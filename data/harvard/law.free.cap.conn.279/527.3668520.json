On appeal, the defendant claims that the total length of his sentence of ten years of imprisonment and ten years of special parole for the offense of sexual assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53a-71<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is illegal because it: (1) exceeds the maximum sentence of imprisonment authorized by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-35a (6) and 53a-71 in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 54-128 (c);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (2) violates the double jeopardy clause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>the fifth amendment of the United States constitution. We agree with the defendant\u2019s first claim and, accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment denying the defendant\u2019s motion to correct an illegal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The following procedural history is relevant to our resolution of the present appeal. On November 2, 2000, pursuant to a plea agreement,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the defendant pleaded guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to sexual assault in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (4), sexual assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (1) (A)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53-21 (2). The trial court sentenced the defendant as follows: (1) for the charge of sexual assault in the second degree, ten years of imprisonment followed by ten years of special parole; (2) for the charge of sexual assault in the third degree, five years of imprisonment followed by five years of special parole; and (3) for the charge of risk of injury to a child, five years of imprisonment followed by five years of special parole. The trial court ordered all of the sentences to run concurrently, resulting in a total effective sentence of ten years of imprisonment followed by ten years of special parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">In June, 2004, the defendant filed a motion to correct his sentence for sexual assault in the second degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 43-22.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thereafter, the trial court held a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion. At the hearing, the defendant pointed out that \u00a7 53a-35a (6) limits the maximum sentence of imprisonment for sexual assault in the second degree to ten years. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53a-71 (b). Because the defendant was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment <em>and </em>ten years of special parole, the defendant maintained that his sentence exceeds the maximum statutory limit and, therefore, is illegal. Moreover, the defendant claimed that \u00a7 54-128 (c) explicitly prohibited the imposition of such an illegal sentence. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-128 (c) (\u201c[t]he total length of the term of incarceration and term of special parole combined shall not exceed the maximum sentence of incarceration authorized for the offense for which the person was convicted\u201d). The defendant conceded, however, that General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 54-125e (c)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>the trial court to sentence the defendant to a period of special parole of \u201cnot less than ten years . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant maintained, nonetheless, that to the extent that \u00a7\u00a7 54-125e (c) and 54-128 (c) conflict, \u201cthe benefit should go to the defendant.\u201d The trial court disagreed and concluded that the defendant\u2019s sentence was not illegal because \u00a7 53a-35a (6) plainly authorized a sentence of ten years of imprisonment, and \u00a7 54-125e (c) plainly authorized a sentence of ten years of special parole for the offense of sexual assault in the second degree.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Further, the trial court concluded that \u00a7\u00a7 54-125e (c) and 54-128 (c) do not conflict because \u00a7 54-125e (c) unambiguously \u201ccarves out an exception [to the maximum statutory limit] for sex offenses.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to correct his sentence, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">On appeal, the defendant renews the claim that he raised before the trial court. The defendant further claims that his sentence violates the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution because it \u201cconstitutes cumulative multiple punishments exceeding what the legislature intended\u201d for the offense of sexual assault in the second degree.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>The state responds that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to correct his sentence. Specifically, the state claims that the total length of the defendant\u2019s sentence combined is not illegal because the trial court was authorized to sentence the defendant to ten years of imprisonment under \u00a7 53a-35a (6), and to ten years of special parole under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-28 (b) (9)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and 54-125e (c). The state further claims that \u201c\u00a7 54-128 (c) does not apply to, much less address, a trial court\u2019s authority to impose a particular sentence. Rather \u00a7 54-128 (c) establishes the period of incarceration that the board of pardons and paroles can impose on a defendant who has violated special parole.\u201d Lastly, the state claims that the defendant\u2019s sentence does not violate the double jeopardy clause because it is authorized by \u00a7\u00a7 53a-28 (b) (9), 53a-35a (6) and 54-125e (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">We conclude that the defendant\u2019s sentence violates \u00a7 54-128 (c) because the total length of the term of imprisonment and term of special parole combined exceeds the maximum term of imprisonment authorized for sexual assault in the second degree. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s sentence is illegal, and we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">As a preliminary matter, we review the trial court\u2019s authority to correct an illegal sentence. \u201cThis court has held that the jurisdiction of the sentencing court terminates once a defendant\u2019s sentence has begun, and, therefore, that court may no longer take any action affecting a defendant\u2019s sentence unless it expressly has been authorized to act. <em>State </em>v. <em>Walzer, </em>208 Conn. 420, 424-25, 545 A.2d 559 (1988); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Mollo, </em>63 Conn. App. 487, 490, 776 A.2d 1176, cert. denied, 257 Conn. 904, 777 A.2d 194 (2001); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tuszynski, </em>23 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Conn. App. 201, 206, 579 A.2d 1100 (1990). Practice Book \u00a7 43-22, which provides the trial court with such authority, provides that [t]he judicial authority may at any time correct an illegal sentence or other illegal disposition, or it may correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner or any other disposition made in an illegal manner. An illegal sentence is essentially one which either exceeds the relevant statutory maximum limits, violates a defendant\u2019s right against double jeopardy, is ambiguous, or is internally contradictory. <em>State </em>v. <em>McNellis, </em>15 Conn. App. 416, 443-44, 546 A.2d 292, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 809, 548 A.2d 441 (1988). We previously have noted that a defendant may challenge his or her criminal sentence on the ground that it is illegal by raising the issue on direct appeal or by filing a motion pursuant to \u00a7 43-22 with the judicial authority, namely, the trial court. See <em>Copeland </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>225 Conn. 46, 47 n.2, 621 A.2d 1311 (1993).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cobham </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>258 Conn. 30, 37-38, 779 A.2d 80 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Ordinarily, a claim that the trial court improperly denied a defendant\u2019s motion to correct an illegal sentence is reviewed pursuant to the abuse of discretion standard. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>93 Conn. App. 61, 66, 888 A.2d 132, cert. denied, 277 Conn. 927, 895 A.2d 800 (2006); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pagan, </em>75 Conn. App. 423, 429, 816 A.2d 635, cert. denied, 265 Conn. 901, 829 A.2d 420 (2003). In the present case, however, the defendant\u2019s claim presents a question of statutory interpretation over which our review is plenary. See, e.g., <em>Cogan </em>v. <em>Chase Manhattan Auto Financial Corp., </em>276 Conn. 1, 7, 882 A.2d 597 (2005). \u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">We begin our analysis with the text of the relevant statutes. General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53a-71 (b) provides that \u201c[s]exual assault in the second degree is a class C felony for which nine months of the sentence imposed may not be suspended or reduced by the court.\u201d Section 53a-35a provides that \u201c[f]or any felony committed on or after July 1, 1981, the sentence of imprisonment shall be a definite sentence and the term shall be fixed by the court as follows ... (6) for a class C felony, a term not less than one year nor more than ten years . . . .\u201d Pursuant to the plain language of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-35a (6) and 53a-71 (b), a conviction of sexual assault in the second degree carries a minimum sentence of one year of imprisonment and a maximum sentence of ten years of imprisonment, nine months of which are nonsuspendable. In the present case, the trial court sentenced the defendant to ten years of imprisonment. Accordingly, the defendant received the maximum sentence of imprisonment authorized by \u00a7\u00a7 53a-35a (6) and 53a-71 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>We now turn to the statutory provisions governing special parole. The trial court may sentence a defendant convicted of a criminal offense to \u201ca term of imprisonment and a period of special parole as provided in section 54-125e.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-28 (b) (9). Pursuant to \u00a7 54-125e (a), \u201c[a]ny person convicted of a crime committed on or after October 1, 1998, who received a definite sentence of more than two years followed by a period of special parole,\u201d begins to serve the sentence of special parole after \u201cthe expiration of the maximum term or terms of imprisonment imposed by the court . . . .\u201d Once the defendant completes the maximum term of imprisonment, he is transferred to the jurisdiction of the chairman of the board of pardons and paroles (board) and begins to serve the period of special parole \u201csubject to such rules and conditions\u201d established by the board. General Statutes \u00a7 54-125e (b). In 2004, the legislature amended \u00a7 54-125e so that an alleged violation of a condition of special parole results in a hearing before the board.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Public Acts 2004, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>No. 04-234, \u00a7 5 (P.A. 04-234). Thus, under the amended revision of the statute, if a violation successfully is established, the board may: \u201c(1) [c]ontinue the sentence of special parole; (2) modify or enlarge the conditions of special parole; or (3) revoke the sentence of special parole.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-125e (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">To determine the applicable period of special parole in the present case, we turn to \u00a7 54-125e (c), which provides: \u201c[t]he period of special parole shall be not less than one year nor more than ten years <em>except that such period shall be not less than ten years nor more than thirty-five years for a person convicted of a violation of </em>... \u00a7 53a-71 . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 54-125e (c). As previously explained, the defendant was convicted of sexual assault in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (4). Therefore, pursuant to the plain language of \u00a7 54-125e (c), the trial court was required to sentence the defendant to a minimum of ten years of special parole. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s sentence of ten years of special parole is authorized by, and, indeed, required by, \u00a7 54-125e (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Although the defendant\u2019s sentence of ten years of imprisonment explicitly is authorized by \u00a7 53a-35a (6), and his sentence of ten years of special parole is required by \u00a7 54-125e (c), the defendant claims that the total length of his combined sentence exceeds the maximum statutory limit for the offense of sexual assault in the second degree. Specifically, the defendant claims that his sentence is illegal because his sentence of special parole potentially exposes him to an additional term of imprisonment after he has finished serv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>ing his ten year maximum term of imprisonment. The defendant further claims that \u00a7 54-128 (c) plainly prohibits the trial court from imposing such an illegal sentence. The state responds that the defendant\u2019s sentence is not illegal because his ten year sentence of imprisonment is authorized by \u00a7\u00a7 53a-35a (6) and 53a-71 (b), and his ten year sentence of special parole is required by \u00a7\u00a7 53a-28 (b) (9) and 54-125e (c). Moreover, the state claims that \u00a7 54-128 (c) does not prohibit the sentence imposed by the trial court because \u00a7 54-128 (c) plainly refers only to the board\u2019s authority to \u201cretain\u201d the defendant after he has violated a condition of special parole, rather than to the trial court\u2019s authority to impose a combined sentence of imprisonment and special parole. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Section 54-128 (c) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who, during the service of a period of special parole imposed in accordance with subdivision (9) of subsection (b) of section 53a-28, has been returned to any institution of the [department of [c]orrection for violation of such person\u2019s parole, may be retained in a correctional institution for a period equal to the unexpired portion of the period of special parole. The total length of the term of incarceration and term of special parole combined shall not exceed the maximum sentence of incarceration authorized for the offense for which the person was convicted.\u201d The first sentence of \u00a7 54-128 (c) is plain and unambiguous, and it authorizes the board to imprison a parolee for the unexpired portion of the period of special parole if he violates the conditions of parole. The final sentence of \u00a7 54-128 (c), however, is not plain and unambiguous in the present context. Specifically, it is unclear whether, as the defendant claims, the phrase \u201c[t]he total length of the term of incarceration and term of special parole combined\u201d refers to the combined term of imprisonment and special parole that can be imposed by the trial court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>the offense for which the defendant was convicted, or whether, as the state claims, it refers to the length of time the defendant \u201cmay be retained\u201d by the board after he has violated the conditions of special parole.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, we turn to the legislative history of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>statutes governing special parole to resolve the ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">In 1998, the legislature enacted Public Acts 1998, No. 98-234 (P.A. 98-234), which implemented a system of special parole in the state. The legislative history of P.A. 98-234 reveals that special parole was \u201cintended to operate as a sentencing option in cases where the judge wanted additional supervision of a defendant after the completion of his prison sentence. Michael Mullen, the chairman of the Connecticut board of parole testified before the judiciary committee and described special parole as a \u2018sentencing option which ensures intense supervision of convicted felons after they\u2019re released to the community and allows the imposition of parole stipulations on the released inmate to ensure their successful incremental re-entry into society or if they violate their stipulations, speedy re-incarceration before they commit another crime.\u2019 . . . Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 4, 1998 Sess., p. 1013.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>272 Conn. 72, 79 n.6, 861 A.2d 1155 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">The provision that is now codified at \u00a7 54-128 (c), was adopted in response to the testimony of Deborah Del Prete Sullivan, executive assistant public defender and legal counsel for the office of the chief public defender. Sullivan submitted a letter to the judiciary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>committee stating that the bill as originally drafted, \u201cwould allow the total number of years of imprisonment and the term of special parole (for which a person can be incarcerated) combined to exceed the maximum sentence which can be imposed for the offense. As a result, a person could be incarcerated for an extensive period of time well in excess of the maximum sentence permitted by the penal statute if he/she were to violate special parole. The concept of parole is that it is an extension of the original period of incarceration imposed as a sentence by the court. The language proposed would not pass constitutional muster as a person could receive increased penalties without due process. These additional penalties could also violate the constitutional right against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">\u201cA suggestion is to add language to line 196 in subsection (c) of [\u00a7] 6 as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">\u201cTHE TOTAL LENGTH OF THE TERM OF INCARCERATION AND TERM OF SPECIAL PAROLE COMBINED SHALL NOT EXCEED THE MAXIMUM SENTENCE OF INCARCERATION AUTHORIZED FOR THE OFFENSE FOR WHICH THE PERSON WAS CONVICTED.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 5, 1998 Sess., p. 1325.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">The judiciary committee adopted Sullivan\u2019s proposed amendment and favorably reported the substitute bill out of committee. See Substitute Senate Bill No. 568, 1998 Sess., \u00a7 6 (c). In light of the constitutional concerns raised by Sullivan, and the legislature\u2019s wholesale adoption of the proposed amendment, we conclude that the legislature intended to resolve the alleged constitutional Infirmities of the original bill by adding the language recommended by Sullivan that is now codified at \u00a7 54-128 (c). Accordingly, it is apparent that the legislature intended to prevent the trial court from sentencing a defendant to a term of imprisonment and to a period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>of special parole, the total combined length of which exceeds the maximum sentence of imprisonment for the offense for which the defendant was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Our conclusion further is supported by the office of legislative research\u2019s analysis of P.A. 98-234. <em>Urbano-wicz </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>87 Conn. App. 277, 293, 865 A.2d 474 (2005) (\u201c[w]e may consult the analysis of a bill by the office of legislative research to ascertain legislative intent\u201d). The office of legislative research described special parole as follows: \u201cSpecial parole may be <em>imposed </em>for one to [ten] years, but an individual who has been convicted of a felony sexual assault offense or sentenced as a persistent dangerous felony offender or persistent serious felony offender may be sentenced to [ten] to [thirty-five] years of special parole. The combination of the term of imprisonment <em>imposed </em>and the term of special parole cannot exceed the maximum sentence that may be <em>imposed </em>for the offense.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Office of Legislative Research, Bill Analysis of Substitute Senate Bill No. 568, p. 1. Moreover, in its analysis, the office of legislative research discussed the board\u2019s authority to retain a parolee for a violation of special parole in a section of the report titled \u201cViolation of Special Parole.\u201d See id., p. 2 (\u201c[a]n individual returned to the custody of the [commissioner of [correction for violating parole may be retained in the institution from which he was paroled for a period equal to the unexpired portion of the period of special parole\u201d). The foregoing analysis exhibits a legislative intent to restrict the authority of the trial court to impose a combined sentence of a term of imprisonment and a period of special parole that \u201cexceedfs] the maximum sentence that may be imposed for the offense.\u201d Id., p. 1. Accordingly, we conclude that \u00a7 54-128 (c) sets forth the maximum statutory limit to which a trial court can sentence a defendant to a com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>bined term of imprisonment and period of special parole under \u00a7 53a-28 (b) (9).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The trial court sentenced the defendant in the present case to ten years of imprisonment followed by ten years of special parole for the offense of sexual assault in the second degree. The total length of the term of imprisonment and term of special parole combined amounts to twenty years. The maximum sentence of imprisonment for sexual assault in the second degree is ten years. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-35a (6). Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s sentence violates \u00a7 54-128 (c) because the total length of the term of imprisonment and period of special parole combined exceeds the maximum sentence of imprisonment for sexual assault in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">We recognize that the trial court was required to sentence the defendant to a minimum of one year of imprisonment under \u00a7 53a-35a (6), and to a minimum of ten years of special parole under \u00a7 54-125e (c). The total length of the minimum term of imprisonment and the minimum period of special parole combined amounts to eleven years. As such, the trial court was <em>required </em>to impose a combined term of imprisonment and period of special parole that exceeds the maximum sentence of imprisonment for sexual assault in the second degree. At the same time, pursuant to \u00a7 54-128 (c), the trial court was <em>prohibited </em>from imposing a combined term of imprisonment and period of special parole that exceeds the maximum sentence of imprisonment for sexual assault in the second degree. Accordingly, under the circumstances of the present case, an irreconcilable conflict exists between the sentencing requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 54-125e (c) and 54-128 (c).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">To resolve the conflict, we return to the legislative history of P.A. 98-234. As previously explained, the judiciary committee amended the language of the original bill in response to Sullivan\u2019s concern that it \u201cwould not pass constitutional muster\u201d because it \u201cwould allow the total number of years of imprisonment and the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>of special parole . . . combined to exceed the maximum sentence\u201d authorized for the offense. Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 5, 1998 Sess., p. 1325. Thus, the judiciary committee adopted the amendatory language proposed by Sullivan, now codified at \u00a7 54-128 (c), to resolve the alleged constitutional infirmities of the original bill.

For purposes of the present appeal, we assume without deciding that P.A. 04-234, \u00a7 5, is a procedural amendment that applies retroactively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b561-6\"> The state claims that \u00a7 54-128 (c) plainly and unambiguously refers only to the length of time that the defendant may be retained by the board after he has violated the conditions of special parole. In support of this claim, the state points out that \u00a7 54-128 is titled \u201c[v]iolation of parole,\u201d and utilizes different terminology than the statutes governing the trial court\u2019s authority to impose a particular sentence. Specifically, the state observes that \u00a7 54-128 (c) refers to \u201cterm of <em>incarceration\u2019\u2019 </em>and to <em>\u201cterm </em>of special parole,\u201d whereas \u00a7\u00a7 53a-28 (b) (9) and 54-125 (e) refer to \u201cterm of <em>imprisonment\" </em>and to <em>\u201cperiod </em>of special parole,\u201d and \u00a7 53a-35a refers to \u201csentence of <em>imprisonment.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Because \u201c[t]he use of different words [or the absence of repeatedly used words in the context of] the same [subject matter] must indicate a difference in legislative intention\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Plourde </em>v. <em>Liburdi, </em>207 Conn. 412, 416, 540 A.2d 1054 (1988); the state maintains that \u201cthe phrases \u2018term of incarceration\u2019 and \u2018term of special parole\u2019 [in \u00a7 54-128 (c)] must be interpreted as referring to something else relating specifically to confinement after a violation of special parole.\u201d We reject this claim. Section 54-128 (c) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe total length of the term of incarceration and term of special parole combined shall not exceed the maximum sentence of incarceration authorized for the offense for which the person was convicted.\u201d The state conceded in oral argument before this court that the phrase \u201cmaximum sentence of incarceration authorized for the offense for which the person was convicted\u201d refers to the ten year maximum sentence of imprisonment authorized by \u00a7 53a-35a (6). Because the state concedes that the term \u201cincarceration\u201d in the latter portion of \u00a7 54-128 (c) is synonymous with the term \u201cimprisonment\u201d in \u00a7 53a-35a (6), it is logical to presume that the legislature used the terms incarceration and imprisonment interchangeably. Moreover, the terms incarceration and imprisonment are used as synonyms in common parlance. See General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a) (\u201c[i]n the construction of statutes, words and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language\u201d); <em>Buell Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Greater New York Mutual Ins. Co., </em>259 Conn. 527, 539, 791 A.2d 489 (2002) (\u201c[t]o ascertain the commonly approved usage of a word, it is appropriate to look to the dictionary definition of the term\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (defining \u201cincarceration\u201d as \u201ca confining or state of being confined: imprisonment,\u201d and defining \u201cimprisonment\u201d as \u201cthe act of imprisoning or the state of being imprisoned: confinement\u201d). Accordingly, it is unclear whether the phrase \u201cterm of incarceration\u201d in \u00a7 54-128 (c) refers to: (1) the trial court\u2019s authority to sentence a defendant to a term of imprisonment for the offense for which he was convicted; or (2) the board\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>authority to retain a defendant for a violation of a condition of special parole. Moreover, if the legislature intended the phrase \u201cterm of incarceration\u201d to refer to a trial court\u2019s authority to sentence a defendant to a term of imprisonment under \u00a7 53a-35a (6), it is logical to presume that the phrase \u201cterm of special parole\u201d similarly refers to the trial court\u2019s authority to sentence a defendant to a period of special parole under \u00a7 54-125e. Accordingly, we conclude that \u00a7 54-128 (c) does not plainly and unambiguously refer to the length of the time that the defendant may be retained by the board for a violation of the conditions of special parole, despite the title of the statute. See <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Fleet National Bank, </em>252 Conn. 1, 13, 742 A.2d 293 (1999) (title of statute is not determinative of, but may provide evidence of, statutory meaning).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b565-9\"> In light of the language and legislative history of \u00a7 54-128 (c), we disagree with the trial court that \u00a7 54-125e (c) unambiguously \u201ccarves out an exception [to the maximum statutory limit] for sex offenses.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b565-10\"> The legislature has since amended the sentencing provisions of \u00a7 54-125e (c). See footnote 9 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b566-7\"> The state contends that the defendant\u2019s claim is not ripe for review because the defendant \u201chas not yet violated special parole and may never violate\u201d special parole. We reject this claim. As explained previously in this opinion, \u00a7 54-128 (c) prohibits the trial court from <em>imposing </em>a term of imprisonment followed by a period of special parole that exceeds the maximum term of imprisonment for the offense for which the person was convicted. In any event, Practice Book \u00a7 43-22 plainly provides that \u201c[t]he judicial authority may <em>at any time </em>correct an illegal sentence . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b566-8\"> In light of our conclusion, we do not reach the defendant\u2019s double jeopardy claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b566-9\"> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Raucci, </em>supra, 21 Conn. App. 562, the Appellate Court recognized that a defendant who has appealed successfully from a multicount conviction and punishment, or who has prevailed on his motion to correct an illegal sentence, \u201chas voluntarily called into play the validity of the entire sentencing package, and, thus, the proper remedy is to vacate it in its entirety.\u201d The Appellate Court therefore adopted the \u201c \u2018aggregate package\u2019 \u201d theory of resentencing, which recognizes that \u201cwhen a trial court imposes [a] sentence pursuant to a multicount conviction, its intent ordinarily is to structure the sentences on the various counts so as to arrive at a total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>effective sentence that it deems appropriate for both the crimes and the criminal.\u201d Id., 563. Essentially, \u201cthe original sentencing court is viewed as having imposed individual sentences merely as component parts or building blocks of a larger total punishment for the aggregate convictions, and, thus, to invalidate any part of that package without allowing the court thereafter to review and revise the remaining valid convictions would frustrate the court\u2019s sentencing intent.\u201d Id., 562. Accordingly, the Appellate Court concluded that \u201cthe [resentencing] court\u2019s power under these circumstances is limited by its original sentencing intent as expressed by the original total effective sentence, and, furthermore, that this power is permissive, not mandatory. Although the court may reconstruct the sentencing package to conform to its original intent, it is not required to do so. It may, therefore, simply eliminate the [illegal portion of the] sentence previously imposed . .. and leave the other sentences intact; or it may reconstruct the sentencing package so as to reach a total effective sentence that is less than the original sentence but more than that effected by the simple elimination of the [illegal portion of the original] sentence .... The guiding principle is that the court may resentence the defendant \u2018to achieve a rational, coherent [sentence] in light of the remaining convictions,\u2019 as long as the revised total effective sentence does not exceed the original.\u201d Id., 563, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bentley, </em>850 F.2d 327, 328 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 970, 109 S. Ct. 501, 102 L. Ed. 2d 537 (1988); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 127-30 (adopting aggregate package theory of resentencing for reasons articulated in <em>Raucci).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b567-9\"> The trial court sentenced the defendant to five years of imprisonment followed by five years of special parole for his conviction of sexual assault in the third degree. At the time of the crime, sexual assault in the third degree was a class D felony that carried a minimum sentence of one year of imprisonment and a maximum sentence of five years of imprisonment. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-35a (7); General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53a-72a (b). As such, under \u00a7 54-128 (c), the total length of the combined term of imprisonment and period of special parole imposed by the trial court cannot exceed five years. Because the total length of the defendant\u2019s sentence amounts to ten years, five years of imprisonment and five years of special parole, we conclude that his sentence for sexual assault in the third degree violates \u00a7 54-128 (c) because it exceeds the maximum statutory limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">The defendant does not challenge his sentence for his conviction of risk of injury to a child and this decision does not affect his sentence as to that offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
