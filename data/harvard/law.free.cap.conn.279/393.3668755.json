On appeal,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the defendant claims, inter alia, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>the trial court improperly excluded from evidence certain messages left on his answering machine that were admissible under \u00a7 8-8 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because they would have demonstrated the non-testifying complainant\u2019s bias and motive to make a false accusation of assault against him. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the answering machine recording was both improper and harmful and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of conviction as to the assault charge. We affirm the judgment of conviction as to the defendant\u2019s violation of a protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The record reveals the following facts and procedural history. The complainant, Maureen Calabrese, is the defendant\u2019s mother, and was sixty-nine years old at the time of the events at issue herein. On the evening of January 4, 2002, Branford police and paramedics, including Paul Cipriani, a paramedic, and Duncan Ayr, a detective, found the following scene at the complainant\u2019s home, which was located in front of the defendant\u2019s family owned home.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>The complainant\u2019s now late husband, William Calabrese, Sr., was in a hospital bed in the living room of the house, unable to get up. The dining room of the house contained a hutch with broken glass, and there was glass debris on the floor. The complainant lay on the floor of the kitchen, surrounded by five or six blood soaked paper towels.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Cipriani testified that he had assessed and interviewed the complainant, and that she appeared scared and hesitant to answer his questions. Ayr testified similarly, noting that the complainant appeared disheveled and upset, with dried blood on her nightgown. The complainant did, however, tell Cipriani that she was injured when attempting to block a vase that had been thrown at her at approximately 10 a.m. Cipriani cleaned and bandaged the complainant\u2019s wound and monitored her while the police interviewed her and seized evidence from the scene, including a small vase. The complainant then refused ambulance transportation to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">The next day, however, the complainant\u2019s other son, William Calabrese, Jr. (William), brought her to Yale-New Haven Hospital, where she was diagnosed with a fracture of the olecranon, which is the bottom portion of the elbow joint. David Gibson, an orthopedic surgeon who had treated the complainant, testified that he operated immediately as her injury was a true limb threatening emergency because of the open wound and the delay in seeking treatment, which had increased the risk of infection.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">On the basis of information gained through interviews with William and the complainant, the Branford police arrested the defendant on the morning of January 5, 2002.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under Docket No. CR02-394, the state charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>the defendant with three alternative counts of assault of an elderly person in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-60b and General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (1) through (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">In connection with the defendant\u2019s arraignment, the court, <em>Alexander, J., </em>issued a family violence protective order on January 7,2002 (protective order). The protective order directed the defendant, inter alia, to refrain from threatening, harassing or assaulting the complainant, and from entering the family dwelling or dwelling occupied by the complainant. According to the testimony of Tracy Genues-Johnson, a court clerk, the defendant was given a copy of and advised of his rights under the protective order. The protective order remained in effect and was not modified while the case was pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Several months later, on September 15, 2002, at approximately 9 p.m., Mark Ciarciello, a Branford police sergeant, received a call from William, and as a result of that conversation, responded to the complainant\u2019s home with several other officers. The complainant, who was crying and appeared disheveled and nervous, let Ciarciello and the other officers enter the house. The complainant also was holding her arm at the time,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> *8 but she was evasive about how her injuries had occurred.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Ciarciello knew that the protective order was in effect against the defendant,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and he called for a K-9 unit to assist with a search of the house for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Shortly thereafter, David Atkinson, the Branford K-9 officer, arrived with Red, a police trained German Shepherd. Relying on Red\u2019s ability to detect nervous or apprehensive persons, they searched the house and found the defendant naked on the roof of the house near a small porch located off a second floor bedroom. The defendant then climbed around the chimney to come down onto the porch, at which point Atkinson and another officer, Arthur Ferris, took the defendant into custody. Under Docket No. CR02-9309, the state then charged the defendant with one count of violating a protective order in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-110b, and one count of assault of an elderly person in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-61 (a) (1) and 53a-61a.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">On the state\u2019s motion, the trial court, <em>Thompson, J., </em>joined the two cases for trial. Subsequently, the case was tried to the jury, with <em>Rodriguez, J., </em>presiding. Neither the defendant <em>nor the complainant </em>testified at the trial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> After the state rested its case, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>moved for judgments of acquittal on all charges. With respect to Docket No. CR02-394, the trial court granted the motion for judgment of acquittal as to the first and second counts of assault of an elderly person in the second degree, but denied it as to the third count, which referred to the defendant\u2019s \u201creckless\u201d conduct on January 4, 2002. With respect to Docket No. CR02-9309, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on the assault of an elderly person in the third degree charge, but denied the motion as to the violation of the protective order on September 15, 2002. Thereafter, the jury returned verdicts of guilty of assault of an elderly person in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-60b, and of violation of a protective order in violation of \u00a7 53a-223. On December 19, 2003, the trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict, and sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of five years imprisonment suspended after the mandatory minimum two years, with five years of probation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">On appeal, the defendant contends that there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he \u201crecklessly\u201d caused the complainant\u2019s injuries. The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly: (1) admitted into evidence, under both the Connecticut Code of Evidence and the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>541 U.S. 36, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2004), testimonial and documentary evidence containing inadmissible hearsay statements made by the nontestifying complainant to police officers and medical personnel;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and (2) refused to admit into evidence certain messages left by the complainant on the defendant\u2019s answering machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">We begin with the defendant\u2019s claim that there is insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he recklessly caused the complainant\u2019s injuries. This claim was properly preserved by his motion for a judgment of acquittal on that charge; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Padua, </em>273 Conn. 138, 146 n.12, 869 A.2d 192 (2005); and we must review it in addition to his evidentiary claims because, if the defendant prevails on the sufficiency claim, he is entitled to a directed judgment of acquittal rather than to a new trial. Id., 179; see also <em>States. Gray, </em>200 Conn. 523, 535-36, 512 A.2d 217, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 940, 107 S. Ct. 423, 93 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1986). Moreover, our sufficiency review does not require initial consideration of the merits of the constitutional and evidentiary claims because \u201cappellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence, pursuant to <em>[Gray] </em>properly includes hearsay evidence even if such evidence was admitted despite a purportedly valid objection. Claims of evidentiary insufficiency in criminal cases are always addressed independently of claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>of evidentiary error.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Carey, 228 Conn. 487, 496, 636 A.2d 840 (1994).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">\u201cThe standard of review we apply to a claim of insufficient evidence is well established. In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction we apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [finder of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">\u201cWe note that the jury must find every element proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to find the defendant guilty of the charged offense, [but] each of the basic and inferred facts underlying those conclusions need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . If it is reasonable and logical for the jury to conclude that a basic fact or an inferred fact is true, the jury is permitted to consider the fact proven and may consider it in combination with other proven facts in determining whether the cumulative effect of all the evidence proves the defendant guilty of all the elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">\u201cMoreover, it does not diminish the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of evidence that is circumstantial rather than direct. . . . It is not one fact, but the cumulative impact of a multitude of facts which establishes guilt in a case involving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>substantial circumstantial evidence. ... In evaluating evidence, the [finder] of fact is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence. . . . The [finder of fact] may draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\u201cFinally, [a]s we have often noted, proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt . . . nor does proof beyond a reasonable doubt require acceptance of every hypothesis of innocence posed by the defendant that, had it been found credible by the [finder of fact], would have resulted in an acquittal. . . . On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the [finder of fact\u2019s] verdict of guilty.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gary, </em>273 Conn. 393, 405-406, 869 A.2d 1236 (2005); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>274 Conn. 790, 800, 877 A.2d 739 (2005) (\u201c[W]e do not sit as a thirteenth juror who may cast a vote against the verdict based upon our feeling that some doubt of guilt is shown by the cold printed record. . . . Rather, we must defer to the jury\u2019s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses based on its firsthand observation of their conduct, demeanor and attitude.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The defendant contends that there is no evidence in the record as to his specific intent, namely, recklessness. Specifically, he argues that, although there is evidence that he threw the vase at the complainant, there is no evidence as to the circumstances under which she was injured, and that he could, for example, have \u201cbeen outside cleaning out a box and thrown the vase over his shoulder, not knowing the complainant was nearby.\u201d Thus, the defendant contends that there are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>no facts in the record from which it may be inferred that he knew of a risk and consciously disregarded it. In response, the state argues that recklessness may be inferred from the complainant\u2019s statements to Cipriani and Gibson that her elbow was injured when she tried to block the vase from striking her in the head, as well as the serious nature of the resulting injuries. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">We begin with a review of the relevant statutory provisions. The defendant was convicted of assault of an elderly person in the second degree under \u00a7 53a-60b (a) because the jury found that he had \u201ccommitted] assault in the second degree under section 53a-60 or larceny in the second degree under section 53a-123 (a) (3) and (1) the victim of such assault . . . has attained at least sixty years of age . . . .\u201d See footnote 1 of this opinion. The cross referenced statute, \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (3), provides in relevant part that a person is guilty of assault in the second degree when \u201che <em>recklessly </em>causes serious physical injury to another person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cA person acts \u2018recklessly\u2019 with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur or that such circumstance exists. The risk must be of such nature and degree that disregarding it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (13).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Although the defendant correctly notes that the record does not contain evidence setting the scene of the altercation between the defendant and the complainant, there nevertheless is sufficient evidence that he acted recklessly. As the state points out, a nurse\u2019s note in the hospital record reflects that the complainant had stated that, \u201c \u2018I feel very embarrassed to tell you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>the truth how I broke my elbow. My son [threw] a vase [and] I [tried] to protect my head.\u201d We also note Cipriani\u2019s testimony to a similar effect, that the complainant had tried to block the thrown vase. Moreover, the jury received the vase as an exhibit, and we note that it is approximately the size of a softball; it is compact enough to throw with significant velocity, but has weight sufficient to cause serious injury to someone hit by it.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, the jury reasonably could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was \u201caware of and consciously disregardfed] a substantial and unjustifiable risk\u201d that the complainant would have been seriously injured by the thrown vase, and that throwing a vase at her \u201cconstitute^] a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (13). Accordingly, we now turn to the defendant\u2019s evidentiary claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">The remainder of our inquiry begins and ends with the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly refused to admit into evidence the answering machine recording with statements by the complainant threatening the defendant. The record reveals the following additional relevant facts and procedural history. During cross-examination of William, the defendant attempted to offer into evidence several messages left by the complainant on the defendant\u2019s answering machine.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>this point, the jury was excused, and after William authenticated the voice on the recording as that of the complainant, the trial court listened to the messages, which included the complainant calling the defendant derogatory names such as \u201cprick\u201d and \u201cbastard,\u201d and threatening to call the police and the victim\u2019s advocate if the defendant did not bring her food.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The trial court then sustained the state\u2019s objection, concluding that the recording was both irrelevant and inadmissible hearsay not subject to any exception, and that it would be inappropriate to use the tape recording with the complainant\u2019s whereabouts unknown. The trial court did, however, permit the defendant to question William about his mother\u2019s nature when she becomes agitated or intoxicated. William then testified before the jury that, although he \u201cdidn\u2019t really want to get into family dynamics,\u201d the complainant \u201ccould be charming when she wanted to be charming. [The complainant] could be manipulative when she wanted to be manipulative. She could be angry when she wanted to be angry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\u201cWe first set forth .the standard that governs our review of a trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling. It is axiom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>atic that [t]he trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is entitled to great deference. ... In this regard, the trial court is vested with wide discretion in determining the admissibility of evidence, including issues of relevance and the scope of cross-examination. . . . Accordingly, [t]he trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. ... In determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, every reasonable presumption should be made in favor of the correctness of the trial court\u2019s ruling, and we will upset that ruling only for a manifest abuse of discretion. . . . This deferential standard is [generally] applicable to evidentiary questions involving hearsay.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>271 Conn. 218, 252, 856 A.2d 917 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">We begin with \u00a7 8-8 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence, which provides: \u201cWhen hearsay has been admitted in evidence, the credibility of the declarant may be impeached, and if impeached may be supported, by any evidence that would be admissible for those purposes if the declarant had testified as a witness. Evidence of a statement of the declarant made at any time, inconsistent with the declarant\u2019s hearsay statement, need not be shown to or the contents of the statement disclosed to the declarant.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Section 8-8 recognizes that \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>weight a fact finder gives a witness\u2019 in-court testimony often depends on the witness\u2019 credibility. So too can a declarant\u2019s credibility affect the weight accorded that declarant\u2019s hearsay statement admitted at trial.\u201d Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-8, commentary; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>663 N.W.2d 877, 880 (Iowa 2003) (rule permitting impeachment of hearsay declarant \u201cprimarily exists to even the playing field when a party attempts to present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>hearsay evidence through a witness other than the declarant in an effort to prevent the other party from challenging the declarant\u2019s credibility or to capitalize on the good credibility of the witness\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahar, </em>430 Mass. 643, 650, 722 N.E.2d 461 (2000) (adopting rule of evidence similar to \u00a7 8-8 because \u201c[t]here is no reason to put a proponent of an absent witness in a better position than a proponent of a live witness\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The state properly notes that \u00a7 8-8 is not in itself an exception to the hearsay rule, and that it, therefore, \u201cdoes not permit a hearsay declarant to be impeached by hearsay that would otherwise have been inadmissible.\u201d Accordingly, the state argues that <em>State </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>80 Conn. App. 662, 837 A.2d 808 (2003), cert. denied, 268 Conn. 914, 847 A.2d 311 (2004), which is relied on by the defendant, is inapposite. In <em>Mills, </em>the Appellate Court concluded that the trial court should have permitted the defendant to impeach the credibility of a dying declarant under \u00a7 8-8 by using evidence of prior convictions, which would have been admissible under \u00a7 6-7 (a) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence. Id., 667-68. We disagree with the state because, in the present case, the answering machine recording is not hearsay since it clearly was offered not for the truth of the matter asserted therein, but merely for the fact that those statements had been made. <em>States. Perkins, </em>supra, 271 Conn. 254; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>214 Conn. 122, 131, 571 A.2d 686 (1990) (Evidence of threats against a witness are admissible to rehabilitate her inconsistent testimony and \u201cto explain the discrepancy between her trial testimony and her pretrial statement. For that purpose, the evidence of threats was relevant to show [the witness\u2019] state of mind and was not hearsay because it was not offered for its truth.\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewtan, </em>5 Conn. App. 79, 84, 497 A.2d 60 (1985) (testimony about threats made by defendant over telephone in harassment con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>viction not inadmissible hearsay because they \u201cwere offered not to prove that her statements were true but that she made them\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Thus, the answering machine messages were admissible nonhearsay evidence under \u00a7 6-5 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence, under which \u201c[t]he credibility of a witness may be impeached by evidence showing bias for, prejudice against, or interest in any person or matter that might cause the witness to testify falsely.\u201d See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Bova, </em>240 Conn. 210, 219, 690 A.2d 1370 (1997) (\u201cImpeachment of a witness for motive, bias and interest may also be accomplished by the introduction of extrinsic evidence. . . . The same rule that applies to the right to cross-examine applies with respect to extrinsic evidence to show motive, bias and interest . . . .\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]). We can think of no better evidence of animus that might show a motive for making false allegations than the threats of seeking the arrest of the defendant if he did not comply with the complainant\u2019s wishes, and other invectives, contained in the messages that the trial court improperly excluded from the jury\u2019s consideration.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Having concluded that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding the tape recording from evidence, we now consider whether the defendant has proven that impropriety to be harmful error requiring that he receive a new trial.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>279 Conn. 331, 354, 904 A.2d 101 (2006), we recently resolved our \u201ctwo competing formulations of the standard\u201d for determining when an improper evidentiary ruling constitutes harmful error. We embraced the \u201coutcome determinative approach followed by the overwhelming majority of state and federal courts,\u201d and concluded that, \u201cthe proper standard for determining whether an erroneous evidentiary ruling is harmless should be whether the jury\u2019s verdict was substantially swayed by the error.\u201d Id., 357. In applying this standard, which \u201cexpressly requires the reviewing court to consider the effect of the erroneous ruling on the jury\u2019s decision,\u201d an appellate court may conclude that a nonconstitutional error is harmless only when it \u201chas a fair assurance that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>error did not substantially affect the verdict.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 357. In reviewing the case, we consider a number of factors, namely, the overall strength of the state\u2019s case, the impact of the improperly admitted or excluded evidence on the trier of fact, whether the proffered evidence was cumulative, and the presence of other evidence corroborating or contradicting the point for which the evidence was offered. See id., 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">With respect to the assault charge, we are left with the requisite \u201cfair assurance\u201d that the trial court\u2019s failure to admit the answering machine messages into evidence \u201csubstantially swayed\u201d the jury\u2019s verdict. The only evidence in the record on the assault charge consisted of hearsay statements by the complainant made to the police, paramedics and medical personnel at Yale-New Haven Hospital, at least one of which the state concedes was improperly admitted. See footnote 20 of this opinion. Thus, the jury\u2019s perception of the complainant\u2019s credibility was central to the state\u2019s case. Having listened to both the tone and substantive content of the messages; see footnote 17 of this opinion; we are left with no doubt that these messages demonstrating the complainant\u2019s inclination to make threats against the defendant would have had a significant effect on the jury\u2019s assessment of her credibility. Moreover, the messages would not have been cumulative, despite William\u2019s testimony about the complainant\u2019s manipulative nature and treatment of himself and his brother. This is because William\u2019s admittedly poor relationship with his mother and brother could have caused the jury to perceive him, too, as a biased witness.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Instead, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>recorded messages provide an untainted source for the jury to understand the animus between the complainant and the defendant, and the resulting bias that might have attached to her statements that were admitted as hearsay evidence. The defendant is, therefore, entitled to a new trial on the assault charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">We need not consider the remainder of the defendant\u2019s claims under both <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 541 U.S. 36, and the Connecticut Code of Evidence, with respect to the admission of the complainant\u2019s statements made to Ayr and Gibson, and contained in the hospital records.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We do not view them as likely to arise on remand, and to the extent that they relate to the defendant\u2019s conviction for violation of a protective order, they are at most harmless error not requiring reversal on that count, even if we were to assume, without deciding, that the trial court committed a sixth amendment violation under <em>Crawford </em>by admitting into evidence Officer Kris Hormuth\u2019s testimony about the complainant\u2019s statements to her on September 15, 2002. See footnote 9 of this opinion. The trial court properly instructed the jury that \u201cthe types of acts forbidden by the protective order include . . . entering the family dwelling or the dwelling of the victim . . . .\u201d In the absence of evidence of either a ground ladder, or as was suggested at oral argument by this court, that the defendant happens to be Spiderman, the jury\u2019s verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>is overwhelmingly supported by the testimony of the police officers who found the defendant naked on the roof of the complainant\u2019s house on September 15, 2002. Accordingly, any <em>Crawford </em>violations with respect to that conviction are harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>275 Conn. 785, 832, 882 A.2d 604 (2005) (\u201cWhere a claim is of constitutional magnitude, the state has the burden of proving the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. . . .

We note that the trial court\u2019s discussion of this issue with the parties consumed more than fourteen pages of transcript. The defendant made an extensive offer of proof in which he explained the effect of the tape recording with respect to rebutting the \u201cimplication that\u2019s been floating to the jurors that we are dealing with some poor, gentle, [quiet], pathetic, elderly victim. The tape is compelling evidence that his mother is an extremely aggressive, abusive and, obviously an intoxicated person.\u201d In response to the slate\u2019s argument that the tape recording was improper character evidence and could not be used to impeach the complainant because she was not a witness at the trial, the defendant further argued that the tape recording and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>veiled threats contained thereon was important evidence of how the complainant \u201cbehaves and it is consistent with how she gets when she demandjs] things,\u201d particularly given that the state\u2019s entire case was built on hearsay. The defendant called the messages \u201ccompelling evidence of a very disturbed, very manipulative woman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">\u201c[T]he standard for the preservation of a claim alleging an improper evidentiary ruling at trial is well settled. This court is not bound to consider claims of law not made at the trial. ... In order to preserve an evidentiary ruling for review, trial counsel must object properly. ... In objecting to evidence, counsel must properly articulate the basis of the objection so as to apprise the trial court of the precise nature of the objection and its real purpose, in order to form an adequate basis for a renewable ruling. . . . Once counsel states the authority and ground of [the] objection, any appeal will be limited to the ground asserted. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">\u201cThese requirements are not simply formalities. They serve to alert the trial court to potential error while there is still time for the court to act. . . . Assigning error to a court\u2019s evidentiary rulings on the basis of objections never raised at trial unfairly subjects the court and the opposing party to trial by ambush.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cabral, </em>275 Conn. 514, 530-31, 881 A.2d 247, cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1048, 126 S. Ct. 773, 163 L. Ed. 2d 600 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">We conclude that this issue was properly preserved as a claim of eviden-tiary error. Although it would have been preferable for the defendant to have cited \u00a7 8-8 to the trial court, the defendant\u2019s objection, \u201cwhile not the most artful, sufficiently alerted both the trial court and the [state] to the precise nature of the objection.\u201d <em>Daley </em>v. <em>McClintock, </em>267 Conn. 399, 405, 838 A.2d 972 (2004); accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahar, </em>430 Mass. 643, 650, 722 N.E.2d 461 (2000) (issue preserved for appeal when trial counsel failed to cite rule, but \u201cargument tracked the substance of the rule\u201d). The defendant clearly argued the policy and substance underlying \u00a7 8-8 at trial, and gave the trial court ample opportunity to accept that argument. We, therefore, do not view this case as an impermissible ambuscade wherein the defendant argues one theory at trial, and an entirely different one on appeal. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cabral, </em>supra, 275 Conn. 531 (claim not preserved for appellate review when defendant argued distinctly different theory on appeal than was discussed in trial court).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b432-7\"> We also disagree with the state\u2019s contention that the answering machine messages were inadmissible because \u201c[a] witness may be impeached by evidence of specific acts of misconduct that relate to veracity, but not by those that merely illustrate general bad behavior.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>89 Conn.

The answering machine messages at issue in the present case relate directly to the relationship between the defendant and the complainant, and are evidence of the animosity between them, as well as the complainant\u2019s use of threats involving the authorities to get the defendant to do her bidding.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">The state also claims that the messages were irrelevant because the answering machine contains neither time stamps indicating when the messages were left, nor an indication that the answering machine belonged to the defendant, such as an outgoing greeting. It is, however, abundantly clear that the answering machine belongs to the defendant because the complainant called him by name twice in the messages. See footnote 17 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>this opinion. Moreover, although interruptions to the machine\u2019s power supply apparently have resulted in the deletion of time stamps, the lack of a time reference does not render the messages irrelevant as evidence of the complainant\u2019s ill feelings about the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b433-7\"> We also note that, at oral argument before this court, the state conceded that the trial court improperly overruled the defendant\u2019s objection to Ayr\u2019s testimony that he had learned enough information from his conversation with the complainant to have probable cause to arrest the defendant. The state conceded that this statement was implied hearsay not subject to any applicable hearsay exception. See <em>In re Jose M., </em>30 Conn.
