The plaintiff, Gregory Tracy, the administrator of the estate of James Tracy, appeals from the decision of the compensation review board (board) affirming the decision of the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the first district (commissioner) that the named defendant, Scherwitzky Gutter Company,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> James Tracy\u2019s former employer, is not liable for providing such compensation. We affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The record reveals the following facts. James Tracy (decedent) was employed by the defendant as a gutter installer. On October 7,1999, the decedent was working on the roof of a two-story home when he fell to the ground below, suffering multiple fractures and traumatic brain injury. These injuries were compensable under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Shortly after the accident, the decedent was taken to Hartford Hospital, where he was diagnosed and received appropriate treatment. Thereafter, on December 2, 1999, the decedent was transferred to Gaylord Hospital, where he was treated by Alyse B. Sicklick, a physician, among others. The decedent was discharged into the care of his sister, Julia Morrisette, on February 11, 2000. At the time of the decedent\u2019s discharge, Sicklick recommended \u201cthat he be in a supervised set<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>ting, alone for only short periods of time with frequent checks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The decedent\u2019s mental faculties were considerably reduced as a consequence of his injuries. His memory was diminished such that he would forget to take his medications or would eat until he vomited, unaware that he had eaten a meal a few minutes earlier. The decedent also became unable to conduct himself in a safe manner and, consequently, would wander off alone, unsuccessfully attempt to cook his own meals,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and attempt to mount the roof when he believed that a gutter needed repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The record is unclear as to whether the full extent of these symptoms was evident during the decedent\u2019s time with Morrisette. The burden of caring for the decedent, however, was too much for Morrisette, and, on March 28, 2000, the decedent began living with his nephew, the plaintiff, and the plaintiffs wife, Susan Tracy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On July 25, 2000, the Griswold Probate Court appointed the plaintiff as conservator of the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Between March 28,2000, and November 29, 2001, the Tracys cared for the decedent twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This care was later characterized by the plaintiff as \u201cguardian-type care, not medical\u201d in nature. Susan Tracy, who was employed outside of her home as a certified nurse\u2019s aide, testified that she and the plaintiff monitored the decedent to prevent him from \u201c[doing] things that he shouldn\u2019t do . . . .\u201d They also \u201cprovide [d] [the decedent with] everything he really needed,\u201d reminding him to take his medications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>and giving him \u201ccues to eat, cues to change his clothes, cues to wash up,\u201d and the like. When the decedent experienced one of his occasional seizures,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> often accompanied by vomiting or loss of bowel control, the Tracys would calm him and summon an ambulance, if necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Sicklick saw the decedent after his discharge from Gaylord Hospital only once, for a follow-up visit on June 1, 2000.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At that visit, Sicklick recommended \u2014 in writing, on a prescription pad bearing the name and address of Gaylord Hospital \u2014 that the decedent \u201cbe alone for only short period[s] of time with frequent checks during that time. Otherwise he should be maintained in a supervised setting.\u201d Sicklick also noted in her report of the June 1 visit that the decedent \u201c[was then] living with a nephew, where he ha[d] 24-hour supervision. There continue [d] to be significant memory deficits as well as safety issues.\u201d The decedent continued to suffer from these same symptoms until his death on November 29, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Following the decedent\u2019s death, the plaintiff commenced the present action, claiming that (1) he was entitled to benefits for the decedent\u2019s death pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-306,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (2) he was entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>benefits through the date of the decedent\u2019s death, and (3) the Tracys were entitled to benefits pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-294d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for care provided to the decedent prior to his death. The commissioner, after formal hearings, ordered the defendant to pay \u201ctotal disability benefits\u201d to the plaintiff pursuant to the second claim but dismissed the first and third claims. In reference to the third claim, the commissioner found that the care provided by the Tracys \u201cwas not rendered by referral or under the supervision of any physician and does not rise to the level qualifying it for compensation under [\u00a7 31-294d] . . . .\u201d The commissioner correspondingly ordered that \u201c[t]he claims of [the Tracys] for care provided to the [decedent], though laudable and praiseworthy, do not qualify for benefits under [General Statutes \u00a7] 31-312 and, as such, must be dismissed.\u201d The plaintiff filed a motion to correct the commissioner\u2019s findings and order by changing (1) the commissioner\u2019s decision to describe the decedent as \u201cunder the supervision of a physician on a self pay basis,\u201d and (2) the commissioner\u2019s reference to \u00a7 31-312 in the commissioner\u2019s findings and order to \u00a7 31-294d. The commissioner denied the plaintiffs motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The plaintiff appealed the commissioner\u2019s decision only as to the third claim. The board affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision, finding that \u201c[t]he reasoning the . . . commissioner used [was] consistent with the proper analysis under \u00a7 31-294d. For this reason, the . . . commissioner\u2019s mention of \u00a7 31-312 appear[ed] to be a harmless error.\u201d The board concluded that the commissioner\u2019s finding that the care provided by the Tracys \u201cdid not rise to the level of care qualifying . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>for compensation under [\u00a7 31-294d] ... is a factual finding that we will not disturb . . . .\u201d The plaintiff appealed from the decision of the board to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">On appeal to this court, the plaintiff claims that the care that the Tracys rendered to the decedent is compensable under \u00a7 31-294d.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 9 The plaintiff first argues that care provided by a certified nurse\u2019s aide, such as Susan Tracy, may constitute \u201cmedical aid or rehabilitation services\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 11and, accordingly, that the care provided to the decedent by the Tracys was compensable under \u00a7 31-294d.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The plaintiff also argues that the Tracys\u2019 care of the decedent was medically reasonable and necessary long term custodial care rendered on the basis of the referral, consent, direction and supervision of a physician, and, therefore, was compensable under \u00a7 31-294d.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The defendant argues in response that the plaintiffs claim fails both prongs of the two part test established in <em>Galway </em>v. <em>Doody Steel Erecting Co., </em>103 Conn. 431, 435-36, 130 A. 705 (1925), for evaluating the compensability of such claims, namely, whether \u201cthe care provided to the injured worker\u201d was (1) \u201cunder the direction of a treating physician,\u201d and (2) \u201cwith the consent of the treating physician . . . .\u201d The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>additionally argues that, even if the <em>Galway </em>test were satisfied, the plaintiffs claim nonetheless would fail because the Tracys \u201cwere not \u2018medical providers\u2019 as defined by the statute.\u201d Finally, the defendant argues that \u201ca finding for the [plaintiff] would be contrary to public policy\u201d insofar as it \u201cwould result in administrative nightmares, unending litigation and logistical difficulties,\u201d as well as a double recovery for caregivers. We agree with the defendant that the care that the Tracys rendered is not compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\u201cAs a threshold matter, we set forth the standard of review applicable to workers\u2019 compensation appeals. The principles that govern our standard of review in workers\u2019 compensation appeals are well established. The conclusions drawn by [the commissioner] from the facts found must stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them. . . . <em>Besade </em>v. <em>Interstate Security Services, </em>212 Conn. 441, 449, 562 A.2d 1086 (1989). Neither the . . . board nor this court has the power to retry facts. See Six v. <em>Thomas O\u2019Connor &amp; Co., </em>235 Conn. 790, 798-99, 669 A.2d 1214 (1996). . . . <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>241 Conn. 692, 696-97, 699 A.2d 52 (1997). It is well established that [although not dispositive, we accord great weight to the construction given to the workers\u2019 compensation statutes by the commissioner and [the] board. ... A state agency is not entitled, however, to special deference when its determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny. . . . <em>Duni </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>239 Conn. 19, 24-25, 682 A.2d 99 (1996); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>232 Conn. 311, 317, 654 A.2d 1221 (1995). Where . . . [a workers\u2019 compensation] appeal involves an issue of statutory construction that has not yet been subjected to judicial scrutiny, this court has plenary power to review the administrative decision. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>supra, 697; see <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, 317. . . . <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Slotnik, </em>244 Conn. 781, 798, 712 A.2d 396, cert. denied [sub nom. <em>Slotnik </em>v. Considine], 525 U.S. 1017, 119 S. Ct. 542, 142 L. Ed. 2d 451 (1998).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fimiani </em>v. <em>Star Gallo Distributors, Inc., </em>248 Conn. 635, 641-42, 729 A.2d 212 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The plaintiffs claim also implicates a question of statutory interpretation. Our review is therefore plenary. E.g., <em>Parrot v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, </em>273 Conn. 12, 18, 866 A.2d 1273 (2005). When interpreting a statute, \u201c[o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Perodeau </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>259 Conn. 729, 735, 792 A.2d 752 (2002). To do so, we first consult \u201cthe text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">We begin our analysis by looking to the statutoiy provision under which the plaintiff seeks compensation benefits. General Statutes \u00a7 31-294d (a) (1) provides in relevant part that, \u201cas soon as the employer has knowledge of an injury, [it] shall provide a competent physician or surgeon to attend the injured employee and, in addition, shall furnish any medical and surgical aid or hospital and nursing service, including medical rehabilitation services and prescription drugs, as the physician or surgeon deems reasonable or necessary. . . .\u2019\u2019As the parties\u2019 arguments imply, the plaintiffs attempt to apply this provision to the present situation raises two pertinent questions, both of which must be answered in the affirmative in order for the plaintiff to prevail. First, does the Tracys\u2019 care of the decedent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>fall within the definition of either \u201cnursing service,\u201d \u201cmedical . . . aid\u201d or \u201cmedical rehabilitation services . . . ?\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Second, was the Tracys\u2019 care of the decedent deemed \u201creasonable or necessary\u201d by an attending physician or surgeon?</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">We first consider the question of whether the Tracys\u2019 care of the decedent falls within the definition of either \u201cnursing service,\u201d \u201cmedical . . . aid\u201d or \u201cmedical rehabilitation services\u201d under \u00a7 31-294d. This inquiry begins with the plain language of the relevant statutes. The act defines the term \u201cnursing\u201d by reference to General Statutes \u00a7 20-87a (a). See General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (14) (unless context otherwise provides, \u201c \u2018[n]ursing\u2019 means the practice of nursing as defined in subsection [a] of section 20-87a\u201d). General Statutes \u00a7 20-87a (a) provides: \u201cThe practice of nursing by a registered nurse is defined as the process of diagnosing human responses to actual or potential health problems, providing supportive and restorative care, health counseling and teaching, case finding and referral, collaborating in the implementation of the total health care regimen, and executing the medical regimen under the direction of a licensed physician, dentist or advanced practice registered nurse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Although the language of \u00a7 20-87a (a) does not compel nursing to take a specific form, it defines the practice of nursing in terms of a patient\u2019s \u201cactual or potential health problems,\u201d \u201chealth counseling and teaching\u201d and \u201chealth care\u201d and \u201cmedical\u201d regimens. The implication of the statutory text is clear and unambiguous. Medi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>cally related services are intrinsic to the practice of nursing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The claim that the Tracys\u2019 care of the decedent constitutes a \u201cnursing service\u201d is contradicted by the record in the present appeal, which demonstrates that the Tracys\u2019 care of the decedent was purely nonmedical in nature. The Tracys\u2019 acts of monitoring the decedent, reminding him to perform basic hygienic and domestic functions, and providing a calming presence for him were all non-medical in nature. This reality is reflected in the plaintiffs characterization of the care as \u201cguardian-type care, not medical\u201d in nature. The fact that Susan Tracy was a certified nurse\u2019s aide is of no avail to the plaintiff. The medical qualifications of a caregiver have no bearing on the pertinent issue, namely, whether the care provided was medical in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Moreover, the Tracys did not provide care \u201cunder the direction of a licensed physician, dentist or advanced practice registered nurse,\u201d as the definition of \u201cnursing\u201d in \u00a7 20-87a (a) requires. Although Sicklick recommended that the decedent live in a supervised setting, the record indicates that the care that the Tracys rendered to the decedent was not under the supervision or direction of Sicklick or any other physician, dentist or advanced practice registered nurse. Therefore, the Tracys\u2019 care of the decedent does not constitute nursing service within the meaning of \u00a7 31-294d.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The act does not provide any relevant definition of the terms \u201cmedical . . . aid\u201d or \u201cmedical rehabilitation services,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> nor has any Connecticut court considered the meaning of these terms. We need not expound a definition of these terms, however, to conclude that they do not encompass the Tracys\u2019 care of the decedent. This is because the Tracys\u2019 care of the decedent was nonmedical in nature, and the terms \u201cmedical . . . aid\u201d and \u201cmedical rehabilitation services,\u201d by their own plain language, embrace only medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Our conclusion that purely nonmedical care, such as that provided by the Tracys, is not compensable under \u00a7 31-294d is supported by our only previous inquiry into the predecessor to \u00a7 31-294d. See <em>Galway </em>v. <em>Doody Steel Erecting Co., </em>supra, 103 Conn. 431 (construing General Statutes [1918 Rev.] \u00a7 5347).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In that case, the plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Harry T. Galway, was discharged from a three week hospital stay \u201cwith the knowledge and expectation on the part of the surgeon that [he] then needed and would need a very considerable amount of nursing, care, and attention from his wife.\u201d Id., 432. His wife rendered this care for eleven weeks and subsequently sought compensation from Galway\u2019s employer. See id. We rejected the wife\u2019s claim, stating that, \u201cin [the] case of [an] injury requiring hospital treatment, an award will be made for services rendered and appliances furnished to the injured employee by another member of his family in lieu of such treatment and in accordance with the consent and direction of the physician in charge, especially when the member rendering such services gives up his regular employment in order to do so.\u201d Id., 435-36. We reasoned that \u201c[i]t [was] improbable that [Galway\u2019s] surgeon would have [discharged Galway] had [Galway] still needed hospital service . . . .\u201d Id., 436. The care that Galway\u2019s wife provided accordingly was not given in lieu of hospital treatment and, therefore, was deemed noncompensable. Id. The same logic applies to the present case. The decedent\u2019s postdis-charge care was not provided in lieu of hospital treatment and falls outside of the scope of compensable care established by <em>Galway.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">To be sure, workers\u2019 compensation commissioners and the board occasionally have authorized compensation for home convalescent care rendered by a member of an injured employee\u2019s family.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Boiano </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number><em>Eppoliti Construction, </em>No. 2108 CRB-4-94-7 (June 26, 1996); <em>Mallette </em>v. <em>H. C. Field Co., </em>5 Conn. Comp. Dec. 301 (1923); <em>Stephen </em>v. <em>Waterbury Rolling Mill Co., </em>5 Conn. Comp. Dec. 229 (1923); <em>Lunsmann </em>v. <em>Putnam, 4 </em>Conn. Comp. Dec. 571 (1921); <em>Swan </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford R. Co., </em>2 Conn. Comp. Dec. 449 (1917). In nearly all of these decisions, however, the care deemed to be compensable was unmistakably medical in nature. See <em>Mallette </em>v. <em>H. C. Field Co., </em>supra, 302 (compensating nurse for providing nursing services to her husband); <em>Stephen </em>v. <em>Waterbury Rolling Mill Co., </em>supra, 229 (compensating nurse for tending to her husband for injuries \u201crequir[ing] . . . the attention of a trained nurse\u201d); <em>Lunsmann </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>supra, 571 (compensating nurse for performing services to her injured husband that \u201ceither would have required a trained nurse or the extension of the period of hospital service\u201d); <em>Swan </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford R. Co., </em>supra, 449-50 (compensating nurse for dressing her brother\u2019s injured foot during his incapacity).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">In the most recent of these decisions, <em>Boiano </em>v. <em>Eppoliti Construction, </em>supra, No. 2108 CRB-4-94-7, the employee, Thomas Boiano, fell approximately sixty feet from a scaffold, suffering extensive injuries that left him incontinent, possessed of an unreliable memory and largely helpless with regard to basic daily activities such as cooking, dressing and showering. Boiano\u2019s physician recommended that Boiano \u201creceive home health care for a long period of time,\u201d and, consistent with that recommendation, Boiano\u2019s wife \u201cconstantly changfed] and cleanfed] [his] clothes and bedding, monitor[ed] his medications, catheterizfed] him, prepared] his food . . . [and] [drove] him . . . .\u2019\u2019Id. Boiano\u2019s wife left her permanent employment to provide these services. Boiano\u2019s former employer and its insurer paid Boiano\u2019s wife $100 per week for these services \u201c[d]uring various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>periods between 1988 and July, 1993.\u201d Id. After the employer and its insurer sought to terminate its payments to Boiano\u2019s wife, the commissioner found that she should continue to be compensated $100 per week for her services. The board upheld the commissioner\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\"><em>Boiano </em>is distinguishable from the present appeal in two respects. First, the home convalescent care that Boiano\u2019s wife had provided had a medical aspect to at least part of it, namely, the catheterization of Boiano. Second, Boiano\u2019s employer and its insurer had provided compensation to Boiano\u2019s wife over a five year period. A reasonable inference can be drawn from these payments that the insurance company was not making those payments gratuitously but, rather, because the services, at least in part, were for compensable services being rendered by Boiano\u2019s wife. This circumstance only could have been an additional factor supporting the board\u2019s conclusion that the care at issue in <em>Boiano </em>was compensable. Cf. <em>Valentino </em>v. <em>United Parcel Service, </em>No. 1907 CRB-4-93-11 (February 1, 1995) (enforcing express agreement between employer\u2019s insurer and injured employee\u2019s family to compensate members of employee\u2019s family for providing home convalescent care). Because neither of these circumstances exists in the present appeal, <em>Boiano </em>is distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">We next briefly consider the second question of whether the Tracys\u2019 care of the decedent was deemed \u201creasonable or necessary\u201d by an attending physician or surgeon. Our decision in <em>Galway </em>indicates that home convalescent care rendered by a member of a patient\u2019s family must be \u201cin accordance with the consent and direction of the physician in charge\u201d to be compensable. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Galway </em>v. <em>Doody Steel Erecting Co., </em>supra, 103 Conn. 435-36. The Tracys\u2019 care of the decedent, however, was not rendered in accordance with the consent or under the direction of any physician. As we mentioned previously, Sicklick <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>recommended that the decedent be maintained in a supervised setting. Sickhck did not follow up this recommendation in any active fashion, however. The record reveals no contact between Sicklick and the decedent between the decedent\u2019s June 1, 2000 followup visit and his death on November 29, 2001. Indeed, Susan Tracy testified that the care that she and the plaintiff had provided to the decedent was not under the direction of any physician \u2014 except as to Sickhck\u2019s broad dictum that the decedent should be maintained in a \u201csupervised setting\u201d \u2014 and did not involve the Tracys reporting to a physician or preparing reports of the care provided.
