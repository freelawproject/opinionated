Gianetti, a physician, against the defendants, Glenn Siglinger and Laura Sig-linger (Siglingers) and Foster M. Young, an attorney for the Siglingers, in which the plaintiff sought moneys that he claimed were due to him as compensation for medical services that he had provided to Allison Sig-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>linger, the minor daughter of the Siglingers. The defendants filed counterclaims against the plaintiff alleging violations of General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq. After trial to the court, the trial court rendered judgment for the defendants on both the plaintiffs complaint and the defendants\u2019 counterclaims. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The record reveals the following relevant facts and procedural history. On December 30, 1995, Allison Sig-linger was involved in an automobile accident. As a result of this accident, the plaintiff, a plastic surgeon, provided services to Allison twice: at the emergency room of Bridgeport Hospital on the day of the accident; and during an office visit on January 9, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">At the time that treatment was rendered, both the Siglingers and the plaintiff had a relationship with Physicians Health Services of Connecticut, Inc. (Physicians Health), a health maintenance organization.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Sig-lingers were subscribers to the prepaid health care program issued by Physicians Health. Pursuant to their agreement, Physicians Health provided certain covered services in return for specified periodic payments. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>agreement explicitly provided that it was \u201cnot anticipated that a [m] ember [would] make payments other than any applicable [c]opayment to any person or institution providing benefits under this [c]ontract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The plaintiffs relationship with Physicians Health is more complicated. From 1977 through 1998, the plaintiff was a provider of Physicians Health services as a member of the Greater Bridgeport Individual Practice Association, Inc. (practice association), or its predecessors.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This relationship was reflected in a series of agreements between the plaintiff and the practice association, all of which contain certain basic tenets of the arrangement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under the agreements, the plaintiff, as a participating physician, was obligated to provide or arrange for the covered services designated by Physicians Health sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>scriber contracts and to submit bills for those services to Physicians Health. Physicians Health would then compensate the plaintiff for the medical services he provided to Physicians Health subscribers in accord with a fee schedule determined by Physicians Health. The plaintiff was not to bill Physicians Health subscribers for any amount above a nominal, predetermined co-payment. Specifically, under the agreement in effect at the time the plaintiff provided services to Allison Siglinger, the plaintiff \u201cagreefd] that in no event . . . shall [p]hysician bill, charge, collect a deposit from, seek compensation, remuneration or reimbursement from, or have any recourse against [m] embers or persons . . . acting on their behalf for services provided pursuant to this [agreement.\u201d Thus, \u201cbalance billing,\u201d which is an attempt by a physician to collect the balance due from a subscriber over and above the amount that Physicians Health determined to be reasonable for covered services, was clearly prohibited under the arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The parameters of this arrangement were a matter of some contention between the plaintiff and the practice association up to and during the time that the plaintiff provided services to Allison Siglinger. Specifically, on more than one occasion, the plaintiff had billed Physicians Health subscribers directly for certain services that he had provided to them. The plaintiff subsequently sought payment through litigation. See, e.g., <em>Gianetti </em>v. <em>Fischetti, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Fairfield at Bridgeport, Docket No. CV-98-0352010S (February 3, 2000), aff'd, 64 Conn. App. 902, 777 A.2d 213 (2001); <em>Gianetti </em>v. <em>Mulroney, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Fairfield at Bridgeport, Docket No. CV-91-0290495S (July 10, 1995). In a September 6, 1991 letter, the practice association informed the plaintiff that the board of directors had determined that the plaintiff had a pattern of not fulfilling his contractual obligations to the prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>tice association with respect to billing issues. The letter warned that another occurrence of certain specified events, including balance billing of plan subscribers, would result in termination of his participation with Physicians Health. In letters dated February 14, 1995, and March 6, 1995, the practice association notified the plaintiff that it intended to terminate him as a Physicians Health provider due to his balance billing of a plan subscriber. The board eventually withdrew the termination notice after the plaintiff obtained legal representation and contested the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">It is undisputed that the plaintiff did not inform the Siglingers at the time of treatment that he might claim compensation directly from them for his services, nor did he inform them of his disagreements with Physicians Health and other subscribers regarding compensation beyond that paid by Physicians Health. Indeed, the plaintiff submitted a request for payment to Physicians Health for the services that he performed for Allison Siglinger and received $1888.80 in July, 1996. The plaintiff requested a reconsideration of the amount paid to him, and by December, 1996, Physicians Health had adjusted his compensation for the care of Allison to $1980.80. The plaintiff has since filed an action against Physicians Health in small claims court, alleging \u201c[ijncorrect payment of medical services rendered\u201d and seeking an additional $481.60 in compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">During this time frame, Glenn Siglinger, on behalf of Allison Siglinger, brought a personal injury action arising out of the automobile accident and Young acted as his attorney. In an effort to obtain records from the plaintiff pertaining to the treatment of Allison, Young sent the plaintiff a document entitled \u201cauthorization for record request and irrevocable lien.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In October, 1996, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>the plaintiff sent Young two bills for the services provided: one detailing services provided and reflecting a total charge of $6385; and one reflecting a balance due of $4496.20. Young determined that the plaintiff, as a Physicians Health provider, was not permitted to bill the Physicians Health subscribers such as the Siglingers for the balance of his bill. Young, therefore, put the balance requested into escrow. The plaintiff sent Young another letter dated April 1, 1997, stating his position that the document entitled \u201cauthorization for record request and irrevocable lien\u201d entitled him to payment of the balance that he had claimed due in his October, 1996 letter. Thereafter, in order to facilitate the settlement of the personal injury action, Glenn Siglinger sought appointment as guardian of Allison\u2019s estate, and the plaintiff, in an effort to collect the moneys he claimed due, contested the appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The plaintiff then filed the present action, seeking recovery from the Siglingers under the theories of breach of contract, quantum meruit and unjust enrichment, and from Young under an unjust enrichment theory. The Siglingers filed an answer denying the allegations and alleging the following six special defenses: breach of contract; waiver; satisfaction; negligent provision of services; duress; and violation of General Statutes \u00a7 20-7L<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> *****7 They also filed a counterclaim alleging unfair trade practices in violation of \u00a7 42-110b. Similarly, Young filed an answer denying the allegation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>against him and alleging as special defenses that: any money due the plaintiff is owed by his codefendants; Physicians Health satisfied the debt; and the plaintiff violated General Statutes \u00a7 38a-193 (c).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Young also filed a counterclaim, alleging unfair trade practices in violation of \u00a7 42-110b, as well as an unfair insurance law practice in violation of \u00a7 20-7f and violation of \u00a7 38a-193 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">During a three day hearing, the trial court accepted evidence and heard testimony from the plaintiff, Young, Glenn Siglinger, and Michael Lee. Lee was a founding member of Physicians Health and, at various times, served as the chairman and vice chairman of the practice association. He testified regarding the operation of Physicians Health and the practice association, as well as the relationship of those organizations with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the defendants on the complaint. The trial court also rendered judgment for the defendants on their counterclaims for CUTPA violations. In so holding, the trial court determined that the 1992 agreement between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>plaintiff and the practice association was in force at the time that the plaintiff provided the relevant services. The court also concluded that this agreement prohibited the plaintiff from billing the Siglingers for the balance that he claimed was due after Physicians Health had paid him. Finally, the trial court noted other litigation arising out of the plaintiffs practice of balance billing and concluded that the plaintiff was well aware that the practice was prohibited through court decisions and statutes. The court therefore ruled in favor of the defendants on their CUTPA counterclaims, awarding $25,656.30 to Young, and $39,970 to the Siglingers in actual and punitive damages. The trial court also ordered that its memorandum of decision be filed in all pending cases in which the plaintiff is a pro se plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff raises fourteen issues.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After thoroughly examining the record and considering the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>briefs and oral arguments of the parties, we conclude that the plaintiffs claims have no merit. The trial court\u2019s findings are amply supported by the record and its legal conclusions are sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-12\"> The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b154-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) No person shall engage in unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">\u201c(d) It is the intention of the legislature that this chapter be remedial and be so construed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b154-10\"> \u201cBeginning in the late 1960\u2019s, insurers and others developed new models for health-care delivery, including [health maintenance organizations]. . . .

The [health maintenance organization] thus assumes the financial risk of providing the benefits promised: if a participant never gets sick, the [health maintenance organization] keeps the money regardless, and if a participant becomes expensively ill, the [health maintenance organization] is responsible for the treatment agreed upon even if its cost exceeds the participant\u2019s premiums.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Pegram </em>v. <em>Herdrich, </em>530 U.S. 211, 218-19, 120 S.

This agreement further provided that \u201cat no time shall [the plaintiff] seek compensation from [subscribers] for such services except for the nominal co-payments . . . .\u201d The agreement was for a one year term with automatic renewal absent termination by either party with a ninety day notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">In 1988, the practice association revised the arrangement to comply with federal laws and regulations.
