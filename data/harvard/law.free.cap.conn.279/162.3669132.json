The defendant, Christopher Kennedy, appeals, following our grant of his petitions for certification,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the judgments of the Appellate Court dismissing his appeals from the trial court\u2019s grant of two separate applications by the plaintiff, Leanna Putman,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for domestic violence restraining orders pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-15.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that the expiration of a domestic violence restraining order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>does not render an appeal from that order moot because it is reasonably possible that there will be significant collateral consequences for the person subject to the order. Accordingly, we reverse the judgments of the Appellate Court and remand these cases for consideration of the merits of the defendant\u2019s appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The record reveals the following facts and procedural history. The plaintiff and the defendant were divorced in May, 2002, and have two daughters and a son, all of whom are minors. On January 7, 2004, the plaintiff filed an application pursuant to \u00a7 46b-15, for relief from abuse against the defendant, requesting that the court suspend his visitation with the children and order him not to restrain, threaten, harass, molest or attack the plaintiff or her boyfriend.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On January 8, 2004, the trial court, <em>Kaplan, J., </em>issued an ex parte domestic violence restraining order granting the relief requested and scheduled a hearing for January 20, 2004. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-15 (b). After that hearing, the trial court extended the initial domestic violence restraining order for six months, but modified it to restore the defendant\u2019s contact and visitation with his daughters only. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>court then denied the defendant\u2019s motions for reargument and for clarification. Thereafter, the defendant filed a timely appeal to the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">On March 19, 2004, the plaintiff filed another application for relief from abuse pursuant to \u00a7 46b-15 against the defendant, requesting that the court suspend his visitation with his daughters and bar the defendant from entering the children\u2019s respective school buildings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On that same date, the trial court, <em>Kaplan, J., </em>issued an ex parte restraining order granting the relief requested and scheduled a hearing for March 29, 2004.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After the March 29 hearing, the trial court, <em>Graziani, J., </em>extended the initial order pending another hearing to be held on April 5, 2004. After the April 5 hearing, the trial court, <em>Klaczak, J., </em>extended that same order for six months, and then denied the defendant\u2019s motion for dismissal on the grounds of a mistrial caused by judicial bias and misconduct. The trial court also denied the defendant\u2019s subsequent motions for reargument, which challenged its factual findings, and for clarification of its findings of fact and conclusions of law. The defendant filed a timely appeal to the Appellate Court from the second domestic violence restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Thereafter, the Appellate Court, sua sponte, ordered the defendant to appear and show cause why his appeals should not be dismissed as moot pursuant to that court\u2019s decision in <em>In re Jeffrey C., </em>64 Conn. App. 55, 64-67, 779 A.2d 765 (2001), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 261 Conn. 189, 802 A.2d 772 (2002).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Following that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>hearing, on November 17, 2004, the Appellate Court dismissed both appeals as moot, and denied the defendant\u2019s motions for reconsideration en banc. Thereafter, we granted the defendant\u2019s petitions for certification to appeal from both dismissals; see footnote 1 of this opinion; and subsequently consolidated both certified appeals for briefing and argument pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 61-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The defendant claims that the Appellate Court improperly dismissed his appeals because domestic violence restraining orders present questions that are, by nature of their brief duration and the significant issues that they present, reviewable under the \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d exception to the mootness doctrine. See generally <em>Loisel </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>233 Conn. 370, 382, 660 A.2d 323 (1995).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although we agree that the Appellate Court improperly dismissed the defendant\u2019s appeals from the domestic violence restraining orders, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s appeals are rescued from mootness by the \u201ccollateral consequences\u201d doctrine articulated in <em>State </em>v. <em>McElveen, </em>261 Conn. 198, 205, 802 A.2d 74 (2002), rather than by the more limited \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d exception.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See footnotes 8 and 14 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Our inquiry begins with some basic principles. \u201cMootness is a question of justiciability that must be determined as a threshold matter because it implicates [this] court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wallingford </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Health, </em>262 Conn. 758, 766, 817 A.2d 644 (2003). The mootness doctrine \u201cis founded on the same policy interests as the doctrine of standing, namely, to assure the vigorous presentation of arguments concerning the matter at issue. . . . [T]he standing doctrine is designed to ensure that courts and parties are not vexed by suits brought to vindicate nonjusticiable interests and that judicial decisions which may affect the rights of others are forged in hot controversy, with each view fairly and vigorously represented. . . . Indeed, we note that courts are called upon to determine existing controversies, and thus may not be used as a vehicle to obtain advisory judicial opinions on points of law. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>\u201c[A]n actual controversy must exist not only at the time the appeal is taken, but also throughout the pen-dency of the appeal. . . . When, during the pendency of an appeal, events have occurred that preclude an appellate court from granting any practical relief through its disposition of the merits, a case has become moot. . . . However, under this court\u2019s long-standing mootness jurisprudence . . . despite developments during the pendency of an appeal that would otherwise render a claim moot, the court may retain jurisdiction when a litigant shows that there is a reasonable possibility that prejudicial collateral consequences will occur. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\u201c[T]o invoke successfully the collateral consequences doctrine, the litigant must show that there is a reasonable possibility that prejudicial collateral consequences will occur. Accordingly, the litigant must establish these consequences by more than mere conjecture, but need not demonstrate that these consequences are more probable than not. This standard provides the necessary limitations on justiciability underlying the mootness doctrine itself. Where there is no direct practical relief available from the reversal of the judgment, as in this case, the collateral consequences doctrine acts as a surrogate, calling for a determination whether a decision in the case can afford the litigant some practical relief in the future. <em>State </em>v. <em>McElveen, </em>supra, 261 Conn. 208.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wallingford </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Health, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 767-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">The array of collateral consequences that will preclude dismissal on mootness grounds is diverse, and includes harm to a defendant\u2019s reputation as a result of the judgment at issue. See, e.g., <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Ragaglia, </em>261 Conn. 219, 227-31, 802 A.2d 778 (2002) (appeal from revocation of plaintiffs special study foster care license as consequence for violating foster care regulations was not rendered moot by grant to plaintiff of permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>custody of foster children at issue because of revocation\u2019s effect on her reputation and fact that revocation could be used against her in future department of children and families proceedings if she wanted to become foster parent again); <em>State </em>v. <em>McElveen, </em>supra, 261 Conn. 212-16 (appeal from conviction of violation of probation was not rendered moot by defendant\u2019s completion of his sentence because conviction could impact his reputation and ability to obtain employment or preconviction bail in future); see also <em>Office of the Governor </em>v. <em>Select Committee of Inquiry, </em>271 Conn. 540, 549-50, 858 A.2d 709 (2004) (appeal not rendered moot by investigative committee statement that it would not enforce subpoena directly \u201cbecause of the collateral consequence of the potential for an article of impeachment on the basis, at least in part, of the governor\u2019s noncompliance with the subpoena\u201d); <em>Wallingford </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Health, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 769-70 (appeal not rendered moot by passage of special act addressing issue in case because administrative ruling that town is \u201cwater company\u201d for purposes of possible construction of golf course on watershed land \u201cpotentially subjects\u201d town to collateral consequences of department jurisdiction and other statutory obligations).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">While arguing the \u201cpublic importance\u201d element of the \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d test; see footnote 8 of this opinion; the defendant contends that his appeal presents an issue of public importance because of the effects of a domestic violence restraining order on the reputation and legal record of a person subject to that order. By themselves, however, these effects do not create a question of public importance. They are characterized more properly as collateral consequences of domestic violence restraining orders for the subject individual. Thus, the present case fits squarely within the bounds of our prior cases recognizing reputation harm and other potential legal disabilities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>as collateral consequences of otherwise moot court orders. The threat of reputation harm is particularly significant in this context because domestic violence restraining orders will not issue in the absence of the showing of a threat of violence, specifically a \u201ccontinuous threat of present physical pain or physical injury\u201d to the applicant. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-15 (a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Indeed, the controlling statute also requires the dissemination of the orders to multiple law enforcement agencies. See General Statutes (Sup. 2006) \u00a7 46b-15 (e).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 11 Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>inasmuch as we previously have recognized the importance of reputation damage as a collateral consequence in other contexts, we see no reason not to do so here, for being the subject of a court order intended to prevent or stop domestic violence may well cause harm to the reputation and legal record of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Moreover, as the defendant points out, domestic violence restraining orders have other collateral legal disabilities for their subjects. Once filed, they are available to agencies investigating future allegations involving the same family, and a trial judge making a future custody determination also reasonably might consider the issuance of a domestic violence restraining order in making that sensitive decision. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56 (b) (1) (\u201c[i]n making or modifying any order with respect to custody or visitation, the court shall ... be guided by the best interests of the child\u201d); see also General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56b (\u201c[i]n any dispute as to the custody of a minor child involving a parent and a non-parent, there shall be a presumption that it is in the best interest of the child to be in the custody of the parent, which presumption may be rebutted by showing that it would be <em>detrimental to the child </em>to permit the parent to have custody\u201d [emphasis added]). Thus, in the sensitive and often explosively litigated context of family dysfunction and dissolution, there is a reasonable possibility that a domestic violence restraining order will have prejudicial collateral legal consequences for its subject, even after its expiration. Accordingly, the subject of an improperly rendered domestic violence restraining order is likely to benefit from the vacatur of that order, and dismissal of his or her appeal as moot solely on the basis of that order\u2019s expiration is improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Indeed, the court\u2019s independent research reveals that the majority of the other states that have considered this issue have concluded that appeals from domestic violence restraining orders are not rendered moot by their expiration. We agree with the six states that rely explicitly on the collateral consequences of domestic violence restraining orders.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Roark </em>v. <em>Roark, </em>551 N.E.2d 865, 868-69 (Ind. App. 1990) (noting \u201cpotentially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>devastating\u201d collateral consequences for parent of expired \u201cchild in need of services\u201d order, including impacts on future presentence investigations, in-court impeachments and child custody determinations); <em>Piper </em>v. <em>Layman, </em>125 Md.

Third, the question must have some public importance. Unless all three requirements are met, the appeal must be dismissed as moot.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b189-8\"> We first must determine whether a domestic violence restraining order is an appealable final judgment, which is an issue that the defendant has not addressed. We, therefore, undertake this inquiry, sua sponte, because it implicates our subject matter jurisdiction. See, e.g., <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Dept. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number><em>Social Services, </em>273 Conn. 434, 441, 870 A.2d 448 (2005).

App. 553, 565 n.6, 850 A.2d 1098, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 920, 859 A.2d 578 (2004), that a \u00a7 46b-15 domestic violence restraining order is an appealable final judgment. Because of the potentially irreparable effects of \u00a7 46b-15 restraining orders on relationships within the family unit, the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Hartney </em>is consistent with our decisions applying <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983), with respect to the appealability of other temporary orders in the domestic context.

We disagree with these courts because a conclusion that the expiration of a domestic violence restraining order renders an appeal from that order moot ignores the gravity of these orders for the individuals involved, and is, therefore, inconsistent with our developing collateral consequences jurisprudence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b197-7\"> We address briefly the defendant\u2019s reliance on the \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d exception, which we conclude is misplaced because \u201c[t]he key analytical distinction lies in the type of ipjury; the collateral consequences doctrine applies when the collateral consequences of the contested court action, such as the continuing stigma of a criminal conviction, constitute a continuing injury to the specific litigant, justifying the court\u2019s retention of jurisdiction over the dispute, despite the lack of any consequences flowing from the adjudication directly at issue in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">. . . Thus, alive controversy continues to exist between the parties because of that continuing ipjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">\u201cBy contrast, the capable of repetition, yet evading review rule reflects the functionally insurmountable time constraints present in certain types of disputes. . . . Paradigmatic examples are abortion cases and other medical treatment disputes. . . . Thus, this exception to the mootness doctrine is rooted in a determination that, when its requirements are met, public policy requires that we decide the question, despite the fact that our decision will have no direct consequences in the case before us.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wallingford </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Health, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 770-71 n.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>In our view, correct application of the \u201cpublic interest\u201d element in the domestic violence restraining order context is illustrated by those sister state cases that have relied on the \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d analysis after identifying questions of statutory construction or constitutional dimension that would have a broad public impact beyond the resolution of that specific case. See <em>Ellibee </em>v. <em>Ellibee, </em>121 Idaho 501, 503, 826 P.2d 462 (1992) (first impression issues with respect to applicant\u2019s burden of proof and statute\u2019s applicability in cases of alleged child abuse); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Martens, </em>279 Kan. 242, 245, 106 P.3d 28 (2005) (civil enforcement provision of domestic violence order statute challenged as unconstitutionally vague); <em>Burkstrand </em>v. <em>Burkstrand, </em>632 N.W.2d 206, 208 n.2 (Minn. 2001) (whether statutory time frame in domestic violence statute is subject matter jurisdictional); Gern<em>stein </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>10 Neb.

Specifically, although the defendant claims numerous due process and statutory violations, his pro se brief filed before the Appellate Court indicates that they all are rooted in the trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion <em>with respect to the facts of these particular cases, </em>and his brief to this court, filed by counsel, does not indicate otherwise. Thus, although the \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d exception might well be applicable in a domestic violence restraining order case raising broader issues than those presented here, the Appellate Court properly concluded that the exception did not apply to this appeal. It, therefore, appropriately relied on its decision in <em>In re Jeffrey C., </em>supra, 64 Conn. App. 66-67, in which it rejected application of the \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d exception to a case that also was limited to record specific claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
