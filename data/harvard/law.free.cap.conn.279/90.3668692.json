(Lighthouse). In the first appeal, which arises out of a declaratory judgment action brought by the power company against Lighthouse, the power company claims that the trial court improperly reinstated the lease under the doctrine of equitable nonforfeiture. In the second appeal, which arises out of a civil action for damages brought by Lighthouse against the power company, the power company claims that the trial court improperly granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Lighthouse\u2019s application for prejudgment remedy. We agree with the claims advanced by the power company in both appeals and, accordingly, reverse the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. On November 30, 1999, the power company leased a parcel of land in Stamford to Lighthouse for the purpose of operating a high speed ferry service between Stamford and New York City. The leased parcel consisted of 3.6 acres within a larger twenty-five acre tract, also owned by the power company. Article five of the lease provided: \u201cThe Premises will be used as a ferry service terminal including, without limitation, a parking lot, ticket office, terminal and dock for Tenant\u2019s vessels.\u201d Article six of the lease provided in relevant part: \u201c[The] Tenant shall diligently proceed to obtain all governmental permits, approvals, licenses and/or certificates required in connection with Tenant\u2019s use of the Premises ....</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\u201cIf Tenant has not obtained all such Permits within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of this Lease, then Tenant shall have the right to either (i) terminate this Lease or (ii) extend the contingency period for another sixty (60) days ... if Tenant exercises its right to extend the contingency period for an additional sixty (60) days, and if Tenant has not obtained all such Permits within the additional sixty (60) days, then Landlord and Tenant shall each have the right to terminate the lease by notice given to the other party within ten (10) days after the expiration of said sixty (60) day period. In the event that either party elects to terminate this Lease in accordance with this Paragraph [six], the Lease shall terminate as of the date of such notice of termination and thereafter neither party shall have any obligations or liability hereunder, except those which arose prior to the termination date. Landlord agrees to cooperate with Tenant in connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>with the Permits; Tenant agrees to reimburse Landlord for its out of pocket costs incurred at Tenant\u2019s request in connection with obtaining the Permits.\u201d Article one of the lease required Lighthouse to make rental payments to the power company commencing March 1, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The 180 day period for obtaining permits described in article six began to run on November 30, 1999, and expired on May 29, 2000. When Lighthouse failed to obtain the required permits within the stipulated time, it exercised its option to extend the lease for an additional sixty days, until July 28, 2000. Lighthouse subsequently failed to obtain the permits by the end of the extended period.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the power company sent notice terminating the lease to Lighthouse by letter dated August 3, 2000, and the lease thereby was terminated on August 4, 2000, the date Lighthouse received actual notice of the termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Shortly thereafter, Lighthouse commenced a civil action against the power company, alleging improper termination of the lease. In its amended complaint, Lighthouse alleged, inter alia, that the power company improperly had (1) induced Lighthouse to request the sixty day extension, thereby granting the power company the right to terminate the lease at the end of the extended period if Lighthouse did not obtain all applicable governmental permits within the specified time, even though Lighthouse was not legally obligated to terminate or to extend the lease after the first 180 days, and (2) exercised its right to terminate the lease when Lighthouse failed to obtain the required permits, despite prior assurances, on which Lighthouse had relied in exercising its right to extend the lease, that it did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>intend to do so.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Lighthouse further alleged that the reason the power company wanted to terminate the lease was because, unbeknownst to Lighthouse, the power company was negotiating a lucrative deal with another party, Strand/BRC Group, LLC (Strand), to purchase the entire twenty-five acre parcel, including the leased premises. On the basis of these allegations, Lighthouse sought an award of damages for breach of lease, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>unfair trade practices, intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">On October 13, 2000, the power company filed an. action for a judgment declaring<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the lease with Lighthouse had been terminated properly and was \u201cof no further force and effect.\u201d On December 7, 2000, the two actions were consolidated and transferred to the Complex Litigation Docket at Stamford. On December 21, 2000, during a pretrial conference on other matters pending in the consolidated actions,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the trial court expressed its view that, under applicable caselaw, the power company had terminated the lease \u201cfairly [and] properly\u201d in accordance with its provisions, but that the court could reinstate the lease on equitable grounds.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court also informed the parties that it intended to proceed with a trial to the court on the declaratory judgment action while discovery continued on the civil action.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Thereafter, Lighthouse filed an answer, six special defenses and a counterclaim in the declaratory judgment proceeding. In its fifth special defense<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>terclaim,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>*****7 Lighthouse alleged, inter alia, that the power company wrongfully had induced Lighthouse to extend the lease and had refused to allow Lighthouse to mitigate its damages following improper termination of the lease by interfering with its efforts to obtain the applicable governmental permits. Lighthouse also alleged that termination of the lease, absent equitable relief, would cause it to suffer a loss wholly disproportionate to the loss suffered by the power company, which, according to Lighthouse, was reparable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Lighthouse thus requested that the lease be reinstated pursuant to the doctrine of equitable nonforfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Following a trial to the court, the court issued a memorandum of decision dated August 28, 2002 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>(August 28 decision), in which it concluded that the lease had been terminated properly in accordance with article six, but that the lease should be reinstated pursuant to the doctrine of equitable nonforfeiture. The trial court concluded that \u201cforfeiture of the lease would destroy [Lighthouse\u2019s] contemplated high speed ferry operation at that site and substantially affect [Lighthouse\u2019s] large capital investment in that operation. [Furthermore, Lighthouse] is willing to pay the back rent. [The power company] will not lose the benefit of its November 30, 1999 lease. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\u201c[Lighthouse] shall have the obligation to pay to [the power company] all rental monies due.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> [The power company] shall have the obligation to permit access to the leased premises including execution of all documents and permits necessary for [Lighthouse] \u2018to obtain all governmental permits, approvals, licenses and/or certificates required in connection with [Lighthouse\u2019s] use of the premises.\u2019 The 180 day period and 60 day extension period as set forth in [a]rticle [six] having expired, that portion of [a]rticle [six] is void.\u201d The court added that it would retain continuing jurisdiction over the \u201clitigation and all issues in regards to the lease, rent and permits\u201d and that the decision was an appealable final judgment. Neither party filed an appeal challenging the trial court\u2019s August 28 decision or filed a motion requesting an extension of time to take an appeal within the twenty day appeal period.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See Practice Book \u00a7 63-1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">On January 13, 2003, the power company filed a motion seeking payment of back rent and alleging that Lighthouse had not complied with its obligation to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>\u201call rental monies due.\u201d In fact, Lighthouse had not paid <em>any </em>back rent as of the date of the motion. On January 27, 2003, the trial court held a hearing on the matter. At the hearing, the power company acknowledged that it had waived its appellate rights with respect to the August 28 decision. The court then clarified that the order pursuant to the August 28 decision requiring Lighthouse to pay the power company \u201call rental monies due\u201d was \u201cmandatory.\u201d The court nonetheless advised Lighthouse: \u201cYou have all your remedies for damages, whatever [they are]. Give it to me in a [prejudgment remedy] and do all the rest of that. And meanwhile, I\u2019m going to \u2014 I\u2019m considering ordering that back rent to be paid. Get your [prejudgment remedy] in fast so that you can secure yourself in that regard. But if you don\u2019t pay the rent then what am I going to do about <em>this </em>\u2014 that <em>was the basis of one of the decisions. </em>And it has to be the basis of one of the mitigation findings. And there were concessions in court. I asked you a couple of times about it.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">On December 4, 2003, Lighthouse subsequently filed an application for prejudgment remedy in its civil action against the power company. Lighthouse sought to secure itself with respect to rent claimed due by the power company in connection with the declaratory judgment action, attorney\u2019s fees and costs and the nonrefundable costs Lighthouse had incurred to acquire the ferry boat. The parties subsequently appeared before the court for a hearing on several issues, including the power company\u2019s motion for payment of back rent<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the application for prejudgment remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">On March 5, 2004, the trial court issued two memo-randa of decision. In the first memorandum, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>granted Lighthouse\u2019s application for prejudgment remedy on the ground that there was probable cause that Lighthouse would recover damages in its action against the power company. The court granted relief consisting of $420,000 for attorney\u2019s fees, $237,500 for costs incurred to acquire the ferry boat and $393,749.96 for rent owed to the power company pursuant to the lease from August, 2000, to January, 2003, which it rounded off to atotal recovery of $1,050,000. The court, however, denied Lighthouse\u2019s request for relief as to future rent or rent abatement after January, 2003, leaving the parties to pursue their remedies under landlord/tenant law.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">In the second memorandum on March 5, the court denied the power company\u2019s motion for payment of back rent because, in the first memorandum on that date, it had \u201cgranted to [Lighthouse] a [prejudgment remedy] equal to the unpaid rents of $393,749.96 for the period of August, 2000, to January, 2003.\u201d The court noted that \u201c[t]he evidence submitted during the [prejudgment remedy] application was different than the evidence [the] court relied on in issuing the August 28 . . . decision.\u201d This new evidence included photographs and testimony regarding use of the property by the power company, evidence of the lockout by the power company and evidence that the power company had not cooperated with Lighthouse in the permitting process from August, 2000, to January, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">On March 10, 2004, the power company appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment in the declaratory judgment action, challenging the court\u2019s March 5, 2004 decision denying its motion for payment of back rent and the court\u2019s August 28 decision reinstating the lease. That same day, the power company also appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment in the civil action, challenging the March 5, 2004 decision granting Lighthouse\u2019s application for prejudgment remedy. On March 16, 2004, Lighthouse filed a motion to dismiss the power com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>pany\u2019s appeal in the declaratory judgment action on the ground that the appeal was untimely, to the extent that it raised issues decided in the August 28 decision, because the power company had not brought an appeal within twenty days of that decision. On April 21, 2004, the Appellate Court denied the motion without prejudice and requested that the parties address the matter in their briefs to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">On January 10, 2005, the trial court issued articulations of its March 5, 2004 decisions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court explained, with respect to the prejudgment remedy decision, that one of the reasons behind its August 28 decision to reinstate the lease was that \u201c[the power company had] negotiated a more lucrative deal for the [twenty-five acre parcel] with [Strand].<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> [The power company] needed [Lighthouse\u2019s sixty] day extension to gain the [landlord\u2019s right to terminate. [The power company] did not act in good faith in dealing with [Lighthouse] in obtaining the [sixty] day extension. At no time prior to termination did [the power company] inform [Lighthouse] of the Strand deal. [The power company] has unclean hands.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The court further explained that the parties\u2019 failure to file an appeal challenging the August 28 decision supported the claim by Lighthouse for damages arising from the power company\u2019s termination of the lease. The court then declared that, despite the reinstatement of the lease and the power company\u2019s decision not to challenge the August 28 decision, the power company had violated the terms of the lease by locking Lighthouse out of the leased premises from August, 2000, to January, 2003, and by refusing to cooperate with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Lighthouse in its attempt to obtain the required permits during that period. The court finally noted that, because the premises were available after January, 2003, for use by Lighthouse without further interference by the power company, \u201c[t]he parties were \u2018left to their landlord/tenant legal remedies\u2019 \u201d with respect to relief sought by the power company for nonpayment of rent due after January, 2003. The court made the same observations in its articulation of the decision denying the power company\u2019s motion seeking payment of back rent. On November 14,2005, we transferred the consolidated appeal from the Appellate Court to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">On appeal, the power company claims that, in the declaratory judgment action, the trial court improperly: (1) reinstated the lease pursuant to the doctrine of equitable nonforfeiture; (2) denied its motion for payment of back rent; and (3) acted as an advocate for Lighthouse when it recommended that Lighthouse assert a defense of equitable nonforfeiture. Lighthouse disagrees with each of these claims and argues, in turn, that the power company\u2019s appeal challenging the August 28 decision was untimely filed. We begin by addressing the timeliness of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Lighthouse contends that the appeal should be dismissed, insofar as it challenges the trial court\u2019s August 28 decision reinstating the lease, because the power company did not file its appeal until March 10, 2004, more than eighteen months later. The power company responds that the appeal should not be dismissed because the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion for payment of back rent on March 5, 2004, constituted a material alteration of the earlier ruling, thus creating a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>appeal period. In the alternative, the power company argues that this court should consider the late appeal for good cause pursuant to our supervisory authority under our rules of practice. We agree with the power company\u2019s alternative claim that this court should consider the late appeal for good cause shown.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">Practice Book \u00a7 63-1 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cUnless a different time period is provided by statute, an appeal must be filed within twenty days of the date notice of the judgment or decision is given. . . .\u201d The twenty day limitation, however, is not a \u201cconstitutionally or legislatively created condition precedent to the jurisdiction of [the appellate] court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Slotnik, </em>244 Conn. 781, 788, 712 A.2d 396, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Slotnik </em>v. <em>Considine, </em>525 U.S. 1017, 119 S. Ct. 542, 142 L. Ed. 2d 451 (1998). The court, pursuant to its supervisoiy powers over the administration of justice, \u201cmay, on its own motion or upon motion of any party . . . order that a party for good cause shown may file a late appeal . . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 60-2 (6). Because the rules are intended \u201cto facilitate business and advance justice, they [are to] be interpreted liberally in any case where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>it shall be manifest that a strict adherence to them will work surprise or injustice.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 60-1. Moreover, \u201cwe eschew . . . mechanistic interpretation[s] of our appellate rules in recognition of the fact that an unyielding policy requiring strict adherence to an appellate time limitation \u2014 no matter how severe or unfair the consequences \u2014 does not serve the interests of justice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Alliance Partners, Inc. </em>v. <em>Voltarc Technologies, Inc., </em>263 Conn. 204, 213-14, 820 A.2d 224 (2003). Accordingly, the twenty day limitation in the rules of practice is not an absolute bar to the filing of a late appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Nevertheless, timely motions to dismiss late appeals ordinarily are granted by the court. See id., 212-14 (affirming Appellate Court\u2019s exercise of discretion in dismissing untimely appeal). \u201cThis practice is based in part on the fact that if the untimely appeal is entertained, a delinquent appellant would obtain the benefit of the appellate process after contributing to its delay, to the detriment of others with appeals pending who have complied with the rules and have a right to have their appeals determined expeditiously. Appellees are given the right under our rules to object to the filing of a late appeal and should be given the benefit of that rule, <em>barring unusual circumstances </em>or unless they waive the benefit of that rule.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 213. In light of these principles, we therefore must decide whether the circumstances in the present case are \u201csufficiently exceptional to fall within the [court\u2019s] own limiting caveat.\u201d <em>Ramos </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>248 Conn. 52, 61, 727 A.2d 213 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">We conclude that, because exceptional circumstances gave rise to the power company\u2019s late appeal challenging the August 28 decision reinstating the lease, and because those circumstances were beyond the power company\u2019s control, its appeal should not be dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>missed. The trial court\u2019s March 5, 2004 ruling on the motion for payment of back rent changed a fundamental premise of the decision reinstating the lease, namely, that Lighthouse was \u201cwilling to pay back rent\u201d and, therefore, the power company would not \u201close the benefit of its November 30, 1999 lease.\u201d The court emphasized that this element was central to its August 28 decision during the hearing on the motion in January, 2003. During that hearing, the court described the August 28 decision requiring Lighthouse to pay back rent as \u201cmandatory\u201d and as \u201cthe basis of one of the decisions.\u201d Consequently, when the court determined more than one year later that Lighthouse no longer was obligated to pay back rent, it fundamentally altered the original decision. <em>See Alliance Partners, Inc. </em>v. <em>Voltarc Technologies, Inc., </em>supra, 263 Conn. 213-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">Furthermore, the trial court decided the motion in a highly unorthodox manner. In its March 5, 2004 memorandum, the court stated that the evidence on which it had relied in reaching its decision \u201cwas <em>different </em>than the evidence [the trial] court relied on in issuing the August 28 . . . decision.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This evidence included testimony <em>at the prejudgment remedy hearing </em>on the power company\u2019s use of the property, its lockout at the premises and its failure to cooperate with Lighthouse in the permitting process from August, 2000 to January, 2003. The court also stated that a key consideration in its decision on the motion for payment of back rent was its granting of the application for prejudgment remedy, which included a sum equal to the unpaid rent. The court thus relied on findings in a proceeding that Lighthouse did not commence until more than fifteen months following issuance of the August 28 decision to effect a radical change in its earlier balancing of the equities between the parties. These developments were beyond the control of, and could not have been anticipated by, the power company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>when the court issued the August 28 decision. See <em>Ramos </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 61-62 (most significant factor in permitting late appeal was that delay could not be attributed to petitioner, but arose from specifically identified confusion in office of public defender); <em>State </em>v. <em>Stead, </em>186 Conn. 222, 228, 440 A.2d 299 (1982) (key factor in permitting late appeal was that defendant had \u201cbecome mired in a procedural bog largely created by his own counsel\u201d). For the foregoing reasons, and because of the unusual procedural status of this case; see footnote 14 of this opinion; we conclude, pursuant to the exercise of our supervisory authority, that good cause has been shown for the filing of a late appeal by the power company challenging the trial court\u2019s August 28 decision reinstating the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">We next consider whether the trial court properly reinstated the lease under the doctrine of equitable nonforfeiture.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Lighthouse argues that the trial court properly reinstated the lease on the ground that the power company wrongfully had induced Lighthouse to exercise the lease extension option. This is the same argument Lighthouse makes in its civil action against the power company. Lighthouse specifically contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>that article six did not require it to choose between terminating the lease or seeking a sixty day extension, but merely granted Lighthouse the <em>right </em>to make such a choice, and that it could have remained a tenant even without exercising the sixty day extension upon failing to obtain the required permits within the first 180 days. Lighthouse further argues that the power company wrongfully <em>induced </em>it to exercise the sixty day extension so that the power company would acquire the right to terminate the lease if Lighthouse did not satisfy the permit requirement within the next sixty days. Lighthouse suggests that the power company wanted to acquire this right because it was negotiating to sell the property to another party and termination of the lease would eliminate the cost of relocating the ferry service operation should the sale take place. Lighthouse thus argues that the power company did not act in good faith in urging it to exercise the sixty day extension and, accordingly, the trial court properly reinstated the lease under the doctrine of equitable nonforfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">The power company responds that the plain language of article six establishes that the lease was contingent on Lighthouse obtaining the applicable governmental permits. Furthermore, the lease did not require the power company to inform Lighthouse of negotiations to sell the property during its tenancy. We agree with the power company that Lighthouse was obligated either to terminate or to extend the lease after the first 180 days should it fail to obtain the required permits and approvals. We therefore conclude that the trial court improperly reinstated the lease on the grounds that it was not contingent on obtaining the required permits and that the power company wrongfully had induced Lighthouse to exercise the lease extension option.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The trial court made the following findings in its August 28 decision: \u201cThe court finds that the lease was entered into by sophisticated parties, represented by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>competent counsel regarding the commercial interests of both parties, each with relatively equal bargaining power. This court concludes that in article six \u2018the parties meant what they said and said what they meant in language sufficiently definitive to obviate any need for deference to the trial court\u2019s factual findings as to the parties\u2019 intent.\u2019 . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">\u201cArticle six is titled \u2018Approvals\u2019 and does not contain a pure contingency clause. It does give either party the right to terminate if permits are not obtained but each party has different termination rights. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\u201cThe court finds that article six of the lease gives the tenant alone the right to terminate the lease within and at the end of the 180 day period of time if the permits were not obtained. During that same 180 day period and at the end of the 180 days, the landlord has no right to terminate the lease, even if the permits are not obtained. Article six is not a pure contingency clause. The court concludes that the lease is not contingent on obtaining the governmental permits. The failure to obtain the permits only gives either the tenant and/or the landlord, under certain circumstances, the right to cancel the lease. Only when the tenant requests an extension of an additional 60 days, do both the tenant and the landlord have the right to terminate the lease. The tenant, on May 22,2000, exercised the 60 day extension. . . . The 180 day period from November 30, 1999, ended at the conclusion of business on May 29, 2000. The 60 day extension thereafter, ended at the conclusion of business on July 28, 2000.\u201d (Citations omitted.) The court ultimately concluded that the lease had been terminated properly in accordance with article six, but found for Lighthouse on the fifth special defense and reinstated the lease under the doctrine of equitable nonforfeiture because the power company improperly had induced Lighthouse to extend the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>The applicable standard of review in contract interpretation cases is well established. \u201cAlthough ordinarily the question of contract interpretation, being a question of the parties\u2019 intent, is a question of fact . . . [w]here there is definitive contract language, the determination of what the parties intended by their contractual commitments is a question of law. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">\u201cOur case law, however, does not set forth a test by which to determine whether contract language is sufficiently definite to warrant its review as a question of law rather than as a question of fact. It is noteworthy that, in the majority of the cases considering contract interpretation a matter of law, the disputed agreement was a commercial contract between sophisticated commercial parties with relatively equal bargaining power.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tallmadge Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P., </em>252 Conn. 479, 495-96, 746 A.2d 1277 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The trial court in the present case found that \u201cthe lease was entered into by sophisticated parties, represented by competent counsel regarding the commercial interests of both parties, each with relatively equal bargaining power,\u201d and concluded, with respect to article six, that \u201c \u2018the parties meant what they said and said what they meant in language sufficiently definitive to obviate any need for deference to the trial court\u2019s factual findings as to the parties\u2019 intent.\u2019 \u201d In their respective briefs, both parties agreed that the determination of intent as expressed in the lease is a question of law. Our review is therefore plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The intent of the parties as expressed in a contract \u201cis determined from the language used interpreted in the light of the situation of the parties and the circumstances connected with the transaction. . . . [T]he intent of the parties is to be ascertained by a fair and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>reasonable construction of the written words and . . . the language used must be accorded its common, natural, and ordinary meaning and usage where it can be sensibly applied to the subject matter of the contract. . . . Where the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous, the contract is to be given effect according to its terms. A court will not torture words to import ambiguity where the ordinary meaning leaves no room for ambiguity .... Similarly, any ambiguity in a contract must emanate from the language used in the contract rather than from one party\u2019s subjective perception of the terms.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tallmadge Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P., </em>supra, 252 Conn. 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">As previously noted, article six provides in relevant part: \u201c[The] Tenant shall diligently proceed to obtain all governmental permits, approvals, licenses and/or certificates required in connection with Tenant\u2019s use of the Premises ....</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\u201cIf Tenant has not obtained all such Permits within one hundred eighty days (180) days after the date of this Lease, then <em>Tenant shall have the right to either (i) terminate this lease or (ii) extend the contingency period for another sixty (60) days . . . </em>if Tenant exercises its right to extend the contingency period for an additional sixty (60) days, and if Tenant has not obtained all such Permits within the additional sixty (60) days, then Landlord and Tenant shall each have the right to terminate the lease by notice given to the other party within ten (10) days after the expiration of said sixty (60) day period.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines the word \u201ccontingent\u201d as \u201cdependent on ... or conditioned by something else ...\u201d and the word \u201ceither\u201d as \u201cthe one and the other of the two . . . [or] the one or the other of the two.\u201d Construing the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>according to its ordinary meaning and usage, it is clear that the initial term of the lease was intended to be a \u201ccontingency period\u201d subject to one of two choices by the tenant at the end of the first 180 days, these being \u201ceither\u201d termination of the lease \u201cor\u201d extension of the lease for another sixty days should Lighthouse fail to obtain the applicable governmental permits and approvals. No third option, including continued occupation of the property by the tenant, can be read into the lease. Article six plainly provides that the tenant \u201cshall diligently proceed to obtain all governmental permits\u201d and other approvals needed in connection with the tenant\u2019s use of the property. If the lease was construed to mean that a tenant could continue to occupy the property after the first 180 days, even without obtaining the applicable permits and approvals, the due diligence provision would have no meaning. See <em>R. T. Vanderbilt Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Co., </em>273 Conn. 448, 462, 870 A.2d 1048 (2005) (\u201c[w]hen interpreting a contract, we must look at the contract as a whole, consider all relevant portions together and, if possible, give operative effect to every provision in order to reach a reasonable overall result\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">Lighthouse argues that language stating that the tenant \u201cshall have the right\u201d to terminate or to extend the lease if it has not obtained the necessary permits and approvals within the first 180 days indicates that termination or extension of the lease are not the only options available to the tenant because a right is merely a power or privilege, rather than an <em>obligation, </em>to perform the designated act. Lighthouse thus contends that a third option of \u201c \u2018doing nothing,\u2019 \u201d or simply continuing to occupy the property, is available under the lease if the tenant has not obtained the permits and approvals within the specified time. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Interpretation of the lease to include a third option of doing nothing would render superfluous the provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>granting either party the right to terminate the lease following exercise of the sixty day extension. Indeed, it is patently clear that there would be no reason for Lighthouse to seek an additional sixty days to obtain the required permits if it could ignore the 180 day deadline established in the lease. The option of doing nothing also flies in the face of article five of the lease, which describes the use to which the premises shall be put. Article five specifically provides: \u201cThe Premises <em>will </em>be used as a ferry service terminal including, without limitation, a parking lot, ticket office, terminal and dock for Tenant\u2019s vessels.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is undisputed that a variety of permits are required to effectuate this use of the premises. Reading articles five and six together, as we are required to do; see <em>R. T. Vanderbilt Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Co., </em>supra, 273 Conn. 462; leads to no other logical conclusion except that at the end of 180 days Lighthouse was required either to terminate the lease or to extend it. There was no third option of doing nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">We thus conclude that the trial court improperly reinstated the lease under the doctrine of equitable nonfor-feiture. Under the express terms of the lease, Lighthouse would have been required to terminate the lease if it had not exercised the sixty day extension. In addition, Lighthouse concedes that it needed more time to obtain the applicable permits and approvals. As a result, it cannot be said that the power company wrongfully induced Lighthouse to extend the lease, and, therefore, equitable principles do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Lighthouse also argues that interpretation of the lease to mean that only two options are available after the first 180 days if the permits and approvals have not been obtained would render superfluous the provision that follows granting either party the right to terminate the lease at the end of 240 days. Lighthouse suggests that this would be the case because a consistent inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>pretation of the lease would mean that, if the tenant is granted a right limited to choosing between extension or termination of the lease at the end of 180 days, the only alternatives expressed in the lease, then subsequent language granting either party the right to terminate the lease after 240 days must mean that the lease must be terminated if the permits are not obtained. This is so because termination is the only express option available to the parties at that point in time. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">As previously noted, contract language must be construed according to its ordinary meaning and sensibly applied to the subject matter of the contract. See <em>Tall-madge Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P., </em>supra, 252 Conn. 495-96. The right of either party to terminate the lease at the end of 240 days is not a requirement, as Lighthouse suggests, because the disputed language, when construed according to its ordinary meaning, clearly implies that the parties have a choice between terminating the lease and not terminating the lease. In contrast, the \u201ceither/or\u201d language pertaining to termination or extension of the lease at the end of 180 days is explicit and implies no third choice. Additionally, granting each party the right to terminate the lease at the end of 240 days would have no meaning if the lease automatically terminated. Had the result suggested by Lighthouse been intended, the lease would have provided that the tenant\u2019s failure to obtain the applicable permits after 240 days would result in automatic termination of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Furthermore, the power company had no obligation under the lease to inform Lighthouse that it was negotiating with another party to sell the property because the lease expressly provided that the entire twenty-five acre parcel, which included the 3.6 acres leased to Lighthouse, would be marketed actively for redevelopment. There was no requirement that the power com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>pany inform Lighthouse of its negotiations with specific developers. Lighthouse, which was represented by competent counsel, had to be aware that the property could be sold at any time and that the lease contained no requirement that the power company inform Lighthouse of its negotiations in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Because we conclude that the trial court improperly reinstated the lease under the doctrine of equitable nonforfeiture, we need not reach the power company\u2019s claim that the trial court relied on the incorrect standard in granting equitable relief to Lighthouse. There is also no need to consider the power company\u2019s remaining claims that the trial court improperly denied its motion for payment of back rent and improperly acted as an advocate for Lighthouse, each of which rests on the presumption that the lease properly was reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The power company claims, in the civil action brought by Lighthouse, that the trial court improperly granted the application by Lighthouse for prejudgment remedy on the grounds that (1) the power company wrongfully induced Lighthouse to exercise the sixty day extension, and (2) the losses suffered by Lighthouse were proximately caused by the power company.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In addition, the power company argues that the trial court acted as an advocate for Lighthouse in recommending that Lighthouse file an application for prejudgment remedy. Because the trial court granted the prejudgment remedy on the basis of its determination that the power company wrongly had induced Lighthouse to extend the lease, we conclude, for all of the reasons previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>articulated, that the trial court improperly granted the application for prejudgment remedy. Accordingly, we need not reach the issue of whether the trial court improperly acted as an advocate for Lighthouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The judgment in Docket No. SC 17552 is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to render judgment for Connecticut Light and Power Company, except with respect to the motion for payment of back rent. The judgment in Docket No. SC 17553 is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to deny the application by Lighthouse Landings, Inc., for prejudgment remedy.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-7\"> Lighthouse did not file its first permit application until July 31, 2000, three days following the expiration of the extended approval period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b117-5\"> Lighthouse\u2019s amended complaint, filed on July 10, 2003, alleges in relevant part: \u201c11.
