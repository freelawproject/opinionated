The plaintiff, James Stutz, appeals<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court denying his application to vacate and granting the application of the defendant Southport Athletic Club, Inc.,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to confirm the arbitration award. The plaintiff claims that, based on the record of the arbitration proceeding he presented to the trial court, the court improperly denied his application to vacate because the arbitrator committed clear error by: (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>reducing the plaintiffs attorney\u2019s fees by 60 percent due to the lack of novelty and complexity of the shareholder derivative suit brought by the plaintiff; (2) reducing the plaintiffs attorney\u2019s fees by $24,896 for failing to comply with the requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 33-722;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (3) failing to consider the risk borne by the plaintiffs counsel in taking on the litigation as an enhancing factor to the value of the arbitration award. We conclude that the plaintiff has failed to furnish us with an adequate record to review his claims. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The plaintiff served a demand<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> upon the defendant\u2019s board of directors, claiming that the defendant\u2019s employee compensation plan was flawed and had resulted in the payment of inadequate shareholder dividends. Prior to the expiration of the ninety day waiting period required by \u00a7 33-722, the plaintiff also filed in the trial court a shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the corporation. Ultimately, the parties entered into an arbitration agreement that the trial court approved. The arbitration proceeded in two phases: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>phase I addressed the substantive merits of the plaintiffs claims; phase II resolved the plaintiffs claims for attorney\u2019s fees and expenses. The arbitrator first issued his phase I decision on the merits and found in favor of the plaintiff.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That award was confirmed by the trial court without objection from the defendant and is not a subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Thereafter, following a separate hearing with witnesses\u2019 testimony, documentary exhibits, and oral argument by the parties, the arbitrator issued his phase II decision, and awarded the plaintiff an \u201cadmittedly subjective\u201d amount of $50,000 in legal fees and $75,000 in expenses. Citing the arbitrator\u2019s failure to articulate the basis for the \u201cadmittedly subjective\u201d attorney\u2019s fee award of $50,000, the plaintiff filed an application to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s phase II award. The trial court granted that application, found that, in the absence of an articulation, the arbitrator\u2019s phase II award was \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d and remanded the case to the arbitrator for further proceedings. Subsequently, following another hearing with documentary exhibits and oral argument, the arbitrator issued an articulation of his phase II decision and awarded the plaintiff $50,331.60 in attorney\u2019s fees. The plaintiff once again filed an application to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4). The trial court denied the plaintiffs application. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The following facts are relevant to our analysis of the plaintiffs claims. The defendant is a corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>with 9852 shares of stock outstanding, 100 shares of which are owned by the plaintiff, who is also a former member of the defendant. As set forth in the demand served upon the defendant\u2019s board of directors, the plaintiff challenged the defendant\u2019s compensation plan because employees were paid below market wages in exchange for the opportunity to participate in a bonus pool tied to the corporation profits. The plaintiff alleged that, as the financial success of the defendant increased, the bonus pool and eventual disbursement of funds as employee compensation grew to the point that it resulted in a disproportionate drain on shareholder dividends.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">In his shareholder derivative complaint, the plaintiff sought: (1) recovery of all payments made under the compensation plan from 1995 to the present; (2) money damages from the individual directors; and (3) a declaratory judgment that all past payments under the compensation plan were illegal. In response to the demand and shareholder derivative suit filed by the plaintiff, the defendant appointed a special litigation committee (committee) to investigate the plaintiffs challenges to its employee compensation system. After an extensive investigation, the committee concluded that the defendant\u2019s compensation plan had been properly approved by the shareholders and that the compensation paid to employees under the plan had been both fair and appropriate. Accordingly, the committee concluded that the plaintiffs action was without merit and should be dismissed. The committee also concluded, however, that the defendant\u2019s board of directors should review the plan in light of the defendant\u2019s increasing financial success and determine whether profits had increased for reasons other than employee performance. To enable this assessment, the committee recommended that a specialist in compensation be retained to assist the defendant in preparing written criteria to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>whether the entire available bonus pool should be distributed as employee compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Upon receiving the committee\u2019s written report, the plaintiff objected to its conclusions on the merits of his claims and elected to go forward with his lawsuit. In response, the defendant did not immediately design a new compensation plan and dividend policy pursuant to the committee\u2019s recommendation. Instead, the parties entered into an arbitration agreement in order to resolve the issues of compensation and dividends outlined in the committee\u2019s report. Paragraph ten of the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement provides as follows: \u201cNotwithstanding the foregoing, the [p]arties may seek pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-417, 52-418, and/or 52-419 judicial orders confirming, vacating and/or modifying any arbitration award .... The parties further agree that any arbitration award regarding expenses (including attorneys fees) that enters pursuant to paragraph [six] may be vacated upon a determination by the [c]ourt that the fee award was <em>clearly erroneous </em>either as to entitlement and/or amount.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">At the phase II proceeding, the arbitrator received substantial briefing on the issue of attorney\u2019s fees, reviewed documentary exhibits, and heard testimony from witnesses. By mutual agreement, the parties did not create a written transcript of the phase II proceeding, and, consequently, a transcript of the testimony heard and arguments made at that hearing is not a part of the record before us on appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Ultimately, the arbitrator concluded that the plaintiffs requested fee was not warranted because the benefits conferred upon the defendant were unquantifiable and the cost of the plaintiffs derivative suit had a significant economic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>impact on the shareholders of the corporation. Consequently, the arbitrator awarded the plaintiff $75,000 in expenses<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and $50,000 in legal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Subsequently, the plaintiff sought to vacate the award in the trial court. The trial court remanded the phase II award for further articulation on the limited basis that the arbitrator had not specifically acknowledged the plaintiffs stated fee estimate, or lodestar,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and had not explained the reason for the deviation from that amount. The parties submitted additional briefs and an additional hearing was held before the arbitrator. Once again, by mutual agreement of the parties, no transcript was created of the proceeding, and, consequently, no transcript of the hearing is part of the record before us on appeal. The arbitrator issued a further articulation of his phase II award on June 30, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">The arbitrator\u2019s June 30,2004 articulation of his original phase II decision recognized the plaintiffs stated fee estimate of $150,725. The arbitrator concluded that the hourly rates of the plaintiffs counsel were reasonable. He found, however, that a reduction of $24,896 in the total fee was necessary because the plaintiff had disregarded the ninety day waiting period required by \u00a7 33-722, thus leading to the creation of extensive unnecessary expenditures. Additionally, the arbitrator stated that a further 60 percent reduction in the total fee was necessary due to a lack of novelty and complexity in the litigation, which resulted in a total award of $50,331.60 in attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The plaintiff once again applied to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award, based on the rationale that the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>would have suffered irreparable harm if he had complied with the requirements of \u00a7 33-722. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that the corporation would have lost an additional $200,000 in bonuses set to be paid to the defendant\u2019s employees well before the ninety day waiting period would have expired. Additionally, the plaintiff argued that the arbitrator\u2019s June 30, 2004 decision was not so much an articulation of the arbitrator\u2019s prior award as it was a new rationale implemented to arrive at a predetermined fee amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The trial court denied the plaintiffs application. The trial court ruled that the plaintiff had failed to demonstrate that it was clearly erroneous for the arbitrator to conclude that the plaintiff had prematurely commenced the litigation in violation of \u00a7 33-722, and that the litigation was not unusually novel or complex. To the contrary, the trial court found that \u201cthe arbitrator, by his articulation, [had] made what he himself [originally] described as an admittedly subjective amount . . . now fully articulated both as to the amount and the derivation of that amount.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Furthermore, the trial court concluded that, in order to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award on remand, the court would necessarily have to substitute its judgment for that of the arbitrator, and that there was not sufficient evidence before the court to allow it to conclude that the arbitrator had committed clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The plaintiff claims that it was clearly erroneous for the arbitrator to: (1) adjust the stated lodestar due to the litigation\u2019s lack of novelty and complexity; (2) recalculate his estimated attorney\u2019s fees due to the plaintiffs failure to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 33-722; and (3) decline to enhance the plaintiffs attorney\u2019s fees due to the contingent risk associated with plaintiffs counsel taking on the litigation. Because the plaintiff has failed to sustain his burden to furnish an adequate record on appeal, we are unable to resolve the merits of his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>We first note the standard of review that governs this case. \u201cJudicial review of arbitral decisions is narrowly confined. . . . When the parties agree to arbitration and establish the authority of the arbitrator through the terms of their submission, the extent of [the court\u2019s] judicial review of the award is delineated by the scope of the parties\u2019 agreement.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Blakeslee Arpaia Chapman, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Transportation, </em>273 Conn. 746, 754-55, 873 A.2d 155 (2005). Additionally, \u201c[t]his court has for many years wholeheartedly endorsed arbitration as an effective alternative method of settling disputes intended to avoid the formalities, delay, expense and vexation of ordinary litigation. . . . When arbitration is created by contract, we recognize that its autonomy can only be preserved by minimal judicial intervention. . . . Because the parties themselves, by virtue of the submission, frame the issues to be resolved and define the scope of the arbitrator\u2019s powers, the parties are generally bound by the resulting award. . . . [Finally] [t]he party challenging the award bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient to invalidate or avoid it . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) O <em>&amp; G/O\u2019Connell Joint Venture </em>v. <em>Chase Family Ltd. Partnership No. 3, </em>203 Conn. 133, 145-46, 523 A.2d 1271 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Furthermore, the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review mutually agreed upon by the parties makes an evaluation of the evidence that was before the arbitrator, based on a complete record of the proceedings, all the more imperative. We have repeatedly commented on the meaning of \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d in the context of evaluating prior factual determinations. \u201cA finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is <em>no evidence in the record to support it ... ox </em>when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court <em>on the entire evidence </em>is left with the definite and firm convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>tion that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Giacomi, </em>242 Conn. 17, 70, 699 A.2d 101 (1997); <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Danforth, </em>222 Conn. 150, 156, 609 A.2d 654 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">We acknowledge that the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard agreed to by the parties is traditionally one that we have reserved exclusively for the evaluation of questions of fact. As noted at oral argument before this court, however, the question of whether the plaintiffs counsel was <em>entitled </em>to a fee award is not in dispute. Rather, the only issue that is before us is whether the <em>amount </em>of the fee awarded by the arbitrator was \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d This determination necessarily depends heavily on the arbitrator\u2019s factual findings related to the novelty and complexity of the plaintiffs case, the circumstances surrounding the plaintiffs decision to file suit prior to the expiration of the requisite ninety day waiting period, and the potential risk associated with the plaintiffs counsel taking the case. Accordingly, we must apply the clearly erroneous standard consistent with our precedent, which requires a review of the entire record that the arbitrator had before him prior to issuing, and subsequently to articulating, his phase II decision. Indeed, at oral argument before this court, the plaintiff characterized the clearly erroneous standard in this context as meaning \u201cupon a review <em>of the entire evidence, </em>is there a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Additionally, we reiterate that, in making this determination \u201c[i]t is incumbent upon the appellant to take the necessary steps to sustain its burden of providing an adequate record for appellate review. . . . [A]n appellate tribunal cannot render a decision without first fully understanding the disposition being appealed. . . . Our role is not to guess at possibilities, but to review claims based on a complete factual record devel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>oped by a trial court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>H.N.S. Management Co., </em>272 Conn. 81, 101, 861 A.2d 1160 (2004); see also Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 60-5 and 61-10. We have also applied this principle of appellate review within the context of evaluating arbitral awards and similar fact intensive motions. See <em>Steve Viglione Sheet Metal Co. </em>v. <em>Sakonchick, </em>190 Conn. 707, 714, 462 A.2d 1037 (1983) (\u201c[b]ecause the defendant has filed no transcript of the [arbitration] proceeding . . . our review of [his motion to open the trial court\u2019s judgment confirming the arbitration award] is limited\u201d [citation omitted]); see also <em>Clairol, Inc. </em>v. <em>Enertrac Corp., </em>44 Conn. App. 506, 515, 690 A.2d 418 (\u201cWe note that [the plaintiff] put before the trial court a minimal record [of the arbitration proceeding] that failed to include the transcript of [the witness\u2019] testimony. Absent that transcript, it was impossible for the trial court to determine whether any of his testimony was detrimental to [the plaintiff].\u201d), cert. denied, 241 Conn. 906, 695 A.2d 537 (1997); <em>Covillion </em>v. <em>Northern Ins. Co. of New York, </em>92 Conn. App. 268, 270, 884 A.2d 449 (2005) (\u201c[I]t is impossible and unrealistic to require the trial court to make any determination absent the record of the arbitration proceedings. . . . Without an adequate record, we are left to speculation and conjecture . . . which . . . have no place in appellate review.\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">On the basis of the preceding framework, we conclude that as the appellant in the present case, the plaintiff has failed to meet his burden with respect to the three claims that he advances on appeal. In short, in light of the demanding \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard agreed to by the parties, the resolution of each of the plaintiffs claims requires an examination of the entire record that was before the arbitrator when he issued, and subsequently articulated, his phase II award. In the absence of the transcripts from the phase II proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>ings, the record before us is inadequate, and therefore, the plaintiff has failed to \u201c[produce] evidence sufficient to invalidate\u201d the arbitrator\u2019s award. <em>O &amp; G/O\u2019Connell Joint Venture </em>v. <em>Chase Family Ltd. Partnership No. 3, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">We are also mindful that the plaintiffs claims raise many thorny questions of law about how properly to calculate attorney\u2019s fees in a case such as this, including the role of the lodestar' in that calculation. There is no binding Connecticut precedent to guide us. Furthermore, the federal case law sends unclear and at times seemingly conflicting messages. See, e.g., <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Delaware Valley Citizens\u2019 Council, </em>478 U.S. 546, 565, 106 S. Ct. 3088, 92 L. Ed. 2d 439 (1986) (noting that novelty and complexity of issues \u201care presumably fully reflected in the lodestar amount, and thus cannot serve as independent bases for increasing the basic fee award\u201d); <em>DiFilippo </em>v. <em>Morizio, </em>759 F.2d 231, 235 (2d Cir. 1985) (noting that \u201cthe fact that a case is straightforward is not grounds to reduce lodestar award\u201d); <em>Independent Living Aids, Inc. </em>v. <em>Maxi-Aids, Inc., </em>25 F. Sup. 2d 127, 132 (E.D.N.Y. 1998) (\u201cthe novelty and complexity of the issues ... [is a factor] fully reflected in the lodestar calculation and cannot serve as independent bases for adjusting the basic fee award\u201d); but see <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Bergeron, </em>489 U.S. 87, 93, 109 S. Ct. 939, 103 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1989) (citing novelty and complexity as one of twelve \u201cfactors to be considered in assessing the reasonableness of an award of attorney\u2019s fees\u201d); <em>Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc. </em>v. <em>Comline Business Data, Inc., </em>1998 WL 274285 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (affirming reduction of lodestar by more than $200,000 based in part on litigation\u2019s lack of complexity), aff'd, 166 F.3d 65 (2d Cir. 1999); <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>7 F. Sup. 2d 132, 141 (D. Conn. 1998) (\u201c[o]nce [the lodestar has been] calculated, the court may, in its discretion, increase or decrease this figure by examining such factors as . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>the complexity of the issues\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Having reviewed the relevant federal case law, the only thing that becomes clear is that the federal jurisprudence in this area is not clear, and that the plaintiffs failure to present us with a complete record of the phase II proceedings is fatal to his claims. Indeed, only if the plaintiff were to prevail as a matter of law on the legal question of whether the novelty and complexity of the litigation is subsumed within the initial lodestar calculation, would the plaintiffs failure to provide a complete factual record be irrelevant. We are mindful, however, that \u201c[w]e do not decide issues of law in a vacuum. In order to review an alleged error of law that has evidentiary implications, we must have before us the evidence that is the factual predicate for the legal issue that the appellant asks us to consider.\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>American Thread Co., </em>200 Conn. 108, 110, 509 A.2d 512 (1986). We conclude that in the absence of the transcripts from the phase II proceedings, which contained testimony from individuals capable of commenting on the case\u2019s novelty and complexity, as well as the factual circumstances surrounding the plaintiffs other claims,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> it would be imprudent for us to attempt to resolve the complicated and thorny issues of law raised by the plaintiff. Accordingly, we decline to reach the merits of the plaintiffs claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The plaintiff contends nonetheless that the transcripts from the phase II proceeding are unnecessary to determine whether it was clearly erroneous for the arbitrator to make a downward adjustment to the fee award because the transcripts from the phase I proceeding, as well as the exhibits from both proceedings, provide all of the evidence necessary to support the plaintiffs original lodestar calculation. Specifically, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>plaintiff argues that this material demonstrates that the defendant benefited from the plaintiffs action, the litigation was novel and complex, filing suit early in conflict with \u00a7 33-722 was necessary to avoid irreparable harm and, therefore, it was clearly erroneous for the arbitrator to make a downward adjustment to the plaintiffs attorney\u2019s fees. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Even if we were to assume that we are able to reach the merits of the plaintiffs claims, the plaintiff asks us to assume further that, given the nature of the case, the volume of the pleadings, and the impending timing of one of the defendant\u2019s bonus payments, any factors to be considered in connection with his fee request militate in favor of leaving the presumptive lodestar intact. The plaintiffs approach, however, would require us to view the exhibits and other evidence from phase I and phase II in isolation, without the benefit of the very testimony from the separate phase II proceeding that the arbitrator heard to explain the other evidence\u2019s relevance to the plaintiffs fee request. It bears repeating that in order for us to conclude that the arbitrator\u2019s award was clearly erroneous, we would need to determine that there was <em>no </em>evidence in the record to support the award, or that <em>based on the entire evidence, </em>a mistake had been committed. See <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Giacomi, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 70. It is impossible to make such a determination when only one half of the record is available to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">To conclude otherwise would completely ignore the potential significance of the phase II testimony and require us to second guess the judgment of the arbitrator, who is the only individual who had the benefit of weighing the complete record, inclusive of the testimony from the phase II proceeding. Additionally, such an approach would conflict with our clear preference for making every reasonable presumption in favor of the arbitration award and the arbitrator\u2019s acts and pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>ceedings. See O <em>&amp; G/O\u2019Connell Joint Venture </em>v. <em>Chase Family Ltd. Partnership No. 3, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 145. It is not our role on appeal to try the arbitration proceeding de novo, an undertaking that would obviously defeat our \u201c[wholehearted] endorse[ment] [of] arbitration as an effective alternative method of settling disputes intended to avoid the formalities, delay, expense and vexation of ordinary litigation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals has aptly noted that, as an appellate court, \u201c[w]e do not sit in judgment over the wisdom of [an] arbitrator\u2019s holdings. . . . We do, however, review an [arbitrator\u2019s] decision to assure that it rests upon a barely colorable justification for the outcome reached.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Buttar, </em>378 F.3d 182, 195 (2d Cir. 2004). In light of this deferential standard, and in the absence of the transcripts from the phase II proceedings that constitute the full and complete record for review, we decline to consider the merits of the plaintiffs claims and cannot conclude that the arbitrator\u2019s reduced fee award was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-8\"> The plaintiffs application to vacate was brought pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a), which provides in relevant part: \u201cUpon the application of any party to an arbitration, the superior court for the judicial district in which one of the parties resides . . . shall make an order vacating the award if it finds any of the following defects ...
