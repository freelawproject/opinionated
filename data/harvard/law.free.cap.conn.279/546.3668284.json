Haight, \u201coperated\u201d a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a) when he was asleep in the driver\u2019s seat of his vehicle with the key inserted into the ignition. Because we conclude that this action was sufficient to constitute the operation of a motor vehicle, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">The record reflects the following relevant facts and procedural history. Shortly after midnight on October 20, 2001, Officer Kevin J. Dowling of the New Canaan police department observed a Lexus RX 300 legally parked on Elm Street in New Canaan. The vehicle\u2019s headlights were illuminated, but the motor was not running. Dowling initially believed that the vehicle was unoccupied but, after briefly leaving the scene and then returning, Dowling discovered the defendant asleep in the driver\u2019s seat. Dowling roused the defendant and, upon opening the vehicle\u2019s door, heard a warning chime. Dowling observed the key in the ignition but did not notice its position. The defendant submitted to a series of field sobriety tests and was arrested after failing them. He subsequently submitted to breath tests, which he also failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>The record also reflects that a key inserted into the ignition of a Lexus RX 300 can be turned to four positions: off, accessory, on and start. The key must be turned to the \u201cstart\u201d position initially to engage the motor, and to the \u201con\u201d position to continue running the motor. The headlights of the RX 300 may be illuminated regardless of whether the key is in the ignition. When the door of an RX 300 is open and the key is in the ignition in either the \u201coff\u2019 or \u201caccessory\u201d position, a warning chime will sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The defendant thereafter was charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of \u00a7 14-227a (a). The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charge on the ground that \u201cthe arresting [officer] did not, as a matter of law, have reasonable grounds to believe [that] the defendant was committing, or had committed, a crime . . . .\u201d Following an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, concluding that \u201c[it] [was] for the trier of [fact] ... to determine if there was \u2018operation\u2019 \u201d of the motor vehicle. The defendant then entered a conditional plea of nolo contendere,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>and the trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the plea. The defendant subsequently appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The Appellate Court reversed the judgment of the trial court, concluding that \u201cthe state did not factually support its allegation of operation by presenting evidence that a key was in the motor vehicle\u2019s ignition, while such key was neither in the \u2018on\u2019 nor \u2018start\u2019 positions of the ignition, even when the motor vehicle\u2019s headlamps were illuminated.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Haight, </em>88 Conn. App. 235, 239-40, 869 A.2d 251 (2005). We granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to appeal, limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that at the time of his arrest the defendant was not operating his motor vehicle?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Haight, </em>273 Conn. 939, 875 A.2d 44 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The state argues that the defendant \u201coperated\u201d his vehicle under the definition of that term as set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>125 Conn. 399, 6 A.2d 359 (1939).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The state argues that, because \u201ca jury reasonably could find that . . . the defendant operated his motor vehicle when he intentionally inserted his key into the ignition and partially turned it,\u201d the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss was proper, and that the defendant\u2019s conviction therefore should stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">The defendant objects to the state\u2019s assertion that he partially turned the key in the ignition, an assertion that he characterizes as \u201cconjectural . . . .\u201d The defendant instead analogizes the facts of this case to those of <em>State </em>v. <em>DeCoster, </em>147 Conn. 502, 162 A.2d 704 (1960), a decision that, according to the defendant, establishes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>\u201cbeyond question that simply having a key in the ignition is not sufficient to establish a prima facie case of operating [a motor vehicle] under the influence.\u201d As such, the defendant argues, the evidence is insufficient to establish that he was operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Because we disagree with both the defendant\u2019s interpretation of <em>DeCoster </em>and his claim of evidentiary insufficiency, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">\u201cAs a preliminary matter, we set forth the standard of review. A motion to dismiss . . . properly attacks the jurisdiction of the court, essentially asserting that the plaintiff cannot as a matter of law and fact state a cause of action that should be heard by the court. . . . A motion to dismiss tests, inter alia, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction. . . . [0]ur review of the trial court\u2019s ultimate legal conclusion and resulting [decision to] grant . . . the motion to dismiss will be de novo.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Welwood, </em>258 Conn. 425, 433, 780 A.2d 924 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">The state\u2019s claim also implicates a question of statutory interpretation. Our review is therefore plenary. E.g., <em>Parrot </em>v. <em>Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, </em>273 Conn. 12, 18, 866 A.2d 1273 (2005). When interpreting a statute, \u201c[o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Perodeau </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>259 Conn. 729, 735, 792 A.2d 752 (2002). To do so, we first consult \u201cthe text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>We begin our analysis by looking to the statutory provision in question. General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both. A person commits the offense of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both if such person operates a motor vehicle on a public highway of this state ... (1) while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both, or (2) while such person has an elevated blood alcohol content. . . .\u201d Section 14-227a (a) prohibits <em>operating </em>a motor vehicle while under the influence rather than merely <em>driving </em>a motor vehicle while under the influence. It is well settled that \u201coperating\u201d encompasses a broader range of conduct than does \u201cdriving.\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>supra, 125 Conn. 402-403 (statute \u201crefers to persons who shall operate a motor vehicle, and is not confined to persons who shall drive a motor vehicle\u201d); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>84 Conn. App. 519, 527, 854 A.2d 74 (\u201c[t]he definition of \u2018operation\u2019 does not require [a] defendant to drive the car\u201d), cert. denied, 271 Conn. 941, 861 A.2d 516 (2004). Neither \u00a7 14-227a nor any related statute, however, defines \u201coperation\u201d of a motor vehicle. Moreover, the legislative history of \u00a7 14-227a and its predecessor statutes offers no insight into the definition of \u201coperation\u201d of a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>supra, 125 Conn. 403, however, this court set forth the definition of \u201coperation\u201d of a motor vehicle that our courts have applied since. In that case, the defendant, Lyman F. Swift, \u201c[a]fter visiting various dramshops in New London during the evening and partaking of intoxicating liquors . . . drove a car to Norwich . . . and returned to New London .... In an attempt to avoid another car on Williams Street in New London, [Swift] drove his car into [an embankment]. He was under the influence of intoxicating liquors at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>the time .... Police officers arrived on the scene immediately thereafter and found [Swift] sitting behind the wheel attempting to start the engine of the car while [a passenger], the only other occupant of the car at the time of the accident, was attempting to push it.\u201d Id., 401. Swift claimed that he never had driven the vehicle and entered the driver\u2019s seat only after the vehicle had collided with the embankment, when his companion had left the vehicle to attempt to push it. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">At the conclusion of Swift\u2019s ensuing trial on the charge of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, the trial court instructed the jury regarding the definition of \u201coperation\u201d as follows: \u201cA <em>person operates a motor vehicle within the meaning of this statute, when in the vehicle he intentionally does any act or makes use of any mechanical or electrical agency which alone or in sequence will set in motion the motive power of the vehicle. </em>So if you find that the accused, while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, got into the automobile, while it was standing [at the] side of the street, and manipulated the machinery of the motor for the purpose of putting the automobile into motion, the accused being in the car and in a position to control its movements, the accused would be guilty of operating a car under the influence of intoxicating liquor, whether the automobile moved or not.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 403. Although Swift challenged the trial court\u2019s instruction on appeal; id., 402; this court concluded that the instruction was proper and upheld Swift\u2019s conviction and the trial court\u2019s instruction. Id., 403, 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The present case is analogous to <em>Swift. </em>In both cases, the defendant failed to set the vehicle in motion, or even to run the vehicle\u2019s motor. Nothing in our definition of \u201coperation\u201d requires the vehicle to be in motion or its motor to be running. See, e.g., id., <em>403; State v. Lariviere, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>2 Conn. Cir. Ct 221, 225, 197 A.2d 529 (1963) (\u201ca person may be convicted of \u2018operating\u2019 a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor without it necessarily being shown that the automobile was actually in motion or even had the engine going\u201d). The act of inserting the key into the ignition and the act of turning the key within the ignition are preliminary to starting the vehicle\u2019s motor. Each act, in sequence with other steps, \u201cwill set in motion the motive power of the vehicle.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. Swift, </em>supra, 125 Conn. 403. Each act therefore constitutes \u201coperation\u201d of the vehicle under the definition set forth in <em>Swift. </em>See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>2 Conn. Cir. Ct. 605, 607, 203 A.2d 447 (1964) (attempting to start engine constitutes operation, even if motor fails to \u201ccatch\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Numerous courts in other jurisdictions have concluded that a motorist who is found sleeping or unconscious in a stationary vehicle with the motor not running violates the applicable prohibition on operating or being in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while intoxicated or under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>70 Ohio St. 3d 150, 154, 637 N.E.2d 897 (1994) (concluding that defendant in each case violated statute prohibiting operation of motor vehicle while under influence of alcohol when he \u201cwas intoxicated and in the driver\u2019s seat of his vehicle with the key in the ignition,\u201d regardless of whether motor was running), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Sylvania, </em>514 U.S. 1023, 115 S. Ct. 1371, 131 L. Ed. 2d 227 (1995); <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>State, </em>535 P.2d 1023, 1024 (Okla. Crim. App. 1975) (concluding that defendant violated statute prohibiting being in actual physical control of motor vehicle while under influence of intoxicating liquor when he was found sleeping or unconscious in driver\u2019s seat of vehicle with key in ignition and motor not running); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>353 N.W.2d 37, 42 (S.D. 1984) (concluding that defendant violated statute prohibiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>being in actual physical control of vehicle while under influence of alcohol when he was found sleeping or unconscious in driver\u2019s seat of vehicle with key in ignition and motor not running ); <em>Adams </em>v. <em>State, </em>697 P.2d 622, 625 (Wyo. 1985) (concluding that defendant violated statute prohibiting having actual physical control of vehicle while under influence of intoxicating liquor when he was found unconscious in driver\u2019s seat of vehicle with lights off, key in ignition and motor not running); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>120 Ohio App. 3d 416, 419-20, 698 N.E.2d 64 (1997) (\u201c[a] person sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of an automobile with the keys in the ignition is \u2018operating\u2019 a motor vehicle . . . even if the engine is not running\u201d); <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>Falls Church, </em>243 Va. 434, 439, 416 S.E.2d 435 (1992) (Compton, J., dissenting) (\u201cwhen a drunk [person] is sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a parked, operable motor vehicle, and he is alone and has inserted the key in the ignition switch, he is in \u2018actual physical control\u2019 of the vehicle\u201d); cf. <em>Atkinson </em>v. <em>State, </em>331 Md. 199, 219, 627 A.2d 1019 (1993) (\u201cThere [was] no evidence that [the defendant] did anything but climb into his vehicle, put the key in the ignition, and go to sleep. Without such evidence, and in light of . . . [the fact] that [the defendant] was not in \u2018actual physical control\u2019 of the vehicle when apprehended . . . his conviction [was reversed under the statute prohibiting <em>driving </em>or attempting to drive while intoxicated].\u201d [Emphasis added.]); but see <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>Falls Church, </em>supra, 438 (\u201c [b] ecause the presence of the key in the ignition switch in the off position did not engage the mechanical or electrical equipment of [the defendant\u2019s] car, [the defendant] did not \u2018drive or operate\u2019 the car\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The Ohio case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>supra, 70 Ohio St. 3d 150, is particularly persuasive because \u00a7 4511.19 of the Ohio Revised Code prohibits, in language similar to that of \u00a7 14-227a (a), the \u201coperation] [of] any vehicle . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>within th[e] state\u201d by any \u201cperson under the influence of alcohol . . . .\u201d Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 4511.19 (A) (1) (Banks-Baldwin 1993). In that consolidated case, each defendant was found sleeping in the driver\u2019s seat of his respective vehicle with the key in the ignition and the motor not running.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>supra, 154. The court rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that the vehicle\u2019s motor must be running for \u201coperation\u201d to have occurred. Id., 153-54. The court instead upheld the defendants\u2019 convictions, reasoning that \u201c[a] clear purpose of [Ohio Revised Code \u00a7] 4511.19 is to discourage persons from putting themselves in the position in which they can potentially cause the movement of a motor vehicle while intoxicated . . . .\u201d Id., 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">We previously have recognized Connecticut\u2019s \u201cunambiguous policy . . . [of] ensuring that our highways are safe from the carnage associated with drunken drivers.\u201d <em>State v. Stevens, </em>224 Conn. 730, 739, 620 A.2d 789 (1993). In light of this policy and the fact that the insertion of a key into the ignition is an \u201cact . . . which alone or in sequence will set in motion the motive power of the vehicle\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>supra, 125 Conn. 403; we conclude that the defendant\u2019s act of inserting the key into the ignition constituted operation of a motor vehicle within the meaning of \u00a7 14-227a (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The defendant argues that, contrary to the state\u2019s assertion,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the evidence was insufficient to support a reasonable inference that the key was found in the \u201caccessory\u201d position of the ignition rather than in the \u201coff\u2019 position. The distinction between the two positions, however, is inconsequential. Mere insertion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>the key into the ignition is an \u201cact . . . which alone or in sequence will set in motion the motive power of the vehicle\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted); id.; and, therefore, itself constitutes operation of the vehicle. Whether the defendant turned the key in the ignition does not affect the fact that he was operating the vehicle within the meaning of \u00a7 14-227a simply by inserting the key into the ignition.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The defendant relies heavily on our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>DeCoster, </em>supra, 147 Conn. 502, to support his claim that inserting the key into the ignition does not constitute the \u201coperation\u201d of a vehicle. In that case, a police officer found the defendant, Alvah DeCoster, intoxicated and slumped over the steering wheel of his car, which was stopped on the road. Id., 504. \u201cThe key was in the switch but the ignition was turned off. There was damage to the car on the right side and both tires on that side were flat.\u201d Id. Traffic signs at a nearby rotary had been knocked down. Id. We reversed DeCoster\u2019s conviction of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor, reasoning that \u201c[n]o one had seen [DeCoster] operating the car, and there was no evidence to show how long it had been standing in the place where it was found. Even though the court might infer that [DeCoster\u2019s] car had struck the signs at the traffic circle, there was no evidence whatever to show when or how the collision occurred.\u201d Id., 504-505. In the course of our analysis, we noted that, \u201c[a]t the time of his arrest, [DeCoster] was not operating a motor vehicle within the meaning of the law.\u201d Id., 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">The defendant seizes upon this last remark to argue that <em>DeCoster </em>established \u201cbeyond question that simply having a key in the ignition is not sufficient to establish a prima facie case of operating [a motor vehicle] under the influence.\u201d The remark that the defendant seizes upon, however, was dictum. The issue of whether the defendant in <em>DeCoster </em>was operating his vehicle at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>time of his arrest was not contested.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>DeCoster, </em>the issue before this court, instead, was the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence to sustain DeCoster\u2019s conviction. See id., 505 (concluding that, \u201cin the absence of any evidence as to the time when the defendant last operated his car, the conclusion of the trial court that he violated the statute was unwarranted and invaded the realm of speculation and conjecture\u201d). The statement that, \u201c[a]t the time of his arrest, [DeCoster] was not operating a motor vehicle within the meaning of the law\u201d; id., 504; did not bear on a contested issue, was unnecessary to the resolution of the case and, therefore, was dictum. It does not thwart our conclusion that the defendant in the present case engaged in conduct\u2014 specifically, inserting the key into the ignition \u2014 sufficient to constitute the \u201coperation\u201d of a motor vehicle under <em>Swift.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-7\"> The defendant\u2019s plea was accepted pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a and Practice Book \u00a7 61-6 (a) (2) (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen a defendant, prior to the commencement of trial, enters a plea of-nolo contendere conditional on the right to take an appeal from the court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s . . . motion to dismiss, the defendant after the imposition of sentence may file an appeal within the time prescribed by law provided a trial court has determined that a ruling on such . . . motion to dismiss would be disposi-tive of the case.

Supreme Court Records &amp; Briefs, April Term, 1960, Pt. A-388, Defendant\u2019s Brief p. 4. Correspondingly, the state argued that the direct testimony of an eyewitness was not necessary to find DeCoster guilty of violating \u00a7 14-227a but described DeCoster as \u201c[t]he only eyewitness\u201d to any such conduct, despite the fact that it was undisputed that a police officer had observed DeCoster slumped over his steering wheel with the key in the ignition before arresting him. Id., State\u2019s Brief p. 7. The implication of both DeCoster\u2019s and the state\u2019s arguments is that DeCoster was not operating his vehicle when the officer discovered him and arrested him.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
