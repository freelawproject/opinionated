Gainer argues that the admission of testimony about whether he remained silent violated his right of due process and entitles him to a new trial under <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976). Because we hold that the error was harmless, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">In July 2010, an officer discovered Gainer unconscious in the driver\u2019s seat of a Pontiac Bonneville vehicle, which was left idling in the parking lot of a Walmart store. Gainer was holding a plastic bag containing a substance that appeared to be marijuana, and he retrieved from his pants pockets \u201ctwo [additional] bags of marijuana and a lot of cash.\u201d Inside the vehicle, the officer saw lying on the passenger seat a gun partially covered by a paper bag. The gun contained a fully-loaded ammunition magazine and a bullet in the chamber. The officer also discovered in the center console of the vehicle a plastic bag containing rocks of crack cocaine and a \u201ccookie\u201d of crack cocaine that could be broken into pieces to sell. Gainer was indicted for possessing cocaine and firearms illegally.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-13\">Several months later, an investigator of the Panama City Police Department detained Gainer when he attempted to drive the same Pontiac vehicle away from a residence where officers were executing a search warrant. The investigator learned of Gainer\u2019s indictment and arrested him. Later, William Langley, an agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, interviewed Gainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-14\">At trial, Langley testified that Gainer waived his right to remain silent and agreed to speak to Langley. Gainer said that his girlfriend, Tameka Smith, owned the Pontiac vehicle and allowed him to \u201cdrive it all the time.\u201d When Langley testified that he \u201casked [Gainer] if he wanted to talk\u201d about his arrest for the earlier drug and firearm offenses, Gainer objected that Langley was about \u201cto make a comment about asking for an attorney.\u201d The prosecutor stated that she had \u201cprepped\u201d Langley not to mention whether Gainer had invoked his right to counsel, and the district court did not rule on Gainer\u2019s objection. The prosecutor asked Langley to repeat Gainer\u2019s response when asked to discuss his arrest, and Langley <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>testified that Gainer did not want to talk about his criminal charges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhqG\">[PROSECUTOR]: And when you asked Mr. Gainer if he wanted to speak with you about the events \u2014 the arrest that occurred in 2010, what did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axt\">[LANGLEY]: He said he did not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Gainer objected to Langley\u2019s statement as constituting \u201can improper comment regarding [Gainer\u2019s] right to remain silent.\u201d Gainer requested that the district court strike Langley\u2019s testimony and order the jury to disregard the testimony. The district court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">The government argues that Langley\u2019s brief testimony is equivalent to a remark this Court deemed unobjectionable in <em>United States v. Stubbs, </em>944 F.2d 828, 834-35 (11th Cir.1991), but that precedent is distinguishable. In <em>Stubbs, </em>the prosecutor asked Stubbs\u2019s cellmate \u201cwhat happened after [she] talked to [a federal agent],\u201d and the cellmate testified that the agent had tried to \u201ctalk[ ] to [the defendant] ... [but] \u2018[s]he [would not] say anything.\u2019 \u201d 944 F.2d at 834. This Court held that the cellmate\u2019s nonresponsive answer did not violate the rule in <em>Doyle </em>not to use for impeachment purposes the fact of a defendant\u2019s silence because \u201c[t]he prosecution made no \u2018specific inquiry or argument\u2019 about [the] defendant\u2019s postarrest silence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">This appeal instead is akin to <em>United States v. Ruz-Salazar, </em>764 F.2d 1433, 1435-37 (11th Cir.1985), and <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>921 F.2d 1530, 1549-50 (11th Cir.1991), where we held that, when a prosecutor had elicited testimony that a defendant had invoked his right to silence, the error was harmless. In <em>Ruz-Salazar, </em>the prosecutor ignored a warning that his question could violate the rule in <em>Doyle </em>and elicited testimony from a customs officer that the defendant had declined to provide a statement after being advised of his right to remain silent. 764 F.2d at 1435-36. We held that the error was harmless because \u201cthere was but a single reference at trial to the fact of defendant\u2019s silence\u201d and the evidence of his guilt was overwhelming. <em>Id. </em>at 1437. Likewise, in <em>Gonzalez, </em>a <em>Doyle </em>error occurred when the prosecutor elicited from an investigator that, after advising Gonzalez of his right to remain silent, Gonzalez had \u201canswer[ed] some questions relating to his identity, citizenship and ownership of property,\u201d but had refused \u201cto answer any questions regarding the criminal charges against him.\u201d 921 F.2d at 1549. The Court in <em>Gonzalez </em>held that the error was harmless because it \u201caccounted for one sentence\u201d during an eight-day trial; \u201c[t]he prosecutor did not focus on, nor emphasize [the] response\u201d; \u201cthere [was] no further mention of [the defendant\u2019s] silence\u201d; the trial court instructed the jury to disregard the remark; and the evidence was \u201cstrong\u201d regarding the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>Id. </em>at 1549-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">\u201cA <em>Doyle </em>violation is harmless if the error had no \u2018substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Miller, </em>255 F.3d 1282, 1285 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 623, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993)). And we have repeatedly held harmless a single comment on a defendant\u2019s silence \u201cif it occurs during a trial at which the government\u2019s evidence was otherwise overwhelming.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1285-86 (citing <em>United States v. Gabay, </em>923 F.2d 1536, 1541 (11th Cir.1991), <em>Ruz-Salazar, </em>764 F.2d at 1437, and <em>Sullivan v. Alabama, </em>666 F.2d 478, 485 (11th Cir.1982)). The error is \u201cespecially [harmless] [when] the prosecutor makes no further attempt to \u2018highlight,\u2019 the defendant\u2019s exercise of Miranda rights either in questioning other witnesses or during closing argument.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1286; <em>see United States v. Espinosa-Cerpa, </em>630 F.2d 328, 335 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">Gainer was not substantially prejudiced by Langley\u2019s testimony. Langley made a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>single reference to Gainer\u2019s right of silence, and the prosecutor did not revisit that issue during Gainer\u2019s trial. The district court told the jury, both before the case commenced and in its final instructions, that Gainer \u201c[had] the right to remain silent\u201d and that the jury could not assign \u201cany weight\u201d or \u201cconsider ... in any way\u201d a defendant\u2019s decision \u201cnot to testify\u201d because \u201c[i]t is not evidence.\u201d Although Gainer argued that someone else placed the drugs and firearm in the vehicle, the evidence of his guilt was overwhelming. Gainer had in his possession marijuana, crack cocaine, and a large quantity of cash and had within his reach a loaded gun. We cannot say that Langley\u2019s single remark \u201cwas ... so substantial as to taint the overall fairness of [Gainer\u2019s] trial.\u201d <em>Gonzalez, </em>921 F.2d at 1551.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">We AFFIRM Gainer\u2019s convictions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
