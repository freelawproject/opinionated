Holmes appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of her discrimination claims against Defendants-Appellees Air Liquide USA, L.L.C., and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>Air Liquide Industrial U.S.L.P. (collectively, \u201cAir Liquide\u201d), based on the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement (\u201cADR Agreement\u201d). She contends on appeal that the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Pub.L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010) (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d) renders the ADR Agreement unenforceable. We disagree and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Following her termination in 2010, Holmes sued her former employer, Air Liquide, asserting claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Family and Medical Leave Act. Air Liquide moved to compel arbitration according to the terms of the parties\u2019 2006 ADR Agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court found the ADR Agreement valid and enforceable, granted Air Liquide\u2019s motion to compel arbitration, and dismissed the case. <em>Holmes v. Air Liquide USA LLC, </em>No. H-11-2580, 2012 WL 267194, at *7 (S.D.Tex. Jan. 30, 2012). Holmes timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to compel arbitration de novo. <em>Am. Heritage Life Ins. Co. v. Orr, </em>294 F.3d 702, 708 (5th Cir.2002). The two-step inquiry to determine whether the parties should be compelled to arbitrate requires the court to establish (1) \u201cwhether the parties agreed to arbitrate the dispute,\u201d and, if so, (2) \u201cwhether any federal statute or policy renders the claims non-arbitrable.\u201d <em>Banc One Acceptance Corp. v. Hill, </em>367 F.3d 426, 429 (5th Cir.2004) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Holmes does not challenge the district court\u2019s finding that the parties entered into a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement. Instead, she argues that certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act render the ADR Agreement invalid and unenforceable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">Critically, Holmes admits that none of her claims arise under the Dodd-Frank Act or have anything to do with the provisions addressed in the Dodd-Frank Act. She nonetheless argues that the Act precludes arbitration of her claims because the ADR Agreement\u2019s broad scope (\u201call disputes\u201d) would require arbitration if she had brought them under the Act. She attempts to support this assertion by contrasting the language in three provisions of the Act. <em>Compare </em>7 U.S.C. \u00a7 26(n)(2) (\u201cCommodity Exchanges Provision\u201d), <em>and </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514A(e)(2) (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley Provision\u201d) (prohibiting any \u201cpredispute arbitration agreement [from being] valid or enforceable, if the agreement requires arbitration of a dispute arising under this section\u201d), <em>with </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 5567(d)(2) (\u201cBureau of Consumer Financial Protection Provision\u201d) (prohibiting predispute arbitration agreements \u201cto the extent that [they require] arbitration of a dispute arising under this section\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">Holmes posits that while Congress drafted the Bureau of Consumer Financial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Protection Provision using the language \u201cto the extent that,\u201d thereby requiring a claim to arise under that statute before the pre-dispute arbitration provision would apply, there is no such requirement in the Sarbanes-Oxley or Commodity Exchanges Provisions. Therefore, Holmes argues, because the ADR Agreement encompasses \u201call disputes,\u201d and because the former two provisions do not contain the limiting \u201cto the extent\u201d language, the fact that Holmes <em>could </em>have brought Sarbanes-Oxley and Commodity Exchanges Act claims renders the entire agreement invalid, even though she did not actually assert these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Holmes\u2019s argument is unavailing. Because she brings no Dodd-Frank claims, the ADR Agreement does not \u201crequire[ ] arbitration of a dispute arising under [the Commodity Exchanges or Sarbanes-Oxley Provisions].\u201d <em>See </em>7 U.S.C. \u00a7 26(n)(2); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514A(e)(2). Thus, the Act does not foreclose arbitration here. Any other decision would lead to the untenable conclusion that the Act wholesale invalidates all broadly-worded arbitration agreements (of which there are many) even when plaintiffs bring wholly unrelated claims. We must interpret the Act in a manner that avoids such unreasonable results. <em>See Birdwell v. Skeen, </em>983 F.2d 1382,1337 (5th Cir.1993); <em>cf. Gonzales v. Oregon, </em>546 U.S. 243, 267, 126 S.Ct. 904, 163 L.Ed.2d 748 (2006) (\u201c \u2018Congress, we have held, does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions \u2014 it does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted)). We conclude that the Dodd-Frank Act did not invalidate the ADR Agreement for the disputes Holmes actually brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b427-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b428-6\">. In relevant part, the agreement reads: \u201cAll disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation and application of this ADR Agreement or the employee's employment with Air Liquide or the termination of employment ... shall be resolved through ADR, including binding arbitration if necessary.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b428-7\">. Holmes also contends that the Dodd-Frank Act applies retroactively, thereby invalidating the ADR Agreement. We acknowledge the current debate in the district courts on this matter. <em>Compare Wong v. CKX, Inc., </em>890 F.Supp.2d 411, No. 11 Civ. 6291(JGK), 2012 WL 3893609 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 10, 2012) (applying arbitration provisions of Dodd-Frank retroactively), <em>with Blackwell v. Bank of Am. Corp., </em>No. 7:11-2475-JMC-KFM, 2012 WL 1229673 (D.S.C. Mar. 22, 2012) (refusing to apply Dodd-Frank to retroactively bar arbitration agreements). Because we conclude that the Dodd-Frank Act does not apply here, however, we do not reach Holmes\u2019s retroac-tivity argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
