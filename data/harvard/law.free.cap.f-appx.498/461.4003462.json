Brito appeals the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition challenging his CCE conviction and the imposed-sentence. He claims: insufficient evidence to support his conviction; district-court error in treating the offense-elements as sentencing factors; and actual innocence of unspecified enhancements to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-21\">A federal prisoner who seeks to collaterally challenge the legality of his conviction or sentence must file a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425-26 (5th Cir.2005). (Brito\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, filed in 1998, was denied; our court, in 2002, denied a certificate of appealability.) Such claims may be raised in a \u00a7 2241 petition under \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause only if the prisoner shows the \u00a7 2255 remedy is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention\u201d. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-22\">Brito did not brief any challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that he failed to show his claims were based on a Supreme Court decision establishing he might have been convicted of a nonexistent offense, as required by <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Failure to identify an error in the district court\u2019s analysis is equivalent to appellant\u2019s not appealing that issue. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Although <em>pro se </em>briefs are afforded liberal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>construction, <em>pro se </em>litigants must brief claims to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Because Brito has not challenged the district court\u2019s reasons for determining he is not entitled to proceed under \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause, any such contentions are abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b483-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
