Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). He consented to proceed before a magistrate judge, who dismissed the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). \u201cA complaint is frivolous if it lacks an arguable basis in law or fact.\u201d <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999). We review a dismissal of a complaint under \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) de novo, while a dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Green v. Atkinson, </em>623 F.3d 278, 279-80 (5th Cir.2010); <em>Berry, </em>192 F.3d at 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-13\">Gaines asserts that various defendants committed deliberate indifference by depriving him of his heart medications on four separate occasions. The magistrate judge determined that these allegations sounded in negligence, which does not rise to the level of deliberate indifference. <em>See Gobert v. Caldwell, </em>463 F.3d 339, 346 (5th Cir.2006). Gaines was required to establish \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to his \u201cserious medical needs,\u201d constituting an \u201cunnecessary and <em>wanton </em>infliction of pain.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Seiter, </em>501 U.S. 294, 297, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We have held that a prison employee\u2019s refusal to provide prescribed medication when an inmate with known heart problems complained of chest pain rose to the level of deliberate indifference. <em>See Easter v. Powell, </em>467 F.3d 459, 463-65 &amp; n. 25 (5th Cir.2006). Therefore, Gaines\u2019s allegations are not \u201cbased on an indisputably meritless legal theory\u201d or on \u201cclearly baseless\u201d facts. <em>Berry, </em>192 F.3d at 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-14\">Additionally, Gaines asserts that he suffered from deliberate indifference when he injured his ankle by falling into a crack or pothole in the pavement; he alleged in the district court that the prison administration had been made aware of the dangerous condition but did nothing to remedy the problem. Gaines had a duty to show that officials knew of the risk of harm but disregarded that risk by failing to undergo abatement procedures. <em>See Gobert, </em>463 F.3d at 346. He has made such a showing through the allegations in his complaint and at his hearing pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>to <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985), and we accept those assertions as true. <em>See Green, </em>623 F.3d at 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The remaining claims set forth by Gaines are insufficient to establish a constitutional violation cognizable in a <em>Bivens </em>action. Although he asserts that the defendants stopped his Prozac prescription to retaliate against him for filing a grievance, he has failed to satisfy his burden of establishing causation, and his personal belief that retaliation was the cause for the canceled prescription is insufficient. <em>See Johnson v. Rodriguez, </em>110 F.3d 299, 310 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1166 (5th Cir.1995). Although Gaines asserts that the defendants did not act in a timely manner in treating the ankle that he injured when he tripped and fell, he has not shown that the delay in treatment resulted in substantial harm. <em>See Easter, </em>467 F.3d at 464. Gaines\u2019s allegations that prison overcrowding has led to delays in medical and dental treatment are insufficient to establish a constitutional violation. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Gaines does not repeat his assertions, made in the district court, that prison overcrowding caused him to miss several meals. Additionally, he does not challenge the magistrate judge\u2019s conclusion that Gaines\u2019s official capacity claims are not cognizable in a <em>Bivens </em>action and that several defendants should be dismissed because they are challenged solely in their supervisory capacities. Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Consequently, the magistrate judge\u2019s judgment is REVERSED with respect to Gaines\u2019s assertions that he was deprived of his heart medications and his allegation that the prison administration evinced deliberate indifference by failing to remedy a known problem relating to the cracks or potholes in the pavement. The case is REMANDED for further proceedings on these claims. In all other respects, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b438-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
