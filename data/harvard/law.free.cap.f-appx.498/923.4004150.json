The evidence at trial showed that Holmes possessed a .357 caliber revolver outside a convenience store in Savannah, Georgia, fled from the investigating police officers, and was ultimately detained despite resisting arrest. On appeal, Holmes argues that the district court (1) abused its discretion in admitting into evidence two recorded 911 calls placed by an employee of the convenience store; (2) plainly erred in its oral jury charge by varying from the written final jury instructions; and (3) imposed a substantively unreasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-12\">We review a district court\u2019s determination of the admissibility of hearsay for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Miles, </em>290 F.3d 1341, 1351 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam). We will not reverse an erroneous evidentiary ruling unless \u201cthere is a reasonable likelihood that [it] affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Hawkins, </em>905 F.2d 1489, 1493 (11th Cir.1990). \u201c[W]here an error had no substantial influence on the outcome, and sufficient evidence uninfected by error supports the verdict, reversal is not warranted.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b946-13\">\u201cHearsay\u201d is a statement that: (1) the declarant makes outside of court; and (2) a party offers into evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement. Fed.R.Evid. 801(c). Hearsay is not admissible unless specifically excepted by statute or rule. Fed.R.Evid. 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-14\">Federal Rule of Evidence 803(1) provides that statements \u201cdescribing or explaining an event or condition, made while or immediately after the declarant perceived it,\u201d also known as \u201cpresent sense impressions,\u201d are exceptions to the rule against hearsay. Fed.R.Evid. 803(1). \u201cThe underlying theory of this exception is that the substantial contemporaneity of the event and the statement negate the likelihood of deliberate or conscious misrepresentation.\u201d <em>United States v. Scrima, </em>819 F.2d 996, 1000 (11th Cir.1987) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-15\">Rule 803(2) creates an exception for \u201cexcited utterances\u201d which are statements \u201crelating to a startling event or condition, made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement that it caused.\u201d Fed. R.Evid. 803(2). We have explained that the excited utterance exception does not require that the statement be made contemporaneously with the startling event. <em>United States v. Belfast, </em>611 F.3d 783, 817 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>(11th Cir.2010). Rather, courts ruling on the exception should consider the totality of the circumstances to determine if the declarant was still under the stress or excitement of the startling event at the time she made the statement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">Out-of-court statements offered for a reason other than the truth of the matter asserted are not hearsay, and Rule 802 does not bar their admission. <em>United States v. Hawkins, </em>905 F.2d 1489, 1494 (11th Cir.1990). We have held that explaining why an investigation was launched is a permissible, non-hearsay purpose. <em>Id. </em>at 1495. Statements to law enforcement officers generally may be admitted as non-hearsay for the limited purpose of explaining the course of the officers\u2019 investigative actions. <em>United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1208 n. 17 (11th Cir.2005). However, in order to be admissible, the probative value of the statement\u2019s non-hearsay purpose must not be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">We conclude from the record that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the recorded 911 calls were admissible, if hearsay, as both present sense impressions and excited utterances. Even if the district court erred in admitting the content of the 911 calls as non-hearsay statements not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, we conclude that such error was harmless because (1) the court properly admitted the content of the calls as hearsay exceptions; and (2) sufficient trial evidence independent of the contested 911 calls established Holmes\u2019s guilt. The district court\u2019s admission of the 911 caller\u2019s statements into evidence had no substantial influence on the outcome of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">\u201cWe review the legal correctness of a jury instruction <em>de novo </em>but defer to the district court on questions of phrasing absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Mintmire, </em>507 F.3d 1273, 1292-93 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cDistrict courts have broad discretion in formulating jury instructions, so long as the charge as a whole accurately reflects the law and facts,\u201d and we will only reverse a conviction when the court inaccurately presented the issues of law, or its \u201ccharge improperly guided the jury in such a substantial way as to violate due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1293 (internal quotation marks omitted). However, when the defendant fails to object to the jury charge as read at trial prior to the jury retiring, we review the claim for plain error only. <em>United States v. Schlei, </em>122 F.3d 944, 973 (11th Cir.1997). When analyzing a claim under the plain-error standard, we look to see (1) whether the district court committed error; (2) whether the error was plain; and (3) whether the error affected a substantial right. <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 831 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). Error affects substantial rights when it affects the outcome of the proceeding. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1778, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). In order to be reversible, this error also must \u201cseriously affect[] the fairness, integrity[,] or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 732, 113 S.Ct. at 1776 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">As a whole, we conclude that the district court\u2019s instructions accurately reflected the law. Although the court deviated from the scripted written instructions, Holmes does not meet his burden of showing that any error in the court\u2019s oral statement was plain error or that any error of the court affected the outcome of the proceedings \u2014 that, but for the wording choices of the court, Holmes would not have been convicted as charged. Holmes does not show that the court committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>plain error that affected his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">We review a sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness and evaluate the substantive reasonableness of a sentence under the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Although we do not apply a presumption of reasonableness for sentences falling within the guidelines range, \u201cordinarily we would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">We review the totality of the facts and circumstances to gauge for substantive error. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189-90 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc). The party challenging the sentence has the burden to establish that the sentence is unreasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. The relevant inquiry is \u201cwhether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-7\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds \u25a0 of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 786 (summarizing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). The weight given to any factor \u201cis a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). We may vacate a sentence only \u201cif we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the ease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">We conclude from the record that Holmes has not met his burden of showing that his 120-month sentence was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm Holmes\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
