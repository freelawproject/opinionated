Martinez argues that the district court should have granted his motion to suppress evidence seized during execution of a search warrant because there were false statements in the underlying affidavit. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">On denial of a motion to suppress, we review findings of fact for clear error and the application of law to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Spoerke, </em>568 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.2009). We construe all facts in the light most favorable to the United States, <em>id., </em>and defer to the findings of the district court, including those involving the credibility of witnesses, \u201cunless [its] understanding of the facts appears to be unbelievable.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-14\">The district court did not err by denying Martinez\u2019s motion to suppress. Detective Matthew Ochiuzzo\u2019s affidavit provided probable cause to issue a warrant to search Martinez\u2019s residence for marijuana. <em>See United States v. Lueck, </em>678 F.2d 895, 903 (11th Cir.1982). Oehiuzzo\u2019s affidavit stated that, while he stood \u201cat the front door of the target residence, [he] and Detective [Christopher] Carty immediately smelled the odor of fresh cannabis omitting from inside of the target residence\u201d; based on \u201chis training and experience\u201d he knew from the \u201cconcentrated smell\u201d that the residence contained a \u201clarge quantity of fresh cannabis\u201d; and he could distinguish between \u201cfresh cannabis [which] has a much stronger [odor] than that of burnt cannabis cigarette.\u201d Although Ochiuzzo averred that he acted on an \u201canonymous tip from a Confidential Source\u201d that the residence was a marijuana grow house, and Ochiuzzo later testified that he acted on a tip from an undercover agent, that discrepancy was immaterial. <em>See United States v. Ofshe, </em>817 F.2d 1508, 1513 (11th Cir.1987). Ochiuzzo\u2019s affidavit did not contain a \u201cdeliberate falsehood.\u201d <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 171, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 2684, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978). Ochiuzzo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>testified that he considered the agent a \u201cconfidential source\u201d because \u201cthere was confusion about whether [he needed to] proteet[ ] the identity of the agent[ ].\u201d And the district court did not clearly err by crediting Ochiuzzo\u2019s and Carty\u2019s testimony about the smell of marijuana. Although three other officers testified that they did not smell marijuana while waiting to execute the search warrant, those officers stated that they waited in the driveway and on the sidewalk some 15 to 25 feet away from the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">We AFFIRM Martinez\u2019s convictions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
