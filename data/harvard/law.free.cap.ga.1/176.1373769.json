The bill was instituted at the instance of the defendants in error against the plaintiffs, charging that on or about the 2d day of June, 1840, the complainants advanced to Edward btiles, at his request, the sum of $2,125 86, and took his note for the same, payable on the first day of December thereafterwards : that on the 30th of that month ho paid them on said note $592 01, and subsequently on the 20th of February, 1841, the further sum of $89 75, leaving still due and unpaid the sum of $1,475 26 ; that the complainants, having-ascertained that said Edward was greatly embarrassed in his circumstances, and believing him to bo insolvent and unable to pay his debts, instituted suit against him for said balance in the inferior Court of said county of Chatham, returnable to May Term, 1842, of said Inferior Court; and at the January Term, 1843, recovered judgment against him therefor, with interest and cost, and from which execution was issued. That about the 19th of April, 1842, and but a few days after the commencement of said suit by the complainants, the said Edward being in failing circumstances, and unable to pay his debts, as they believed, executed to Joseph Jones, Charles West, and Roswell King, junior, (three of the plaintiffs in error,) as trustees of Caroline Clifford Stiles, a mortgage of nine negro slaves, to secure the payment of three notes, bearing date the 1st of January, 1836, and payable respectively at one, two, and three years after date thereof, and the interest, which up to that time had accrued, being debts long antecedent to, and not contracted at the time of the execution of said mortgage. That said mortgage was executed in the county of Chatham aforesaid, and having been made and executed by the said mortgagor to secure debts long antecedent, and at a time when lie was unable to pay his debts, with interest, <em>lo prefer the said mortgagees, and to exclude the other creditors of the said mortgagor from an equal share, or portion of the estate so assigned, transferred and mortgaged, </em>and said mortgage containing a condition <em>that the, surplus of moneys arising from the sale, of said negroes, after payment of said notes, amounting to </em>$798 98 <em>principal, besides interest and charges, should be, returned to the said mortgagor, being a trust in favor of him, the sc\u00e1d Edward, </em>was under the laws of Georgia aforesaid null and void, and considered in law' and equity as fraudulent against creditors. Notwithstanding which, the said trustees caused the said mortgage to bo foreclosed at the February Term, 1843, of the Superior Court of the said county of Chatham, and execution to be issued thereon, and required the said John E. Davis, sheriff of said county, (one of the plaintiffs in error,) to sell said nine negroes, so illegally mortgaged, under the execution issuing from said foreclosure in favor of said mortgagees, and to pay over the proceeds of said sale to said mortgagees, the trustees aforesaid; and the said sheriff\u2019 proceeded to sell said slaves, and holds in his hands, as sheriff, a large sum of money, being such proceeds, which are claimed under the aforesaid illegal mortso foreclosed as aforesaid. That the had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>said trustees to desist from their said claim, founded upon said illegal mortgage, and to permit the complainants, with other judgment creditors of the said Edward, to share'pro <em>rata </em>the said proceeds, and to permit the said John E. Davis, sheriff as aforesaid, to retain said proceeds, to be applied to the payment of said judgments, &amp;c. ; and concluded with a prayer for injunction, and for a decree directing said proceeds to be paid over to the judgment creditors, wholly disregarding the claims set up under the said mortgage, and for general relief, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-5\">The plaintiffs in error, who were defendants in said bill, answered, admitting the sale of the negroes under the mortgage <em>fi. fa., </em>and the proceeds of the sale held up in the hands of the sheriff, except so much thereof as was necessary to pay costs, and an execution older than the mortgage ; the balance left on hand being $1,017 73. Divers executions against said Edward Stiles, besides the mortgage <em>fi.fa., </em>were in the hands of the said sheriff, unsatisfied ; and it appeared that he had no other property at the time of the levy, except the mortgaged negroes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-6\">The said Edward Stiles, answering the bill, stated that he had mortgaged to the defendants in error, to secure the payment of <em>their </em>said debt, a tract of land in the couhty of Bryan, of five hundred -acres first quality inlaqd swamp, called \u201c Crow-lane,\u201d with the improvements thereon, worth, as he believed, three thousand dollars at the time of giving the mortgage in 1841; and at the time of his answer it was worth $2,000. That said mortgage had never been foreclosed, and remained of force and <em>effect, </em>and was the oldest lien against him. That sometime in the year 1836 he purchased a plantation called \u201c Selina,\u201d in the county of Bryan, from said trustees, and gave a mortgage upon it to secure the purchase-money. In April, 1842, the said Edward, being desirous of disposing of said plantation, proposed to said trustees, or their agent, to give up the mortgage thereon, and that he would substitute in its stead a mortgage on the nine negro slaves referred to in said bill, the amount of the notes and the interest accrued thereon being then nearly twelve hundred dollars, which was accepted, and the mortgage <em>on the </em>negroes aforesaid was executed and delivered. That at the time of executing said mortgage he was solvent, and able to pay his debts with his property at a fair valuation. That said mortgage was executed in good faith, and with no view of excluding any one of his creditors from a fair and just participation of his estate, which he believed to be ample for the payment of his debts at a fair valuation ; nor did he have any view of securing to himself any benefit by way of trust, to the exclusion of his other creditors, for any surplus remaining after satisfaction of said mortgage to the trustees. <em>That </em>he had no intention to prefer one of his creditors to another, or to reserve any trust to himself, to the exclusion of his creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-7\">The answer of the trustees corroborated that of the said Edward Stiles as to the mortgage on the place called Selina, and the consideration therefor, and the circumstances under which the same was given, and the substitution, in its stead, of the mortgage upon the nine slaves, and the reasons therefor : They stated that the whole matter on the part of the trustees was conducted by the Reverend Joseph C. Stiles, the husband and father of their <em>cestui que trusts, </em>who, they believed, had no design whatever to defraud any of the creditors of the said Edward Stiles in the said transaction ; they had no knowledge at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>execution of the mortgage on the slaves, that the said Edward Stiles wasin failing circumstances. They denied the fraudulent trust charged 5a the bill, and insisted that the. condition embraced in the mortgage, which entitled said Edward to any surplus, was not such a trust as was contemplated by the statute, because without such condition the said Edward would have been entitled by law to any such surplus.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-4\">Upon, the trial of said bill in the court below, the solicitors for the plaintiffs in error offered Benjamin Edward Stiles as a witness, who was objected to on the ground of interest; which objection being overruled, and the witness examined, it was subsequently discovered that the said witness was a surety of the plaintiffs in error on their appeal bond in the case, and the objection was again renewed on this ground : \u2014 their counsel contended that the objection came too late, which being overruled by the court, they moved to substitute another surety in the place of the witness, but the presiding judge decided that the appeal bond could not be altered for that purpose; that it would not then be the bond which had been filed, and the appeal would be filed without bond within the time prescribed by law. Whereupon the counsel for the plaintiffs in error excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-5\">The counsel for the plaintiffs in error then submitted to the court that a mortgage was not such an assignment, transfer, or conveyance in trust as was intended and embraced, under and by the provisions of the act of Georgia of 1818, to prevent fraudulent conveyances, to deprive creditors from an equal distribution of an insolvent\u2019s estate, and that tinder the laws of Georgia, a mortgage was but a security for a debt, and did not change the ownership of the property: And the presiding judge decided, and so charged the jury, that a mortgage was such an instrument as was embraced under the said act, if made under the circumstances stated in said act, to bring it within its operation. To which the counsel for the plaintiffs in error excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-6\">The counsel for the, plaintiffs in error then submitted to the court, that if a mortgage was an instrument embraced under the act of 1818, it could only be so, when made by an insolvent to secare aa antecedent debt, under the apprehension and in expectation of immediately winding \u00abp, and with the intent and motive to give a fraudulent preference^ and the said court decided, and so charged the jury, that if the party was insolvent at the time the mortgage was made, it was within the act, although neither the mortgagor nor mortgagee knew of such insolvency at the time ; and although they did not act under the motive or with the intent <em>to give </em>a fraudulent preference, and although the mortgagor was woundup by executions twelve months after the date of the mortgage, provided that the jury should be satisfied that the mortgage was voluntary, and not forced by the vigilant creditor. To which the counsel for the plaintiffs in error excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-7\">In behalf of the plaintiffs in error it was proved on the said trial that in 1836 the said trustees sold to the said Eward Stiles a tract of land in Bryan county, called Selina, for ($800) eight hundred dollars, and took three promissory notes, bearing interest, in payment; and to secure which notes the said trustees took a mortgage from the said Edward Stiles, the vendee, on the said Selina plantation ; that in the same year the said Edward Stiles exchanged the said plantation for another with Alexander Stephen, who had knowledge of the mortgage, and under an agreemeat by ike said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>Stiles to procure the removal and cancellation of said mortgage ; that in April, 1842, upon the arrival of the said Joseph C. Stiles into Georgia from Kentucky, he being the husband and father of the <em>cestui que trusts </em>of the Selina plantation, the said Edward Stiles arranged with him, by the consent of the said trustees, to substitute a new mortgage upon nine slaves, to secure the said notes and interest, in the place of the mortgage on Selina, which new mortgage being taken, the old mortgage on S'elina was given up to the said Edward Stiles ; and the counsel for the plaintiffs in error thereupon submitted to the court that, under these facts, the latter mortgage on the negroes could not be within the provisions of the act of ISIS, even admitting the insolvency of the said Edward Stiles at the time, because the relinquishment of the old mortgage was a present good and valuable consideration for the new; and the said court decided, and so charged the jury, that the new mortgage was for the security of the notes, and the interest which had accrued from 1836 to 1842, when the mortgage was given ; that the interest was a sum greater than the value of the Selina plantation and mortgage on it; and that so far as the new mortgage was given to secure the interest, it was within the statute, and so far void; and that being void in part, it was, by the act, void altogether. Whereupon the counsel for the plaintiffs in error excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-5\">Upon these several exceptions the error was assigned.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b204-6\">Ij.

The plaintiffs in error maintain that the court erred, in allowing the objection to the witness, Benjamin Edward Stiles, on the ground of his being a security on the appeal bond; because, they say, that having been put upon his <em>voire dire, </em>and then sworn in chief, he could not afterwards be objected to, on proof of specific grounds of <em>interest.' </em>\u2014 Greenleaf <em>Evid. </em>470, 471.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-9\">2d.

Lloyd, for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-13\">Upon the trial of the above case, Benjamin E. Stiles was offered as a witness for file defendants, and objected to on behalf of complainants\u2019 solicitors on the ground of interest, which objection was overruled; the defendants\u2019 solicitors stating that the witness was not interested. Subsequently, during the course of the trial, it was discovered that the witness was the security of the defendants, on the appeal bond, and the objection was renewed, and the testimony of the witness ruled otrt, the motion being resisted by the defendants\u2019 solicitors on the ground that the objection came too late.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-14\">The defendants then moved to amend the appeal bond by striking out the name of Benjamin E. Stiles, and substituting another in his place as security ; thus to render him competent as a witness, which motion was refused by the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-15\">The exceptions taken to the decision of his Honor Judge Flkmixg on these points form the first ground of error complained of.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-16\">The testimony of Stiles was inadmissable on the ground of his interest, having by his bond obligated himself to pay the eventual condemnation money. lie was likewise liable for costs and also damages, should the jury have considered the appeal frivolous and intended for delay. It was a certain, direct and positive interest depending upon the result of the decree and judgment which was to be effected by Ins own testimony.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-17\">His liability for costs was a sufficient disqualification. Upon this point the authorities found in text books and reports are unanimous, to a degree remarkable in legal questions, and sustain the objection to the competency of a witness on this ground, even though he he an executor, trustee or officer of a corporation, with a remedy for reimbursement out of the public or trust funds. \u2014 1 <em>Greenleaf on Ev. </em>p. 447; 1 Stra. 548,- 5 <em>East. 7; 1 Doug. 139; Gresly Eq.

C. </em>p. 63; 19 Vesey, 434.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-18\">It may then ho considered as settled that Stiles was an incompetent witness.. Did the objection come too late <em>1</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-19\">It is conceded that under the old rule of law the objection to a witness must have bean taken upon the <em>voire dire </em>before examination, and that after discoveied interest was no ground of objection; but this rule was shaken, if not destroyed, by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>case of <em>Turner </em>vs. <em>Pearte, </em>(1 <em>T. R.) </em>ahd it may be safely laid down as the modem rule:</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-5\">That a witness may be objected to on the ground of interest whenever, during the course of the trial, it appears that he is interested. \u2014 1 <em>Greenleaf on Ev. </em>p. 467; 1 <em>Starkie, </em>124; 1 <em>Phillips, </em>96; 13 <em>Mass. </em>381; 2 <em>Camp. </em>14; 6 <em>John. </em>537 ; 1 <em>Esp. </em>37.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-6\">But farther let us look to the reason and spirit of the rule, by which a party was compelled to examine a witness upon his <em>voire dire </em>before he was examined in chief.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-7\">It is said <em>(Greenleaf on Ev. </em>p. 467) that a party shall not lie by, and <em>\u201c </em>see if the testimony of an interested witness makes for or against him, and then object, if he find it unfavorable.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-8\">The complainants\u2019 solicitors objected to this witness before he was put upon his examination in chief; they did not lie by, but objected from the time he was offered to them :</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-9\">\u201c Cessante ratione cessat et ipsa lex,\u201d is a maxim which should apply with peculiar force to these cases, in which the discretion of the court is so largely exercised.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-10\">Again, it is said, that perchance, if the objection had been taken upon the <em>voire dire, </em>the witness might have been released. The objection was taken before the testimony was closed in the case, and the defendants had full time to render the witness competent, had such a course been in accordance with the opinion of the presiding judge. \u2014 1 <em>Phillips on Ev. </em>p. 132.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-11\">The defendants have been in no .way prejudiced. The act by which the witness was rendered incompetent was their own deed. They were fully aware of it. The name of the solicitor of record appears on the bond in juxta position with that of the witness. It was not disclosed when the objection was first made to the witness as interested, and after the objection was originally made, the <em>voire dire </em>was waived upon the statement of witness and counsel, that the witness had no interest. We again appeal to the discretion of the court if, under circumstances like these, the objection came too late.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-12\">Had no objection been made at first, it might have been presumed that the complainants\u2019 solicitors were at the time aware of the objection, it being a matter of record. Is it probable that they would have urged an objection, and omitted in their argument to mention 'a fact, which would have been decisive of the question ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-13\">In support of the above views may be added legal authority. But if, notwithstanding every ineffectual endeavor to exclude a witness on the ground of incompetency, it should afterwards appear incidentally in the course of the trial that the witness is interested, his testimony will be stricken out, and the jury will be instructed wholly to disregard it. \u2014 1 <em>Greenleaf on Ev. </em>p. 468.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-14\">In all these cases the objection is to he considered as though it had come upon the \u201c <em>voire dire,\u201d </em>or first objection. \u2014 13 <em>Mass. </em>381.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-15\">Had this fact been shown to the court upon the first objection made to the competency of the witness, he must have been excluded. The fact having afterwards been discovered, and brought to the notice of the court, it may well be taken as part and parcel of the original motion, being only a continuation or renewal of it. <em>\u201413 Mass. </em>381.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-16\">There was no error in the court\u2019s refusal to allow the appeal bond to b\u00a9 amended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-17\">The record of a court cannot be varied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-18\">Though in some instances the record at the same term may be amended, where it is manifest that error has been committed in making up the record, yet can an instance be found in which a motion has been made to the court to alter or expunge from and add to its own record for the convenience of a party whose own-act had placed him under the necessity of making the demand ? \u2014 5 <em>Comyns\u2019 Dig. </em>395; <em>Sal. </em>567.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-19\">The appeal bond is a matter of record, regularly entered on the minutes of the court, which are signed by the presiding judge.

Taking into consideration that the decision in South Carolina, above cited, and also the one in the Circuit Court, (which arose out of a matter occurring in the very county in which Judge Shly decided, and a matter which attracted great attention,) had been decided, and some of them in printed reports, long anterior to the decisions of Judge Silly, we come to the necessary conclusion that the latter decision must have been hasty, and without that research and attention which alone entitles judicial decisions to respect, where they are not controlling.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-5\">The reasoning by which Judge Shly came to the conclusion in his decision, is equally fallacious.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-6\">ft is in substance, \u201c That the laws of Georgia having given an additional remedy to mortgagors, have thereby entirely changed the nature of the conveyance, admitting that, except by the operations of this statute, a mortgage would be within the act.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-7\">This remedy is but cumulative, and there are many circumstances which might induce a party to pursue this course, but it is apprehended that the common law method of a foreclosure might still be used.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-8\">If, after condition broken, the mortgagee were to take possession of the property, would ejectment or trover lie by the mortgagor for the property ?

If the mortgagee foreclose, (allowing the statute not to be cumulative,) he must <em>foreclose </em>in this way, but is there in that statute any provision that he shall be excluded from his other common law remedies, if he <em>do not choose to foreclose. </em>\u2014 10 <em>John. </em>481.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-11\">Subsequent acts of Parliament in the affirmative, giving new penalties, and instituting new methods of proceeding, do not repeal former methods and penalties ordained by preceding acts of Parliament, without negative <em>words.\u201d </em>\u2014 Middleton <em>and wife </em>vs. <em>Crofts, in Sanders\u2019 Atkins, </em>pp. 674, 675.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-12\">And this statute, being in derogation of the common law method of proceeding, must, be construed strictly, and without giving scope to implication.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-13\">That such is the ordinary construction, is evidenced by the repealing clause annexed to all statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-14\">To the anthoiity of this decision, we oppose those of Judge Montgomery, Judge Henry, and the decision of his Honor in the court below,</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-15\">\u201cAlia lex Roma, alia Athenis \u2014 our appeal is unto Csesar.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-16\">ft lias been decided that the mortgagee of personal property is the legal owner of property, after condition broken, the equitable estate alone remains in the mortgagor. \u2014 8 <em>John. </em>96; 2 <em>Vesey. jr. </em>378 ; 1 <em>McCord.

He may have sued upon the note or bond, and wish to sell the mortgaged property, to ascertain the difference between its value and the debt, as until such an ascertainment, he might bo enjoined by other creditors from touching other funds; but there is nothing which compels him to foreclose; if he can obtain possession of the personal property, he may retain it, and drive the mortgagor to his bill in equity to redeem.

The following are the requisites, as they appear upon the face of the act:</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-5\">1st. The grantor must be insolvent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-6\">2d.

That the conveyance was not within the act, unless it was made \u201c under the apprehension and in the expectation of immediately winding up, and with the intent and motive 1o give a fraudulent preference.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-10\">The court committed no error in refusing this charge, and in deciding that the knowledge and intention of the parties did <em>not effect </em>the matter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-11\">To sustain this view of the case, we refer to the words of the act itself:</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-12\">\u201c Any persons unable to pay his, her, or their debts, who shall hereafter make any assignment or ti-ansfer,\u201d &amp;c. \u201c by which any creditor of the said debtor shall or may be excluded from an equal share or portion of the estate so assigned or transferred,\u201d \u201csuch conveyance shall be null and <em>void.\u201d </em>\u2014 Prince\u2019s <em>Dig. </em>164, 165.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-13\">These are the words of the act. There is nothing in them which requires the party to be under the apprehension and in the expectation of winding up his affairs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-14\">The act speaks of an insolvent, and further qualifies the idea of technical insolvency by defining what the legislature meant as such: \u201c One unable to pay <em>his </em>debts.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-15\">A man may be utterly and hopelessly insolvent, and yet have no intention of winding up his affairs.

But are not the words in the statute last quoted, so pregnant with the ideas of knowledge, intention, and preference, expressions omitted in our statute ? It was un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>doubtedly in the power of the legislature to have passed the law in this form.

The title of the act speaks \u201c of the injury and exclusion of creditors.\u201d The preamble states \u201c excluding or defrauding.\u201d The body of the act speaks of \u201c exclusion\u201d of creditors only, and declares such exclusion sufficient to make the deed legally \u201c fraudulent,\u201d without reference to intention ; nor does the word \u201c fraud\u201d occur in any part of the body of the act, except in this last peculiar application.</p>\n<p data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-8\">But in addition to this argument upon the law itself, we present the opinions of eminent judges upon this point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-9\">Judges Johnson and Cuyler, in the case of <em>Schultz </em>vs. <em>Briethaupt, </em>before referred to, in deciding a cause identical in its features with this, say, in speaking of a mortgage :</p>\n<p data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-10\">\u201c It is a transfer of real estate, by which other creditors may he excluded from an equal share of the estate so assigned.\u201d And it is a \u201c conveyance, not free from a trust, for the benefit both of the seller and other persons appointed by <em>him.\u201d </em>\u2014 Printed <em>Report, </em>p. 61.</p>\n<p data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-11\">They follow the words of the statute, and attach to the deed only those requisites attached by the statute.

What is meant by this ? Clearly, a sale for cash, or consideration then moving, and which consideration stands to the creditors, in the place of the property thus sold ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-11\">Can it be said, that a mortgage or deed, by a man in insolvent circumstances, to a creditor, for an antecedent debt, by which other creditors are excluded, comes within the proviso ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-12\">If so, the proviso is directly repugnant to the body of the act, and is void.\u2014 1 <em>Black. Commen. </em>p. 89.</p>\n<p data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-13\">In all the cases above quoted, the proviso seems to have been construed, as having relation to purchasers other than creditors, and for a present consideration ; and would apply where a person, for a valuable consideration, sold his property to any one not a creditor, and still, in such conveyance, limited a trust for himself or others.</p>\n<p data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-14\">The facts of the insolvency of the grantor, and exclusion of creditors, make the conveyance one of <em>mala fides, </em>and exclude it from the proviso.</p>\n<p data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-15\">And this latter reasoning applies, even though the court should be inclined to the opinion, that a mortgage is not a deed which involves a trust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-16\">The fourth and last ground of error, is upon the charge of the court to the jury, as to the consideration for which the mortgage was given, under the following state of facts :</p>\n<p data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-17\">In January, 1836, the trustees, defendants, sold to Edward Stiles a tract of land, called Selina, for eight hundred dollars, taking his promissory notes for that sum, secured by a mortgage on the place. Selina was at the time worth eight hundred dollars, but shown, by the testimony, to have deteriorated in value very much in the six years following. In April, 1836, Edward Stiles exchanged Selina with one Stephens ; and sold the place taken in exchange to Starr, in the same month, for $800; and in that <em>month, April, </em>1836, <em>received the purchase-money from Starr. </em>There was some proof, of a promise, from Stiles to Stephens, to relieve the Selina place from the mortgage; but not with the knowledge, or concurrence, of the trustees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-18\">\u2019 In April, 1842, Edward Stiles being insolvent, and the amount due. on the promissory notes having increased from $800 to 1200 by the interest, and Selina having deteriorated in value from $800 to $500, Edward Stiles gave to the trustees a mortgage on <em>nine negro slaves, </em>to secure the principal sum, <em>and all the interest then due, </em>being an amount one and a half times larger than the sum originally secured, and double the value of the Selina property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"160\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-19\">It is stated in the answers, that upon receiving the second mortgage, the trustees cancelled the mortgage they held upon Selina, which had been the property of Stephens, for upwards of six years previously, though upon the face of the mortgage no such consideration appeared.</p>\n<p data-order=\"161\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-20\">The judge charged, that though the last mortgage was good for the eight hundred dollars, which was the value of the Selina place exchanged, yet, inasmuch as( it was given to secure not only that,^but also four hundred dollars <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>interest which had accrued, which was over and above the value o\u00ed the land and mortgage released ; it was, as to the four hundred dollars, without consideration, and void ; and being a statutory deed void in part, it was void altogether.</p>\n<p data-order=\"162\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-4\">The only error in the charge of the court, we contend, was that it did not instruct the jury that as between Edward Stiles and the trustees theie was no consideration whatsoever then moving.</p>\n<p data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-5\">The mortgage on its face expressed an antecedent consideration, and, being the act and deed of the parties under seal, it was an estopple to them to show any other consideration than the one expressed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-6\">When a deed states a consideration, and does not say for other consideration, no other consideration can be shown. \u2014 4 <em>Cowen, </em>427; 7 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>341; 1 <em>Vesey, sr. </em>127.</p>\n<p data-order=\"165\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-7\">If no proof can be heard to show a different consideration for a deed than the one expressed upon its face, the consideration was wholly antecedent, and the fudge's charge upon the point greatly in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"166\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-8\">But further, the release of the mortgage accrued to the benefit of Stephens, not Stiles. The Selina tract had belonged to Stephens for six years; it was his land, not the land of Stiles, which would have been sold, had the mortgage been foreclosed. <em>There was no evidence before the court that the exchange was accompanied with a warranty of title, and the pa,rol promise of Stiles was such an one as could not be enforced against him in equity, because of the statute of frauds, nor at law, because of the statute of limitation. </em>It is true, as a general rule, that there is an implied warranty in exchanges, hut such was not the case in this instance, because Stephens know of the mortgage; and the <em>parol promise of Stiles, </em>to lift the mortgage, took the place of a warranty. The warranty in exchange is, that if any parly is evicted, he has a right to the land given in exchange for his own. This would have restored Stephens\u2019 land to him, and there is no evidence that Stiles gave Starr a warranty title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"167\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-9\">There was no release to Stiles of any legal obligation, and the release of a mora! obligation is nota valuable consideration in law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"168\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-10\">If the deed of exchange contained a warranty, it was in the power of the solicitors for the defendant to have produced it. Stephens was examined as a witness by them, and their neglect to prove so material a point indicates with certainty that it has no existence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"169\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-11\">The reason why a deed is not within the act which is made for a present valuable consideration is, that the consideration stands to the creditors in the place of the property transferred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"170\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-12\">!i The money is probably applied to the debts of the creditors, or the debts of some of <em>them.\u201d </em>\u2014 Schultz and <em>Briethaupt, printed Doc. </em>p. 61.</p>\n<p data-order=\"171\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-13\">Was there any such consideration as this in the case before us. The defendant\u2019s witness, Starr, proved that he had paid to Edward Stiles the consideration money for the land taken in exchange in the year 1886. The money was in Stiles\u2019 pocket, and probably spent by him long before the debts of the complainants were contracted. It was to <em>Stiles </em>a consideration <em>long past, </em>and a <em>present </em>consideration to <em>Stephens </em>only.</p>\n<p data-order=\"172\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-14\">But allow the mortgage to he good for the 8800 principal, it is assuredly bad for the S'400 accrued interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"173\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-15\">Tise case of Schultz and Briethaupt, before quoted, is directly in point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"174\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-16\">The McKinnes\u2019 owed the Bank of the State of Georgia 840,000, and, m consideration of a mortgage to be given to secure both sums, the bank advanced in cash to them, $50,000. The mortgage was taken to secure both sums, and the Sixth Circuit Court in the District of Georgia, and the Court of Appeals of South Carolina, decide that, so far as the mortgage was for antecedent consideration, it was void, notwithstanding the then moving consideration of <em>$50,000. </em>\u2014 Printed <em>Decision, </em>pp 3, 61.</p>\n<p data-order=\"175\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-17\">Suppose, in the most favorable point of view, that they had paid Stiles the $800 in cash, and he had appropriated it to the payment of the comnlaining credit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>ors, and that in consideration of the $800, he had given them a mortgage for $1200, it would under the above decision be void as to the four hundred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"176\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-5\">How much stronger is thjs case against the defendants ? They have a lien upon certain property, (admit it to be Stiles\u2019 for argument sake,) worth six hundred dollars, and in consideration of a release of this lien, he gives them a mortgage conveyance for $1200 00. Can it be seriously contended that such release is a full moving present consideration for the $1200 00 ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"177\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-6\">Such a decision is a virtual repeal of the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"178\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-7\">A debtor in insolvent circumstances goes to a creditor to whom he owes.five thousand dollars, and which creditor has in his possession property of the debtor subject to his retainer of $500 00. The debtor says, release this property, and I will give yon a mortgage to secure your antecedent debt of S5000. The property is released, and the mortgage given. Will it be contended that such a release will support the mortgage, and be that valuable moving consideration which the law contemplates ? Surely not; and yet, if $500 will not support $5000, neither will $600 support $1200. The principle is identical. The court cannot judge of the relative considerations : there is but one rule which we apprehend can be sustained, either by policy or sound reason.</p>\n<p data-order=\"179\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-8\">\u201c <em>That when a mortgage, is given for valuable consideration, the moving to secure a debt which is antecedent, that the mortgage is void for the exact amount by which the antecedent debt exceeds the present consideration.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"180\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-9\">This mortgage was therefore void as.to the interest; and, being a statutory deed, void in part, was void <em>altogether. </em>\u2014 Schultz and <em>Briethaupt </em>vs. <em>Bk.

Stiles (the husband and father of <em>cestui que trusts) </em>agreed to have the mortgage cancelled upon receiving a new security. He was then in Kentucky. Upon his arrival here in Ihe spring of 1812, this arrangement, was consummated, by giving new mortgage, and was acquiesced in by the trustees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"214\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-8\">Defendant, Stiles, was then greatly indebted, and numerous suits a few days before instituted against him. His debts were then about $7,000. His property consisted of about fifteen negroes (mortgaged, as aforesaid, to the trustees, and to B. E. Stiles, guardian, &amp;c.,) and Crow-lane plantation. The complainants having exhausted their mortgage on Crow-lane, seek to avoid the defendant\u2019s mortgage, as contrary to the act of 1818.</p>\n<p data-order=\"215\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-9\">First inquiry : Is a mortgage within that act ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"216\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-10\">That act turns upon the creation of a <em>trust. </em>This appears from the causes which led to its passage; and is expressly declared in the act, (3 <em>Dall. </em>267,) a man may sell, <em>provided no trust.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"217\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-11\">What is a mortgage? It is a sale \u2014 conditional, it is true, but absolute on forfeiture of condition. \u2014 4 <em>McCord, </em>336 What is the condition ? That mortgagee pay the debt. But it is said to be a <em>trust </em>estate. What kind of a trust ? Much an one as is contemplated by the act ? No; it is an equity of redemption \u2014 the right of paying the debt, and retaining his property. This equity is at all times open to his creditors. They may redeem. They may levy upon it. These assignments in trust delay and hinder creditors.---2 <em>Kent, </em>535.</p>\n<p data-order=\"218\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-12\">Take the case of a general assignment for payment of creditors. A provision for the overplus, after payment of debts, to the assignor, will not invalidate, because such a resulting trust would follow of course, without any stipulation. \u2014 2 <em>Kent, </em>536, <em>n.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"219\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-13\">So an absolute conveyance, intended as a security, is but a mortgage, and the equity of redemption would result wilhout any stipulation. There is in neither case any secret trust, and the interest reserved by the mortgage is only what the law gives from the character and nature of the transaction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"220\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-14\">What is prohibited ? Assignments and conveyances in trust, by which the title passes absolutely out of the grantor, for the benefit of those appointed in the deed. These conveyances were peculiarly objectionable, because debtors were enabled to force creditors into conditions under the penalty of being excluded. <em>The distinction is very striking,</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"221\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-15\">I have been considering this subject in the most favorable aspects to complainant\u2019s case.

The complainants are judgment creditors of Edward Stiles ; their judgment having been obtained <em>subsequent </em>to the date of the mortgage. On the trial of the cause, the defendants in the court below, offered to intro - duce Benjamin Edward Stiles as a witness, who was objected to, on the ground that he was security for the defendants on their appeal bond, and therefore interested. The defendants\u2019 solicitors then moved the court to permit them to substitute another security on the bond, in the place of the witness, which mofion the presiding judge refused : Whereupon the defendants excepted. We are of the opinion that the court below ought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>to have permitted the defendants to have substituted another security in the place of the witness, for the advancement of justice ; the motion for substitution being made by the parties for their benefit, they could not take advantage of it; and an order entered on the minutes of the court, stating the facts, would make the record sufficiently intelligible. It would Eot, as is supposed, be giving a <em>new bond; </em>the appeal was entered according to law, and security given at the time, who continues security up to the time the new security is substituted in his place. Nothing is more common in our courts, when the original security on an appeal bond becomes insolvent, pending the appeal, than to require new security to be given; the court passing an order for that purpose. The motion to substitute another security in the place of the witness ought, in our judgment, to have been allowed; and there was error on the part of the court in overruling the motion. In the case of <em>Eastman </em>and <em>Philbrick </em>vs. McAlpin, decided during the present term, <em>(page </em>157,) we held that a debtor, in insolvent circumstances, might make an absolute <em>bona fide </em>conveyance of his property to a creditor, in payment of a <em>bona fide </em>pre-existing debt; provided there was no trust reserved for the benefit of the seller, without such conveyance being obnoxious to the act of 1818. But it has been ably and ingeniously argued, in this case, that inasmuch as the mortgagee is a trustee for the mortgagor, to the extent of the equity of redemption, such a trust is created, as would bring a mortgage conveyance within the statute. That a mortgage is such a conveyance, as would be obnoxious to the provisions of the act of 1818, provided it was used as an instrument of fraud, for the purpose of securing to the mortgagor a <em>secret </em>trust, or benefit, within the intent and meaning of that act, we do not doubt; but that a mortgage executed by a debtor in insolvent circumstances to a creditor, to secure the payment of a <em>bona fide </em>pre-existing debt is <em>per se </em>fraudulent as against creditors, within the meaning of the act of 1818, we do not admit. We have already decided that the debtor can make an <em>absolute </em>sale of his property to a creditor, in payment of a <em>bona fide </em>pre-existing debt. If he can make an absolute sale, surely he can pledge it, or create a lien upon it, as a <em>security </em>for a pre-existing debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">A mortgage in this State is nothing more than a <em>security </em>for the payment of the debt; and the title to the mortgaged property remains in the mortgagor until foreclosure and sale, in the manner pointed out by statute. It is true, the mortgagor is entitled to the equity of redemption after the debt is paid ; and the clause in this mortgage which stipulates that the surplus, after paying the pri \u00a1cipal lebts, interests and costs, shall be refunded to the mortgagor, confers no other, or greater privilege than the law confers upon him. The law gives him the right to the surplus of the proceeds of the mortgaged property when sold, after foreclosure, over and above the principal debt and interest, which the mortgage was given to secure, and the costs of such foreclosure and sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">We have said, under our law, the <em>legal title </em>to the mortgaged property remained in the mortgagor until after foreclosure and sale. The judgment\" creditor, in this case, could have levied his execution upon th\" mortgaged property, and sold it, and the purchaser would have acquired the legal title, subject to ihe incumbrance of the mortgage. The fundamental error in the argument of the counsel for the judgment ci editor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>is, in supposing the legal title to the mortgaged property is in the mortgagee after condition broken, and that he holds it in trust for the mortgagor ; at least so far as the equity of redemption is concerned.- The fact that the legal title to the mortgaged properly remains in the mortgagor, until after foreclosure and sale, cuts off, and destroys all foundation for the idea there is any such trust existing between the mortgagee and mortgagor as was contemplated by the act of 1818. The record in this case discloses that in 1836, the plaintiffs in error took a mortgage on a tract of land called Selina, to secure the payment of a debt due by Edward Stiles, the mortgagor, for $800 00. At the time this mortgage was executed, it is admitted the mortgagor was <em>solvent. </em>Afterwards, this tract of land was sold by Edward Stiles to Stephens, and For the purpose of raising the incumbrance, so as to make Stephens a good title, a new mortgage was executed in 1842, on the negroes, to secure the payment of the $800 00 with the accruing interest thereon. When this last mortgage was executed, the mortgagor was in failing circumstances. The debt which the mortgage was executed to secure, it is admitted, was a <em>bona fide </em>indebtedness. The court below instructed the juiw, this latter mortgage, given to secure the payment of the $800 00 with the accruing interest thereon, was within the statute of 1818, so far as the interest was concerned; and being void in part, it was void altogether. We are of the opinion a debtor in insolvent circumstances, has the right to execute a mortgage to a creditor, to secure the payment of a <em>bona fide </em>pre-existing debt; and that the execution of such mortgage would not <em>per se </em>be fraudulent as against creditors, within the intent and meaning of the act of 1818. That act was directed against conveyances made by debtors to creditors, <em>in trust for the benefit of the </em>seller, <em>or </em>mortgagor, whether secret or otherwise ; but was not intended to prohibit a del tor from making a <em>bona fide </em>sale of his property to a creditor, or to secure the payment of a <em>bona fide </em>debt by mortgage on his property, <em>free from any trust for the benefit of the seller or mortgagor. </em>Under our law of mortgage, there is not such a trust existing between the mortgagee and mortgagor, as will <em>per se </em>bring it within the provisions of the act. We are, therefore, of the opinion, th\u00e9re was error in the charge of the court, in deciding this mortgage came within the provisions of the act of 1818. Let the judgment of the court below be reversed, and a new trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
