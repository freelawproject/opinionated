Whereupon the defendants in error, by writ of certiorari, carried up said case to the Superior Court of the county of Chatham ; and after argument of counsel for the parties, his Honor Judge Fleming took time to advise and consider of the said case, and of the questions involved therein ; and on the 10th day of March, 1846, pronounced his decision, sustaining the said exceptions, and setting aside the proceedings in the Justice\u2019s Court: To which the plaintiff in error excepted, and assigns for error \u2014 \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-10\">1st. The court below erred in deciding that the Justice\u2019s Courts of this State were not courts of record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-11\">2d. The court below erred in holding that the Central Railroad and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Banking Company of Georgia, was not liable to be sued in a Justice\u2019s Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-5\">3d.

Judgment for plaintiff, and certiorari to Superior Court, upon the grounds stated in petition, and now to this court, on error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-8\">1st. That justices\u2019 courts are not courts of record, so held by the Superior Court, when plaintiff contends they are courts of record, having by statutes power to fine and <em>imprison. </em>\u2014 Prin. <em>Dig. </em>504, 508.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-9\">And they have extensive criminal jurisdiction, in all cases, over free persons of color or slaves, not extending to life or <em>limb. </em>\u2014 Prin. <em>Dig. </em>789, 790.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-10\">Any court having power to fine and imprison, is a court of record. So expressly laid down by <em>Blackstone, </em>3 <em>vol. </em>24, 25 ; <em>Bac. Ab. </em>101.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-11\">In the case of <em>Groenvelt </em>vs. <em>Burwell, </em>(1 <em>Salk. </em>200,) 1he court held that a Corporation Court of Physicians of London, was a court of record, because they had power to fine and imprison ; and this is the true test of courts of record, and not the enrolling the proceedings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-12\">The Circuit and District Courts of the United States are courts of record, and yet the proceedings are not enrolled; they are filed, but not enrolled. Now, if <em>be the test, these courts are not courts of record.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-13\">The judgments of justices\u2019 courts have equal <em>dignity </em>with those of superior <em>courts. </em>\u2014 Prin. <em>Pig. </em>507. Now, how do we prove a judgment from one of the superior courts? By an exemplification of the record, the record proves itself.\u2014 3 <em>Blk. Com. </em>24. And are not those of the justices\u2019 courts proven in the same manner ? If not, do we not destroy their dignity?</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-14\">Again, they are put expressly upon the same footing as to a claim of any money received of any officer, from sale of defendant\u2019s <em>property.' </em>\u2014 Act 13, <em>Dec. </em>1810; <em>Prin. Dig. </em>435.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-15\">Suppose a sale had taken place by a sheriff, and the money be claimed by the judgment of the Superior Court, and judgment from a justice\u2019s court; both being equal in dignity, and entitled to the same claim for the money, if of equal date, how will we prove the judgments, one by the record, which cannot be gainsayed, and permit the other, of equal dignity, to be disputed ? Equal of rank, of elevation, and yet not equal. \u2014 3 <em>Blk. Com. </em>25.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-16\">In England, justice\u2019s courts are courts of record. - 2 Bac. Abr. 101.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-17\">I shall consider the 3d and 4th points together</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-18\">That the words of the charter, \u201c to sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded in courts of record,\u201d are not words of grant, and convey no exclusive privileges.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-19\">The power of suing and being sued are the incidents of every corporation, and belong to them as soon as created. \u2014 2 <em>Kent Com. </em>224; 1 <em>Blk. Com. </em>475.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-20\">This is fully recognized and laid down by the court in the case of <em>Freeholders Sussex </em>vs. <em>Strader, </em>3 <em>Harrison Rep. </em>117.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-21\">In this case, the court held these <em>words surplusage ; </em>and so in the case at bar, strike out these words, and the company have all their chartered rights.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-22\">These words are only affirmative of the common law; and necessarily imply no negative, and are not to be construed to take away any common-law right. And one of the common-law rights which belongs to the public is that of suing the in court having jurisdiction of the subject matter of the suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-23\">This principle is fully laid down by the court in the following cases: <em>Crittenden </em>vs. <em>Wilson, </em>5 <em>Cowen, </em>165.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-24\">The court, speaking of the statute in that case, says: \u201c The act is not couched in negative terms. The remedy which it prescribes is cumulative merely, and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>exclusive.\u201d So the words used ave only those implied, and not exclusive. \u2014 6 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>388 ; <em>Melody </em>vs. Reab, 4 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>472.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-5\">The words <em>may </em>or <em>slid!,, </em>when used in a statute, are <em>imperative only when the public interest requires. </em>\u2014 Malcomb vs. <em>Rogers, </em>5 <em>Cowen, </em>188.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-6\">This being a private corporation, the charter is not to be construed to take away any common-law right of others. This rule is laid down in <em>Coolidge </em>vs. <em>Williams, </em>4 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>143-44; <em>Sprague </em>vs. <em>Birdsall, </em>2 <em>Cowen Rep. </em>419.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-7\">In this case, the court says : \u201c In the construction of statutes made in favor o\u00ed' corporations or particular persons, and in derogation of common law right, care should be taken not to extend them beyond their express words or their clear im<em>port. </em>\u2014 Savage, <em>Ch. J.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-8\">Do the words in the charter clearly import that the public can only sue the Company in the Superior and Inferior Court, and that it can sue a citizen in those Courts for 85, and collect, $12 50 for costs ? Is such the clear meaning of the charter ? Would not such a construction be monstrous ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-9\">It is a maxim of the law, that an affirmative statute does not take away a common-law right. \u2014 6 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>376.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-10\">Statutes are to ho construed in reference to the common law. \u2014 1 <em>Kent Com. </em>433. In <em>Wilbur </em>vs. <em>Crane. </em>\u2014 13 <em>Pick. </em>290.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-11\">Tiiis court, speaking of the construction of a statute, says : \u201c The rules of the common law are not to he changed by doubtful construction.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-12\">In the construction of statutes, this court has adopted the rule lam contending for in the case of <em>Doe ex dem. Truluck et al. </em>vs. <em>Peeples et al. (Ante, </em>1 <em>to </em>6.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-13\">But the statutes of 1840 and 1843 are remedial statutes, and relate entirely <em>to </em>the remedy of the public against railroad companies for stock killed upon their roads.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-14\">And a statute, changing the remedy, unless by the burthens imposed it renders the remedy useless, is not a violation of the Constitution of the United States, as it impairs no contract. What portion of the charter is violated by those statutes <em>? </em>\u2014can the court put its finger upon it ? The statute permits the corporation to be sued, so does the charier, and the statute of 1843 permits suit where the damages are less than 830, in a Justice\u2019s Court in the district where the president resides. What words of the statute prohibit this, and what <em>rigid </em>is taken away by this <em>statute ? </em>\u2014 Charles <em>River Bridge </em>vs. <em>The Warren Bridge, </em>11 <em>Peters, </em>pp. 544, 545, 546; <em>Satteries </em>vs. Matthewson, 2 <em>Peters, 411, 412, </em>413; <em>Bronson </em>vs. <em>McKinzie, </em>1 <em>How. </em>315 ; <em>and see Justice M\u2019Lean\u2019s opinion, </em>325, 328, 332 ; <em>Story on the Constitution, </em>vol. 3 pages 250, 351, sec. 1379.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-15\">But, in cases of doubt, the court should always hold the law constitutional.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-16\">The presumptions are always in its favor, and it should never he set aside, unless in cases entirely free from doubt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-17\">This is a rational rule ; for the Legislature enacts the laws under an oath to support the constitution, and the great object of the veto power in the executive is to preserve the constitution from violation by hasty legislation, and he sanctions the laws under a like oatli to support the constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-18\">The following cases fully support the <em>principle. </em>\u2014 Cooper vs. <em>Telfair, 4 Dallas' Rep. </em>14 ; (1 <em>Cond. Rep. </em>211.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-19\">In this case, Washington, Justice says : \u201cThe presumption, indeed, must always he in favor of the validity of the Jaws, if the contrary is not clearly demonstrated.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-20\">Can any one say that it is clearly demonstrated in the charter that the corporation cannot be sued many court having jurisdiction of the subject matter of suit ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-21\">A ad in the same case Patterson, J. says: \u201cTo authorize this court, (the Supreme Court of the U. S.) to pronounce a law void, it must be a clear and unequivocal breach of the Constitution, not a doubtful argumentative implication.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-22\">What language can better suit this case ? To declare the act of 1843 void, would be a doubtful implication.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-23\">Inow submit to the court whether 1 have not shown, by authority which this court will recognise and sanction,</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-24\">1st. That theJustices\u2019 Courts of this State are inferior courts of record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>2d. That the words \u201c sue and be sued, &amp;c, in courts of record,\u201d in the charter of the defendant, are not words of grant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-5\">3d. That they are merely affirmative of the common law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-6\">4th. That the acts of 1840 and 1843, defining the liability of railroad companies, are remedial and constitutional.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-7\">lastly, presumption always a law, and that the plaintiff is entitled to the judgment of this court, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court of Chatham county, and dismissing the certiorari granted by that court in this case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b200-8\">Robert M. Charlton, representing Cohen, for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b200-9\">\n<em>By the Court</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"Ayn\">Warner, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">The plaintiff instituted his action in the Justices\u2019 Court, to recover damages from the defendants for killing his stock with their railroad cars. It appears from the record in this case, the stock was killed before the passage of the act of 1843. Before the passage of the statute of 1843, Justices of the peace had no jurisdiction to try cases sounding in damages, for any trespass on the person or property of the <em>plaintiff. </em>\u2014 Prin. <em>Dig-</em>432-3. The act of 1843 was intended to operate prospectively, as is apparent from its terms ; and to give parties injured, the right to sue in justices\u2019 courts for damages done their stock by the railroad companies <em>subsequent </em>to its passage. The stock of the plaintiff in this case having been killed <em>before </em>the enactment of this latter statute, the justice\u2019s court had no jurisdiction to maintain the suits against the defendants to recover damages therefor ; consequently we are of the opinion the judgment of court below should be affirmed on that ground. This view of the question renders it unnecessary for us to express any opinion as to the other grounds taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">Let the judgment of the court below be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
