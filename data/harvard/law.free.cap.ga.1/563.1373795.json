Then the further question was propounded : \u201c Have you any prejudice or bias resting on your mind for or against the prisoner at the bar?\u201d Which the juror also answered in the negative. Whereupon said juror was offered on the part of the State as competent, when the counsel for the prisoner, with a view further to test his competency, required that he should be asked the further question, whether \u201c he had formed and expressed any opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the prisoner ?\u201d so as to ascertain whether <em>the </em>said juror had formed and expressed any opinion in regard to the prisoner\u2019s guilt or innocence from report or otherwise, which was objected to on the part of the State, and the objection sustained by the court. A jury of twelve was at length empanneled and sworn, to try said cause, upon the plea of \u201cnot guilty,\u201d whose qualification and competency were ascertained in the above manner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-5\">Witnesses were then introduced in behalf of the State, who, among other things, proved that the boy George, with Edy, his mother, and several other slaves, was sold at Sheriff\u2019s .sale, as the property of the prisoner, and' the boy George and bis mother Edy, and some others, were purchased at said sale, by the prosecutor, in the year 1842, and that George was worth about $500. The boy was missing from the prosecutor\u2019s plantation about the first of March, 1846. That George was one of the negroes in controversy,, in a suit pending in Baldwin Superior Court between Harper Tucker and the prosecutor, and that he had been levied on, after the prosecutor\u2019s purchase of him, by a mortgage^./\u00bb. in favor of said Tucker. As to the portion of the testimony on the part of the State, from which it is supposed the jury inferred the prisoner\u2019s guilt, there having been no objection to its admission, it is deemed unnecessary to state it here. The testimony in behalf of the State having been closed, the prisoner\u2019s counsel'proposed to prove, that when the boy George was sold by the sheriff, he was sold subject to the Mortgage of said Harp'er Tucker, for the purpose of showing that the property in said boy was not in the prosecutor, but in the prisoner, which the court refused to allow, on the ground that whatever title was in the prisoner when the boy was sold, passed to the prosecutor by that sale, as much so as if the prisoner had himself made the sale ; and that it was not necessary that the prosecutor should have the absolute and entire property in the negro, to maintain the allegation in the indictment that the negro was his property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-6\">It was then proven, on the part of the prisoner, by one Searcy, that prosecutor\u2019s son went for him to go with his dogs and catch two boys, Edward and the said George, that had run away from the prosecutor. Witness went and drove for them, and caught the boy Edward, and struck another track, and pursued it to the river, and down the river some distance. This was a day or two after the boy was missing. Witness did not see the place where the boy went into the river. A few days after-wards, the prosecutor sent for witness, requesting him to go and search for George. Witness went, but did not strike any track, and returned home. The counsel for the prisoner then offered to prove the admission of prosecutor, that the boy George, in all <em>likelihood, was </em>drowned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>in tho river at the time the bay Edward was caught, which being objected to, was repelled by the court, and the counsel were not permitted to put tho question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-4\">Tho counsel for prisoner then offered tho mortgage <em>ft. fa. </em>in favor of Harper Tucker against the prisoner, which was levied, on the boy George after the purchase of him by the prosecutor, with the levy and entry of \u201c claim\u201d by said prosecutor thereon, for the purpose of showing that the property in the boy George, at the time of the alleged larceny, was in the sheriff and not in the prosecutor, and thereby to disprove the allegation that he was the properly of the prosecutor; which was repelled by the court upon the ground that the mere levy of the <em>Ji.fa., </em>without an actual sale under it, did not of itself divest the title acquired by the prosecutor, and the fact of such levy, if true, did not of itself counteract or negative the charge in the indictment, that the said negro George was the property of the prosecutor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-5\">The counsel for the prisoner then tendered in evidence a paper for the purpose of negativing the ownership of the prisoner, which, it was stated to the court by\u2019counsel, showed that a claim had been interposed by the prosecutor to the boy George when levied on by the mortgage <em>ft. fa., </em>and that said claim had been withdrawn, and also the forth-coming bond of the prosecutor, by which ho had the possession of said negro George at the time of the alleged larceny, which was rejected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-6\">The counsel for the prisoner then offered in evidence a paper, which, they stated to the court, was a bill in equity filed by the prosecutor and Donald M\u2019Donald, tho purchasers at sheriff\u2019s sale of tho mortgaged property, against said Harper Tucker, also a purchaser of another portion of the mortgaged property, for the purpose of compelling contribution between all the purchasers of the mortgaged property to the discharge of the mortgage, and enjoining said levy, the said bill being tendered to disprove the fact of property in the prosecutor. Which was rejected by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-7\">To all which decisions of the court below the counsel for the prisoner excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-8\">For the assignment of errors, see the decision of tho Supreme Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b589-9\">Kenan &amp; Rockwell, counsel for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b589-10\">Mr. Rockwell argued as follows :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-11\">Trial is the investigation of the matter of fact in issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-12\">The question presented by this record is two-fold. First, as to the inode o\u00ed examination. Second, as to tho facts necessary to be examined.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-13\">The mode of examination of a matter of fact by a jury, involves the manner of empanneling that jury; for if the constituent members thereof be not such as the law regards fully competent to determine the issues before them, the jury is defective, and the result of the examination is void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-14\">The grounds of challenge to the polls are ranged under four principal heads by Sir Edward Coke; the third of which, <em>\u201cpropter affectum,\u201d </em>is the one alleged in the assignment of errors to have been denied the prisoner by the court below, in determining the competency of the juror in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-15\">This challenge is of two sorts: either working a principal challenge, or to the favor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-16\">A principal challenge is, where there is express favor, or express malice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>^The rule of law is, \u201c that a juror must stand indifferent as he stands un<em>sworn.\u201d </em>\u2014 Co. <em>Litt. </em>157, <em>b. \u201c Omni excepfione major.\"</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-5\">\u2019 In an old case (1 <em>Bulat. </em>20, cited in <em>Joy on Jurors, </em>169,) upon a trial at bar, a juror was challenged that he had said to one of the parties, \u201c Provide to pay, for if I am sworn I shall give my verdict against you he was found not' to be indifferent and was withdrawn.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-6\">The older authorities in the English books seem to recognize the doctrine, that if a juror had formed or expressed his opinion <em>from his knowledge of the cause, </em>such an expression of opinion was not incompatible with his legal indifferency; but if such opinion was expressed <em>without </em>any knowledge of the cause, it was considered as springing from ill-will,or favor, and the juror was adjudged incompetent. Modem cases in the United Stales, professedly based on the common law, have much expanded the doctrine.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-7\">Although the doctrine, in its limited or more liberal application, will equally support the positions assumed in this record, it may not be amiss to consider the earlier decisions upon this question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-8\">Fitzherbert <em>(Chall. </em>22) reports the charge of Babington, J.,' to the triers in an old case, thus: \u201c If he will pass for one party, whether the matter be true or false, he is favorable. So if he has said he will pass for one party, if it be for affection he hath to the person and not for the truth of the matter, he is favorable; but if it be for the truth of the matter that he has knowledge of it, he is not favorable.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-9\">In the Year Books, (7 <em>Hen. </em>6. <em>fol. </em>25,) the charge of the same judge to the triers, upon a challenge <em>\u201cpropter affectum\" </em>taken in a replevin suit, is given thus: \u201c You will inquire on your oaths, whether the cause be for partiality or affection <em>{pour </em>l\u2019affection) that he has to the party, or for the knowledge he has of the matter in issue. If the cause is partiality for the party, then he is favorable; otherwise, not: and if he has more affection to one than to the other. But if he has a <em>full knowledge </em>of the matter in issue, and if he \u2019be sworn he will speak the truth, notwithstanding the affection he hath for the party, then he is not favorable.\u201d\u2014 <em>Joy on Jurors, </em>203.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-10\">This appears to have been the earlier doctrine on this subject, and although in part overruled by subsequent decisions, was recognized in the case of the <em>King </em>vs. <em>Edmunds, </em>reported in 4 <em>Barn, </em>and <em>Aid. </em>472, which was decided in Easter Term, 1821.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-11\">ii&amp;In the case of the <em>King </em>vs. <em>Edmunds, </em>Abbot, C. J., seems to have been of the opinion, that the declaration of a juror was not a good cause of challenge, unless it be made in terms, or under circumstances, denoting an ill intention towards the party challenging; and cites <em>Hawk. b. </em>2, <em>ch. </em>42, <em>sec. </em>28, in support of the opinion. A reference to the authority, however, fails to support the decision to the extent stated. Considering the other questions presented in the case of the <em>King </em>vs. <em>Edmunds, </em>it decides, in effect, that you may not prove by the juror himself, his hostility to the party challenging; admitting, however, that such hostility if proved by other evidence, is a good ground of challenge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-12\">The doctrine laid down by Babington, J.,in the cases above quoted, underwent some modification in later times. Brook lays down the rule, that it is a good cause of challenge that a juryman has reported, if he be empanneled, he will pass for the plaintiff \u2014 citing 21 <em>Hen. </em>7, 29 ; <em>(Chall, pl. 90.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-13\">In the case of <em>Peter Cooke, </em>tried for high-treason, reported 13 <em>St. T. </em>334, <em>it </em>was held not competent to prove by the juror himself'anything which tended <em>to </em>his <em>dishonor; </em>and Treby, C. J., seemed to consider it a dishonorable thing to express <em>ill-will </em>towards a person accused of crime in regard to the matter of his accusation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-14\">In all these cases the question asked of the juror was, directly, if he had not expressed his opinion <em>adversely </em>to the prisoner. But the question sought to bs propounded in the court below to the juror in this case, might have been answered in the affirmative, without at all compromising the juror. Indeed, it seems to have been framed to avoid the perpetually embarrassing investigation, how far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>you might examine a juror on his \u201c <em>voire dire\u201d </em>without exposing him to <em>discredit: </em>he might have expressed an opinion as to the \u201cguilt or innocence\u201d of the person, without any feeling of ill-wili, yet he might not, nevertheless, <em>have stood indifferent.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-5\">Admitting, for the sake of argument, that you may not prove the juror\u2019s <em>ill-will </em>to the party challenging, by the juror himself, it is by no means clear that it was necessary according to the common law. Indeed, there is strong reason to believe otherwise. The ingredient of <em>ill-will, </em>superadded to the opinion formed, never was engrafted on the common law of England. It is expressly enacted in 25 <em>Edw. 3, c. 3, </em>which, Hawkins says, (vol. 2, c. 43, sec. 27) seems to be made in affirmance of the common law, \u2018\u2018that no indicto'r shall be put on inquests upon deliverance of the indictees of felonies, or trespass, if he be challenged for that same cause by him which is so <em>indicted.\u201d </em>\u2014 Schley\u2019s <em>Dig. </em>124. This statute may have been necessary, because of the application of the principle that the juror\u2019s knowledge of the cause would not render him incompetent; yet Breton, who wrote in the time of Edward 1, asserts that a defendant may challenge a juror <em>because he was one of those who indicted him.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-6\">It is undeniably true, that the common law required a juror should stand impartial and indifferent between the parties; he should be without prejudice or bias for or against either; and jurors are examined as to this point without objection; nor has the question ever been considered in the least degree reflecting on their honor. But can a juror bo deemed impartial or Indifferent, who comes to the decision of the matter <em>in issue with his opinion </em>already <em>formed; and, </em>as far as he is concerned, his verdict already declared ? If the trial by jury be the investigation of the matter in issue by twelve men whose opinions thereon are known and expressed before the investigation is commenced, then is this boasted bulwark of liberty worse than a mockery and a farce. The rules of the common law seem to require that a juror, to be competent to sit in a cause, should not have formed an opinion thereon, and most undoubtedly that such opinion should not have been expressed. Whenever such has been ascertained to be the fact., it has been repeatedly adjudged a ground of <em>principal challenge. </em>\u2014 Trials <em>per pais, </em>222, 228; <em>Joy on Jurors, </em>166 ; 7 Cowen, 128. in <em>the </em>court below, the prisoner was precluded from showing <em>the </em>existence of this fact, and restricted within the limitation that the opinion, if formed and expressed, should be biised on <em>his knowledge of the cause, </em>derived from having seen the crime committed, or having heard the evidence on oath.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-7\">The courts in modern times, and particularly in this country, have gone farther iban the courts of England to ensure the requisite impartiality and indififcrency of jurors. It has been ruled in accordance with the common-law right of challenge, that it is not necessary for the juror to hav&lt;/a fixed and definite opinion upon the matter in issue: it ma.y be hypothetical; and this will constitute a ground of challenge, either principal, or to the favor, according to the circumstances under which it is expressed. \u2014 2 <em>Dev. &amp; Batt. </em>196, 224; 11 <em>Leigh, </em>667; 14 <em>Wendell, </em>131; 7 <em>Monroe, R.

So in Knapp\u2019s case, 9 <em>Pick. </em>499. So in Polly Bodine\u2019s case, 1 <em>Denio, R. </em>301.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-9\">The challenge <em>\u201cpropter affectum,\u201d </em>must he considered beyond all question as existing in Georgia as lateas the 14th May, 1776, was not repealed at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, and consequently secured to the citizens by the terms of that instrument.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-10\">The mode of trying a challenge \u201c <em>propter affectum \u201d </em>was fixed by the Penal Code of 1833. \u2014 14 <em>Div. </em>sec. 48. \u201c On all trials for crimes or offences on the crimina! side of the court, where the punishment is death, or imprisonment and labor in the Penitentiary, any juror may be put on his <em>voire dire, </em>and the following question shall be propounded to him, viz: \u201c Have you formed and expressed any opinion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>regard to the guilt or innocence of the prisoner at the bar ?\u201d If the juror shallan , swer in the negative, then the following question shall be propounded to him \u201c Have you any prejudice or bias resting on your mind either for or against tb prisoner at the bar ?\u201d And if the juror shall so answer these questions as to malt him a competent juror, the State or the prisoner may nevertheless have the right 1 put such juror upon his trial in the manner pointed out by law, and to prove sue juror incompetent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-5\">This mode of ascertaining the incompetency of a juror was altered by an ai of the Legislature passed in the year 1843, <em>(Cobb\u2019s Analysis, </em>329,) which repeale the above section, and substituted in lieu of the first question the following, viz \u201c Have you, from having seen the crime committed, or heard any part of the ev dence delivered on oath, formed and expressed any opinion of the guilt or inne cence of the prisoner at the bar ?\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-6\">It is material to observe, this last statute has restricted the expression of opinio by the juror to liis <em>absolute knowledge </em>of the matter in issue. The authoritic already cited establish a juror\u2019s knowledge of the matter in issue did not by tl common law disqualify him from sitting in the cause, nor did itconstitute agroun of challenge, either principal, or to the favor. If a juror had given a verdict b( fore in the same cause, or upon the same matter between other parties, though good cause of challenge, it could not be proved by the juror himself, <em>but by the n cord. </em>\u2014 Joy <em>on Jurors.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-7\">The conclusions are deemed just, from a review of the authorities:</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-8\">1st. That if a juror has formed and expressed any opinion upon the matter i issue, it is a good ground of challenge \u201c <em>propter affectum,\u201d </em>according to the rule of the common Jaw, and may be either principal, or to the favor ; which may b proved by the juror himself when sworn on his \u201c <em>voire dire.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-9\">2d. That the first question required to be propounded by the act of 1843, if ai swered in the affirmative, will not elicit the proof that the juror may be subject t the challenge, \u201c <em>propter affectum,\u201d </em>either principal, or to the favor, and is so far restriction on the trial by jury as used in Georgia at the adoption of the Const tution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-10\">The second branch of the argument will be devoted to the consideration of <em>tl facts necessary to be examined.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-11\">The allegation in the indictment is in substance as follows : charging that tl prisoner \u201c with force and arms, a certain negro slave of the value of $500, the and there the property of Samuel Buffington, Sr., did steal, take and carry away.

If, however, the sheriff <em>legally </em>left the slave in the possession of the pros&lt; cutor, (as it is presumed in the absence of proof to the contrary,) the prosecute had no interest in the negro ; he was the mere servant of the sheriff, provided 1 had no claim to the property. \u2014 9 <em>Mass. </em>104, 112, 265.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>What claim did the prosecutor have to the property, as disclosed by tlio testimony which was sought to be introduced by the prisoner, but repelled by the court ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-5\">The prisoner sought to prove that when the said slave was purchased by the prosecutor, he was sold at sheriff\u2019s sale under the incumbrance of a mortgage executed by the prisoner to Harper Tucker.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-6\">This leads to the examination of the nature of the property o\u00ed a mortgagor of peisonal chattels in the things mortgaged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-7\"><em>A </em>mortgage of personal property vests the legal title to the thing mortgaged in the mortgagee or the assignee, and <em>he </em>may bring trover after condition broken. \u2014 1 <em>Hill, S.

R. </em>396,) involving the right of priority of payment secured to the United States by an act of Congress, Mr. Justice Washington holds this language : \u201cif, before a right of preference has accrued to the United States, the debtor has made a <em>bona fide </em>conveyance of his estate to a third person, <em>or has mortgaged, the same </em>to secure a debt, or if his property has been seized under a <em>ft. fa., the property is divested out of </em>the debtor, and cannot be made liable.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-11\">This doctrine is also maintained in the case of <em>Conard </em>vs. <em>the Atlantic Insurance Company. </em>\u2014 1 <em>Pet. R. </em>356. Mr. Justice Story in that case observes, \u201c Lt is true that in discussions in courts of equity a mortgage is sometimes called a lien for a debt. And so it certainly is, and something more; it is a transfer of the property itself as security for the debt. This must be admitted to be true at law, and it is equally true in equity, for equity follows the law. It does not consider the estate of the mortgagee as defeated and reduced to a mere lien, but it treats it as a trust estate, and according to the intention of the parties, as a qualified estate and security. When the debt is discharged, there is a resulting trust for the mortgagor. It is therefore only in a loose and general sense that it is sometimes called a lien, and then only by way of contrast to an estate absolute and indefeasible.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-12\">It thus appears, that a mortgage of personal property conveys the legal title to the mortgagee. That after default in the payment of the debt secured by the mortgage, the <em>property </em>of the mortgagee in the thing mortgaged is absolute, unless there be something in our law that modifies or alters the law as recognized in the other States of the Union. It is submitted that the act of 1830, <em>(Prin. Dig. </em>468,) recognizes and sustains the doctrines above asserted. It became then a material fact to ascertain if the property, when sold by the sheriff' at public sale, was encumbered by a mortgage, in order to lay the ground-work of the evidence which would prove a title out of the prosecutor, and in the mortgagee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-13\">The evidence was material in another point of view. It is alleged in the indictment that the slave was of the value of \u201c S500.\u201d Certainly it is requisite to prove the value of the property of the prosecutor in the thing stolen. If, therefore, by his purchase, the prosecutor acquired a qualified and special, not absolute, property, the value of that property must be proved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-14\">Goods pawned or gauged for a debt, or leased for years, cannot be taken in execution against a pawner or <em>lessor. </em>\u2014 Dalt. 146; <em>Watson on Sheriff's, </em>182. Subject to the right of the pawnee or lessee, the sheriff may sell the goods so pawned or leased. Such goods cannot, however, be seized, for the pawnee or lessee has no present right of <em>possession. </em>\u2014 Watson <em>on Sheriffs, </em>182; 8 <em>East R. </em>476; 5 <em>John. R. </em>336. Both of which cases recognize the doctrine thaL an <em>equitable </em>interest is not a subject of <em>seizure </em>and sale by the sheriff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-15\">The_/i./ti. issued on the foreclosure of the mortgage was also offered in evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>and rejected by the court. This document contained the entry of the sheriff that he had levied on the negro slave, the subject of the alleged larceny, as the property of the prisoner. It was material to prove a default in the payment of the money secured by the mortgage; because, on such default, the title of the mortgagee became absolute, and the property of the mortgagor in the slave, which was purchased by the prosecutor at the sale, was absolutely determined. The entries on <em>the ft. fa. </em>established two other facts material to the defence: First, That the slave was in the legal possession of the sheriff, and upon a claim having been interposed, might have been left lawfully with the prosecutor as claimant. Second. That the claim had been withdrawn, and of course the possession of the slave reverted to the sheriff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-5\">When a sheriff h\u00e1s duly seized goods under a writ of <em>fieri facias, he </em>has such a <em>special properly </em>in them as to enable him to maintain trespass or trovei against any person who may take them out of his possession. \u2014 2 <em>Saunders R. </em>47; 1 <em>Vent. R. </em>52; <em>Watson on Sheriffs, </em>191. It is not perceived how a conviction on this indictment would bar an indictment against the same party, alleging the property to be in the sheriff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-6\">The fourth ground assigned for error is, that the court erred in rejecting the mortgage <em>Ji.fa. </em>because the entries thereon proved that the prosecutor was not entitled even to the.legal possession of the slave.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-7\">It seems, that an action of trover, or even of trespass, brought by the prosecutor against any person who should take the slave out of his possession, could not be maintained. A person cannot sue in trespass, if he be a <em>mere servant. Owen, </em>52 3 <em>Inst. </em>103; 2 <em>Saund. </em>47, <em>b, c, d, </em>cited 2 <em>Saund. on Plead. and Ev. </em>861. The conelusion is therefore warranted, that the evidence which was rejected by the cour was material to disprove the allegation in the indictment that the slave, the subjec of the alleged larceny, \u201c was the property \u201d of the prosecutor, and of the value o $500.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-8\">The examination, therefore, of the matters in fact in issue, was not conductei according to the rules of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-9\">1st.

Com. </em>362 ; ) but how the prisoner was deprived of that right, by the refusal of the court to permit him to show such cause of challenge by the juror himself, under the provisions of our penal code, as now amended by the act of 1843, is not so clearly apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The act of 1843 repealed that portion of the act of 1833, which permitted the question to be asked the juror on his <em>voire dire, </em>if he had formed and expressed any opinion in regard to the guilt or innocence of the prisoner at the bar ; so that the prisoner had no right to show such cause of challenge by the juror himself, as the court below, in <em>our judgment very properly ruled.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">It is true, the act of 1843 prescribes certain questions to be propounded to the juror, but it also provides, if he shall answer them in the <em>negative, </em>\u201cthe State, or the prisoner, may have the right to put such juror on his trial, in the manner pointed out hy law, and <em>prove such juror incompetent.\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">The record in this case shows, the juror answered the questions, required by the act of 1843, in the <em>negative ; </em>then it was the privilege of the prisoner to have asked the court for the appointment of triers, for the purpose of showing the juror was incompetent, which does not appear to have been done. The act of 1843 does not take away the right to challenge a juror <em>\u201cpropter </em>affectum,\u201d but only prescribes the <em>manner </em>in which that right shall he exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">The counsel proposed to show cause of challenge, \u201c <em>propter affectum,\" </em>by the juror himself, but the court very properly decided ho could not do so, as the act of 1843 requires triers to be appointed, and the cause of challenge to be shown before them ; either principal cause of challenge, or challenge to the favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">It does not follow because the court refused the prisoner the right to show caitse of challenge, <em>\u201cpropter </em>affectum,\u201d by the juror himself, the right of such challenge was denied him altogether, for it does not appear ho applied to the court for the appointment of triors.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">By the common law, the principal cause of challenge was tried by the court, and challenges to the favor only, were tried hy triers, appointed by the court. \u20145 <em>Bacon's Ab. </em>366.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-13\">The act of 1843, however, seemed to contemplate when the juror shall answer the questions required to he propounded by it, so as to make Mm <em>prima facie </em>competent, all further investigation, as to causes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>challenge, either principal or to the favor, shall be submitted to triers, and be determined by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The second ground of error assigned is, that the court \u201c repelled \u2022evidence, that at the time of the purchase of the negro slave, (the subject of the alleged larceny,) at, sheriff\u2019s sale, by Samuel Buffington, sen., (the prosecutor,) the same was sold under the encumbrance of a mortgage) because such testimony ascertained the fact that the property acquired in and to said negro, by the prosecutor, under said purchase, was not absolute, but limited and special, and the prisoner would.be at liberty to show in his defence, not only the value ol Such special property, but that the same was determined to disprove the allegations in the indictment, <em>that said slave was the property oj Samuel Buffington, Sr., and of the value of five hundred dollars.-\u2019\u2019</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The third ground of error assigned by the plaintiff is, that \u201c the court erred, in not admitting the mortgage <em>fi. </em>/a., bill, and accompanying papers \u2014 among them the original mortgage, with the decree of foreclosure\u2014 when tendered in evidence on the part of the prisoner ; because they went to prove that the equity of redemption in and to said slave was barred and foreclosed; and the entry by the sheriff thereon proved., that at the time of the alleged larceny, the said prosecutor had no property whatever in said negro, and that he was not entitled even to the legal possession of said negro.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">The fourth ground of error assigned upon, the record is, that \u201cthe court erred in refusing to 'admit the mortgage <em>fi. fa. </em>in evidence, when offered on the part of the prisoner,because the entries thereon established the fact, that the negro slave, the subject of the alleged larceny, had been levied on as the property of the prisoner, and a claim had been interposed by the prosecutor, which said claim being withdrawn, and the levy yet undisposed of, negatived the allegation in the instrument., that said slave was the property of the prosecutor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">It appears the slave George was mortgaged by the prisoner tc Tucker. Afterwards, the slave was levied upon by virtue of an execution, issued upon a judgment obtained against the. prisoner, which war of later date than the mortgage, and sold at sheriff\u2019s sale as the proerty of prisoner, and purchased by the prosecutor, subject to the encumbrance of'said mortgage, who acquired by such purchase, all the title which remained in the prisoner to said negro'; and when he paid, the debt to Tucker, which the mortgage was given to secure, there if, nothing which appears on the record, going to show that his title to the; slave would not have been good against everybody.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">The counsel for the plaintiff in error <em>assumes </em>the ground, and makes i , the basis of his argument, that the legal title to the slave was in Tucker, the mortgagee, after condition broken. This court has already decide;, that by our law of mortgage, the title to the mortgaged property remains in the mortgagor until foreclosure and sale thereof, in the manner pointec out by statute ; that a mortgage is a security for the debt. The lega, title to the slave enjoyed by the prisoner was divested by the sheriff\u2019;; sale, and passed to the prosecutor, who was the purchaser, and who tbur. acquired the possession of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">It is true, before the title of the prosecutor to the negro was perfect as against Tucker\u2019s mortgage, he would be bound to discharge the <em>debt, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>which the mortgage was given to secure; to raise the encumbrance created by the mortgage ; but with that the prisoner had nothing to do ; <em>his title </em>to the negro was sold by the sheriff, and purchased by the prosecutor, who had something more than <em>a </em>mere <em>special property </em>in the negro as against the prisoner. But if the prosecutor had only a <em>special property </em>in the negro, coupled with the <em>lawful </em>possession, it would be sufficient to maintain the allegation in the <em>indictment. </em>\u2014 Packard's case, <em>2d East Pleas </em>Crown, 653; 1 Leach, 357; Roscoe\u2019s <em>Crim. Ev. </em>515.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">It tvas urged that the value of the slave was material, that it might appear whether the offence was grand or petit larceny. The 20lh section of the 6th division of our penal code declares, \u201c The stealing of a slave is <em>simple </em>larceny. <em>\u201d </em>\u2014 Prin. <em>Dig. </em>630.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">We do not think, therefore, that the mortgage <em>fi.fa. </em>and the accompanying papers offered in evidence by the prisoner, would have proved, as is assumed by his counsel in the third assignment of error, \u201c that at the time of the alleged larceny, the prosecutor had <em>no property whatever </em>in the negro, and that he was not entitled even to the <em>legal possession </em>of said negro;\u201d but on the contrary, are of the opinion the court below decided correctly in rejecting the testimony, for the reason, the prosecutor had such a legal possession of the <em>property </em>under <em>his </em>purchase at sheriff\u2019s sale of the defendant\u2019s title thereto, as in judgment of law was sufficient to maintain the allegation in the indictment; and the proffered evidence would not negative the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">We are also of the opinion, the fact that the negro had been levied on by the mortgage <em>fi.fa. </em>in satisfaction of the mortgage debt, and claimed by the prosecutor, which claim had been dismissed, did not, in a legal point of view, negative the allegation in the indictment, that the slave was the property of the prosecutor. The prosecutor was the purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale, as we have already seen, and obtained the <em>lawful </em>possession of the negro under such purchase, from the sheriff; and when levied on to satisfy the mortgage debt, he claimed him as his property, giving bond and security for the forthcoming of the ne,gro at the day of sale, or when called for by the sheriff. Although the levy was dismissed, yet the prosecutor, as the claimant, was entitled to the possession of the negro for the purpose of surrendering him to the sheriff, in discharge of his bond; and depriving him of that possession, thus lawfully acquired, by the defendant, was wrongful and fraudulent, in the eye of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">From the best consideration we have been enabled to give to this case, we are of the opinion that there is no error in the record, and that the judgment of the court below must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
