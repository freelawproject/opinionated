The counsel for the plaintiff objected to the competency .of the witness, on the ground of his being the principal in said note, and therefore liable- to the defendants for the costs of the suit, and interested in preventing a recovery: Which objection was overruled by the court, and the. witness was admitted and sworn: To this decision the plaintiffs in error excepted; and assigned for error that the court erred in admitting said witness, he being interested, to the extent of the costs, in behalf of the defendants, by whom he had been introduced, and had not been released by them from said liability.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b282-11\">, John P.

Pearce was not sued in this action. The defendants relied on the plea of usury as their defence, and at the trial, offered Wiley Pearce, the principal maker of the note, as a witness to prove the usury. An obje 'lion was made to the competency of his testimony, on the ground he was interested in the event of the suit, which objection was overruled by the court, and the witness examined : and the. only question presented for our consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>is, the <em>competency </em>of the witness. \u2014 We are of the opinion the witness was incompetent for the defendants, without a release as to the costs of the suit, they being his sureties only. \u2014 1 <em>Greenleaf\u2019s Ev. </em>465, section 395; <em>Townsend vs. </em>Downing, 14 <em>East, </em>565; 2 <em>Greenleaf\u2019s Ev. </em>167, section 203; <em>Hubbly vs. Brown, </em>16 <em>John.
