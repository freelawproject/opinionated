Mantz and John A. Cameron, administrators of James Leverich, deceased, and others, their securities, alleging a <em>joint devastavit </em>by both of the administrators, and was brought by the defendants in error, for the use of Luther Roll, in the Superior court of the county of Richmond, and came up for trial before Judge Gamble, at the January Term, 1846. The defendants in error set forth as their cause of action, two several judgments, one of which had been recovered against Mantz alone, and the other against both of the administrators jointly, upon causes of action existing against their intestate, at the time of his death, from which judgments writs of <em>fieri facias </em>had been issued, and returned \u201c <em>nulla </em>bonad Upon the trial, the records of these respective recoveries were given in evidence, to prove a devastavit by the administrators, so as to charge them and their securities <em>de bonis propriis.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-9\">Under this state of facts, the plaintiff in error, Cameron, by his counsel, contended that neither he nor the other defendants were liable in this action for the amount of the judgment against Mantz alone, as administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-10\">The Judge of the Court below charged the jury that the defendants below (Cameron and the securities), were liable for the amount of said judgment, and a verdict was rendered accordingly.

Those assets are not to be found by the sheriff. The administrator then, and his sureties, are liable on the bond. If we cannot recover against all, we can recover against none. The rule contended for would make administrators\u2019 bonds valueless; for the absence of one from the State, so that he could not be served with process in an original suit, would prevent all remedy against the other, or the sureties.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\n<em>By the Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">This action was instituted, upon an administrator\u2019s bond, against Philip Mantz and John A. Cameron, administrators of James Leverich deceased, and their securities, alleging a <em>joint devastavit </em>by the administrators. To prove such <em>joint devastavit, </em>a judgment was offered in evidence, and admitted in the court below, obtained against Mantz <em>alone, </em>as the administrator of Leverich, together with an execution which issued thereon, and a return of <em>nulla bona, </em>by the sheriff. The error assigned is, that the court below held this judgment against Mantz <em>alone </em>was evidence to authorize a recovery against both defendants and their securities, on their administration bond, for the amount of the judgment. The plaintiffs allege a <em>joint devastavit </em>against both administrators. Does a judgment against <em>one </em>of them establish the affirmative of the issue ? We think not. The allegation is, that the defendants as administrators wasted and eloigned the assets of Leverich. The evidence is, that Mantz wasted and eloigned such portion thereof as came into his hands; but one executor, or administrator, is not liable for the <em>devastavit </em>of his co-executor, or administrator, unless he has contributed, in some way, to the <em>devastavit </em>of his <em>companion. </em>\u2014 Toller\u2019s <em>law of Executors, </em>430; <em>Douglass vs. Satterlee, </em>11 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>16. It was contended in behalf of the defendants in error, that in the eye of the law, co-executors and administrators are considered as but one person. This position is a correct one for many purposes, and the acts of one will be considered the acts of all, in reference to the administration of the assets; but we think it is well established, both by reason and authority, one co-exccutor, or administrator, cannot be made chargeable with the <em>devastavit </em>of his companions, when he has not, in any manner, contributed thereto. It was also urged on the argument of this case, inasmuch as the suit was on the bond, and all the defendants parties to it, they were all sureties for each other, and the plaintiff was entitled to recover. The answer to this argument is, that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover on the bond, in the court below, until he first established a <em>devastavit </em>against the administrators, according to law \u2014 and having alleged a <em>joint devastavit </em>against both of them, in his declaration, he was bound to <em>prove </em>such joint devastavit on the trial, which he failed to do. The judgment against Mantz <em>alone, </em>with the return of <em>nulla bona </em>on the fi. fa. issued thereon, may have been sufficient evidence to charge Mantz with a <em>devastavit ; </em>but it certainly furnished no evidence of a <em>devastavit </em>by Cameron. The liability of the securities to an administrator\u2019s bond is not <em>pdmary, </em>it is an <em>ultimate </em>liability ; and the following cases decide, that suit cannot be maintained on the bond, until a <em>devastavit </em>has first been established against the administrator according to <em>law. </em>\u2014 Jones vs. <em>Anderson, A McCord\u2019s Rep. </em>113 ; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number><em>Braxton </em>vs. <em>Winslow, &amp;c., </em>1 <em>Washington\u2019s Virginia Rep. </em>31 ; <em>Call </em>vs. <em>Ruffin, </em>1 <em>Call\u2019s Rep. </em>333 ; <em>Gordon\u2019s Administrators </em>vs. <em>Frederick, </em>1 <em>Munford\u2019s Rep. </em>1; <em>Faulk </em>vs. <em>The Judge, of the County Court of Monroe, 2 Porter\u2019s Rep. </em>538.</p>\n<author id=\"Abk\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Warner, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b62-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Wo are therefore of the opinion, the court below committed error, in deciding the plaintiff below was entitled to recover the amount of the judgment rendered against Mantz alone.
