Bar Counsel charged McLaughlin with violating the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> during her representation of Doris Leedom.</p> <p id=\"b213-4\" pgmap=\"213(45) 214(20) 215(21)\">The AGC investigated after Paula McCabe, Ms. Leedom\u2019s daughter and power of attorney, filed a complaint. Bar Counsel alleged that McLaughlin violated the following: (1) Rule 1.3 (Diligence);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) Rule 1.4(a) and (b) (Communication);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (3) Rule 1.5(a) (Fees);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (4) Rule 1.15(a) and (e) (Safekeeping Property);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (5) Rule 8.1(a) and (b) (Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (6) Rule 8.4 (a), (c) and (d) (Misconduct);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and Maryland Code (1957, 2010 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article (\u201cBP\u201d) (Misuse of Trust Money).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b215-4\" pgmap=\"215\">We transmitted the matter to the Honorable Kevin J. Mahoney (\u201cthe hearing judge\u201d) of the Circuit Court for Har-ford County to hear the case. After trying and failing to serve McLaughlin, Bar Counsel served the Client Protection Fund of the Bar of Maryland pursuant to Maryland Rule 19-723(b). The Fund mailed the Petition to McLaughlin at three different addresses. When McLaughlin did not answer the Petition, Bar Counsel moved for an Order of Default under Maryland Rule 2-613(b), which the Circuit Court granted. McLaughlin was sent notice of the Default Order and served with Bar Counsel\u2019s discovery requests. McLaughlin never responded to Bar Counsel, nor sought to overturn the default.</p> <p id=\"b215-5\" pgmap=\"215\">McLaughlin did not appear at the Circuit Court hearing on March 20, 2017. The hearing judge concluded that because McLaughlin had defaulted, all requests for admissions in Bar Counsel\u2019s discovery requests were deemed admitted pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-424(b). The hearing judge issued Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, based on the admitted facts, in which he found by clear and convincing evidence that McLaughlin violated MLRPC 1.3, 1.4(a) and (b), 1.5(a), 1.15(a) and (e), 8.1(a) and (b), 8.4(a), (c), and (d), and BP \u00a7 10-306. He found multiple aggravating factors and no mitigating factors.</p> <p id=\"b216-3\" pgmap=\"216\">THE HEARING JUDGE\u2019S FINDINGS OF FACT</p> <p id=\"b216-4\" pgmap=\"216\">The hearing judge made the following findings of fact. McLaughlin was admitted to the Maryland Bar on June 15, 2004 and has substantial experience in the practice of law.</p> <p id=\"b216-5\" pgmap=\"216\">In 2011, Ms. Leedom, then age 86, and a resident of New York, retained McLaughlin to prepare estate planning documents. Ms. Leedom gave her son George Leedom (\u201cMr. Leedom\u201d) her power of attorney, and her daughter, Mrs. McCabe, was identified as his successor. When Ms. Leedom moved to Maryland in 2013, McLaughlin drafted a Maryland power of attorney for her, which named Mr. Leedom as her agent. In 2013, Ms. Leedom sold her New York home and gifted the proceeds, over $500,000, to Mr. Leedom. McLaughlin provided some advice regarding this gift. The hearing judge found that Mr. Leedom managed his mother\u2019s finances from 2011 to June 2014. At that time,</p> <blockquote id=\"b216-6\" pgmap=\"216\">Mr. Leedom entered a rehabilitation for substance abuse issues, and Mrs. McCabe notified [McLaughlin] .... However, [McLaughlin] did not advise Ms. Leedom of the risks of allowing Mr. Leedom to continue to serve as her power of attorney at any time after June 2014. In fact, [McLaughlin] did not communicate with Ms. Leedom at all in June 2014, and never discussed Mr. Leedom\u2019s substance abuse issues with Ms. Leedom.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b216-7\" pgmap=\"216\">On August 12, 2014, Ms. Leedom, with [McLaughlin\u2019s] assistance, sold two pieces of property located in Aberdeen, Maryland. The sale of the two properties resulted in net proceeds to Ms. Leedom of approximately $95,000.00. [McLaughlin] agreed to serve as an escrow agent, holding the proceeds of the sale in her Attorney Trust Account. Respondent was not to disburse the proceeds of the sale until [Mr.] Leedom and Mrs. McCabe agreed on the disposition of the funds.</blockquote> <p id=\"b216-8\" pgmap=\"216\">The hearing judge found that despite this agreement, McLaughlin disbursed $10,000 to Mr. Leedom in October 2014. McLaughlin did not notify Mrs. McCabe or obtain her consent to the disbursement.</p> <p id=\"b217-3\" pgmap=\"217\">In December 2014, Ms. Leedom executed a power of attorney, naming McLaughlin as her agent. The next month, McLaughlin \u201cpaid herself $5,175.00 from Ms. Leedom\u2019s funds held in her trust account without Mrs. McCabe\u2019s authorization or consent.\u201d McLaughlin did not provide invoices or billing statements to Ms. Leedom, or to Mr. Leedom when he had his mother\u2019s power of attorney.</p> <p id=\"b217-4\" pgmap=\"217\">Ms. Leedom executed another power of attorney in April 2015, naming Mrs. McCabe as her agent. Mrs, McCabe immediately sent McLaughlin a letter asking \u201cfor an accounting of and the return of her mother\u2019s funds.\u201d The hearing judge found that McLaughlin provided an accounting in May, \u201cbut refused to return the balance of Ms. Leedom\u2019s funds unless and until Mrs. McCabe signed a waiver releasing [McLaughlin] from any and all liability.\u201d He also found that Mrs. McCabe signed this release under duress.</p> <p id=\"b217-5\" pgmap=\"217\">In July 2015, Mrs. McCabe filed a complaint with the AGC. Bar Counsel sent McLaughlin a copy of the complaint and requested a written response. McLaughlin submitted a written response on September 18. The hearing judge found that McLaughlin made \u201cknowing and intentional misrepresentations to Bar Counsel\u201d in her response, specifically:</p> <blockquote id=\"A8Me\" pgmap=\"217(146) 218(50)\">[McLaughlin] stated that \u2018Doris Leedom ... was adamant that she did not want her daughter [Paula McCabe] involved. I had been told by [Mr.] Leedom on several occasions that his mother became very agitated and combative when Paula wanted to take her to a hair appointment or when her name came up. I witnessed this on several occasions in meetings just between Doris Leedom and myself.\u2019 [McLaughlin] also misrepresented to Bar Counsel that she was in frequent contact with [Mr.] Leedom, including in person meetings, in the fall of 2014. Additionally, [McLaughlin] misrepresented that she wrote a letter to Mrs. McCabe on May 15, 2015, when in fact she had not. [McLaughlin] also misrepresented that Mike McCabe, Paula McCabe\u2019s husband, \u2018[o]n more than one occasion ... said he did not want to deal with Paula or have her get involved and finally on May 8, 2015 said he was not getting involved with this and that he had told Paula he wanted nothing to do with her actions.\u2019 Finally, [McLaughlin] misrepresented that she \u2018explained on several occasions to Mrs. McCabe [that] there was never an [escrow] account in Doris Leedom\u2019s name.\u2019</blockquote> <p id=\"b218-4\" pgmap=\"218\">Bar Counsel sent a letter to McLaughlin dated November 13, 2015, which explained that the matter had been docketed for further investigation, enclosed additional correspondence from Mrs. McCabe, and requested a response. Bar Counsel sent a similar letter on January 11, 2016. McLaughlin received both of these letters, but never responded.</p> <p id=\"b218-5\" pgmap=\"218\">An AGC investigator interviewed McLaughlin in February 2016. McLaughlin told the investigator that she did not think she had to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s November 13 letter, and that she \u201cdid not recall\u201d receiving the January 11 letter. Bar Counsel sent McLaughlin additional copies of the previous correspondence through U.S. mail and e-mail. McLaughlin received, but did not respond to these communications.</p> <p id=\"b218-6\" pgmap=\"218\">THE HEARING JUDGE\u2019S CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</p> <p id=\"b218-7\" pgmap=\"218\">The hearing judge found that an evidentiary hearing was unnecessary because the Circuit Court had entered an Order of Default and McLaughlin had not moved to vacate the order. He found that the admitted facts were \u201csufficient by a clear and convincing standard\u201d to justify the court\u2019s conclusions of law that McLaughlin violated MLRPC 1.3, 1.4(a) and (b), 1.5(a), 1.15(a) and (e), 8.1(a) and (b), 8.4(a), (c), and (d), and BP \u00a7 10-306.</p> <p id=\"b218-8\" pgmap=\"218\">MLRPC 1.3: Diligence</p> <p id=\"b218-9\" pgmap=\"218\">The hearing judge concluded that McLaughlin violated Rule 1.3 when she \u201cfail[ed] to promptly advise her client, Doris Leedom, of the risks of continuing to have [Mr.] Leedom act as her power of attorney when [Mr.] Leedom was experiencing problems with substance abuse.\u201d This \u201cincreased the likelihood that her client would suffer adverse financial consequences.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b219-3\" pgmap=\"219\">MLRPC 1.4: Communication</p> <p id=\"b219-4\" pgmap=\"219\">The hearing judge found that McLaughlin violated 1.4(a) by failing \u201cto provide information, advice and counsel to her client regarding the propriety of having [Mr.] Leedom, who had known substance abuse issues, continue as her power of attorney.\u201d This omission left Ms. Leedom without \u201csufficient information to participate in making decisions regarding the representation.\u201d The hearing judge found that McLaughlin\u2019s failure \u201cto explain to [Ms.] Leedom in any manner, the risks of having [Mr.] Leedom continue as her power of attorney\u201d violated Rule 1.4(b) because she never explained the matter to permit her client to make an informed decision.</p> <p id=\"b219-5\" pgmap=\"219\">MLRPC 1.5(a): Fees</p> <p id=\"b219-6\" pgmap=\"219\">The hearing judge found that McLaughlin never provided an invoice or billing statement for the $5,175 fee to either her client or her power of attorney. She simply deducted the money from her IOLTA account, and the only justification for this fee was a notation: \u201cthrough 08/2014.\u201d The hearing judge found that \u201c[wjithout any basis to substantiate her charges in this case, [McLaughlin\u2019s] fee is unreasonable,\u201d and violated Rule 1.5(a).</p> <p id=\"b219-7\" pgmap=\"219\">MLRPC 1.15(a) and (e): Safekeeping Property</p> <p id=\"b219-8\" pgmap=\"219\">The hearing judge found that McLaughlin \u201cviolated ... Rule [1.15(a) ] when she failed to keep her own property, i.e., the $5,175 in fees she earned in August 2014, separate from [Ms.] Leedom\u2019s own property,\u201d because \u201cshe failed to withdraw the funds from the IOLTA account until January 24, 2015.\u201d The hearing judge found that McLaughlin violated Rule 1.15(e) \u201cby disbursing $10,000 to George Leedom in October 2014 without Mrs. McCabe\u2019s consent.... [and] when she disbursed $5,175.00 to herself for attorney\u2019s fees without Mrs. McCabe\u2019s consent.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b219-9\" pgmap=\"219\">MLRPC 8.1: Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters</p> <p id=\"b219-10\" pgmap=\"219(17) 220(30)\">The hearing judge concluded that McLaughlin violated Rule 8.1(a) when she repeatedly made false statements to Bar Counsel in her September 18, 2015 letter. The hearing judge found that McLaughlin violated Rule 8.1(b) because she received three requests for information from Bar Counsel and never responded.</p> <p id=\"b220-4\" pgmap=\"220\">MLRPC 8.4: Misconduct</p> <p id=\"b220-5\" pgmap=\"220\">The hearing judge determined that McLaughlin violated Rule 8.4(a) because she violated other Rules of Professional Conduct. The hearing judge concluded that McLaughlin\u2019s five misrepresentations to Bar Counsel in the September 18 letter violated Rule 8.4(c), which prohibits conduct involving dishonesty or misrepresentation.</p> <p id=\"b220-6\" pgmap=\"220\">The hearing judge found that McLaughlin\u2019s \u201cfailures to communicate with her client, failures to safeguard her client\u2019s funds, misrepresentations to [Bar Counsel], and failures to respond to [Bar Counsel\u2019s] lawful requests for information\u201d were \u201clikely to impair public confidence in the profession and impact the image of lawyers in the public eye.\u201d Such conduct was prejudicial to the administration of justice, and violated 8.4(d).</p> <p id=\"b220-7\" pgmap=\"220\">Business Occupations &amp; Professions \u00a7 10-306: Misuse of Trust Money</p> <p id=\"b220-8\" pgmap=\"220\">The hearing judge found that McLaughlin violated \u00a7 10-306 when she disbursed $10,000 to Mr. Leedom and $5,175 to herself contrary to the agreement that she would not disburse any proceeds from the sale of the Aberdeen properties until Mr. Leedom and Mrs. McCabe could agree on the disposition of the funds.</p> <p id=\"b220-9\" pgmap=\"220\">Aggravating and Mitigating Factors</p> <p id=\"b220-10\" pgmap=\"220(73) 221(67)\">Relying on Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Shuler, 443 Md. 494, 506-07, 117 A.3d 38 (2015), the hearing judge considered: (1) the rules McLaughlin violated; (2) her mental state; (3) the injury her misconduct caused, or could have caused; and (4) aggravating and mitigating factors. He found that McLaughlin had violated numerous Rules of Conduct and BP \u00a7 10-306. The hearing judge concluded that McLaughlin\u2019s mental state \u201cseem[ed] to be intentional and deliberate\u201d based on her September 18 letter. He found that Ms. Leedom lost $10,000 when McLaughlin released funds to Mr. Leedom without Mrs. McCabe\u2019s consent, and $5,175 when McLaughlin transferred the fee to herself without \u201cproper documentation that [she] had earned those fees.\u201d Ms. Leedom may have lost additional funds when McLaughlin failed to advise her client of the dangers of retaining Mr. Leedom as her power of attorney.</p> <p id=\"b221-4\" pgmap=\"221\">The hearing judge found multiple aggravating factors. He found that McLaughlin had violated multiple rules and BP \u00a7 10-306. She engaged in \u201cbad faith obstruction of the attorney discipline proceedings\u201d because she \u201cfailed to respond to [Bar Counsel\u2019s] last three letters.... failed to file an answer to the PDRA, which resulted in a default judgement being entered against her.... [and] she failed to respond to any of [Bar Counsel\u2019s] discovery requests.\u201d McLaughlin \u201csubmitted false statements, false evidence, and engaged in other deceptive practices\u201d by making multiple misrepresentations in her response to Bar Counsel. McLaughlin did not acknowledge the wrongful nature of her misconduct because she \u201cnever admitted that she violated any Rules of Professional Conduct.,.. [and] never apologized for her misconduct.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b221-5\" pgmap=\"221\">The hearing judge found that Ms. Leedom was a vulnerable victim because she was 89 years of age at the time the misconduct occurred. McLaughlin had substantial experience in the practice of law. McLaughlin was indifferent to making restitution or correcting her misconduct because she never refunded her fees, nor apologized. He also found that McLaughlin was likely to repeat her misconduct, because \u201cabsent recognition of and remorse for her wrongdoing, there is a substantial likelihood that she will repeat it.\u201d The hearing judge found that McLaughlin had no available mitigating factors because she had not provided any evidence, nor had she \u201cparticipated in any way during these proceedings .... \u201d</p> <p id=\"b221-6\" pgmap=\"221\">DISCUSSION</p> <p id=\"b221-7\" pgmap=\"221(17) 222(37)\">In proceedings before this Court, McLaughlin was limited to addressing sanctions because of the default entered against her. We issued a per curiam order disbarring McLaughlin on September 11, 2017. See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McLaughlin, 456 Md. 45, 169 A.3d 952, 2017 WL 3976468 (2017). We now explain the basis for that order.</p> <p id=\"b222-4\" pgmap=\"222\">Standard of Review</p> <p id=\"b222-5\" pgmap=\"222\">\u201cIn attorney discipline proceedings, this Court has original and complete jurisdiction and conducts an independent review of the record.\u201d Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McClain, 406 Md. 1, 17, 956 A.2d 135 (2008). The Court will accept the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Page, 430 Md. 602, 626, 62 A.3d 163 (2013). Both parties may file \u201cexceptions to the findings and conclusions of the hearing judge[.]\u201d Maryland Rule 19-728(b)(1). Because neither party filed an exception in this case, we choose to \u201ctreat the findings of fact as established.\u201d Md. Rule 19-741(b)(2)(A); see also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. De La Paz, 418 Md. 534, 552, 16 A.3d 181 (2011). We review the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law without deference, \u201ceven where default orders and judgments have been entered at the hearing level.\u201d Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Harrington, 367 Md. 36, 49, 785 A.2d 1260 (2001).</p> <p id=\"b222-6\" pgmap=\"222\">The Order of Default</p> <p id=\"b222-7\" pgmap=\"222\">The hearing judge entered an Order of Default under Md. Rules 2-613(b) and 19-724(c) because McLaughlin never filed a response to the Petition. He relied on Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Thomas, 440 Md. 523, 550-51, 103 A.3d 629 (2014), to conclude that \u201ca full-blown evidentiary hearing [wa]s not necessary.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b222-8\" pgmap=\"222\"> In Thomas, we explained:</p> <blockquote id=\"b222-9\" pgmap=\"222(60) 223(9)\">In the context of a default attorney grievance proceeding, ... after an order of default has been entered, the taking of additional evidence may be warranted only when, as noted above, new and material evidence has come to light since the filing of the PDRA, or perhaps when the hearing judge expresses doubt as to certain averments (or absence thereof) and invites live testimony or additional demonstrative evidence.</blockquote> <p id=\"b223-4\" pgmap=\"223\">Id. at 547 n.26, 103 A.3d 629. Absent those circumstances, in the event of a default, the hearing judge is not required to hold a full evidentiary hearing. Id. at 550, 103 A.3d 629.</p> <p id=\"b223-5\" pgmap=\"223\"> The hearing judge properly entered an Order of Default when McLaughlin failed to answer the Petition, see Md. Rules 2-613(b), 19-724(c), and never sought to vacate the default under Md. Rule 2-613(d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We turn our attention to whether the admitted facts were sufficient by a clear and convincing standard to warrant the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law.</p> <p id=\"b223-6\" pgmap=\"223\">MLRPC 1.3: Diligence</p> <p id=\"b223-7\" pgmap=\"223\"> Rule 1.3 requires an attorney to \u201cact with reasonable promptness and diligence in representing a client.\u201d Our review of the record reveals that McLaughlin was aware that Mr. Leedom had a history of substance abuse before she began representing Ms. Leedom. McLaughlin was aware that Mr. Leedom entered a facility to treat his substance abuse in June of 2014, and interacted with him while he was intoxicated after he had been released from treatment. Mrs. McCabe had contacted McLaughlin in July 2014 regarding her brother\u2019s past and current substance abuse problems, and alleged that he had poor financial management skills. McLaughlin\u2019s September 18 letter lists a series of events between June and December 2014 that should have raised concerns for any reasonable attorney regarding Mr. Leedom\u2019s fitness to serve as his mother\u2019s power of attorney.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b224-3\" pgmap=\"224\"> These events undoubtedly impacted Ms. Leedom\u2019s interests. See MLRPC 1.3, cmt. [8] (\u201cA client\u2019s interests often can be adversely affected by the passage of time or the change of conditions .... \u201d). Despite learning new information and observing changes in Mr. Leedom\u2019s behavior, McLaughlin did not promptly discuss these issues with her client, or act to protect her client\u2019s financial interests. We have \u201cconsistently regarded neglect and inattentiveness to a client\u2019s interests to be a violation of the Canon of Ethics warranting the imposition of some disciplinary sanction.\u201d Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Montgomery, 296 Md. 113, 120, 460 A.2d 597 (1983).</p> <p id=\"b224-4\" pgmap=\"224\"> There is no evidence that McLaughlin investigated the situation, or verified that Mr. Leedom was complying with his obligations as his behavior deteriorated.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> An attorney who fails to investigate a client\u2019s matter violates Rule 1.3. See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. London, 427 Md. 328, 347, 47 A.3d 986 (2012) (\u201cThe failure to consistently monitor and manage a client\u2019s business is a classic example of a Rule 1.3 violation.\u201d); Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Monfried, 368 Md. 373, 385, 394, 794 A.2d 92 (2002) (attorney violated Rule 1.3 when he failed to investigate a client\u2019s matter).</p> <p id=\"b224-5\" pgmap=\"224(29) 225(25)\">McLaughlin violated Rule 1.3 when she did not act to protect her client against Mr. Leedom\u2019s behavior, including advising her client about the risk of keeping Mr. Leedom as her power of attorney when he was experiencing substance abuse problems or investigating whether he was complying with his duties as her power of attorney.</p> <p id=\"b225-4\" pgmap=\"225\">MLRPC 1.4; Communication</p> <p id=\"b225-5\" pgmap=\"225\"> \u201cAttorneys violate Rule 1.4 when they fail to communicate with clients and keep them informed of the status of their legal matters.\u201d Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Powers, 454 Md. 79, 93, 164 A.3d 138 (2017). The duty to communicate includes providing information about \u201csignificant developments affecting ... the substance of the representation.\u201d MLRPC 1.4, cmt. [3]; see also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Narasimhan, 438 Md. 638, 656-57, 92 A.3d 512 (2014) (failing to inform a client about the status of a matter or update the client after significant case developments violates Rule 1.4(a)).</p> <p id=\"b225-6\" pgmap=\"225\"> The record shows that Ms. Leedom engaged McLaughlin for estate planning, including establishing a power of attorney to manage her financial affairs. McLaughlin was required \u201cwhen appropriate, to consult with the client about the means to be used to accomplish the client\u2019s objectives.\u201d MLRPC 1.4, cmt. [3]. McLaughlin knew that her 89-year-old client suffered from the early stages of dementia and did not wish to manage her own affairs.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Moreover, she learned from a third party\u2014after the instrument was signed\u2014that Mr. Leedom entered a rehabilitation facility for his alcoholism. McLaughlin did not know whether her vulnerable client was aware of this change in circumstances.</p> <p id=\"b225-7\" pgmap=\"225(62) 226(29)\"> When the representation began, both McLaughlin and Ms. Leedom knew of Mr. Leedom\u2019s history of substance abuse problems. Surely, the reoccurrence of Mr. Leedom\u2019s substance abuse problems could affect his ability to manage his mother\u2019s financial affairs under the power of attorney, and could well increase the risk of mismanagement and loss. Under these circumstances, McLaughlin had a duty to communicate with Ms. Leedom about this information.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Her failure to discuss this information with Ms. Leedom violated Rule 1.4(a) because she did not keep her client reasonably informed about the matter.</p> <p id=\"b226-4\" pgmap=\"226\"> Rule 1.4(b) requires an attorney to \u201cexplain ongoing matters to the extent reasonably necessary to allow a client to make informed decisions .... \u201d Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

In Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Rand, 429 Md. 674, 717, 57 A.3d 976 (2012), we explained that the analysis of whether an attorney has violated Rule 1.4(b) requires considering \u201cthe entire interaction between [the attorney] and [the client] and the information that was communicated.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b226-5\" pgmap=\"226\">McLaughlin violated Rule 1.4(b) when she did not explain to Ms. Leedom the risks of having Mr. Leedom continue as her power of attorney. See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Shuler, 454 Md. 200, 214, 164 A.3d 209 (2017) (failure to explain important aspects of the matter to a client violates Rule 1.4(b) when the client is denied the opportunity to make an informed decision). McLaughlin should have consulted with her client to permit Ms. Leedom to make an informed decision about her financial management because the circumstances of the ongoing representation had changed. See Steinberg, 395 Md. at 363, 910 A.2d 429.</p> <p id=\"b226-6\" pgmap=\"226\">MLRPC 1.5: Fees</p> <p id=\"b226-7\" pgmap=\"226(45) 227(62)\"> Rule 1.5(a) prohibits attorneys from agreeing to, charging, or collecting \u201cunreasonable fee[s],\u201d and sets out a list of non-exclusive factors to determine whether a fee is reasonable. It is unclear how McLaughlin earned the $5,175 she deducted from the escrow account, other than for work \u201cthrough 08/2014.\u201d McLaughlin\u2019s letter stated that this fee related to the sale of Ms. Leedom\u2019s Aberdeen properties. But her letter does not contain sufficient information to conclude that the fee was reasonable under Rule 1.5(a). \u201c[A]n otherwise-reasonable fee can become unreasonable if the lawyer fails to earn it.\u201d Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Failure to send invoices when an attorney is required to do so is unreasonable. See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Green, 441 Md. 80, 99, 105 A.3d 500 (2014); Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Rand, 445 Md. 581, 608, 128 A.3d 107 (2015). The hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, and our own review of the record establish that McLaughlin never submitted an invoice for this charge, nor supplied a basis for her fee.

Weiers, 440 Md. 292, 305, 102 A.3d 332 (2014).</p> <p id=\"b227-7\" pgmap=\"227\">The hearing judge found that McLaughlin violated Rule 1.15(a) when she failed to remove her earned fees from trust monies. Because we do not know what legal services she provided, or when, it is impossible to know whether or when she should have removed these funds. Therefore, we decline to reach this issue, which did not, in any event, affect our decision to disbar McLaughlin.</p> <p id=\"b228-3\" pgmap=\"228\">Rule 1.15(e) applies to property that comes into an attorney\u2019s possession \u201cin the course of representing a client.\u201d If two or more persons claim an interest in the property, the lawyer is required to keep that property separate pending the resolution of the dispute. Id. The hearing judge found that all of Bar Counsel\u2019s averments were admitted because McLaughlin never answered the Petition, nor appeared at the hearing. For that reason, he concluded that McLaughlin had violated 1.15(e).</p> <p id=\"b228-4\" pgmap=\"228\">It is not clear to us whether 1.15(e) would apply to the dispute between Mrs. McCabe and Mr. Leedom. McLaughlin received the property in the course of the representation. But our review of the record does not show that anyone disputed that Ms. Leedom owned the funds, or that Mrs. McCabe or Mr. Leedom claimed an interest in the funds. Our cases applying 1.15(e) typically address a lawyer\u2019s failure to pay bills out of settlement funds on a client\u2019s behalf, or turn settlement funds over to a client.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This rule also applies to attorney fee disputes. See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gracey, 448 Md. 1, 23, 136 A.3d 798 (2016). There is no evidence in the record that anyone disputed McLaughlin\u2019s fee because she never notified anyone that she was taking the fee.

An attorney violates this rule \u201cwhenever an attorney makes intentional misrepresentations to Bar Counsel.\u201d Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mitchell, 445 Md. 241, 259, 126 A.3d 72 (2015). Bar Counsel identified five \u201cknowing and intentional\u201d misrepresentations McLaughlin made in her September 18 letter to Bar Counsel. The hearing judge found, apparently by allegation and default, that McLaughlin made five \u201cknowing and intentional\u201d misrepresentations to Bar Counsel, and that this conduct violated Rule 8.1(a). We review these misrepresentations in greater detail.</p> <p id=\"b229-4\" pgmap=\"229\">1. Misrepresentation regarding Ms. Leedom\u2019s preference that Mrs. McCabe should not be involved in her finances or her day-to-day care.</p> <p id=\"b229-5\" pgmap=\"229\"> McLaughlin misrepresented that Ms. Leedom did not want Mrs. McCabe involved in managing her finances or her day-to-day care, and became \u201cagitated and combative\u201d when Mrs. McCabe took her to appointments, or when her name came up. Mrs. McCabe provided letters to Bar Counsel from Ms. Leedom\u2019s physician and daily caregivers. All of these letters refuted McLaughlin\u2019s assertion and stated that Mrs. McCabe was involved in her mother\u2019s day-to-day care and that they had a loving and positive relationship. McLaughlin did not provide any information supporting her claim, and we find that the record sufficiently demonstrates the falsity of her statement.</p> <p id=\"b229-6\" pgmap=\"229\">2. Misrepresentation regarding the frequency of contact with Mr. Leedom.</p> <p id=\"b229-7\" pgmap=\"229(134) 230(13)\">McLaughlin claimed frequent contact with Mr. Leedom in the fall of 2014, including in-person meetings. McLaughlin\u2019s letter states that she met with Mr. Leedom in September and October 2014, but he began cancelling meetings and never rescheduled at the end of October 2014. Mrs. McCabe explained that both she and Mr. Leedom\u2019s wife regularly contacted McLaughlin after July 2014 because Mr. Leedom was not accounting for his mother\u2019s finances. McLaughlin told them that Mr. Leedom had set up meetings, but failed to attend or reschedule. It is unclear when McLaughlin had meetings with Mr. Leedom, but an e-mail from May 2015 she enclosed in her September 18 letter suggests that Mr. Leedom was meeting with McLaughlin to discuss his mother\u2019s care in August of 2014\u2014but not after that point. McLaughlin did not provide any other information substantiating her claims of regular meetings with Mr. Leedom.</p> <p id=\"b230-4\" pgmap=\"230\">3. Misrepresentation regarding correspondence with Mrs. McCabe.</p> <p id=\"b230-6\" pgmap=\"230\">Mrs. McCabe\u2019s initial complaint to Bar Counsel stated she sent a certified letter to McLaughlin in April 2015, which requested a full accounting of the escrow account, and included a copy of Ms. Leedom\u2019s new power of attorney naming Mrs. McCabe as her agent. McLaughlin told Mrs. McCabe that she had not received the letter, although Mrs. McCabe had a received signed confirmation card. The individual who signed the card told Mrs. McCabe that McLaughlin had been given the letter. McLaughlin subsequently claimed that she found the letter, and that she mailed a response on May 15. McLaughlin\u2019s September 18 letter encloses a copy of a letter dated May 15, 2015. There is no evidence that she mailed the letter. Mrs. McCabe stated that she never received it.</p> <p id=\"b230-7\" pgmap=\"230\">4. Misrepresentation regarding Mr. McCabe\u2019s willingness to deal with Ms. Leedom\u2019s affairs and statements he made about Mrs. McCabe.</p> <p id=\"b230-8\" pgmap=\"230\">McLaughlin misrepresented that Mr. McCabe said on multiple occasions that he did not want to deal with his wife, or have her involved in Ms. Leedom\u2019s affairs, and that he wanted nothing to do with his wife\u2019s actions. Mr. McCabe provided information regarding this claim to Bar Counsel. He explained that once he and his wife learned that Mr. Leedom had been mishandling his parents\u2019 financial affairs, Mr. McCabe addressed his father-in-law\u2019s financial situation, and attempted to remain neutral regarding Ms. Leedom\u2019s finances. He asserts that McLaughlin used this information out of context. Mr. McCabe denied that he ever said that he wanted nothing to do with his wife\u2019s actions.</p> <p id=\"b230-9\" pgmap=\"230\">5.Misrepresentation regarding the escrow account.</p> <p id=\"b230-10\" pgmap=\"230(19) 231(125)\">McLaughlin misrepresented that she had explained on several occasions to Mrs. McCabe that there was never a separate escrow account in Ms. Leedom\u2019s name. McCabe\u2019s initial complaint stated that everyone had agreed that McLaughlin would invest the proceeds of the sale of the Aberdeen properties in Fidelity Investments. One of McLaughlin\u2019s emails confirms that this was the original understanding. Mrs. McCabe independently sought account information from a bank after McLaughlin failed to provide an accounting and told Mrs. McCabe that no separate account existed. When McLaughlin sent an accounting in May 2015, she stated that the funds were in her IOLTA escrow account, and not a separate account in Ms. Leedom\u2019s name. Mrs. McCabe was apparently unaware of this until McLaughlin told her in May 2015. McLaughlin\u2019s letter misrepresents the course of events and suggests an agreement that did not exist.</p> <p id=\"b231-4\" pgmap=\"231\">The September 18 letter demonstrates at least five intentional misrepresentations to Bar Counsel about McLaughlin\u2019s representation of Ms. Leedom. For that reason, McLaughlin has violated Rule 8.1(a). See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Brigerman, 441 Md. 23, 39, 105 A.3d 467 (2014) (knowingly making false statements to Bar Counsel violates 8.1(a)).</p> <p id=\"b231-5\" pgmap=\"231\">Rule 8.1(b)</p> <p id=\"b231-6\" pgmap=\"231(147) 232(17)\"> \u201cThis Court has a long history of holding that an attorney violates Rule 8.1(b) by failing to respond to letters from disciplinary authorities requesting information.\u201d Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Fezell, 361 Md. 234, 249, 760 A.2d 1108 (2000). Bar Counsel sent McLaughlin three requests for information. McLaughlin told the AGC investigator that she had received one of those requests, but did not think she had to respond. In Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kremer, 432 Md. 325, 68 A.3d 862 (2013), we found that an attorney violated Rule 8.1(b) when he did not respond to a Petition for Discipline, told an investigator that he would respond, but failed to do so. Id. at 336, 68 A.3d 862. McLaughlin\u2019s conduct is substantially similar. Bar Counsel\u2019s letters included a warning that a knowing failure to respond to the communication constituted a violation of Rule 8.1. McLaughlin received Bar Counsel\u2019s correspondence, knew she was required to reply, and did not comply. Therefore, she violated Rule 8.1(b).</p> <p id=\"b232-4\" pgmap=\"232\">Rule 8.4: Misconduct</p> <p id=\"b232-5\" pgmap=\"232\">Rule 8.4 defines professional misconduct for an attorney.

For the reasons discussed supra, we have concluded that McLaughlin has violated Rules 1.3, 1.4, 1.5(a), and 8.1(a) and (b). McLaughlin, therefore, has violated Rule 8.4(a). See Garrett, 427 Md. at 227, 46 A.3d 1169.</p> <p id=\"b232-6\" pgmap=\"232\"> Subsection (c) prohibits an attorney from engaging in \u201cconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.\u201d This Court has explained that \u201c[d]ishonest acts, in and of themselves are violative of Rule 8.4(c).\u201d Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Barnett, 440 Md. 254, 266-67, 102 A.3d 310 (2014).

Goff, 399 Md. 1, 22, 922 A.2d 554 (2007). Here, McLaughlin did not communicate with her client about information that significantly affected the representation, and failed to act diligently in protecting her client\u2019s interests. She charged a fee without submitting invoices or explaining the basis for her fee. When her misconduct came under investigation, she made multiple misrepresentations to Bar Counsel and ignored Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for information.</p> <p id=\"b233-3\" pgmap=\"233\"> We have found that this kind of conduct reflects negatively on the legal profession and is prejudicial to the administration of justice. In Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Shapiro, 441 Md. 367, 394, 108 A.3d 394 (2016), we explained that \u201c[a]ttorneys violate MLRPC 8.4(d) when they fail to keep their clients advised of the status of the representation and represent diligently their client\u2019s interests.\u201d See also Thomas, 440 Md. at 555, 103 A.3d 629. In Rand, we found that failing to provide invoices, and misrepresentations to Bar Counsel, violated Rule 8.1(d). 445 Md. at 613, 128 A.3d 107. Dishonesty to Bar Counsel regarding a disciplinary matter violates Rule 8.4(d). See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Thomas, 445 Md. 379, 396, 127 A.3d 562 (2015).

The funds were not deposited as advance fees or a retainer. McLaughlin\u2019s disbursement to Mr. Leedom was inconsistent with the purpose for which the money was entrusted to her. She misappropriated funds when she paid herself $5,175 from those funds without billing her client, or obtaining consent to use the funds for that purpose. See id. at 484, 671 A.2d 463 (misappropriation occurs through \u201cunauthorized use ... of a client\u2019s funds entrusted to him or her, whether or not temporary or for personal gain or benefit\u201d). The September 18 letter demonstrates that she intentionally took funds from the account to pay herself when the funds were to be used for Ms. Leedom\u2019s benefit. McLaughlin, therefore, violated BP \u00a7 10-306.</p> <p id=\"b234-4\" pgmap=\"234\">We agree with the hearing judge that Bar Counsel produced clear and convincing evidence that McLaughlin violated MLRPC 1.3,1.4(a) and (b), 1.5(a), 8.1(a) and (b), 8.4(a), (c), and (d), and BP \u00a7 10-306.

In her September 18 letter, McLaughlin appears intent on blaming Mrs. McCabe for any problems that arose during the representation to absolve herself of any misconduct. During argument before this Court, she claimed that she had been caught in the middle of a family dispute, but that she had done nothing wrong.</p> <p id=\"b235-5\" pgmap=\"235\">The actual injury McLaughlin caused is a serious one. An elderly, vulnerable adult lost $10,000 for her care. She also lost $5,175 without knowing that her attorney charged that fee or why. It is unknown whether Ms. Leedom lost additional funds when McLaughlin did not advise her client of the dangers inherent in retaining an individual with active substance abuse issues as her power of attorney. McLaughlin\u2019s inaction put her client at risk for future financial losses.</p> <p id=\"b235-6\" pgmap=\"235(76) 236(19)\"> Mitigation is not available \u201cwithout the attorney providing supporting evidence of the existence of such factors.\u201d Kremer, 432 Md. at 339, 68 A.3d 862.

McLaughlin never participated in the proceedings until she appeared before this Court.

After her initial response, she did not comply with further requests for information. McLaughlin was aware that AGC was investigating a complaint, but claims that she assumed matters never proceeded further, despite meeting with an AGC investigator who informed her that she was required to respond to Bar Counsel. A prudent attorney who did not receive such important anticipated communications would have contacted Bar Counsel, particularly if, as McLaughlin claimed, she was beset with mail delivery problems.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b237-4\" pgmap=\"237\">Because McLaughlin intentionally did not respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s communications, factor 5, \u201cbad faith obstruction of the attorney discipline proceeding\u201d is present. We have found that McLaughlin made multiple misrepresentations in her sole communication to Bar Counsel. For that reason, factor 6, \u201csubmission of false evidence, false statements, or other deceptive practices,\u201d is present.

Despite her experience, which presumably included working with elderly, vulnerable individuals, she failed to act in her client\u2019s best interests and mishandled client funds. Her \u201csubstantial experience in the practice of law\u201d is an aggravating factor.</p> <p id=\"b237-6\" pgmap=\"237(24) 238(186)\">Factor 7, \u201crefusal to acknowledge the misconduct\u2019s wrongful nature,\u201d and factor 10, \u201cindifference to making restitution or rectifying the misconduct\u2019s consequences\u201d are also present. Shuler, 443 Md. at 506-07, 117 A.3d 38. At argument, McLaughlin never conceded that her conduct might have been improper. She has never admitted to violating the Rules of Professional Conduct, nor did she participate in the proceedings until argument before this Court. See Thomas, 440 Md. at 557, 103 A.3d 629 (\u201cAbsence from the proceedings also indicates a refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of ... conduct and indifference to making restitution .... \u201d). McLaughlin told this Court that she was not sure what else she could have done to serve her client appropriately. She could have done more. At a minimum, she could have communicated with her client, or investigated the information she received suggesting that Mr. Leedom might be mismanaging his mother\u2019s finances. She certainly could have provided itemized billing invoices on a regular basis. And if McLaughlin became concerned that her client\u2019s age and vulnerability made her insistence that Mr. Leedom serve as power of attorney unreasonable, she could have taken action under MLRPC 1.14 (Client with Diminished Capacity). An experienced Estates and Trusts attorney should know that.</p> <p id=\"b238-4\" pgmap=\"238\">Factor 12, the \u201clikelihood of the repetition of the misconduct\u201d is present here. The hearing judge found that \u201cabsent recognition of and remorse for her wrongdoing, there is a substantial likelihood that she will repeat it.\u201d Based on our review of the record, and McLaughlin\u2019s insistence that her conduct did not violate any of the Rules of Professional Conduct, we agree.</p> <p id=\"b238-5\" pgmap=\"238(87) 239(39)\"> McLaughlin violated multiple Rules of Professional Conduct and BP \u00a7 10-306. Her violations of MLRPC 8.1(a) and 8.4(e) and (d), however, persuade us that disbarment is the proper sanction. We have explained that \u201c[djisbarment ordinarily should be the sanction for intentional dishonest conduct,\u201d Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, 364 Md. 376, 418, 773 A.2d 463 (2001), absent \u201ccompelling extenuating circumstances ....\u201d Id. at 413, 773 A.2d 463. McLaughlin has not shown any circumstances that could excuse her conduct. She made at least five intentional misrepresentations to Bar Counsel to evade the consequences of her actions. \u201cThe appropriate sanction for that kind of behavior ordinarily is disbarment.\u201d Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Payer, 425 Md. 78, 95, 38 A.3d 378 (2012) (deceitful conduct towards Bar Counsel).</p> <p id=\"b239-4\" pgmap=\"239\">McLaughlin\u2019s failure to participate in the attorney disciplinary proceeding, lack of remorse or awareness, and the nature of the underlying misconduct only underline the propriety of this sanction. See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Dunietz, 368 Md. 419, 431, 795 A.2d 706 (2002) (\u201cRespondent\u2019s continuing disregard for the Attorney Grievance Process, his apparent indifference to the tenets of his chosen profession, the dereliction of his duties to his client and his ostensible lack of remorse for his misconduct, warrant [disbarment].\u201d). McLaughlin\u2019s eleventh-hour appearance before this Court does not excuse her apathy towards attorney discipline proceedings or her dishonest conduct. We are convinced that disbarment is the appropriate sanction to protect the public and deter future violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b213-5\" pgmap=\"213\">.
