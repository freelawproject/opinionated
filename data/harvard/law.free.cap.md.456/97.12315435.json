State, 364 Md. 160, 179, 771 A.2d 1082, 1093 (2001). In other words, \u201c[identification testimony may be outcome determinative[.]\u201d Id. at 174, 771 A.2d at 1090. \u201c[H]ence, any solid preparation of a defense demands this information.\u201d Id. at 174, 771 A.2d at 1090.</p> <p id=\"b132-9\" pgmap=\"132\">During discovery in a criminal case in a circuit court, Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) requires the State to disclose to the defense, without the necessity of a request, \u201c[a]ll relevant material or information regarding ... pretrial identification of the defendant by a State\u2019s witness[.]\u201d</p> <p id=\"b132-10\" pgmap=\"132\">Here, we are asked to decide whether Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) requires the State to disclose to a defendant\u2019s counsel information regarding a State\u2019s witness\u2019s pretrial identification of a co-defendant. If not, we must decide whether Maryland Rule 4\u2014263(d)(7)(B) required the State to make such a disclosure under the circumstances of this case, in which the State\u2019s undisputed theory was that only the defendant and co-defendant were with the person who was killed when he was fatally shot, and a State\u2019s witness identified the co-defendant as not being the shooter.</p> <p id=\"b132-11\" pgmap=\"132(26) 133(101)\">At trial, the State, Respondent, offered evidence of the following theory of the case. John W. Green, III (\u201cGreen\u201d), Petitioner, was friends with Jonathan Copeland (\u201cCopeland\u201d), a drug dealer. One of Copeland\u2019s customers was Jeffrey Myers (\u201cMyers\u201d), the person who was killed. One day, Myers burglarized Copeland\u2019s residence and stole cash and drugs. Later that day, Copeland and Green went to Myers\u2019s residence and confronted him about the burglary. The next day, Copeland obtained a handgun. The following day, Copeland and Green returned to Myers\u2019s residence and confronted him about the burglary again. During the confrontation, Myers was fatally shot. Copeland, Myers, and Green were the only people who were present at the time of the shooting. According to the State, Green was the shooter.</p> <p id=\"A1g\" pgmap=\"133\">Green was the only defendant when the case proceeded to trial. Copeland had been charged with the same offenses with respect to Myers. Copeland, however, pled guilty to first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder.</p> <p id=\"b133-6\" pgmap=\"133\">The State\u2019s sole eyewitness to the shooting was Doris Carter (\u201cCarter\u201d). Carter saw two men with Myers at the scene of the shooting. Carter was unable to see the shooter\u2019s face because he was wearing a hoodie. Carter, however, saw the face of the person who was not the shooter.</p> <p id=\"b133-7\" pgmap=\"133\">At trial in the Circuit Court for Cecil County (\u201cthe circuit court\u201d), during Carter\u2019s direct-examination, the prosecutor proffered that Carter would identify Copeland as the person who was not the shooter. Green\u2019s counsel objected on the ground that the State had not disclosed Carter\u2019s identification of Copeland during discovery. The circuit court permitted Carter to identify Copeland. Copeland was briefly brought into the courtroom, and Carter identified him as the person who did not do the shooting.</p> <p id=\"b133-8\" pgmap=\"133(73) 134(12)\">Before us, Green contends that the circuit court erred in permitting Carter to identify Copeland for two alternative reasons. First, Green argues that Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) requires the State, as a matter of course, to disclose a pretrial identification of a co-defendant during discovery. Second, Green asserts that Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) required such a disclosure in this case because a pretrial identification of Copeland as the person who was not the shooter essentially constituted a pretrial identification of Green as the shooter.</p> <p id=\"b134-4\" pgmap=\"134\">In Part I, we hold that, as a general matter, Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B), by its plain language and history, does not require disclosure of pretrial identifications of co-defendants. In Part II, we conclude that a pretrial identification of a co-defendant is \u201crelevant ... information regarding ... pretrial identification of the defendant\u201d under Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) where the pretrial identification of the co-defendant is the equivalent of a pretrial identification of the defendant as the person responsible for the crime. Here, Carter\u2019s pretrial identification of Copeland as the person who was not the shooter was the equivalent of a pretrial identification of Green as the shooter because the State\u2019s theory of the case was, and the State\u2019s evidence showed, that Green, Copeland, and Myers, the person who was killed, were the only people at the scene of the shooting, and Myers was shot by one of the other two men. Thus, the State was obligated to disclose during discovery Carter\u2019s pretrial identification of Copeland as the person who was not the shooter.</p> <p id=\"b134-5\" pgmap=\"134\">BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"b134-6\" pgmap=\"134\">Charges, Writ of Habeas Corpus, and State\u2019s Opening Statement</p> <p id=\"b134-7\" pgmap=\"134\">On November 13, 2013, Green was indicted for first-degree murder, second-degree murder, conspiracy with Copeland to commit first-degree murder, use of a firearm in the commission of a felony or crime of violence, possession of a firearm after conviction of a disqualifying crime, and wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun.</p> <p id=\"b134-8\" pgmap=\"134(60) 135(20)\">On November 18, 2014, prior to trial, the State filed a Request for Writ in the circuit court, asking that \u201ca writ be issued to\u201d Copeland. (Emphasis omitted). The Request for Writ did not state its purpose. On November 28, 2014, the circuit court issued to Copeland a Writ of Habeas Corpus Ad Testificandum/Prosequendum for each day from December 9 through December 12, 2014, and each day from December 15 through December 19, 2014. On December 8, 2014, trial began.</p> <p id=\"AqD\" pgmap=\"135\">After a jury was selected, but before opening statements, the prosecutor informed the circuit court that the State intended to call Carter as a witness. The prosecutor advised that he wanted Copeland to appear in the courtroom during Carter\u2019s testimony so that she could identify him. Green\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cI very well might object to that. This is the first time [that] I\u2019ve heard that this is going to happen.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b135-6\" pgmap=\"135\">During the State\u2019s opening statement, the prosecutor addressed Carter\u2019s identification of Copeland as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b135-7\" pgmap=\"135\">You\u2019re going to hear a witness who drove by the shooting and saw a very distinct hat and then saw the shooting actually take place in her side-view mirror.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"pAiB\" pgmap=\"135\">[[Image here]]</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b135-8\" pgmap=\"135\">[Y]ou have one eyewitness putting two people, one which will be very clearly identified as [ ] Copeland and one that loosely identifies as [ ] Green, at the scene of the shooting, and that the trigger man is the one loosely identified by size, shape[,] and stature as [ ] Green, and you connect all the other things that you hear\u2014I\u2019m not going to lay out every piece you\u2019re going to hear.</blockquote> <p id=\"b135-9\" pgmap=\"135\">Carter\u2019s Testimony</p> <p id=\"b135-10\" pgmap=\"135(136) 136(15)\">At trial, as a witness for the State, Carter testified that, on October 23, 2013, she was driving north on Principio Road in Cecil County. Carter saw two parked vehicles facing each other. One vehicle was a truck, and the other was a dark Ford Mustang. Two men were nearby. One man was standing off to the side of the road. That man was shorter and stouter than the other one, and was wearing a hoodie. The other man was standing near the Mustang\u2019s driver\u2019s seat, with one foot in the Mustang and the other foot on the ground. That man was tall and thin, and was wearing a black hat with what appeared to be white snowflakes. During Carter\u2019s testimony, the State showed her a hat. Carter identified the hat as the one that she had seen on the tall, thin man. The circuit court admitted the hat into evidence.</p> <p id=\"b136-4\" pgmap=\"136\">Carter testified that she heard a gunshot. She looked into her driver\u2019s side-view mirror and saw the shorter, stouter man shoot into the truck three times. Carter could not see the face of the shorter, stouter man\u2014ie., the shooter\u2014because his hood was up. Carter, however, got a look at the face of the tall, thin man\u2014ie., the person who was not the shooter\u2014and drove away. Afterward, Carter decided to return to the scene of the shooting so that she could find out the address. Within two or three minutes, Carter drove back to the scene. On her way, she did not see the Mustang. By the time that Carter returned to the scene, the Mustang was gone.</p> <p id=\"b136-5\" pgmap=\"136\">One or two days after the shooting, Carter provided a statement to detectives in her home. Within a week, detectives interviewed Carter at a police station.</p> <p id=\"b136-6\" pgmap=\"136\">On direct-examination, the following exchange occurred with regard to Carter\u2019s ability to identify the two men:</p> <blockquote id=\"AU1\" pgmap=\"136\">[PROSECUTOR: W]hen you first met with detectives, do you remember what you told them in terms of whether you got a good look at faces or not?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b136-7\" pgmap=\"136\">[CARTER:] You know, at first I didn\u2019t want to get anything wrong. I just wanted to say exactly what I knew that I saw. And as those memories started coming back, it was after I talked to them.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b136-8\" pgmap=\"136\">[PROSECUTOR:] So when you first met the detectives what did you say in terms of\u2014</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b136-9\" pgmap=\"136\">[CARTER:] I think I told them that I couldn\u2019t\u2014I could tell you how\u2014like one was tall and thin and the other one was short and stout, and that the one was wearing a hat. Then I think I might have said that one was a white male, but I\u2019m not even sure.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b136-10\" pgmap=\"136\">[PROSECUTOR:] All right. As time has gone by though, as you sit\u2014again, as you sit here right now, do you have an image of what the taller skinnier one, as you described him, next to the driver\u2019s door looked like?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b137-4\" pgmap=\"137\">[CARTER:] Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b137-5\" pgmap=\"137\">[PROSECUTOR:] And if he was presented to you do you believe that you could identify him?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b137-6\" pgmap=\"137\">[CARTER:] I think so.</blockquote> <p id=\"b137-7\" pgmap=\"137\">While Carter was still on the stand, at a bench conference, the prosecutor stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b137-8\" pgmap=\"137\">[T]his was the reason for the writ for [] Copeland\u2014 noting, of course, that [Green] is not charged merely with first[-]degree murder[ ], he is also charged with conspiracy to commit f\u00edrst[-]degree murder. He\u2019s charged specifically conspiracy with [ ] Copeland. It is the [S]tate\u2019s proffer to the court that we believe that [ ] Carter, upon seeing [ ] Copeland, will be able to positively identify him.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b137-10\" pgmap=\"137\">* * Hi</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b137-11\" pgmap=\"137\">We intend to have [ ] Carter specifically .,. identify [ ] Copeland either by face, and say, yes, that\u2019s him, or that looks like him or whatever she says, then ask her about the physique, whether that\u2019s consistent with the first or the second person or anything to that effect.</blockquote> <p id=\"b137-12\" pgmap=\"137\">(Emphasis added) (paragraph break omitted).</p> <p id=\"b137-13\" pgmap=\"137\">Green\u2019s counsel objected, stating: \u201c[N]owhere in any discovery has anyone told me that a witness is going to identify a co~ defendant^]\u201d Green\u2019s counsel stated: \u201c[Without giving notice, [Carter]\u2019s going to identify [Copeland.] ... [S]urprise, surprise, she\u2019s identifying the co-defendant.\u201d Green\u2019s counsel contended that the State had been obligated to disclose during discovery that a witness had been expected to identify Copeland.</p> <p id=\"b137-14\" pgmap=\"137\">In response, the prosecutor stated, among other things: \u201c[Civilian witnesses[,] every day[,] get on the stand and say things ... for the first time. They say things different and supplemental, additional to what they said during the interview process[.]\u201d The prosecutor did not, however, contend that he had just learned that Carter could identify Copeland, or that he was surprised to discover that Carter could identify Copeland. The prosecutor stated that Green\u2019s counsel\u2019s</p> <blockquote id=\"b138-3\" pgmap=\"138\">claim of surprise that the body [of Copeland] would be produced here for purposes of the identification ... just can\u2019t be accurate .... There is no surprise. This is not a surprise witness. [Green\u2019s counsel] knew that there were plenty of people that could identify [Copeland]; and[,] really[,] the only claim of surprise is, is that [Carter] is going to be able to identify [Copeland].</blockquote> <p id=\"b138-4\" pgmap=\"138\">(Paragraph break omitted).</p> <p id=\"b138-5\" pgmap=\"138\">The prosecutor neither disputed that there had been a pretrial identification of Copeland by Carter, nor denied that Copeland had informed law enforcement officers pretrial of her ability to identify Copeland as the person who was not the shooter. Instead, the prosecutor contended that Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) obligated the State to disclose during discovery pretrial identifications of a defendant, not a co-defendant. The prosecutor stated that Green\u2019s counsel would be able to elicit on cross-examination that, at one point, Carter \u201cwent so far as to say that she couldn\u2019t identify anybody.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b138-6\" pgmap=\"138\">Without expressly determining whether there had been a discovery violation, the circuit court stated that it would allow Carter to identify Copeland. Copeland was brought in the courtroom, briefly stood there, and was excused. Carter identified Copeland as the tall, thin man who had been wearing a hat and standing near the Mustang\u2019s driver\u2019s side. In other words, Carter identified Copeland as the person who did not perform the shooting.</p> <p id=\"b138-7\" pgmap=\"138\">On cross-examination, the following exchanges occurred with regard to the statement that Carter had provided to detectives in her home one or two days after the shooting:</p> <blockquote id=\"Avx\" pgmap=\"138\">[GREEN\u2019S COUNSEL:] Do you remember what you told [the detectives] the first time?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b138-8\" pgmap=\"138\">[CARTER:] Pretty much what I said here except for I\u2019m sure\u2014like I said, it\u2019s been a year, and after that[,] I just didn\u2019t contact them to tell them anything else.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b138-9\" pgmap=\"138\">* \u215d \u215c</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b138-10\" pgmap=\"138\">[GREEN\u2019S COUNSEL:] Is it fair to say [that] the detectives asked you if you could identify [the shooter]?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b139-3\" pgmap=\"139\">[CARTER:] I\u2019m sure [that] they did. That was\u2014believe me, I was so nervous after all this. I was traumatized. I have to say [that] I was traumatized because I didn\u2019t sleep. I just kept thinking about it over and over again. I couldn\u2019t believe that I saw what I saw.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b139-4\" pgmap=\"139\">[GREEN\u2019S COUNSEL:] But two days later[,] they asked if you could identify either of these people.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b139-5\" pgmap=\"139\">[CARTER:] Yeah. I\u2019m sure they asked me if I knew what they were wearing, and I said the hat and the height and as much of a description\u2014</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b139-6\" pgmap=\"139\">[GREEN\u2019S COUNSEL:] Did you give them an idea\u2014two days after the interview you said short and stocky; or did you give an idea of height or just a general description? [CARTER:] Just that, short and stocky.</blockquote> <p id=\"b139-7\" pgmap=\"139\">On cross-examination, the following exchanges occurred regarding the detectives\u2019 interview of Carter at the police station within a week after she provided the statement to detectives in her home:</p> <blockquote id=\"b139-8\" pgmap=\"139\">[GREEN\u2019S COUNSEL:] Is it fair to say [that,] in that interview[,] you told the detectives that you didn\u2019t really get a very good look at these people as you drove by because you were worried about their vehicle in the road? [CARTER:] Right.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b139-9\" pgmap=\"139\">* \u215c *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b139-10\" pgmap=\"139\">[GREEN\u2019S COUNSEL:] And they asked you once again for descriptions of these people beyond what you\u2019ve testified to, and you were unable, even a week after this happened, to give any further description, is that fair?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b139-11\" pgmap=\"139\">[CARTER:] That\u2019s fair.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b139-12\" pgmap=\"139\">[GREEN\u2019S COUNSEL:] Have you seen a tape of your interview?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b139-13\" pgmap=\"139\">[CARTER:] Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b139-14\" pgmap=\"139\">[GREEN\u2019S COUNSEL:] So me asking you that, you\u2019ve seen it?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b139-15\" pgmap=\"139\">[CARTER:] I\u2019ve seen it.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b139-16\" pgmap=\"139\">[GREEN\u2019S COUNSEL:] You know what\u2019s on there.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b140-4\" pgmap=\"140\">[CARTER:] Right. I do know what\u2019s on there. It\u2019s just that memories start coming back after I talked to them, and I didn\u2019t talk to them until now. I\u2019m just telling you what I saw that day and what I remember [that] I saw that day.</blockquote> <p id=\"b140-5\" pgmap=\"140\">The following exchange occurred pertaining to Carter\u2019s ability to identify Copeland:</p> <blockquote id=\"b140-6\" pgmap=\"140\">[GREEN\u2019S COUNSEL: Y]ou just identified the person who came in. Have you ever been shown a photo of him before?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b140-7\" pgmap=\"140\">[CARTER:] Just[,] I identified him through just like his eyes and the hat, and not because of, you know, what he was wearing today or anything like that. I remember [that] he looked at me and I looked at him as I was going by because he was right there.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b140-8\" pgmap=\"140\">[GREEN\u2019S COUNSEL:] Have you seen his picture in the newspaper or anywhere since this happened?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b140-9\" pgmap=\"140\">[CARTER:] Yes, yes, in the Cecil Daily.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b140-10\" pgmap=\"140\">[GREEN\u2019S COUNSEL:] Oh.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b140-11\" pgmap=\"140\">[CARTER:] But I knew [that] when saw [sic] that, that was the person driving the car\u2014or standing outside that driver\u2019s door. The other person I\u2019d saw in the paper also, and I didn\u2019t know them at all.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b140-12\" pgmap=\"140\">[GREEN\u2019S COUNSEL:] When you\u2014since\u2014when was the first time that you realized, seeing a picture, that you knew who that person was?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b140-13\" pgmap=\"140\">[CARTER:] When I saw it probably in the paper. I said, oh, wow, that\u2019s the guy [who] was wearing the hat, that\u2019s the guy [who] was standing outside the door.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b140-14\" pgmap=\"140\">[GREEN\u2019S COUNSEL:] So like a year ago?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b140-15\" pgmap=\"140\">[CARTER:] Yes, probably a little\u2014no, I don\u2019t know if it was a year ago because it wasn\u2019t in the paper\u2014I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m not sure when they put it in the paper.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b140-16\" pgmap=\"140\">[GREEN\u2019S COUNSEL:] But sometime after this case and people were charged\u2014</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b140-17\" pgmap=\"140\">[CARTER:] Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b141-4\" pgmap=\"141\">[GREEN\u2019S COUNSEL:] (Continuing)\u2014you saw a picture of [ ] Copeland, and you\u2014</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b141-5\" pgmap=\"141\">[CARTER:] And I knew that\u2014</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b141-6\" pgmap=\"141\">[GREEN\u2019S COUNSEL:] And you knew [that] it was him?

When did you eventually tell any of the detectives that you knew who [ ] Copeland was?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b141-10\" pgmap=\"141\">[CARTER:] When I went over\u2014over everything again with them, what I saw\u2014everything that I saw that day.</blockquote> <p id=\"b141-11\" pgmap=\"141\">Testimony of Other State\u2019s Witnesses</p> <p id=\"b141-12\" pgmap=\"141\">Including Carter, the State called thirty witnesses. For brevity\u2019s sake, we will refrain from discussing the testimony of all of the State\u2019s witnesses and summarize the testimony of those witnesses who provided relevant information concerning Myers, Copeland, and Green, and evidence of the crime.</p> <p id=\"b141-13\" pgmap=\"141\">Randy Smith (\u201cSmith\u201d) testified that, in October 2013, Copeland was renting a house from him. On October 21, 2013, Copeland told Smith that Myers had broken into his house and stolen cash. According to Smith, Copeland seemed \u201cvery upset.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b141-14\" pgmap=\"141(92) 142(28)\">David Gordon (\u201cGordon\u201d) testified that, on October 21, 2013, he was spending time with Copeland. Copeland got a telephone call about an alarm in his residence going off. Gordon and Copeland went to Copeland\u2019s residence, and Copeland went inside. Afterward, Copeland came back outside looking mad, and said that \u201cstuff\u2019 had been stolen. Gordon and Copeland went to Myers\u2019s residence, and went inside. Copeland told Myers that cash and drugs were missing. Gordon and Copeland left Myers\u2019s residence, then picked up Green. Gordon, Copeland, and Green went to Myers\u2019s residence. Either Copeland or Green told Myers: \u201c[J]ust give it back.\u201d Copeland also talked to Myers\u2019s father, Howard Steve Myers. Eventually, Gordon, Copeland, and Green left Myers\u2019s residence.</p> <p id=\"b142-4\" pgmap=\"142\">Dawn Watson (\u201cWatson\u201d), Myers\u2019s girlfriend, testified that, in October 2013, she lived with Myers in his parents\u2019 basement. At the time, Myers was using heroin. According to Watson, Copeland was Myers\u2019s heroin dealer. Watson testified that, on October 21, 2013, she and Myers were at home. Suddenly, the back door opened, and Copeland and another man appeared. Copeland told Myers that someone had broken into his residence. Copeland and the other man left Myers\u2019s residence. According to Watson, Copeland texted Myers, stating: \u201cIf my stuff is not in the back of your truck when I get there[,] somebody is going to get shot.\u201d Approximately half-an-hour after Copeland and the other man left Myers\u2019s residence, Copeland, Green, and the other man came to Myers\u2019s residence in Copeland\u2019s black Mustang. Watson knew Green because Myers had previously introduced him to her. At the time, Green had a full beard. Myers and his father went outside. Copeland spoke in a loud voice, but Watson could not make out what he was saying. The next day, on October 22, 2013, Green telephoned or texted Myers, warning him that people were looking for him.</p> <p id=\"b142-5\" pgmap=\"142\">Myers\u2019s mother, Rebecca Myers, testified that, on October 21, 2013, when she came home from work, she saw Copeland\u2019s black Mustang parked near her residence. Myers, his father, Copeland, Green, and another man were standing outside. Copeland accused Myers of burglarizing his residence. Myers threw his hands in the air and said: \u201cI wasn\u2019t there. I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d Myers\u2019s father told Copeland to get off their property. Copeland, Green, and the other man left in Copeland\u2019s Mustang.</p> <p id=\"b142-6\" pgmap=\"142(39) 143(141)\">Myers\u2019s father testified that, in October 2013, he, Myers\u2019s mother, Myers, and Watson lived on Principio Road in Port Deposit. On October 21, 2013, at approximately 3:15 p.m. or 3:30 p.m., Myers\u2019s father arrived home from work, and entered his residence. Afterward, Myers\u2019s father heard a vehicle approaching. Myers\u2019s father looked outside and saw Copeland, Green, and another man in Copeland\u2019s black Mustang. At the time, Green had a bushy beard. Myers\u2019s father went outside and asked if he could help the men. The three men asked to talk to Myers. Myers\u2019s father went inside and told Myers that he had company, and Myers went outside. Myers\u2019s father heard yelling, went outside, and asked the three men what was going on. Copeland said something along the lines of: \u201c[N]one of [your] business[.]\u201d Myers\u2019s father heard Copeland tell Myers that someone had broken into his residence. At approximately 4:30 p.m. or 4:35 p.m., Myers\u2019s mother arrived home. Two or three times, Myers\u2019s father told the three men to leave, or he would call the police. Eventually, the three men left.</p> <p id=\"b143-5\" pgmap=\"143\">Myers\u2019s father testified that, two days later, on October 23, 2013, at approximately 3:15 p.m. or 3:30 p.m., he came home from work. Myers was in the basement. At approximately 4:30 p.m., Myers\u2019s mother came home from work. Afterward, Myers\u2019s father heard a door slam. Later, Thomas Miller (\u201cMiller\u201d), a neighbor, telephoned Myers\u2019s father and said that something had happened to Myers. Myers\u2019s parents went outside. Myers\u2019s truck was at the end of the driveway, and Myers\u2019s body was in the driver\u2019s seat.</p> <p id=\"b143-6\" pgmap=\"143\">Michael Owens (\u201cOwens\u201d) testified that, in October 2013, Copeland was his heroin dealer. At the time, Owens used one or two \u201cbundles\u201d of heroin each day. In September and October 2013, Owens owned approximately eight guns. One of Owens\u2019s guns was a 40 caliber Kahr handgun. Sometime before October 21, 2013, Copeland said that he wanted the handgun, and offered to either buy it or trade drugs for it. On October 21, 2013, Copeland told Owens that someone had broken into his residence. Copeland said that he wanted to obtain the handgun for self-defense in case another break-in occurred.</p> <p id=\"b143-7\" pgmap=\"143(18) 144(36)\">Owens testified that, the next day, on October 22, 2013, Owens went to Copeland\u2019s residence and saw Copeland, Green, and Kenny Howell (\u201cHowell\u201d), Copeland\u2019s cousin. Copeland and Green \u201cseemed to be very good friends.\u201d Owens gave Copeland the handgun, which was loaded with six bullets. In exchange, Copeland gave Owens thirteen bags of heroin.</p> <p id=\"b144-5\" pgmap=\"144\">Owens testified that, in March 2014, Detective Chris Lewis contacted him. Owens gave Detective Lewis two spent shell casings that had been ejected from the handgun when he had fired it twice sometime in 2013. During Owens\u2019s testimony, the circuit court admitted the shell casings into evidence.</p> <p id=\"b144-6\" pgmap=\"144\">Jessie Campbell (\u201cCampbell\u201d), a forensic scientist of the Firearms and Tool Marks Unit of the Forensic Sciences Division of the Maryland State Police, was accepted as an expert in firearm and tool mark examination. Campbell compared the shell casings that Owens had given Detective Lewis to four shell casings that had been found at the scene of the shooting. Campbell concluded that all six shell casings had been fired from the same gun.</p> <p id=\"b144-7\" pgmap=\"144\">Richard Bell, Jr. (\u201cBell\u201d) testified that, on October 23, 2013, he telephoned Copeland to ask to buy marijuana. At approximately 4 p.m., Copeland and Howell, his cousin, came to Bell\u2019s residence in Copeland\u2019s black Mustang. Copeland and Howell stayed at Bell\u2019s residence for approximately ten minutes. Copeland told Bell that Myers had broken into his residence two days earlier. Copeland \u201clooked pretty mad,\u201d and had something that \u201clooked like a gun.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b144-8\" pgmap=\"144\">Jessica Peacock (\u201cPeacock\u201d) testified that, in October 2013, she was dating Green. On October 23, 2013, at approximately 4:30 p.m., Green met Peacock outside the residence of one of her friends. Green told Peacock: \u201cSomething bad might happen.\u201d Afterward, Green left. At approximately 6:00 p.m., Peacock returned to her residence. At approximately 6:30 p.m., Green was dropped off at Peacock\u2019s residence. Green told Peacock that someone had been shot. Green told Peacock that he had been present at the scene of the shooting, but that he did not do it.</p> <p id=\"b144-9\" pgmap=\"144(20) 145(32)\">Gwen Wisniewski (\u201cWisniewski\u201d) testified that, on October 23, 2013, she was driving on Principio Road, in the area of its intersection with Biggs Highway. Wisniewski saw a truck parked in a driveway. A black Mustang with two occupants was blocking the driveway. The person in the Mustang\u2019s passenger seat was moving around.</p> <p id=\"b145-5\" pgmap=\"145\">Miller\u2014the neighbor whom Myers\u2019s father had mentioned\u2014 testified that he lived on Principio Road, approximately one or two acres away from the Myerses\u2019 residence. On October 23, 2013, at approximately 4:45 p.m., Miller saw a black Mustang blocking Myers\u2019s truck in the driveway. A man with a long, reddish beard was standing near Myers\u2019s truck. A tall man with black hair was walking around the Mustang. Miller heard loud voices, but could not make out what was being said. Miller went into his garage. One or two minutes later, Miller heard two gunshots. Miller left his garage and saw the Mustang speeding away. Miller went to Myers\u2019s truck and saw that Myers had been shot.</p> <p id=\"b145-6\" pgmap=\"145\">Deputy First Class Ross Griffin of the Cecil County Sheriffs Office testified that he lived approximately a quarter of a mile away from Myers\u2019s residence. On October 23, 2013, while Deputy First Class Griffin was at home, he heard two gunshots. After a pause, he heard two more gunshots. Approximately one or two minutes later, a black Mustang with two occupants went down Principio Road. The passenger had a larger build than the driver, and was wearing a dark coat or jacket.</p> <p id=\"b145-7\" pgmap=\"145\">James Finn (\u201cFinn\u201d), a paramedic with the Cecil County Department of Emergency Services, testified that, on October 23, 2013, at 4:56 p.m., he was dispatched to Principio Road. At 5:02 p.m., he arrived. There was a truck parked in the driveway. Inside the truck was an unresponsive man with a bullet wound. The man was pronounced dead on the scene.</p> <p id=\"b145-8\" pgmap=\"145(48) 146(27)\">James Locke, M.D. (\u201cDr. Locke\u201d), a medical examiner of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, was accepted as an expert in forensic pathology. Dr. Locke testified that, on October 24, 2013, he autopsied Myers\u2019s body. The cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds. Myers had four gunshot wounds: one to his head, one to the left side of his chest, one to the right side of his chest, and one to his right hand.</p> <p id=\"b146-4\" pgmap=\"146\">Stephanie Peterson (\u201cPeterson\u201d), a crime scene technician of the Cecil County Sheriffs Office, testified that, on October 23, 2013, at approximately 9:20 p.m., she arrived at Principio Road. Peterson recovered one cartridge and four cartridge casings from the scene. Peterson recovered from Myers\u2019s body 132 baggies that contained suspected heroin. In the basement of Myers\u2019s residence, Peterson saw pills, suspected marijuana seeds, suspected drug paraphernalia, and a \u201cSuboxone strip,\u201d which is used to treat drug addiction.</p> <p id=\"b146-5\" pgmap=\"146\">Deputy First Class Jonathan Pruett of the Cecil County Sheriffs Office testified that, on October 23, 2013, he assisted in Copeland\u2019s arrest at an M &amp; T Bank in Colora, Maryland. A person named Eddie Haskins (\u201cHaskins\u201d) was the only person who was with Copeland at the time of his arrest. Deputy First Class Pruett performed a search incident to arrest, and found two bundles, or approximately twenty-six bags, of heroin, as well as a cell phone on Copeland\u2019s person.</p> <p id=\"b146-6\" pgmap=\"146\">Detective William Sewell of the Criminal Investigation Division of the Cecil County Sheriffs Office testified that he obtained records for Copeland\u2019s and Green\u2019s cell phones. Detective Sewell had those records sent to Detective Jordan Swonger of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department.</p> <p id=\"b146-7\" pgmap=\"146\">Detective Swonger was accepted as an expert in the fields of cell phones and cell phone technology. Detective Swonger testified that he had performed an analysis of the records for Copeland\u2019s and Green\u2019s cell phones. Detective Swonger prepared a Cellular Analysis Report for Copeland\u2019s cell phone, and another Cellular Analysis Report for Green\u2019s cell phone. Detective Swonger also created a map showing the cell towers to which Copeland\u2019s and Green\u2019s cell phones connected between 4:46 p.m. and 5:46 p.m. on October 23, 2013. The circuit court admitted the Cellular Analysis Reports and the maps into evidence.</p> <p id=\"b146-8\" pgmap=\"146(21) 147(83)\">On October 23, 2013, at 4:46 p.m., Copeland\u2019s cell phone connected to a cell tower in the general vicinity of Myers\u2019s residence. At 4:57 p.m., Green\u2019s cell phone connected to a different cell tower in the general vicinity of Myers\u2019s residence. Copeland\u2019s and Green\u2019s cell phones appeared to move east across Interstate 95, which runs through Cecil County and Delaware. At 5:34 p.m., Green\u2019s cell phone connected to a cell tower in the general vicinity of a Pathmark store in Delaware. At 5:39 p.m., Copeland\u2019s cell phone connected to a different cell tower in the general vicinity of the Pathmark store in Delaware.</p> <p id=\"b147-4\" pgmap=\"147\">Detective Matt Blailock of the Criminal Investigation Division of the Cecil County Sheriffs Office testified that he reviewed surveillance videos as part of the homicide investigation. At the time, Copeland\u2019s Mustang was in the Sheriffs Office\u2019s possession. Detective Blailock was able to identify Copeland\u2019s Mustang in surveillance videos because it had after-market rims or wheels, blinkers on the side-view mirrors, and a stripe on the side. Additionally, stickers and an E-ZPass transmitter tag<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were attached to Copeland\u2019s Mustang\u2019s windows. According to Detective Blailock, surveillance videos showed that, on October 23, 2013, sometime after 4 p.m., Copeland\u2019s Mustang traveled on Theodore Road, then turned onto Camp Meeting Ground Road. At 4:55 p.m., Copeland\u2019s Mustang traveled through the parking lot of a Lan-dhope Farms gas station, and left onto Maryland Route 276. At 5:14 p.m., Copeland\u2019s Mustang went east through the toll booth on Interstate 95 that is near the Maryland-Delaware border. Detective Blailock viewed a surveillance video from a camera outside a Pathmark store in Delaware. On October 23, 2013, at 5:46 p.m., Copeland and Green were walking together outside of the store.</p> <p id=\"b147-5\" pgmap=\"147(18) 148(45)\">Detective Blailock testified that he helped execute a search warrant for Green\u2019s residence. Detective Blailock found a hat on the kitchen countertop. Detective Blailock was shown the hat that had been admitted into evidence\u2014ie., the hat that Carter testified that she had seen the tall, thin man wearing. Detective Blailock identified the hat as the one that he had seized from Green\u2019s residence.</p> <p id=\"b148-4\" pgmap=\"148\">Julie Kempton (\u201cKempton\u201d), a forensic scientist of the Biology Unit of the Forensic Sciences Division of the Maryland State Police,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> testified that she had received a hat and oral swabs from Green and Copeland. Kempton found skin cells on the hat. There were two contributors to the DNA in the skin cells\u2014-one major, and one minor. The major contributor\u2019s profile matched Green\u2019s profile. Kempton excluded Copeland as the minor contributor.</p> <p id=\"b148-5\" pgmap=\"148\">Detective Lewis of the Criminal Investigation Division of the Cecil County Sheriffs Office testified that, on October 24 or 25, 2013, he and Detective Sewell interviewed Carter at her residence. On October 25, 2013, Detective Lewis prepared a statement of charges against Green. According to the statement of charges, Carter said that the shooter was a short, stocky person who was wearing a hat with snowflakes.</p> <p id=\"b148-6\" pgmap=\"148(63) 149(28)\">Detective Lewis testified that, when they were arrested and booked, Green was approximately 5\u20197\u201d and 190 pounds, and Copeland was approximately 511\u201d and 160 pounds. On October 25, 2013, Detective Lewis interviewed Green. Detective Lewis advised Green of his Miranda rights,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which he waived. Green told Detective Lewis that he had never been with Copeland on October 23, 2013. Green acknowledged, however, that he and Copeland were close. Green also said that he used to have a bushy beard, and that he had shaved on the day of the interview.</p> <p id=\"b149-5\" pgmap=\"149\">Motion for Judgment of Acquittal and Green\u2019s Testimony</p> <p id=\"b149-6\" pgmap=\"149\">At the conclusion of the State\u2019s ease, Green\u2019s counsel made a motion for judgment of acquittal, which the circuit court granted only as to the charge for possession of a firearm after conviction of a disqualifying crime.</p> <p id=\"b149-7\" pgmap=\"149\">As the only witness on his own behalf, Green testified that he had known Myers for fifteen years. According to Green, he and Myers \u201cwere all right\u201d and \u201cgot high together.\u201d On October 22, 2013, Green telephoned Myers and told him \u201cto watch out, that people were looking for him[.]\u201d Green told Myers that, if he had stolen cash or drugs, he should give them back.</p> <p id=\"b149-8\" pgmap=\"149\">Green testified that on October 23, 2013, Copeland telephoned him and said that he was going to pick him up and drive to Myers\u2019s residence. Copeland said that he wanted to talk to Myers about \u201ctaking [his] s[***].\u201d Copeland picked up Green in his Mustang. Green acknowledged that, at the time, he was wearing the hat that had been admitted into evidence.</p> <p id=\"b149-9\" pgmap=\"149\">According to Green, Copeland drove to Myers\u2019s driveway and parked in front of his truck. Myers told Copeland and Green to leave, and threatened to call the police. Myers and Copeland started arguing about the \u201cdope\u201d that had gone missing. Myers told Copeland to move his Mustang because Myers\u2019s truck was blocked in. Green testified that while Myers was in his truck, Copeland pulled out a gun and shot Myers. Green acknowledged that no one else was present at the time.</p> <p id=\"b149-10\" pgmap=\"149\">According to Green, Copeland drove his Mustang to Delaware, with Green as a passenger. Eventually, Copeland drove to an open-air drug market, and left his Mustang to buy drugs. When Copeland left his Mustang, he had his gun, but when he returned, the gun was gone. Copeland drove down Interstate 95. Eventually, due to car trouble, Copeland parked and telephoned Haskins to ask for help. Haskins picked up Copeland and Green.</p> <p id=\"b150-3\" pgmap=\"150\">On cross-examination, Green acknowledged that, when detectives interviewed him, he falsely stated that, on October 23, 2013, he was not at the scene of the shooting. Green admitted that he told detectives that he does not drive. Green also acknowledged that he had a beard at the time of the shooting.</p> <p id=\"b150-4\" pgmap=\"150\">State\u2019s Closing Argument</p> <p id=\"b150-5\" pgmap=\"150\">During the State\u2019s closing argument, the prosecutor addressed Carter\u2019s identification of Copeland as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b150-6\" pgmap=\"150\">Passers[ ]by and neighbors saw the two people outside the Mustang. One taller. One skinnier. I\u2019m sorry. One taller and skinnier and the other was shorter and stockier. And [] Miller, the neighbor, and [] Cartel', the passer[]by, both said without reservation, no ambiguity, no cross[ Jexamination that got them tongue[-]tied or twisted or slightly confused, no question in their minds that the shorter[,] stocky guy was the one at the side of [Myers]\u2019s truck. [ ] Miller distinctly remembered a bushy beard on the shorter[J stockier man. And [ ] Copeland [was] positively identified by [ ] Carter, you saw him, he stood right here, she sat right there, he left the room, she said [that] that was the guy. Not just the guy. That was the guy standing at the side of the Mustang. That is one key piece of evidence. So [ ] Copeland was positively identified by [ ] Carter as being the man next to his Mustang at the time of the shooting. He is distinctly\u2014you have seen them both. He is distinctly the taller[,] skinnier guy as compared to [] Green. [] Green himself says [that] he doesn\u2019t drive, yet he wants you to believe that he, not Copeland, was the person at the driver\u2019s side of the door when [ ] Carter drove by. You know [that] that makes no sense. He was the passenger. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t drive.\u201d You heard that in a statement to the detectives during their interview and you heard that in his testimony here. He doesn\u2019t drive. But for convenience sake [sic] of this story he concocted, he wants you to believe that roles were reversed, he got out of the car and just meandered over to the driver\u2019s side while [ ] Copeland was the one who went and executed [ ] Myers.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b151-4\" pgmap=\"151\">Still talking about that puzzle piece about short and stocky, [ ] Carter was quite clear in her memory. First of all, the tall[,] skinny guy was at the side of the Mustang. She said that without reservation. Secondly, she positively identified him as the guy next to the Mustang when he was in the courtroom[,] and she said that the shorter[,] stocky guy was the one by the side of the truck. This is so important. Think about the time that went by. She drove by, she\u2019s feet away, she sees Copeland standing at the side of the Mustang, and within seconds, not enough time for them to just do a quick role reversal, she hears the bang, she looks in the mirror and she sees the shorter[,] stocky guy. This tall[7]skinny versus short[/]stocky is critical. The timing did not allow the two to change positions as [ ] Carter heard shots fired almost instantly she passed by. So not only did she say without reservation that the shorter[,] stockier guy was the shooter, but given that she is certain that [] Copeland was the person standing at the driver\u2019s side of the Mustang[,] and given the lack of time between passing by and hearing that first shot, those two could not have swapped positions. She said she saw the shorter[,] stockier guy firing the gun.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"pAmj\" pgmap=\"151\">[[Image here]]</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b151-5\" pgmap=\"151\">[ ] Wisniewski and [ ] Carter happened to drive by as this thing was all just going down. Think about the timeframe here, ladies and gentlemen. Think about this. They have got two guys there. Carter definitively, definitively, she is as neutral as you can get, she\u2019s a passer[ ]by who you could tell, maybe not as much as [ ] Peacock, but you could tell she didn\u2019t want to be here either. I mean, who would want to be here and testifying in circumstances like this? But she gets on the stand[,] and she says without reservation, that man, [ ] Copeland, was the man standing at the side. This is all important because of the amount of time, the speed by which this happened.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b151-6\" pgmap=\"151\">* # *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b151-7\" pgmap=\"151(21) 152(95)\">Green, by his own admission!,] and as supported by other evidence, was, in fact, at the crime scene. The shooter was the short[,] stocky guy and had a bushy beard. [ ] Green was and is the shorter!,] stockier guy[,] and had, by his own admission[,] and again as supported by the evidence we presented, a bushy beard when [ ] Myers was shot. [ ] Gopeland was positively identified as the man standing on the roadway immediately next to the driver\u2019s door of his own Mustang a mere second or two before the first shots were fired. [ ] Carter was quite clear about this fact, and [ ] Copeland, therefore, was not the shooter.</blockquote> <p id=\"b152-5\" pgmap=\"152\">Verdicts and Opinion of the Court of Special Appeals</p> <p id=\"b152-6\" pgmap=\"152\">The jury found Green guilty of first-degree murder, conspiracy with Copeland to commit first-degree murder, use of a firearm in the commission of a felony or crime of violence, and wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun. Green noted an appeal.</p> <p id=\"b152-7\" pgmap=\"152\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the convictions. See Green v. State, 231 Md.App. 53, 56, 149 A.3d 1159, 1161 (2016). The Court of Special Appeals held \u201cthat the State\u2019s discovery obligations pursuant to [Maryland] Rule 4\u2014263(d)(7)[ (B) ] are limited to that set forth by the plain language of the rule, i.e., information regarding \u2018pretrial identification of the defendant by a State\u2019s witness.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 74, 149 A.3d at 1171. In other words, the Court concluded that Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) is unambiguous, and applies only to \u201cdisclosure of pretrial identifications of \u2018the defendant.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 72, 149 A.3d at 1170. The Court observed that, in contrast to Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B), other provisions of Maryland Rule 4-263(d) expressly use the term \u201cco-defendant.\u201d See id. at 72, 149 A.3d at 1170.</p> <p id=\"b152-8\" pgmap=\"152(64) 153(62)\">The Court concluded that Green had supplied \u201cno persuasive authority\u201d indicating that Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) applies to a pretrial \u201cidentification of someone other than the defendant\u201d where such a pretrial identification \u201csuggests, in conjunction with other evidence, that the defendant was involved with the crime.\u201d Id. at 73, 149 A.3d at 1171. The Court reasoned that concluding otherwise would make the State\u2019s discovery obligations depend on the defendant\u2019s trial strategy, \u201cwhich often will be unknown prior to trial.\u201d Id. at 74, 149 A.3d at 1171. Applying its holding to the facts of this case, the Court concluded that the State did not violate Maryland Rule 4\u2014263(d)(7)(B) by not disclosing during discovery Carter\u2019s pretrial identification of Copeland. See id. at 74, 149 A.3d at 1171.</p> <p id=\"b153-4\" pgmap=\"153\">Petition for a Writ of Certiorari</p> <p id=\"b153-5\" pgmap=\"153\">Green petitioned for a writ of certiorari, raising the following two issues:</p> <blockquote id=\"b153-6\" pgmap=\"153\">1. Does Maryland Rule 4\u2014263(d)(7)(B), which requires the State to disclose \u201c[a]ll relevant material or information regarding ... pretrial identification of the defendant by a State\u2019s witness,\u201d require the State to disclose all relevant material or information regarding pretrial identification of a co-defendant by a State\u2019s witness?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b153-7\" pgmap=\"153\">2. Where [Green] and another individual, [] Copeland, who pled guilty to first[-]degree murder and conspiracy to commit f\u00edrst[-]degree murder in the shooting death of the victim in [Green]\u2019s case, were both present at the scene of the shooting, and the eyewitness identification of Copeland as the [person who was not the shooter] implicated [Green] as the person who shot and killed the victim, did the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that information regarding the identification of Copeland did not fall within the scope of \u201crelevant material or information regarding ... pretrial identification of the defendant by a State\u2019s witness,\u201d under [Maryland] Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B)?</blockquote> <p id=\"b153-8\" pgmap=\"153\">(Ellipses and first alteration in original). This Court granted the petition. See Green v. State, 452 Md. 4, 155 A.3d 891 (2017).</p> <p id=\"b153-9\" pgmap=\"153\">DISCUSSION</p> <p id=\"b153-10\" pgmap=\"153\">I. Pretrial Identification of Co-Defendants</p> <p id=\"Axi\" pgmap=\"153\">The Parties\u2019 Contentions</p> <p id=\"b153-11\" pgmap=\"153(19) 154(88)\">Green contends that, as a general matter, Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) requires the State to disclose a State\u2019s witness\u2019s pretrial identification of a co-defendant. Green argues that disclosure of a pretrial identification of a co-defendant fulfills the objectives of Maryland Rule 4-263\u2014namely, assisting the defendant in the preparation of a defense and protecting the defendant from unfair surprise. Green asserts that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s holding resulted in too narrow an interpretation of Maryland Rule 4\u2014263(d)(7)(B), and that the use of the phrase \u201call relevant material or information\u201d in the subsection warrants a broader interpretation, requiring disclosure of a pretrial identification of a co-defendant.</p> <p id=\"b154-5\" pgmap=\"154\">Green maintains that Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) is analogous to Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(6)(G), which requires the State to disclose a pretrial failure to identify a defendant or a co-defendant. Green acknowledges that, unlike Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(6)(G), Maryland Rule 4\u2014263(d)(7)(B) does not explicitly refer to co-defendants. Green contends, however, that \u201cthere is no reasonable explanation as to why the [Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure (\u201cthe Rules Committee\u201d) ] would recommend[\u2014]and this Court, in its rule-making capacity, would require[\u2014disclosure of information regarding the failure of a witness to identify a co-defendant[,] but not disclosure of information regarding the witness\u2019s identification of a co-defendant.\u201d According to Green, both of these pieces of information are important to preparing a defense, and neither is more burdensome to produce than the other. Green argues that the inclusion of the term \u201cco-defendant\u201d in Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(6)(G) mandates the inclusion of the term \u201cco-defendant\u201d in Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B).</p> <p id=\"b154-6\" pgmap=\"154(89) 155(68)\">Green asserts that, even if Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(6)(G)\u2019s use of the word \u201cco-defendant\u201d does not establish that Maryland Rule 4\u2014263(d)(7)(B) applies to co-defendants, Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(6)(G)\u2019s use of the word \u201cco-defendant\u201d shows that Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) is ambiguous in its applicability to co-defendants. Green maintains that, if Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) is ambiguous, the Rule\u2019s history is vital to resolving any' question as to its construction. Green points out that Maryland Rule 4-263 was amended in 2008, and contends that the Rules Committee sought to harmonize Maryland Rule 4-263 with the American Bar Association Standards for Criminal Justice: Discovery and Trial by Jury, 3d Ed. (1996) (\u201cthe ABA Standards\u201d) as much as possible, and, as such, intended Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) to \u201ccover identifications of the defendant or co-defendant.\u201d (Footnote and ellipsis omitted). Green argues that the lack of inclusion of the term \u201cco-defendant\u201d in Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) is not evidence of a deliberate omission.</p> <p id=\"b155-5\" pgmap=\"155\">The State responds that Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B)\u2019s plain language limits the State\u2019s discovery obligations to pretrial identifications of the defendant, not a co-defendant. The State points out that Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) explicitly refers to \u201cthe defendant,\u201d not \u201ca defendant,\u201d meaning that Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) may not be construed to include any defendant\u2014ie., a co-defendant or a defendant. In other words, the State contends that the Rules Committee specifically chose language limiting Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) to disclosure of the pretrial identification of the defendant. The State argues that, because the Rules Committee chose to include the phrase \u201cor a co-defendant\u201d in other provisions of Maryland Rule 4-263, but deliberately omitted the phrase from Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B), it must be presumed that the omission is intentional.</p> <p id=\"b155-6\" pgmap=\"155\">The State acknowledges that the purposes of Maryland Rule 4-263 include assisting the defendant in the preparation of a defense and protecting the defendant from unfair surprise, but the State asserts that not all alleged surprises are covered by Maryland Rule 4-263. The State points out that another purpose of the discovery rules is the provision of clear notice as to what is required to be disclosed. The State maintains that interpreting Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B)\u2014 which refers to the disclosure of a pretrial identification of \u201cthe defendant\u201d\u2014to include a requirement to disclose the pretrial identification of a co-defendant would not provide adequate notice of the State\u2019s disclosure obligations.</p> <p id=\"b155-7\" pgmap=\"155(17) 156(154)\">The State contends that Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B)\u2019s history does not show that the Rules Committee intended for the phrase \u201cthe defendant\u201d to include co-defendants and/or co-conspirators. The State points out that ABA Standard 11-2.1 requires disclosure of \u201c[a]ny material, documents, or information relating to lineups, showups, and picture or voice identifications in relation to the case.\u201d The State notes that, in proposing amendments to Maryland Rule 4-263, the Rules Committee considered the ABA Standards, but failed to include the broad language requiring disclosure of any pretrial identifications in relation to the case. The State argues that, instead, the Rules Committee decided to narrow the State\u2019s disclosure requirement to \u201c[a]ll relevant material or information regarding ... pretrial identification of the defendant by a State\u2019s witness!.]\u201d The State asserts that the Rules Committee was free to require the disclosure of a pretrial failure to identify a co-defendant in Maryland Rule 4\u2014263(d)(6)(G) and not require the disclosure of a pretrial identification of a co-defendant in Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B).</p> <p id=\"b156-5\" pgmap=\"156\">The State contends that Maryland case law does not support the position that the pretrial identification of a co-defendant is required to be disclosed under Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B). The State points out that the cases relied on by Green involve pretrial identifications and non-identifications of \u201cthe defendant,\u201d not a co-defendant. The State asserts that, even if Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) can be construed to apply to a co-defendant, it is unclear in this case that Copeland was a co-defendant because he and Green were not charged in the same charging document, did not appear at the same hearings, and were not tried together.</p> <p id=\"b156-6\" pgmap=\"156\">Standard of Review</p> <p id=\"b156-7\" pgmap=\"156\"> Where, as here, a trial court does not expressly determine that a discovery violation occurred, an appellate court reviews the issue without deference. See Williams, 364 Md. at 169, 771 A.2d at 1087 (\u201cWhere the trial [court] made no specific finding as a matter of law that the State violated the discovery rule, we exercise independent de novo review to determine whether a discovery violation occurred.\u201d (Citations omitted)).</p> <p id=\"b157-4\" pgmap=\"157\">In Fuster v.

First, the court considers the Rule\u2019s plain language in light of: (1) the scheme to which the Rule belongs; (2) the purpose, aim, or policy of this Court in adopting the Rule; and (3) the presumption that this Court intends the Rules and this Court\u2019s precedent to operate together as a consistent and harmonious body of law. If the Rule\u2019s plain language is unambiguous and clearly consistent with the Rule\u2019s apparent purpose, the court applies the Rule\u2019s plain language. Generally, if the Rule\u2019s plain language is ambiguous or not clearly consistent with the Rule\u2019s apparent purpose, the court searches for rulemaking intent in other indicia, including the history of the Rule or other relevant sources intrinsic and extrinsic to the rulemaking process, in light of: (1) the structure of the Rule; (2) how the Rule relates to other laws; (3) the Rule\u2019s general purpose; and (4) the relative rationality and legal effect of various competing constructions.</blockquote> <p id=\"b157-6\" pgmap=\"157\">(Brackets, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted).</p> <p id=\"b157-7\" pgmap=\"157\"> Where a Rule\u2019s language is clear, a court \u201cneither add[s] nor delete[s] language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the Rule.\u201d Williams v.

When this Court decided Collins, Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(6)(G) had not yet been adopted, and no provision of Maryland Rule 4-263 expressly required disclosure of a pretrial failure to identify a defendant or a co-defendant.</p> <p id=\"b163-8\" pgmap=\"163(162) 164(17)\">In Collins, 373 Md. at 132, 816 A.2d at 920, the defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and related handgun offenses. On the night of the shooting, a witness told a Baltimore City detective that he had not seen anything because he had been too far away. See id. at 133, 816 A.2d at 921. The detective included this information in a report. See id. at 133, 816 A.2d at 921. Subsequently, however, before trial, the witness identified the defendant as the shooter in a photographic array and gave a contemporaneous audiotaped statement. See id. at 133-34, 816 A.2d at 921. Initially, during discovery, the State disclosed the witness\u2019s pretrial photographic array identification of the defendant, but did not disclose the pretrial failure to identify the defendant the night of the shooting, or the audiotaped statement identifying the defendant. See id. at 134, 816 A.2d at 921. Later, the State provided to the defense the audiotaped statement, but still did not disclose the pretrial failure to identify the defendant.

The State moved to reopen its case so that the witness could testify. See id. at 135, 816 A.2d at 921. The defendant\u2019s counsel opposed the motion to reopen on the ground that there was no necessity for reopening, as the State had simply failed to summons the witness before trial. See id. at 135, 816 A.2d at 921-22. The defendant\u2019s counsel also advised that he had just learned about the witness\u2019s pretrial failure to identify the defendant. See id. at 135, 816 A.2d at 922. The prosecutor responded that the omission of the witness\u2019s pretrial failure to identify the defendant was inadvertent. See id. at 135, 816 A.2d at 922.

It is enough to find that the defense was denied an adequate opportunity to do so, to its prejudice.\u201d Id. at 148, 816 A.2d at 929.</p> <p id=\"b165-8\" pgmap=\"165(36) 166(43)\">This Court determined that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance, which would have given the defendant\u2019s counsel \u201can opportunity to review the circumstances surrounding the undisclosed prior inconsistent statement^]\u201d Id. at 149, 816 A.2d at 930. In other words, a continuance \u201cwould have been appropriate to allow defense counsel adequate time to \u2018regroup,\u2019 investigate, and prepare as full a defense as possible.\u201d Id. at 143, 816 A.2d at 927.</p> <p id=\"b166-5\" pgmap=\"166\">Analysis</p> <p id=\"b166-6\" pgmap=\"166\">Here, we conclude that, as a general matter, Maryland Rule 4\u2014263(d)(7)(B) does not, by its plain language and history, require the State to disclose during discovery a State\u2019s witness\u2019s pretrial identification of a co-defendant.</p> <p id=\"b166-7\" pgmap=\"166\"> As an initial matter, we address the State\u2019s contention that, even if Maryland Rule 4\u2014263(d)(7)(B) can be construed to apply to co-defendants, Maryland Rule 4\u2014263(d)(7)(B) does not apply in this case because it is not clear that Copeland and Green were co-defendants. Despite the State\u2019s contention in its brief, the record is replete with references by the prosecutor identifying Copeland as a co-defendant in the circuit court. At a bench conference, the prosecutor stated: \u201c[T]he [S]tate intends to produce the body of [] Copeland to at least one witness[.] ... [Identification of a co-defendant[,] when charged as co[-]conspirators[,] is almost as important as identification of the defendant^]\u201d Later at the bench conference, the prosecutor stated: \u201c[T]his is [a] co-defendant, not the defendant himself.\u201d Still later at the bench conference, the prosecutor stated: \u201cThe co-defendant, [ ] Copeland, was interviewed by other people.\u201d Shortly afterward, the prosecutor stated that Green and his counsel \u201cknew that ... the co-defendant existed.\u201d Later, the prosecutor stated: \u201c[W]e had a collateral thought about the co-defendant being brought in, as you said, in prison garb[.]\u201d Shortly before Copeland was brought into the courtroom, the prosecutor stated: \u201cWe\u2019re going to ask [Carter] another question before we bring in the body of the co-defendant[.]\u201d And, during the State\u2019s closing argument, the prosecutor stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b166-8\" pgmap=\"166(34) 167(34)\">To call each other, [ ] Green and [ ] Copeland had to use outside sources to connect them together. You heard testimony about the system at the detention center. They are on separate tiers. Co-defendants, people who are charged as co-defendants in a crime, are put in separate places, and one of the reasons is so that they can\u2019t talk, can\u2019t contrive, can\u2019t discuss the cases.</blockquote> <p id=\"b167-5\" pgmap=\"167\">The record demonstrates that, in the circuit court, the State took a different position with respect to Copeland\u2019s status as a co-defendant.</p> <p id=\"b167-6\" pgmap=\"167\">No Maryland Rule or statute defines the term \u201cco-defendant.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary provides the following definition of the term \u201cco-defendant\u201d: \u201cOne of two or more defendants sued in the same litigation or charged with the same crime.\u201d Codefendant, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014).</p> <p id=\"b167-7\" pgmap=\"167(230) 168(96)\">Neither this Court nor the Court of Special Appeals has had the occasion to expressly define the term \u201cco-defendant.\u201d Both this Court and the Court of Special Appeals, however, have treated the term \u201cco-defendant\u201d in a manner that indicates that Black\u2019s Law Dictionary\u2019s definition of the term \u201cco-defendant\u201d is accurate\u2014ie., that a co-defendant is an individual who is charged with the same crime as the defendant. In Veney v. State, 251 Md. 159, 164, 246 A.2d 608, 612 (1968), this Court stated: \u201cThe motion for discovery and inspection filed by the appellant asked for copies of all written statements of three co-defendants who were charged with the same crimes with which appellant was charged.\u201d (Emphasis added). In Boone v. State, 3 Md.App. 11, 31, 237 A.2d 787, 800, cert. denied, 393 U.S. 872, 89 S.Ct. 161, 21 L.Ed.2d 141 (1968), the Court of Special Appeals stated: \u201cThe fact of the conviction or acquittal of one person charged with a crime is neither relevant nor material to the issue of the guilt or innocence of another person charged with the same crime as a co-perpetrator. Contrary to the position taken by the appellant, we feel that the admission of evidence of the conviction of a co-defendant at a prior trial would be prejudicial error.\u201d (Emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And, in Boyd v. State, 321 Md. 69, 72, 581 A.2d 1, 2 (1990), this Court repeatedly referred to defendants who were charged with the same crime as co-defendants, even though they were charged separately and tried separately. Similarly, in Hickman v. State, 242 Md. 91, 91, 218 A.2d 21, 22 (1966), this Court stated that the defendant \u201cwas tried ... with two separately indicted co-defendants[J\u201d And, in State v. Johnson, 367 Md. 418, 421 &amp; n.2, 788 A.2d 628, 630 &amp; n.2 (2002), without expressly referring to co-defendants, this Court stated that four co-conspirators were tried jointly, even though one of them \u201cwas indicted separately.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b168-5\" pgmap=\"168\">This Court has never determined, or, indeed, even indicated, that a co-defendant must be charged in the same charging document as the defendant. To the contrary, Maryland Rule 4-253(a) expressly permits two defendants who have been charged separately to be tried together. See Md. R. 4-253(a) (\u201cOn motion of a party, the court may order a joint trial for two or more defendants charged in separate charging documents if they are alleged to have participated in the same act or transaction or in the same series of acts or transactions constituting an offense or offenses.\u201d). In other words, Maryland Rule 4-253(a) explicitly allows two separately-charged individuals to be tried together as co-defendants.</p> <p id=\"b168-6\" pgmap=\"168\">The State mistakenly relies on State v. Stojetz, 84 Ohio St.3d 452, 705 N.E.2d 329, 338 (1999) for the proposition that, to be a co-defendant, an individual must have been charged in the same charging document as the defendant. In Stojetz, id., the Supreme Court of Ohio reasoned that co-conspirators were not co-defendants because the defendant \u201cwas the only person charged in the indictment[.]\u201d In Stojetz, id., the Court quoted State v. Wickline, 50 Ohio St.3d 114, 552 N.E.2d 913, 918 (1990), in which, in turn, the Court quoted the following definition of \u201cco-defendant\u201d in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th ed. 1979): \u201cMore than one defendant being sued in the same litigation; or, more than one person charged in same complaint or indictment with same crime.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p> <p id=\"b169-4\" pgmap=\"169\">This definition of the term \u201cco-defendant\u201d in the Fifth Edition of Black\u2019s Law Dictionary from 1979 is now approximately thirty-eight years old. In the meantime, there have been five newer editions of Black\u2019s Law Dictionary. The most recent edition\u2014namely, the Tenth Edition, published in 2014\u2014has a different definition of the term \u201cco-defendant\u201d than the one that the Supreme Court of Ohio employed in Wickline and Stojetz. In contrast to the Fifth Edition, the Tenth Edition does not include in its definition of the term \u201cco-defendant\u201d the requirement that the individual was charged \u201cin the same complaint or indictment.\u201d Instead, the Tenth Edition simply defines the term \u201cco-defendant\u201d as \u201c[o]ne of two or more defendants ... charged with the same crime.\u201d Codefendant, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014).</p> <p id=\"b169-5\" pgmap=\"169\">The Tenth Edition\u2019s definition of the term \u201cco-defendant\u201d is consistent with Maryland case law, which indicates that a co-defendant is an individual who is charged with the same crime as the defendant. To the extent that an older edition of Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, or Ohio case law, endorses a definition of the term \u201cco-defendant\u201d that requires the co-defendant to be charged in the same charging document as the defendant, such a definition is inconsistent with the way in which this Court and the Court of Special Appeals have employed the term \u201cco-defendant.\u201d In this case, it is undisputed that Copeland pled guilty to first-degree murder of Myers and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder of Myers\u2014ie., that he was charged with, and convicted of, the same crimes with which Green was charged. We have no difficulty in concluding that Green and Copeland were co-defendants.</p> <p id=\"b169-6\" pgmap=\"169(62) 170(11)\"> As to the plain language of Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) and whether, as a general matter, it requires disclosure of the pretrial identification of a co-defendant, Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) provides: \u201cWithout the necessity of a request, the State\u2019s Attorney shall provide to the defense ... [a]ll relevant material or information regarding ... pretrial identification of the defendant by a State\u2019s witness[.]\u201d The word \u201cco-defendant\u201d is conspicuously absent from Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B).</p> <p id=\"b170-5\" pgmap=\"170\">One of the cardinal tenets of rule interpretation is that, where the language of the Rule is plain, we \u201cneither add nor delete language\u201d to reach a result not set forth in the clear language of the Rule. Williams, 435 Md. at 490, 79 A.3d at 940 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The language of Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) is plain and unambiguous\u2014 Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) applies only to pretrial identifications of \u201cthe defendant,\u201d and not to pretrial identifications of a co-defendant. Significantly, where Maryland Rule 4-263(d) applies to co-defendants, the language of the Rule says as much; the word \u201cco-defendant\u201d is found in three of Maryland Rule 4-263(d)\u2019s other provisions. First, Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(1) requires the State to disclose \u201c[a]ll written and all oral statements of the defendant and of any co-defendant that relate to the offense charged and all material and information ... that relate to the acquisition of such statements[.]\u201d Second, Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(2) requires the State to disclose \u201c[pjrior criminal convictions, pending charges, and probationary status of the defendant and of any co-defendant[.]\u201d And third, Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(6)(G) requires the State to disclose \u201c[a]ll material or information in any form, whether or not admissible, that tends to impeach a State\u2019s witness, including ... the failure of the witness to identify the defendant or a co-defendant[.]\u201d</p> <p id=\"b170-6\" pgmap=\"170(106) 171(37)\">Each party contends that Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(6)(G) supports its position. Green asserts that, by requiring the State to disclose a pretrial failure to identify a co-defendant, Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(6)(G) implies that the State must also routinely disclose a pretrial identification of a co-defendant. By contrast, the State argues that, by referring to co-defendants, Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(6)(G)\u2014as well as Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(l) and (d)(2)\u2014establish that the lack of a reference to co-defendants in Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) was intentional. In our view, the State has the better part of the argument. Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(6)(G), (d)(1), and (d)(2) demonstrate that, where a provision of Maryland Rule 4-263 applies to co-defendants, the provision explicitly states that it applies to co-defendants. The plain language of Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) supports the conclusion that Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) applies only to the defendant, and not to co-defendants.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b171-5\" pgmap=\"171(120) 172(239)\">Our interpretation of Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) is also supported by the circumstance that Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) is not the only provision of Maryland Rule 4-263(d) that expressly refers to the defendant, but does not apply to a co-defendant. This leads to the conclusion that Maryland Rule 4-263(d) expressly delineates when provisions apply to the defendant, but not a co-defendant. In addition to Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B), three other provisions of Maryland Rule 4-263(d) apply only to the defendant. Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(4) requires the State to disclose \u201c[a]ll evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts committed by the defendant that the State\u2019s Attorney intends to offer at a hearing or at trial pursuant to Rule 5\u2014404(b)[.]\u201d (Emphasis added). Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(10) requires the State to provide \u201c[t]he opportunity to inspect, copy, and photograph all items obtained from or belonging to the defendant, whether or not the State\u2019s Attorney intends to use the item at a hearing or at trial.\u201d (Emphasis added). And, Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(5) requires the State to disclose \u201c[a]ll material or information in any form, whether or not admissible, that tends to exculpate the defendant or negate or mitigate the defendant\u2019s guilt or punishment as to the offense charged[.]\u201d (Emphasis added). Like Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B), Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(4), (d)(10), and (d)(5) are provisions that, by their plain language, extend the State\u2019s discovery obligations to matters involving only the defendant, not a co-defendant. As such, Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) is not an anomaly. Just as we would not read into Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(4), (d)(10), or (d)(5) a requirement that the State\u2019s discovery obligations include a co-defendant as well as the defendant, we would not alter the plain language of Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B). In short, certain provisions of Maryland Rule 4\u2014263(d) do not require the State to disclose information that relates to a co-defendant. To accept Green\u2019s position that, as a general matter, Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) applies to pretrial identifications of both the defendant and a co-defendant would read into the Rule language that is not there, potentially affecting interpretation of other provisions of the Rule, which also only apply to the defendant.</p> <p id=\"b172-5\" pgmap=\"172(108) 173(15)\">We acknowledge that there may be cases, such as this one, where a defendant alleges that a pretrial identification of a co-defendant is relevant and, thus, should be disclosed under Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B). In such instances, however, the correct resolution is not to read into Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) the requirement that the State disclose pretrial identifications of a co-defendant. Instead, the proper inquiry is whether the pretrial identification of the co-defendant constitutes \u201crelevant material or information regarding ... pretrial identification of the defendant\u201d under Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B). Stated otherwise, a defendant\u2019s allegation of prejudice based on the nondisclosure of a pretrial identification of a co-defendant does not require departing from the plain meaning of Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B)\u2019s language.</p> <p id=\"b173-5\" pgmap=\"173\">We conclude that the language of Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) is unambiguous because it plainly does not require disclosure of the pretrial identification of a co-defendant. Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) does not become ambiguous when considered together with Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(6)(G), which requires the disclosure of the failure to identify a co-defendant pretrial. These are separate provisions of Maryland Rule 4-263(d), and, like other provisions, reflect instances in which the Rule applies to the defendant, or to the defendant and a co-defendant. Our holding in this case fully comports with Maryland Rule 4-263(d)\u2019s purposes of preventing unfair surprise and assisting in the preparation of a defense. Because Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) is unambiguous, we decline to add the phrase \u201cor a co-defendant\u201d \u201cso as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the Rule.\u201d Williams, 435 Md. at 490, 79 A.3d at 940 (brackets, citation, and internal quotation marks omitted).</p> <p id=\"b173-6\" pgmap=\"173\">Given that Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) is unambiguous, we are not required to examine its history, but we elect to do so \u201cas a confirmatory process.\u201d State v. Rice, 447 Md. 594, 623, 136 A.3d 720, 737 (2016) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In 1977, this Court adopted a predecessor of Maryland Rule 4-263, former Maryland Rule 741. Former Maryland Rule 741(a) was entitled \u201cDisclosure Without Request,\u201d and stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b173-7\" pgmap=\"173\">Without the necessity of a request by the defendant, the State\u2019s Attorney shall furnish to the defendant:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b173-8\" pgmap=\"173\">1.

Thus, like current Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B), former Maryland Rule 741(a)(2)(c) applied only to disclosure of pretrial identifications of the defendant, not a co-defendant.</p> <p id=\"b174-6\" pgmap=\"174\">In 1984, without substantive amendment, former Maryland Rule 741(a)(2)(c) was replaced by Maryland Rule 4-263(a)(2)(C). In 2007, Maryland Rule 4-263(a)(2)(C) remained identical to former Maryland Rule 741(a)(2)(c), except that the words \u201cby the defendant\u201d had been deleted from the phrase \u201c[w]ithout the necessity of a request by the defendant,\u201d so that the Rule read, in pertinent part, \u201c[without the necessity of a request, the State\u2019s Attorney shall furnish to the defendant: ...

See id. at 110. In proposed Maryland Rule 4-263(b)(4)(C), the Rules Committee recommended replacing the word \u201cfurnish\u201d with the word \u201cprovide,\u201d and recommended adding the phrase \u201cExcept for the privileged work product of the State\u2019s Attorney as defined in subsection (d)(1) of this Rule\u201d to the beginning of the sentence.

Members of the Court inquired whether, in formulating its recommendations, the Rules Committee had considered the [ABA Standards], and the answer was that those Standards had not been considered. In light of the controversy with respect to some of the [Rules] Committee\u2019s proposals, the Court deferred action on them.</blockquote> <p id=\"b176-5\" pgmap=\"176\">Id.

Id. at 84. Significantly, however, the Rules Committee did not propose adding a reference to co-defendants to the provision that required disclosure of a pretrial identification of the defendant.

[Maryland Rule 4-263](d)(7) follows the current Rule, and the Rules Committee saw no need to expand the Rule. The ABA Standard requires only that the State inform the defense of electronic surveillance and does not require disclosure of relevant material concerning it. To that extent, subsection (d)(7) is broader than the ABA Standard. With respect to the disclosure of information regarding specific searches and seizures, subsection (d)(7) is comparable to ABA Standard ll-2.1(d).</blockquote> <p id=\"b177-8\" pgmap=\"177\">Rules Committee, Supplement to One Hundred Fifty-Eighth Report at 41-42 (emphasis added).</p> <p id=\"b177-9\" pgmap=\"177(47) 178(130)\">From our perspective, there is nothing in the history of Maryland Rule 4-263 to indicate that the omission of the word \u201cco-defendant\u201d in Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) was unintentional or an oversight. We are aware that Green contends that the history of Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) demonstrates an intent to include co-defendants and to harmonize the Rule with the ABA Standards concerning discovery. What Green draws our attention to about the history of Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) is not persuasive. The passage in Appendix C is a far cry from evidencing an intent to have Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) apply to pretrial identifications of a co-defendant. The passage references the respective requirements of Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(6)(G) and Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B), and explicitly states an intent not to expand Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B). ABA Standard ll-2.1(a)(vii) is a broad standard that applies to numerous discovery requirements, and the desire to harmonize Maryland Rule 4-263 with the ABA Standards in no way reflects the purpose to expand Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) to require disclosure of pretrial identifications of co-defendants.</p> <p id=\"b178-5\" pgmap=\"178(206) 179(45)\">It is significant that the Rules Committee stated that it \u201csaw no need to expand\u201d Maryland Rule 4-263 with respect to pretrial identifications or otherwise. It is reasonable to infer from this statement that the Rules Committee considered, but intentionally refrained from, adding a reference to co-defendants to proposed Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B). Indeed, the Rules Committee included a reference to co-defendants in proposed Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(6)(G), which would require the State to disclose a failure \u201cto identify the defendant or a co-defendant\u201d pretrial. Rules Committee, Supplement to One Hundred Fifty-Eighth Report at 84. And, tellingly, in Appendix C, the Rules Committee stated that proposed Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(6)(G) lacked a counterpart in ABA Standard 11-2.1. See id. at 40. In other words, the Rules Committee included a reference to co-defendants in proposed Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(6)(G) on its own initiative, not in the course of following ABA Standard 11-2.1. This circumstance demonstrates that the Rules Committee was well aware that it could include a reference to co-defendants in proposed Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B). And, by its own assessment, the Rules Committee knew that ABA Standard ll-2.1(a)(vii) \u201cwould seem to apply to the identification (or not) of anyone[.]\u201d Rules Committee, Supplement to One Hundred Fifty-Eighth Report at 41. Nonetheless, the Rules Committee \u201csaw no need to expand\u201d Maryland Rule 4-263\u2019s requirements regarding disclosure of pretrial identifications. Id. This history reinforces our conclusion that the absence of a reference to a co-defendant in proposed Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) was intentional.</p> <p id=\"b179-5\" pgmap=\"179\">In sum, Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B)\u2019s plain language and history compel our holding that Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) does not require as a general matter the State to disclose during discovery a State\u2019s witness\u2019s pretrial identification of a co-defendant. We hold that the State\u2019s obligation under Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) is governed by its plain language\u2014 ie., the State is obligated to disclose \u201crelevant material or information regarding ... pretrial identification of the defendant[.]\u201d There may be cases, such as this one, in which a defendant contends that a pretrial identification of a co-defendant constitutes relevant information regarding the pretrial identification of the defendant. Below in Part II, we address whether the pretrial identification of the co-defendant in this case was subject to disclosure under Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) as relevant material or information regarding the pretrial identification of the defendant.</p> <p id=\"b179-6\" pgmap=\"179\">II.

Stated otherwise, Green argues that Carter\u2019s identification constituted \u201crelevant material or information regarding .,. pretrial identification of the defendant[.]\u201d Md. R. 4-263(d)(7)(B). Green asserts that the Court of Special Appeals erred in concluding that adopting his position would cause the State\u2019s discovery obligations to depend on the defense\u2019s trial strategy. Green maintains that the record demonstrates that the State intended to introduce Carter\u2019s identification of Copeland, regardless of his trial strategy. Green contends that, had his trial counsel known of Carter\u2019s pretrial identification of Copeland, the defense\u2019s trial strategy might have differed.</p> <p id=\"b180-5\" pgmap=\"180\">Green argues that his position is supported by Collins, 373 Md. at 146 n.9, 816 A.2d at 928 n.9, in which this Court commented that \u201cthe State was required by [Maryland Rule] 4-263[ (d)(7)(B) ] to produce not only statements containing the identification, but also any and all other statements made by [the State\u2019s witness] regarding who[m] he saw or did not see commit the act.\u201d Green asserts that Carter\u2019s pretrial identification of Copeland was a statement regarding whom she did not see perform the shooting. Green contends that the importance of Carter\u2019s identification of Copeland establishes that the error was not harmless. Green argues that the prosecutor\u2019s reliance on Carter\u2019s identification during the State\u2019s closing argument demonstrated the importance of Carter\u2019s identification to the State\u2019s case.</p> <p id=\"b180-6\" pgmap=\"180\">The State responds that Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B)\u2019s use of the words \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201cregarding\u201d refer to circumstances surrounding a pretrial identification of a defendant\u2014 not a pretrial identification of a co-defendant. The State contends that requiring the disclosure of a pretrial identification of a co-defendant expands the meaning of \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201cregarding,\u201d such that Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) would fail to provide clear notice to the State regarding its discovery obligations. The State argues that, although Carter testified that she told detectives that she could identify Copeland, it is unclear whether this occurred \u201cpretrial.\u201d The State asserts that, in the event of a discovery violation, the circuit court should impose the least severe sanction, that is consistent with Maryland Rule 4-263\u2019s purposes, and that, in this case, the proper remedy was permitting cross-examination of Carter about her pretrial identification of Copeland.</p> <p id=\"b180-7\" pgmap=\"180\">Relevant Case Law</p> <p id=\"b180-8\" pgmap=\"180(20) 181(130)\">In Williams, 364 Md. at 164, 771 A.2d at 1084, this Court held that a law enforcement officer\u2019s surveillance observations of the defendant, if used by the State for purposes of identification, is a pretrial identification subject to disclosure under Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B). In Williams, id. at 178, 167-68, 771 A.2d at 1092, 1086, this Court determined that the State violated Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(JB) where, before trial, a prosecutor proffered that a law enforcement officer could not identify the defendant, but, at trial, the officer testified that he had made surveillance observations of the defendant and then identified the defendant in court. Of particular significance to this case, this Court concluded that the information that may be subject to mandatory disclosure under Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) is not limited to State-orchestrated identification procedures, such as showups, lineups, and photographic arrays. See id. at 172-73, 771 A.2d at 1089.</p> <p id=\"b181-5\" pgmap=\"181(243) 182(98)\">In Williams, id. at 164-65, 771 A.2d at 1084, the defendant was charged with distribution of cocaine; the charges stemmed from the execution of a search warrant at an apartment. The State contended that, shortly before execution of the warrant, the defendant entered the apartment, which was under law enforcement surveillance, to deliver cocaine. See id. at 165, 771 A.2d at 1085. In Williams, id. at 166, 771 A.2d at 1085, in response to a request for disclosure from the defendant\u2019s counsel, the State filed discovery stating that the defendant had not been identified through a pretrial identification procedure. Subsequently, the defendant moved to suppress any unlawful pretrial identifications of him. See id. at 166, 771 A.2d at 1085. Immediately prior to a hearing on the motion to suppress, the prosecutor proffered that the law enforcement officer\u2019s testimony would not be an identification because the officer would testify only as to the general description of a man who entered the apartment. See id. at 166, 771 A.2d at 1085. At the hearing, the prosecutor again proffered that, while surveilling an apartment for suspected drug activity, a law enforcement officer had seen a man enter the apartment. See id. at 167, 771 A.2d at 1086. The prosecutor also proffered that the officer had observed \u201cthe stature, the size, the height,\u201d and race of the man who entered the apartment. See id. at 167, 771 A.2d at 1086. The prosecutor proffered, however, that the officer would not be able to identify the man who entered the apartment as the defendant. See id. at 166-67, 771 A.2d at 1085-86. The trial court found that no pretrial identification of the defendant had occurred, and determined that the State had complied with its discovery obligations. See id. at 167, 771 A.2d at 1086. At an unrelated pretrial motion hearing, the prosecutor again indicated that the law enforcement officer could identify the man who entered the apartment only by \u201csize, height, and weight[.]\u201d See id. at 167, 771 A.2d at 1086.</p> <p id=\"b182-4\" pgmap=\"182\">Contrary to the prosecutor\u2019s multiple proffers, at trial, the officer identified the defendant as the man who entered the apartment. See id. 167-68, 771 A.2d at 1086. The defendant\u2019s counsel objected and moved to strike the officer\u2019s identification of the defendant. See id. at 168, 771 A.2d at 1086. The trial court overruled the objection and denied the motion to strike. See id. at 168, 771 A.2d at 1086.</p> <p id=\"b182-5\" pgmap=\"182\">Only one State\u2019s witness other than the officer placed the defendant in the apartment on the night in question. See id. at 165, 771 A.2d at 1085. Testifying pursuant to a plea agreement, the witness stated that the defendant entered the apartment, put a foil-wrapped package on the kitchen counter, and said to \u201ctake whatever off the top.\u201d Id. at 165, 771 A.2d at 1085. After the defendant left the apartment, law enforcement officers executed a search warrant and found cocaine in the apartment. See id. at 165, 771 A.2d at 1084-85.</p> <p id=\"b182-6\" pgmap=\"182(124) 183(47)\">After being convicted, the defendant moved for a new trial, contending that the State had violated Maryland Rule 4-263 by failing to disclose during discovery the officer\u2019s pretrial identification of the defendant. See Williams, 364 Md. at 168, 771 A.2d at 1086. The trial court denied the motion for a new trial, determining that the State had not withheld a pretrial identification of the defendant by the officer, as the prosecutor did not know that the officer had made an out-of-court identification of the defendant and would identify the defendant at trial. See id. at 168, 771 A.2d at 1086-87. In other words, the trial court found that the inaccuracy in the prosecutor\u2019s proffer had been inadvertent because the prosecutor had been surprised by the officer\u2019s identification of the defendant. See id. at 169 n.9, 168, 771 A.2d at 1087 n.9, 1086. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed, and this Court reversed and remanded for a new trial.

The State contended that Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B)</p> <blockquote id=\"AjJ\" pgmap=\"183\">is limited to [S]tate-orchestrated identification procedures, such as a photographic array, a show[]up, or a line[]up, because a purpose of the discovery disclosures is to \u2018force the defendant to file certain motions before trial, including a motion to suppress ... \u2019 and a [law enforcement] officer\u2019s surveillance observations would not be the subject of such a pretrial motion.</blockquote> <p id=\"b183-5\" pgmap=\"183\">Id. at 172, 771 A.2d at 1089 (ellipsis in original) (citation omitted).</p> <p id=\"b183-6\" pgmap=\"183\">This Court \u201cf[ou]nd the State\u2019s position faulty[,]\u201d and stated in relevant part:</p> <blockquote id=\"b183-7\" pgmap=\"183\">Simply because we recognize the relationship between the discovery and pretrial motions rules, in that discovery is necessary so that mandatory pretrial motions can be filed, does not mean that we limit discovery to strictly that which may be utilized in support of a pretrial motion. ...

One can hardly imagine a greater obstacle to a[ defendant\u2019s] defense than the State\u2019s declaration prior to trial that the only corroborating witness could not specifically identify the defendant, while the testimony of the witness at trial was nothing shy of a clear and positive identification\u2014\u201cit was [the defendant] who is seated at the defense table ...\u201d Identification testimony may be outcome determinative and hence, any solid preparation of a defense demands this information. Furthermore, unlike statements made by the defendant, identification testimony naturally comes from third parties.

See id. at 175, 771 A.2d at 1090-91. This Court noted that the prosecutor had unequivocally proffered that the officer could not identify the defendant; thus, the prosecutor\u2019s proffer was inconsistent with the officer\u2019s in-court identification of the defendant.

See Green, 231 Md.App. at 74, 149 A.3d at 1171. As such, the Court of Special Appeals did not expressly address the question of when Carter advised the detectives that she could identify Copeland and whether this constituted a pretrial identification.</p> <p id=\"b189-4\" pgmap=\"189\">The record demonstrates that Carter advised law enforcement officers before trial of her ability to identify Copeland as the person who was not the shooter. It is undisputed that, at trial, Carter testified that she saw two men at the scene of the shooting with Myers, and she identified Copeland as the person who was not the shooter. It is also undisputed that, one or two days after the shooting, Carter informed detectives that she was unable to describe the face of either person\u2014Le. the shooter and the person who was not the shooter. The record reflects that, at trial, Carter testified that, after the shooting, she recognized a photograph of Copeland in the newspaper. Carter was uncertain of the date on which she recognized Copeland. Carter acknowledged that, upon recognizing the photograph of Copeland, she did not call anyone or inform anyone. Green\u2019s counsel asked Carter, however: \u201c[W]hen did you eventually tell any of the detectives that you knew who [ ] Copeland was?\u201d Significantly, Carter responded: \u201cWhen I went over\u2014over everything again with them, what I saw\u2014everything that I saw that day.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b189-5\" pgmap=\"189(191) 190(44)\">To be sure, Carter did not specify when she \u201cwent over everything again\u201d with the detectives. But, twenty days before the first day of trial, the State requested a writ to compel Copeland to appear at trial. Notably, Copeland\u2019s plea agreement provided that, if either party called Copeland as a witness in this case, he would invoke his privilege against self-incrimination in response to any question of substance. As such, the State\u2019s purpose in securing Copeland\u2019s appearance could not have been to call him as a witness. Instead, as the prosecutor acknowledged at a bench conference, the State\u2019s purpose was to have Carter identify Copeland. Specifically, the prosecutor stated: \u201c[T]he [S]tate\u2019s intention at this time\u2014 and this was the reason for the writ for [ ] Copeland[.] ... It is the [S]tate\u2019s proffer to the court that we believe that [ ] Carter, upon seeing [] Copeland, will be able to positively identify him.\u201d The State\u2019s request for a writ to compel Copeland\u2019s appearance three weeks before trial leads to the inescapable conclusion that, sometime before the request for the writ\u2014ie., pretrial\u2014Carter told detectives that she recognized Copeland. Otherwise, there would have been no reason for the State to request the writ for Copeland\u2019s appearance, as Copeland\u2019s plea agreement with the State provided that he would invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and not answer any substantive questions.</p> <p id=\"b190-5\" pgmap=\"190\">More tellingly, though, at trial, at a bench conference during Carter\u2019s testimony, before her identification of Copeland, the prosecutor informed the circuit court: \u201cWe intend to have [ ] Carter specifically ... identify [ ] Copeland either by face, and say, yes, that\u2019s him, or that looks like him or whatever she says, then ask her about the physique, whether that\u2019s consistent with the first or the second person or anything to that effect.\u201d In other words, before Carter\u2019s identification of Copeland, the prosecutor advised that the sole purpose of Copeland\u2019s presence was for Carter to identify him.</p> <p id=\"b190-6\" pgmap=\"190(217) 191(73)\">Equally telling, the record reveals other circumstances giving rise to the conclusion that the prosecutor intended for Carter to identify Copeland at trial\u2014ie., that Carter had advised detectives pretrial of her ability to identify Copeland. Before opening statements, the prosecutor stated that he wanted Copeland to appear in the courtroom during Carter\u2019s testimony so that she could identify him. During opening statement, the prosecutor said: \u201c[Y]ou have one eyewitness putting two people, one which will be very clearly identified as [ ] Copeland and one that loosely identifies as [ ] Green, at the scene of the shooting[.]\u201d During direct-examination of Carter, the prosecutor asked Carter whether she would be able to identify the tall, skinny man who had stood next to the Mustang\u2019s driver\u2019s door\u2014ie., the person who was not the shooter\u2014if he were shown to her. Carter responded in the affirmative. At a bench conference, Green\u2019s counsel expressed surprise that Carter would be able to identify' Copeland. In response, the prosecutor did not claim that he too was surprised to learn that Carter could identify Copeland. Instead, the prosecutor stated that \u201c[t]here [wa]s no surprise\u201d because Green\u2019s counsel knew that multiple witnesses could identify Copeland. Significantly, at no time did the prosecutor advise the circuit court that he, like Green\u2019s counsel, had been unaware of Carter\u2019s ability to identify Copeland. The State\u2019s request for a writ nearly three weeks before trial, as well as the prosecutor\u2019s announcement at a bench conference and during the State\u2019s opening statement that Carter was expected to identify Copeland, demonstrate that Carter\u2019s in-court identification of Copeland was not unexpected\u2014to the contrary, it was planned in advance based on Carter having informed detectives pretrial of her ability to identify Copeland.</p> <p id=\"b191-5\" pgmap=\"191\"> Our precedent mandates the conclusion that Carter\u2019s informing detectives before trial of her ability to identify Copeland as the person who was not the shooter constituted a pretrial identification of Copeland. For purposes of Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B), the phrase \u201cpretrial identification\u201d is not \u201climited to [S]tate-orchestrated identification procedures, such as a photographic array, a show[ ]up, or a line[ ]up[.]\u201d Williams, 364 Md. at 172-73, 771 A.2d at 1089. For example, in Williams, id. at 178, 771 A.2d at 1092, this Court \u201cconcludefd] that [a law enforcement officer\u2019s surveillance observation, if used by the State for purposes of identification, [wa]s \u2018relevant material regarding a pretrial identification\u2019 \u201d under Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B). And, notably, in Simons, 159 Md.App. at 574-75, 860 A.2d at 423, guided by this Court\u2019s holding in Williams, the Court of Special Appeals held that a pretrial identification occurred where a witness stated to law enforcement officers that she saw the defendant near the scene of the crime around the time the crime was committed. Here, a pretrial identification of Copeland occurred when Carter informed detectives before trial that she could identify Copeland as being present with the victim but not being the shooter.</p> <p id=\"b191-6\" pgmap=\"191(84) 192(87)\">It is of no moment that Carter may or may not have informed law enforcement officers that she recognized Copeland in a photograph in a newspaper, or that the officers were not present when Carter viewed the newspaper. Just as it is unnecessary for an identification to occur during a lineup, showup, or other formal identification procedure, see Williams, 364 Md. at 172-73, 771 A.2d at 1089, it is also unnecessary for an eyewitness\u2019s recognition of a person who was at the scene of a crime to occur in front of law enforcement officers. What matters is that the eyewitness advises officers of his or her ability to identify the person. At that point, the State is charged with knowledge of the eyewitness\u2019s ability to identify the person. As we explained in Williams, id. at 177, 771 A.2d at 1092, \u201cthe State is charged with the knowledge of all seemingly pertinent facts related to the charge [that] are known to\u201d law enforcement officers. (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p> <p id=\"b192-5\" pgmap=\"192\">Having determined that Carter made a pretrial identification of Copeland and that law enforcement officers were aware of the identification, we must next determine whether that identification was subject to mandatory disclosure under Maryland Rule 4\u2014263(d)(7)(B). We start by reviewing Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B)\u2019s language. Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) does not simply require disclosure of pretrial identifications of defendants. Rather, Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) requires disclosure of \u201c[a]ll relevant material or information regarding ... pretrial identification of the defendant by a State\u2019s witness[.]\u201d (Emphasis added).</p> <p id=\"b192-6\" pgmap=\"192\">In Collins, 373 Md. at 146, 816 A.2d at 928, this Court underscored the importance of the phrase \u201crelevant material or information regarding\u201d in Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B). Specifically, this Court stated its holding as follows: \u201c[The witnesses prior inconsistent statement [about not seeing anyone at the scene of the crime], under the circumstances of this case, falls within the scope of \u2018relevant material or information regarding pretrial identification of the defendant by a witness for the State.\u2019\u201d Id. at 146, 816 A.2d at 928 (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted). The phrase \u201crelevant material or information regarding\u201d is plainly not limited to the mere occurrence of a pretrial identification of a defendant.</p> <p id=\"b192-7\" pgmap=\"192(43) 193(109)\"> Instead, the phrase \u201crelevant material or information regarding\u201d renders Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) applicable to more than just a pretrial identification procedure identifying the defendant. For example, in Collins, id. at 146, 816 A.2d at 928, this Court held that Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) requires disclosure of a failure to identify the defendant pretrial. And, in Williams, 364 Md. at 178, 167-68, 180, 771 A.2d at 1092, 1086, 1093, this Court concluded that the State violated Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) where, contrary to a prosecutor\u2019s proffer, a law enforcement officer testified that he had observed the defendant during surveillance, where the officer had not participated in a pretrial photographic array or lineup identifying the defendant. Thus, in both Collins and Williams, this Court found violations of Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B), even though there had not been a pretrial identification procedure, such as a photographic array or lineup, in which the defendant was identified.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b193-5\" pgmap=\"193(118) 194(56)\">In addition to considering Maryland Rule 4-263\u2019s language, we also take into account its purposes\u2014\u201cto assist defendants in preparing their defense and to protect them from unfair surprise.\u201d Collins, 373 Md. at 146, 816 A.2d at 928 (quoting Williams, 364 Md. at 172, 771 A.2d at 1089). \u201cThe duty to disclose pre[ jtrial identifications ... is properly determined by interpreting the plain meaning of [Maryland] Rule [4-263] with proper deference to these policies.\u201d Collins, 373 Md. at 146-47, 816 A.2d at 928 (quoting Williams, 364 Md. at 172, 771 A.2d at 1089). Guided by Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B)\u2019s language and purposes, as well as our holdings in Collins and Williams, we conclude that a pretrial identification of a co-defendant is relevant information regarding pretrial identification of the defendant where the pretrial identification of the co-defendant is effectively the equivalent of a pretrial identification of the defendant. Stated otherwise, under the circumstances of this case, information regarding the pretrial identification of Copeland was relevant information regarding the pretrial identification of Green.</p> <p id=\"b194-5\" pgmap=\"194\">The facts of this case serve as a prime example of a pretrial identification of a co-defendant being effectively the equivalent of a pretrial identification of the defendant. It is undisputed that, at the time of the shooting, Myers, the victim, was in his truck, which was facing Copeland\u2019s Mustang. Carter testified that, as she was driving by the scene of the shooting, she saw two men. One man was shorter and stouter, wearing a hoodie, and standing off to the side of the road. The other man was taller and skinnier, wearing a hat with snowflakes, and standing near the Mustang\u2019s driver\u2019s seat. Carter heard a gunshot, looked into her driver\u2019s side-view mirror, and saw the shorter, stouter man shoot into the truck three times. Carter had not gotten a look at the face of the shorter, stouter man\u2014ie., the shooter\u2014because his hood was up. Carter had, however, gotten a look at the face of the tall, thin man\u2014ie., the person who was not the shooter. The record establishes that prior to trial Carter informed law enforcement officers of her ability to identify Copeland as the person who was not the shooter. And, at trial, Carter unequivocally identified Copeland as the person who was not the shooter. The State\u2019s theory of the case was that Green was the person with Copeland and was the shooter.</p> <p id=\"b194-6\" pgmap=\"194\">Given the State\u2019s theory of the case, Carter\u2019s identification of Copeland as the person who was not responsible for the shooting established that Green was the shooter. Carter\u2019s pretrial identification of Copeland was in essence the equivalent of a pretrial identification of Green as the shooter. As such, Carter\u2019s pretrial identification of Copeland was relevant information regarding the pretrial identification of Green, and was subject to mandatory disclosure under Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B).</p> <p id=\"b195-4\" pgmap=\"195\">We disagree with the State\u2019s assertion at oral argument that our holding requires prosecutors to be \u201csoothsayers\u201d by predicting what defense strategy will be. Indeed, we conclude that the Court of Special Appeals erred in determining that the State\u2019s discovery obligations would depend on the defendant\u2019s trial strategy, \u201cwhich often will be unknown prior to trial.\u201d Green, 231 Md.App. at 74, 149 A.3d at 1171. The Court of Special Appeals reasoned that Carter\u2019s identification of Copeland as the person who was not the shooter implicated Green as the shooter only because Green testified that he, Copeland, and Myers were the only ones at the scene of the shooting. See id. at 73-74, 149 A.3d at 1171. The record, however, establishes that Carter told detectives before trial that she could identify Copeland as the person who was not the shooter, and that the State intended to use Carter\u2019s identification of Copeland at trial in its case-in-chief. We have no reason to imagine that there will not be other cases in which the State may be aware that a witness\u2019s pretrial identification of a co-defendant will effectively identify the defendant. Our holding simply requires the State to disclose information that would reasonably be expected to be known to prosecutors, and that is relevant to the pretrial identification of the defendant.</p> <p id=\"b195-5\" pgmap=\"195(145) 196(136)\">Independent of Green\u2019s testimony, Carter\u2019s pretrial identification of Copeland was known to the pros\u00e9cutor and relevant to the pretrial identification of Green. The State\u2019s theory of the case was that only Green, Copeland, and Myers were at the scene of the shooting. At trial, the State introduced evidence aimed at establishing that Green was the third person at the scene of the shooting\u2014ie., that Green was the shooter. Watson, Myer\u2019s girlfriend, and both of Myers\u2019s parents testified that, two days before the shooting, Green and Copeland confronted Myers about the burglary of Copeland\u2019s residence. Carter, Wisniewski, Miller, and Deputy First Class Griffin testified that, around the time of the shooting, two people were in or near a dark Mustang that was at or near the scene of the shooting. Detective Swonger prepared Cellular Analysis Reports that showed that, around the time of the shooting, Copeland\u2019s and Green\u2019s cell phones connected to cell towers in the general vicinity of Myers\u2019s residence. Peacock, Green\u2019s girlfriend, testified that, on the day of the shooting, Green told her: \u201cSomething bad might happen.\u201d Significantly, according to Peacock, later that day, Green told her that he had been present at the scene of the shooting, but that he did not do it. During the State\u2019s opening statement, the prosecutor asserted that the short, stocky person who shot Myers loosely identified as Green. During the State\u2019s closing argument, the prosecutor contended: \u201cThe shooter was the short[,] stocky guy[,] and had a bushy beard. [] Green was and is the shorter[,] stockier guy[,] and had, by his own admission[,] and[,] again[,] as supported by the evidence we presented, a bushy beard when [ ] Myers was shot.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b196-5\" pgmap=\"196\">In sum, the State presented evidence that Green, Copeland, and Myers were the only people at the scene of the shooting. Before Green testified, Carter\u2019s identification of Copeland as the person who was not the shooter, in the context of the State\u2019s theory of the case and the evidence presented at trial in support of that theory, identified Green as the shooter. The State obviously knew in advance of trial that Carter\u2019s identification of Copeland as the person who was not the shooter was not only relevant, but also highly probative as to the issue of the shooter\u2019s identity.</p> <p id=\"b196-6\" pgmap=\"196(139) 197(27)\">Our holding does not require prosecutors to predict the future. As a prosecutor prepares for trial, he or she becomes aware of evidence that identifies the defendant. A prosecutor is in a position to determine whether a witness\u2019s pretrial identification of a co-defendant is the equivalent of a pretrial identification of the defendant as the person responsible for the crime. For example, here, the prosecutor was certainly aware in advance of trial of the State\u2019s theory that Green, Copeland, and Myers were the only people at the scene of the shooting and that Copeland was not the shooter. The prosecutor knew in advance that, if Carter identified Copeland as the person who was not the shooter, her identification of Copeland would essentially identify Green as the shooter. It was incumbent upon the prosecutor under Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) to disclose Carter\u2019s pretrial identification of Copeland, as Carter\u2019s pretrial identification of Copeland was relevant information as to the pretrial identification of Green as the shooter.</p> <p id=\"b197-5\" pgmap=\"197\"> Having established that the State violated Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) by failing to disclose Carter\u2019s pretrial identification of Copeland, we must next inquire as to whether the error was harmless. Under the doctrine of harmless error, \u201c[a]n appellate court does not reverse a conviction based on a trial court\u2019s error or abuse of discretion where the appellate court is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the trial court\u2019s error or abuse of discretion did not \u2018influence the verdict\u2019 to the defendant\u2019s detriment.\u201d Hall v. State, 437 Md. 534, 540-41, 87 A.3d 1287, 1291 (2014) (quoting Perez v. State, 420 Md. 57, 66, 21 A.3d 1048, 1054 (2011)) (brackets omitted); see also Dorsey v. State, 276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976).</p> <p id=\"b197-6\" pgmap=\"197(199) 198(46)\">Here, Carter\u2019s identification of Copeland as the person who was not the shooter was critical to the State\u2019s case. Carter was the State\u2019s only eyewitness to the shooting. Carter\u2019s testimony that Copeland was not the shooter was the only evidence that directly identified Green as the shooter. The other State\u2019s witnesses, at best, gave testimony demonstrating that Green and Copeland confronted Myers and testimony that placed Green at the scene of the shooting. For example, Watson and both of Myers\u2019s parents testified that, two days before the shooting, Green and Copeland visited Myers\u2019s residence and confronted him about the burglary of Copeland\u2019s residence. Detective Swonger\u2019s Cellular Analysis Reports established that, around the time of the shooting, Copeland\u2019s and Green\u2019s cell phones connected to cell towers in the general vicinity of Myers\u2019s residence. Peacock testified that, on the day of the shooting, Green said that he had been at the scene of the shooting, but denied that he had done it. Although the State produced evidence placing Green at the scene of the shooting and demonstrating that Green and Copeland had confronted Myers, Carter was the only eyewitness to the shooting. Significantly, the prosecutor referred to Carter\u2019s identification of Copeland as the person who was not the shooter at least once during the State\u2019s opening statement, and multiple times during the State\u2019s closing argument. During the State\u2019s closing argument, the prosecutor referred to Carter\u2019s identification of Copeland as a \u201ckey piece of evidence.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b198-5\" pgmap=\"198\">Undeniably, the State\u2019s failure to disclose Carter\u2019s pretrial identification of Copeland prejudiced Green. Green\u2019s counsel stated that it was a \u201csurprise\u201d to learn at trial that Carter was expected to identify Copeland. The State\u2019s failure to disclose Carter\u2019s pretrial identification of Copeland prevented Green\u2019s counsel from attempting to interview Carter about her identification of Copeland, and potentially performing research to determine if, or when, Carter had seen Copeland\u2019s photograph in a newspaper. Green\u2019s counsel lacked the ability to prepare to cross-examine Carter regarding the timing or remoteness of her pretrial identification of Copeland. Green\u2019s counsel was unable to prepare to question Carter as to whether anything in the newspaper article or other circumstances may have influenced Carter\u2019s testimony. Although Green\u2019s counsel theoretically could have formulated such questions without being told of Carter\u2019s pretrial identification of Copeland before trial, being aware of the pretrial identification would undoubtedly have aided Green\u2019s counsel\u2019s trial preparation.</p> <p id=\"b198-6\" pgmap=\"198\">In addition to providing Green\u2019s counsel the opportunity to interview Carter about her identification of Copeland and perform pretrial research, disclosure of Carter\u2019s pretrial identification of Copeland may have \u201cinfluenced [Green\u2019s] decision to accept a plea bargain[.]\u201d Simons, 159 Md.App. at 574, 860 A.2d at 423. In any event, \u201c[i]t is not for us to determine what, if any, response the defense could have prepared had it known of the prior inconsistent statement. It is enough to find that the defense was denied an adequate opportunity to do so, to its prejudice.\u201d Collins, 373 Md. at 148, 816 A.2d at 929.</p> <p id=\"b198-7\" pgmap=\"198(38) 199(116)\">In sum, we are far from convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the State\u2019s violation of Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) did not influence the verdict to Green\u2019s detriment. A failure to disclose a witness\u2019s pretrial identification is prejudicial, and thus not harmless error, where the witness\u2019s identification is critical to the State\u2019s case. For example, in Williams, 364 Md. at 179, 771 A.2d at 1093, this Court held that a failure to disclose a witness\u2019s pretrial identification was not harmless error where an accomplice was the only other witness to place the defendant at the scene of the crime. Similarly, in Simons, 159 Md.App. at 578, 860 A.2d at 425, the Court of Special Appeals held that a violation of Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) was not harmless error where the witness in question was the only person who saw the defendant at the scene of the crime around the time the crime occurred.</p> <p id=\"b199-4\" pgmap=\"199\">We reject the State\u2019s contention that cross-examination was the proper remedy for the violation of Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) in this case. As discussed above, the inability to engage in pretrial preparation hindered Green\u2019s counsel\u2019s ability to adequately prepare a defense and cross-examine Carter about her pretrial identification of Copeland. And, again, it need not be certain that Green\u2019s counsel would have actually prepared differently had he known in advance of Carter\u2019s pretrial identification of Copeland. All that is required to find that the violation was not harmless error is the circumstance that Green\u2019s counsel was denied the opportunity to prepare differently. See Collins, 373 Md. at 148, 816 A.2d at 929.</p> <p id=\"b199-5\" pgmap=\"199\">Contrary to the State\u2019s position, the prejudice to Green was not ameliorated by the circumstance that he testified that he, Copeland, and Myers were the only people at the scene of the shooting. Regardless of whether Green testified as such, Carter\u2019s identification of Copeland as the person who was not the shooter remained the only direct evidence that Green was the shooter. Independent of Green\u2019s testimony, Carter\u2019s identification of Copeland was crucial to the State\u2019s case.</p> <p id=\"b199-6\" pgmap=\"199(48) 200(64)\">Nor do we agree with the State\u2019s contention that any prejudice to Green from Carter\u2019s identification of Copeland was nullified by the circumstance that, according to the statement of charges, Carter indicated that the shooter was a short, stocky person and the non-shooter was the tall, thin person. Green apparently was, at the time, short and stocky. These circumstances may have given rise to the inference that Green was the shooter. By contrast, Carter\u2019s identification of Copeland as the person who was not the shooter directly implicated Green as the shooter. None of the State\u2019s other evidence did so. Thus, we conclude that the error in this case was not harmless.</p> <p id=\"b200-5\" pgmap=\"200\">Having held that the State violated Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B), and that the error was not harmless, our final task is to determine the appropriate remedy. In his briefs, Green did not specify the remedy sought, beyond requesting that we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. At oral argument, however, Green clarified that he simply desires a new trial, and that he does not request that we exclude Carter\u2019s identification of Copeland from the new trial. Consistently, in Williams, 364 Md. at 181, 771 A.2d at 1094, and Collins, 373 Md. at 149, 816 A.2d at 930, after finding violations of Maryland Rule 4\u2014263(d)(7)(B), this Court ordered new trials without instructing that the identification testimony in question be excluded from the new trials. We shall do likewise here, and order a new trial and refrain from ordering that Carter\u2019s identification of Copeland be excluded on remand.</p> <p id=\"b200-6\" pgmap=\"200\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

When this Court decided Collins in 2003, the provision that is now Maryland Rule 4\u2014263(d)(7)(B) was Maryland Rule 4-263(a)(2)(C).

To be sure, in Boone, 3 Md.App. at 13, 237 A.2d at 790, the Court of Special Appeals stated that the appellant and three others \"were jointly indicted for [ ] murder and robbery with a deadly weapon!.]\u201d The Court of Special Appeals did not expressly indicate that the appellant and three other individuals were charged in the same document.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"6\"> <p id=\"b171-6\" pgmap=\"171\">. Contrary to Green's position, there is a reasonable explanation as to why Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(6)(G) requires disclosure of a pretrial failure to identify a co-defendant, whereas Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) does not require disclosure of a pretrial identification of a co-defendant. Specifically, Maryland Rule 4-263 (d)(7)(B) does not share Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(6)(G)'s purpose of disclosing impeachment material to the defense. Maryland Rule 4\u2014263(d)(6) requires the State to disclose \"[a]ll material or information in any form, whether or not admissible, that tends to impeach a State\u2019s witness[.]\u201d A failure to identify a co-defendant pretrial clearly falls under this category, as it would cast doubt on any subsequent identification of the defendant by the witness. If a witness fails to identify a co-defendant, but identifies the defendant, this circumstance would call into question the witness\u2019s credibility, the witness\u2019s ability to observe, and the witness's ability to recall.</p> <p id=\"b171-7\" pgmap=\"171\">However, where, as here, a witness identifies a co-defendant before trial, this circumstance does not provide any grounds for impeachment under Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(6), as the witness's pretrial identification of the co-defendant would not constitute impeachment material. In short, a failure to identify a co-defendant pretrial is impeachable; a pretrial identification of a co-defendant is not. The rationale underlying the requirement of Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(6)(G) to disclose the failure to identify a co-defendant pretrial does not extend to the requirement of Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) to disclose pretrial identifications of the defendant.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"7\"> <p id=\"b176-8\" pgmap=\"176\">. In a Rules Order dated April 8, 2008, this Court rescinded the existing Maryland Rule 4-263 and added a new Maryland Rule 4-263.

To be subject to mandatory disclosure under Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B), material or information regarding pretrial identification of the defendant must be \"relevant\" to tire identification of the defendant, but it is not necessary that the material or information be found to be \"material,\" Although one of Maryland Rule 4-263's predecessors limited discoverable information to that which was \u201cmaterial,\u201d Maryland Rule 4-263 includes no such limitation.

For Maryland Rule 4-263's purposes, generally, information or material is \"relevant if it reasonably is calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and their probative value is not outweighed by any privacy interests, confidentiality, privilege, or other conflicting interest, including the burden of production.\u201d Cole v.

However, the Majority opinion interprets the discovery rule relating to a \u201cpretrial identification of the defendant\u201d in a way that is at odds with the language of the rule and that broadens its application well beyond an actual identification of the defendant. Accordingly, I cannot join the opinion and would affirm the well-reasoned opinion of the Court of Special Appeals on this issue. 231 Md.App. 53, 58-74, 149 A.3d 1159 (2016).</p> <p id=\"b201-4\" pgmap=\"201\">As the Majority opinion indicates, Doris Carter was originally able to say that the confrontation on Principio Road involved a short, stocky (or stout) man and a tall, thin man and that the short, stocky man was the shooter. Despite her initial inability to make any identifications of either man, she later realized, and advised the prosecution at some point in advance of taking the stand, that she could identify Mr. Copeland as the tall, thin man. The Majority opinion characterizes this as a \u201cpretrial identification\u201d of Mr. Copeland, which seems fair. Majority op. at 155-60, 171 A.3d at 1195-98.</p> <p id=\"b201-5\" pgmap=\"201\">I also agree that it is appropriate to refer to Mr. Copeland, as the Majority opinion does, as a \u201cco-defendant\u201d of Mr. Green, regardless of whether they were both charged in the same indictment or in separate indictments. Majority op. at 133-37, 171 A.3d at 1182-85.</p> <p id=\"b201-6\" pgmap=\"201\">I also agree with the Majority opinion that the criminal discovery rule, Maryland Rule 4-263, does not require that the State make advance disclosure of a pretrial identification of a co-defendant, such as Mr. Copeland. Majority op. at 137-47, 171 A.3d at 1184-91.</p> <p id=\"b201-7\" pgmap=\"201\">The Majority opinion then reasons, however, that Ms. Carter\u2019s pretrial identification of Mr. Copeland was also \u201crelevant ... information regarding .,. pretrial identification of [Mr. Green]\u201d for purposes of Rule 4-263. Majority op. at 102, 160-61, 171 A.3d at 1164-65, 1198-99. This is where, in my view, the Majority opinion\u2019s reasoning departs from the rule.</p> <p id=\"b201-8\" pgmap=\"201\">In order for there to be \u201crelevant ... information regarding ... pretrial identification of [Mr. Green],\u201d there must be a pretrial identification of Mr. Green. What \u201cpretrial identification of [Mr. Green]\u201d is at issue here?</p> <p id=\"b202-4\" pgmap=\"202\">There is no dispute that Ms. Carter did not place Mr. Green at the scene of the crime. So the Majority opinion cannot be referring to a pretrial identification of Mr. Green by Ms. Carter. Nor was there a pretrial identification of Mr. Green by another prosecution witness. As the Majority opinion recounts, two other witnesses observed parts of the confrontation on Principio Road, but neither of those witnesses identified either Mr. Green or Mr. Copeland.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b202-5\" pgmap=\"202\">Thus, there was no \u201cpretrial of identification of [Mr. Green]\u201d in this case. At trial, it was all the items of evidence, recounted in detail by the Majority opinion, that effectively proved that Mr. Green was the short, stocky man involved in the confrontation with Mr. Myers on Principio Road\u2014a fact that Mr. Green confirmed in his own testimony. Ms. Carter\u2019s identification of Mr. Copeland as the tall, thin man in that confrontation is one piece of the mosaic of relevant evidence that pointed to Mr. Green as the shooter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But this piece of the mosaic was not a \u201cpretrial identification of [Mr. Green].\u201d And, without a pretrial of identification of Mr. Green, there cannot be, in the language of the rule, \u201crelevant information\u201d concerning a nonexistent pretrial identification of Mr. Green.</p> <p id=\"b202-6\" pgmap=\"202(53) 203(101)\">The Majority opinion seeks to base its analysis on Williams v. State, 364 Md. 160, 771 A.2d 1082 (2001) and Collins v. State, 373 Md. 130, 816 A.2d 919 (2003). Both of those cases involved deficiencies in pretrial discovery concerning witnesses who were able to identify the defendant prior to trial and who made an identification of the defendant at trial. In Williams, the prosecution, in response to specific requests by the defense, inaccurately stated in pretrial discovery that the witness\u2014a police officer who had conducted a surveillance\u2014 would not be able to identify the defendant. In Collins, the prosecution failed to timely disclose that a witness who made pretrial and in-court identifications of the defendant had initially been unable to make that identification. Neither case concerned discovery of an identification of a co-defendant, or other evidence that might inculpate the defendant but was not itself an identification of the defendant.</p> <p id=\"b203-5\" pgmap=\"203\">Ultimately, the Majority opinion rests its holding on the proposition that, in this case, \u201ca pretrial identification of a co-defendant [is] effectively the equivalent of a pretrial identification of the defendant.\u201d Majority op. at 162, 171 A.3d at 1199. The Majority opinion reasons that, because Ms. Carter had described the shooter as short and stocky and the non-shooter as tall and thin, her identification of Mr. Copeland as the tall, thin man was effectively an identification of Mr. Green as the shooter. But the same could be said for Detective Lewis\u2019 testimony that, at the time of the offense, Mr. Green was 5\u20197\u201d and 190 pounds while Mr. Copeland was 5\u201911\u201d and 160 pounds. That testimony also established that, in relation to each other, Mr. Copeland was the tall, thin man and Mr. Green the short, stocky man, and thus \u201ceffectively\u201d identified Mr. Green as the shooter.</p> <p id=\"b203-6\" pgmap=\"203\">In any event, it is easy for us to say, with the record of the entire trial before us (including Mr. Green\u2019s own testimony), that Ms. Carter\u2019s identification of Mr. Copeland or Detective Lewis\u2019 testimony concerning the height and weight of the two men\u2014or some other item of evidence pointing to Mr. Green as the shooter that was known to the prosecution in advance of trial\u2014was \u201ceffectively\u201d an identification of Mr. Green. It is quite another thing to create a rule of pretrial discovery based on that hindsight observation. What other sort of inculpatory evidence, viewed from that perspective, will be deemed to be \u201ceffectively the equivalent\u201d of a pretrial identification of a defendant?</p> <p id=\"b204-4\" pgmap=\"204\">In my view, the Majority opinion\u2019s interpretation of the rule undermines the notion, frequently expressed by this Court, that the rule is a \u201cprecise rubric,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and renders the rule\u2019s application uncertain for those who must apply it without the benefit of hindsight.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b204-5\" pgmap=\"204\">Chief Judge Barbera and Judge Hotten have advised that they join this opinion.</p> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b202-7\" pgmap=\"202\">. Indeed, only Mr. Green himself in his own testimony definitively placed himself at the scene of the shooting. As the Court of Special Appeals noted, the pretrial discovery obligations of the prosecution under Rule 4-263 cannot be contingent on what testimony the defendant later gives at trial\u2014which is likely to be unknown to the prosecution in advance of the trial. See 231 Md.App. at 73-74, 149 A.3d 1159.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"2\"> <p id=\"b202-8\" pgmap=\"202\">. It may well be that it would be fairer for the prosecution to disclose that piece of evidence sooner rather than later, as the prosecution was required to do with many other pieces of that mosaic (although not all inculpatory testimony is necessarily going to be revealed in pretrial discovery). Perhaps the discovery rule should be amended to encompass pretrial identifications of co-defendants. But that is not the question before us.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"3\"> <p id=\"b204-13\" pgmap=\"204\">. E.g., Williams, 364 Md. at 171, 771 A.2d 1082.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"4\"> <p id=\"b204-14\" pgmap=\"204(135) 205(18)\">. It is also notable that issue before us\u2014Ms. Carter\u2019s pretrial identification of Mr. Copeland\u2014is a matter of pretrial discovery, not the admissibility of that evidence. Ms. Carter\u2019s in-court identification of Mr, Copeland was clearly admissible. Mr. Green's counsel was free to cross-examine her about that identification in light of her failure to make any identifications in her initial interview with detectives\u2014and did so. See Majority op. at 106-10, 171 A.3d at 1167-69. (As the trial judge was careful to confirm during the trial, Mr. Green's counsel had received the report of that interview in discovery). Ms. Carter\u2019s identification of Mr. Copeland no doubt bolstered the prosecution case, but it was perfectly admissible evidence and, even if the timing of its disclosure somehow violated the discovery rule\u2014which, for the reasons explained in the text, it did not\u2014Mr. Green is hard pressed to show how he was harmed by it.</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
