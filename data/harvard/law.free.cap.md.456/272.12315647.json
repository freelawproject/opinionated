Code Ann., Land Use (2012) (\u201cLU\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 7-301 to 7-306 (\u201cthe DRRA statute\u201d), and is defined as \u201can agreement between a local governing body and a person having a legal or equitable interest in real property to establish conditions under which development may proceed for a specified time.\u201d LU \u00a7 7-301(b). A \u201clocal governing body,\u201d in turn, \u201cmeans the legislative body, the local executive, or other elected governmental body that has zoning powers under this division.\u201d LU \u00a7 7-301(c). The purpose of a DRRA is to allow developers and local governing bodies, such as a county, to negotiate terms and conditions under which development may occur. A DRRA serves to streamline the various approval processes that must occur for a complex development project. To that end, one of the key aspects of a DRRA is controlled by the \u201cfreeze provision\u201d of the DRRA statute, LU \u00a7 7-304(a), which permits parties to agree to freeze certain laws, rules, regulations, and policies as of the time of the execution of the DRRA. LU \u00a7 7-304(a) provides: \u201cExcept as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the local laws, rules, regulations, and policies governing the use, density, or intensity of the real property subject to an agreement shall be the local laws, rules, regulations, and policies in force at the time the parties execute the agreement.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The effect of the freeze provision is that developers are able to move forward, with certainty regarding the applicable laws, with development projects that may extend over a long period of time.</p> <p id=\"b309-4\" pgmap=\"309(39) 310(139)\"> Importantly, pursuant to LU \u00a7 7-303(a), to be valid a DRRA must contain certain requirements. And, like any other contract, a DRRA must be supported by consideration. In this case, we decide whether a DRRA must be supported by \u201cenhanced public benefits\u201d to be valid\u2014ie., whether a DRRA must confer an enhanced public benefit to the county, and whether the DRRA at issue is supported by adequate consideration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We hold that, based on the plain language and legislative history of the DRRA statute, as well as relevant case law, to be valid a DRRA is not required to confer an enhanced public benefit<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on a county. In other words, there is no evidence in the DRRA statute, its legislative history, or case law demonstrating an intent to require an enhanced public benefit as part of a DRRA. And, we hold that the DRRA at issue in this case is not required to confer any enhanced public benefit to the county, and is supported by sufficient consideration. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p> <p id=\"b310-4\" pgmap=\"310\">BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"b310-5\" pgmap=\"310(103) 311(108)\">This case arose under the following circumstances. Lillian C. Blentlinger, LLC and William L. Blentlinger, LLC, Petitioners, own two parcels of land (\u201cthe Property\u201d) in Frederick County, Maryland (\u201cthe County\u201d), Respondent, totaling approximately 279 acres. The Blentlinger family farmed the Property for generations before deciding to explore the possibility of developing the Property for other uses. Since 1959, the Property had been zoned for agricultural use. In 2006, for the first time, the Property was designated for Low Density Residential (\u201cLDR\u201d) land use as part of the 2006 New Market Region Plan. Being designated for LDR land use permits a property owner to apply for a Planned Unit Development (\u201cPUD\u201d). Frederick County Code (2014) (\u201cFCC\u201d) \u00a7 1\u201419\u2014 10.500.2(A) provides, in pertinent part, that a \u201cPUD District may only be established where the tract of land receiving the PUD District has a County Comprehensive Plan Land Use designation of [LDR], Medium Density Residential, or High Density Residential.]\u201d A PUD is a \u201cfloating zone[] established to provide for new development and redevelopment within identified growth areas that result in an integrated mixture of commercial, employment, residential, recreational, civic and/or cultural land uses as provided within the appropriate Frederick County Comprehensive, Community, or Corridor Plan.\u201d FCC \u00a7 1-19-10.500.1.</p> <p id=\"b311-4\" pgmap=\"311\">Sometime in 2007, however, the Frederick County Board of County Commissioners (\u201cthe BOCC\u201d)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> removed the Property\u2019s designation for LDR land use. During the 2008 update of the New Market Region Plan, the Property\u2019s designation was changed to agricultural/rural. During the 2010 Comprehensive Plan update, the Property\u2019s designation remained agricultural/rural. With the 2012 Comprehensive Plan, the Property\u2019s designation was changed back to LDR, and the Property was included in the Linganore Community Growth Area. Since 2012, the Property has been designated for LDR land use.</p> <p id=\"b311-5\" pgmap=\"311(105) 312(41)\">On February 25, 2014, after the Property had been re-designated for LDR land use, Petitioners filed an application to rezone the Property from agricultural to PUD zoning as well as a Phase I Concept Plan. Petitioners proposed developing the Property to have 720 residential dwelling units, including a mix of single-family homes and townhomes, and included an approximately twenty-five-acre site for a future middle school. On March 11, 2014, Petitioners filed an application or petition for a DRRA, and included a draft DRRA to be entered into between Petitioners and the BOCC. The DRRA petition incorporated by reference the PUD application and the Phase I Concept Plan. In a letter dated May 5, 2014, Jim Gugel (\u201cGugel\u201d), the Planning Director for the Frederick County Planning and Development Review Department, advised Petitioners that, on April 15, 2014, the BOCC \u201caccepted\u201d the DRRA petition.</p> <p id=\"b312-4\" pgmap=\"312\">On July 30, 2014, at a public hearing, the Frederick County Planning Commission (\u201cthe Planning Commission\u201d) unanimously voted (five to zero, with two members absent) to recommend the approval of the application to rezone the Property from agricultural to PUD. On October 8, 2014, Planning Commission staff recommended that the \u201cPlanning Commission find that the location, character, and extent of the proposed [DRRA] for the [ ] Property are consistent with the County Comprehensive Plan.\u201d Also on October 8, 2014, at a public hearing, the Planning Commission reviewed the draft DRRA, and, in accordance with its staffs recommendation, voted to find the draft DRRA consistent with the Frederick County Comprehensive Plan. On October 22, 2014, Gugel and an Assistant County Attorney issued a staff report recommending that the BOCC review the proposed DRRA \u201cand any conditions related thereto in deciding whether to approve or deny the [ ] DRRA.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b312-5\" pgmap=\"312(115) 313(13)\">On November 6, 2014, the BOCC conducted a public hearing on the PUD application and the DRRA, and witnesses testified and were subject to cross-examination. At the hearing, members of the public and counsel for Cleanwater Linganore, Inc., RALE Inc., Nikki Chauvin, Jimmy D. Duffy, Joyce A. Duffy, Paul D. Garcia, Tracy E. Garcia, Dang Mindte, Carrie Payne, Pamela Pennington, Carol Swandby, Reggie Wade, and Patricia Wells (collectively, \u201cCleanwater\u201d), Respondents, cross-examined witnesses and provided public comment. During the hearing, the BOCC voted four-to-one to approve the PUD rezoning application, but limited the total unit count to 675 residential dwelling units, including 500 single-family homes and 175 townhomes,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on the condition that no building permit for the construction of a residence could be obtained before January 1,2020.</p> <p id=\"b313-4\" pgmap=\"313\">As to the DRRA, during the hearing, Cleanwater\u2019s counsel questioned Petitioners\u2019 counsel about any \u201cgreater public benefits\u201d that the DRRA offered, and the following exchange occurred:</p> <blockquote id=\"b313-5\" pgmap=\"313\">[CLEANWATER\u2019S COUNSEL]: [W]ould the applicant please explain what greater public benefits the DRRA provides above and beyond those that would be otherwise obtainable absent the DRRA?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b313-6\" pgmap=\"313\">[PETITIONERS\u2019 COUNSEL]: A certainty that the project would not lose zoning, wouldn\u2019t lose density, wouldn\u2019t lose its comprehensive plan, a certainty as to what\u2014how the development will proceed in terms of the laws that are in effect when it goes to Phase I and in subsequent years.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b313-7\" pgmap=\"313\">You know, all of that is certainly public benefit, and that\u2019s the whole reason why, or one of the main reasons why these DRRAs are available to localities within the state.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"A8I\" pgmap=\"313\">[CLEANWATER\u2019S COUNSEL]: And what you described certainly would reflect the certainty that the property owner would achieve as a result of the DRRA, but what are the greater public benefits in terms of infrastructure or other\u2014</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"A6kc\" pgmap=\"313\">[PETITIONERS\u2019 COUNSEL]: I mean, it\u2019s one and the same. That\u2019s the argument. I mean, how is it to the greater good or how is it to public benefit, and by public meaning not just a property owner if the\u2014if the zoning can change willy-nilly, if property rights can be given and taken away based on, you know, whatever, you know, however the winds change.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b313-8\" pgmap=\"313(47) 314(14)\">I mean, it\u2019s Maryland law. I mean, obviously it\u2019s\u2014the way common law in Maryland has developed it\u2019s that zoning is up for grabs unless there\u2019s valid\u2014unless there\u2019s recognizable vertical construction based on a validly issued building permit, and all the parties have tried to address this through legislation at the state in terms of vesting and this was the compromise.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b314-4\" pgmap=\"314\">And so obviously by virtue of there being a DRRA available to folks in the state it\u2019s\u2014to the public in the state it\u2019s to the greater public good. Otherwise, the state wouldn\u2019t have passed the law. As my co[-]counsel ... is referencing, I mean, the school site, the roads, the representations as to making all of the improvements that are required under the [Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance], I mean, it\u2019s all right here. It\u2019s all spelled out in the DRRA.</blockquote> <p id=\"b314-5\" pgmap=\"314\">Cleanwater\u2019s counsel also cross-examined Gugel about the DRRA and the following exchange occurred:</p> <blockquote id=\"A_m\" pgmap=\"314\">[CLEANWATER\u2019S COUNSEL]: Under the DRRA is there anything in the\u2014what are [Petitioners\u2019] responsibilities under the DRRA with respect to transportation improvements?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b314-6\" pgmap=\"314\">[ ] GUGEL: Nothing specific. It defers to what would be identified as part of a subsequent [Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance Letter of Understanding],</blockquote> <p id=\"b314-7\" pgmap=\"314\">At different points during the hearing, Cleanwater\u2019s counsel questioned Gugel about the middle school site, and the following exchanges occurred:</p> <blockquote id=\"b314-8\" pgmap=\"314\">[CLEANWATER\u2019S COUNSEL]: Would this property owner be required to proffer the [ ] middle school site whether or not there is a DRRA in this case?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b314-9\" pgmap=\"314\">[] GUGEL: Well, the PUD, I mean it\u2014the new PUD regulations do give that discretion on requiring public site dedication. The old regulations were kind of on a per acre basis. But given the symbol on the site and the rezoning request, it would have been conditioned even without a DRRA.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b314-10\" pgmap=\"314\">* * #</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b314-11\" pgmap=\"314\">[CLEANWATER\u2019S COUNSEL]: And under the school dedication requirement I just would like to confirm that there is no guarantee that the school site will be dedicated, it\u2019s contingent on acceptance by the Board of Education; is that correct?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b315-3\" pgmap=\"315\">[ ] GUGEL: Yeah, the site itself. I mean, the Phase I PUD does establish thresholds, timing thresholds of when that dedication and conveyance must occur.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b315-4\" pgmap=\"315\">[CLEANWATER\u2019S COUNSEL]: But acceptance depends on the Board of Education?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b315-5\" pgmap=\"315\">[] GUGEL: Correct.</blockquote> <p id=\"b315-6\" pgmap=\"315\">Gugel also testified that, \u201cin the event that the Board of Education] does not approve the public school site or determines not to accept conveyance then [Petitioners] shall retain fee simple ownership of the public school site and may use the public school site in a manner consistent with other uses in the project.\u201d At the conclusion of the hearing, the BOCC voted four-to-one to approve the DRRA.</p> <p id=\"b315-7\" pgmap=\"315\">On November 24, 2014, the BOCC enacted Ordinance No. 14-27-682, approving Petitioners\u2019 PUD application and the Phase I Concept Plan for the development, subject to certain conditions (\u201cthe PUD Ordinance\u201d). As discussed at the hearing before the BOCC, one of the conditions of the PUD Ordinance limited the number of dwelling units to be constructed in the development. Specifically, the PUD Ordinance provided that \u201c[a] maximum of 675 dwelling units may be constructed, comprised of no more than 175 townhomes, and the remaining units being single-family detached.\u201d Another condition stated that the development needed to \u201c[p]rovide a diversity of single[-]family lot sizes.\u201d Yet another condition concerned the middle school site, stating:</p> <blockquote id=\"b315-8\" pgmap=\"315\">[Petitioners] shall dedicate and convey to the County a 24.5 +/- acre middle school site to the [Board of Education (\u201cthe BOE\u201d) ], in fee simple, upon</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b315-9\" pgmap=\"315\">i) the recordation of the subdivision plat for the 100th lot in the Project or within two (2) years of the recordation of the subdivision plat for the 1st lot in the Project, whichever occurs first; and</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b315-10\" pgmap=\"315(39) 316(29)\">ii) [the] BOE\u2019s acceptance of the conveyance of land for the Public School Site. [Petitioners] and [the] BOE shall enter into a Memorandum of Understanding [ ], which shall set forth the rights and responsibilities of the parties in connection with development of the school site, prior to final, unconditional approval of the Phase II (Execution) Plan for the portion of the Project that contains the school site.</blockquote> <p id=\"b316-4\" pgmap=\"316\">In the PUD Ordinance, another condition stated that Petitioners were to \u201c[pjrovide two (2) neighborhood parks of at least 20,000 square feet each to be centrally located, with one in the northern land bay, and the other in the central land bay.\u201d And, consistent with the BOCC\u2019s vote at the hearing, the last condition of the ordinance provided that, \u201c[w]ith the exception of structures on the Public School Site and models for the Project, neither Frederick County, nor any agency, department, division and/or branch thereof shall issue any structural building permits, prior to January 1, 2020.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b316-5\" pgmap=\"316\">On the same day, November 24, 2014, the final DRRA executed by Petitioners and the BOCC was recorded among the Land Records of Frederick County (\u201cthe Blentlinger DRRA\u201d). We briefly summarize some of the Blentlinger DRRA\u2019s relevant provisions. Section 2.2A of the Blentlinger DRRA, concerning permissible uses and density, provides that the development shall be developed as a PUD in accordance with the provisions of the Frederick County Code, so long as the overall density and intensity of the development is not increased, and a maximum of 675 residential dwelling units are permitted pursuant to the PUD Ordinance. In Section 2.2C, Petitioners agree to comply with applicable laws should they revise the mix of residential unit types, subject to the cap of 675 residential dwelling units, and to pay any adjusted school construction fees resulting from a change in the unit types. In Section 2.2E, concerning limitation on building permit issuance, Petitioners \u201cacknowledge[ ] and agree[] that[,]\u201d \u201cwith the exception of structures on the Public School Site and models for the Project,\u201d \u201cneither Frederick County, nor any agency, department, division and/or branch thereof shall issue any structural building permits, prior to January 1, 2020.\u201d In Section 2.4, Petitioners agree to make a payment to the County in lieu of building moderately priced dwelling units, as permitted by the Frederick County Code.</p> <p id=\"b317-3\" pgmap=\"317\">Article III of the Blentlinger DRRA sets forth the parties\u2019 agreement with respect to community facilities and infrastructure improvements. Section 3.1, concerning road improvements, provides that, to fulfill the Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance (\u201cthe APFO\u201d) requirements,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Petitioners will either construct or fund construction of road improvements or contribute to escrow funds for road improvements. In Sections 3.2 and 3.3, Petitioners agree to comply with the sewer and water improvements as required by the APFO Letter of Understanding, and to pay tap fees in accordance with the fee schedule in effect at the time of building permit application.</p> <p id=\"b317-4\" pgmap=\"317\">Section 3.4 concerns schools. And, in Section 3.4A, Petitioners agree to pay the school construction fee as a condition of the APFO, notwithstanding the sunset of a school construction fee ordinance. Pursuant to Section 3.4B, all \u201c[ajpplicable [s]chool [ijmpact [f]ees shall be paid at the time of the issuance of building permits in accordance with the fee schedule in effect at the time of the issuance of building permits.\u201d Section 3.4C concerns \u201c[sjchool [s]ite [dedication,\u201d and provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b317-5\" pgmap=\"317(77) 318(157)\">[Petitioners] shall convey in fee simple to the Frederick County Board of Education (\u201cBOE\u201d), with no monetary consideration paid, the Public School Site shown on EXHIBIT 6, totaling a minimum of 24.5 \u00b1 buildable acres, to serve the Project and the surrounding region. The Public School Site will be conveyed to the BOE upon: i) the recordation of the first subdivision plat for lots in the Project; and ii) BOE\u2019s acceptance of the conveyance of land for the Public School Site .... A separate Memorandum of Understanding (\u201cBOE MOU\u201d) between the BOE and [Petitioners] shall be executed prior to unconditional Phase II approval for residential dwelling units in the Project (assuming commercially reasonable efforts by both parties), which MOU shall establish and control other aspects of the Public School Site and the rights and responsibilities of the parties relative to the Public School Site, and the construction of a public school .... In the event that the BOE does not approve the Public School Site or determines not to accept conveyance of the Public School Site, then [Petitioners] shall retain fee simple ownership of the Public School Site, and may use the Public School Site in a manner consistent with other uses with the Project. [Petitioners] acknowledge[ ] that use of the Public School Site may require regulatory approvals, including but not limited to, revision of the [PUD] Ordinance.</blockquote> <p id=\"b318-4\" pgmap=\"318\">(Emphasis in original).</p> <p id=\"b318-5\" pgmap=\"318\">As to property acquisition for public infrastructure, Section 3.5A provides:</p> <blockquote id=\"b318-6\" pgmap=\"318\">In the event that some of the public infrastructure improvements, at the collector road or higher facility level, required by this DRRA or the APFO to be made by [Petitioners] will require the acquisition of public right-of-way from third-party property owners, [Petitioners] shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to secure such right-of-way without the assistance of the County.</blockquote> <p id=\"b318-7\" pgmap=\"318(91) 319(65)\">Section 3.5B provides that, if Petitioners demonstrate to the County that they are unable to secure a public right-of-way through commercially reasonable efforts, then Petitioners may request that the County or the State Highway Administration assist in such acquisition at Petitioners\u2019 \u201csole cost and expense.\u201d Section 3.5B further provides that, should the County approve Petitioners\u2019 request for assistance, then the County or the State Highway Administration \u201cshall have two years to acquire the needed right-of-way.\u201d And, Section 3.5C provides that, if the County decides not to acquire the right-of-way, or the two-year time period of assistance has passed, then Petitioners \u201cmay be permitted to make a contribution to the County equal to the entire anticipated project development costs, which shall include but not be limited to costs for: design, engineering, right-of-way acquisition, management, inspection, etc. in lieu of constructing the public infrastructure improvements!,]\u201d unless the applicable APFO letter of understanding provides otherwise.</p> <p id=\"b319-4\" pgmap=\"319\">Article IV of the Blentlinger DRRA, concerning the terms of the agreement, provides:</p> <blockquote id=\"b319-5\" pgmap=\"319\">This Agreement shall constitute covenants running with the land and shall run with and bind the Property so long as the Project is under development, provided that this Agreement shall terminate and be void twenty-five (25) years after the Effective Date of this Agreement unless extended by an amendment complying with all procedures required in this Agreement, the County Ordinance and the State law. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Term of this Agreement is justified by the: (1) substantial economic investment made and/or to be made by [Petitioners] for the development of the Project; (2) substantial investment in, and construction of, extensive public and private infrastructure by the parties; (3) public purposes to be advanced by development of the Project in accordance with the Development Laws; (4) uncertainty of future market demands and political pressures; and (5) expectations of the parties.</blockquote> <p id=\"b319-6\" pgmap=\"319\">Article V of the Blentlinger DRRA concerns development review and Article VI concerns survival and transfer of obligations.</p> <p id=\"b319-7\" pgmap=\"319(78) 320(93)\">Article VII deals with breach of the Blentlinger DRRA and the parties\u2019 respective remedies. Section 7.1 concerns breach by Petitioners, and Section 7.1 A provides that, if Petitioners fail or refuse to perform obligations under the Blentlinger DRRA, and fail to cure that default within a certain period of time, then the BOCC \u201cmay seek and obtain equitable relief to enforce the terms and conditions of th[e] Agreement[,] either through a decree for specific performance or an injunction.\u201d Section 7.1A further states that, if specific performance or an injunction is not available due to actions taken by Petitioners, \u201cthen the BOCC shall be entitled to bring a legal action for damages.\u201d In Section 7.1B, Petitioners waive the right to a \u201ctrial by jury in connection with any proceedings brought to enforce the terms of\u2019 the Blentlinger DRRA. Section 7.2A provides that the same remedies are available to Petitioners in the event of a breach by the BOCC. And, in Section 7.2B, the BOCC also waives the right to a jury trial.</p> <p id=\"b320-4\" pgmap=\"320\">Section 8.1A provides that Petitioners \u201cshall comply with all Development Laws\u201d as defined in the Blentlinger DRRA, stating:</p> <blockquote id=\"b320-5\" pgmap=\"320\">Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the local laws, rules, regulations and policies governing the use, density or intensity of the Property, including but not limited to, those governing development, subdivision, growth management, impact fee laws, water, sewer, stormwater management, environmental protection, land planning and design, and adequate public facilities (hereafter collectively the \u201cDevelopment Laws\u201d), shall be the local laws, rules, regulations and policies, if any, in force on the Effective Date of the Agreement, and [Petitioners] shall comply with all Development Laws.</blockquote> <p id=\"b320-6\" pgmap=\"320\">And, Section 8.1B provides:</p> <blockquote id=\"b320-7\" pgmap=\"320\">If the BOCC determines that compliance with Development Laws enacted or adopted after the Effective Date of this Agreement is essential to ensure the health, safety or welfare of residents of all or part of Frederick County, the BOCC may impose the change in laws, rule, regulations and policies and the effect thereof upon the Property.</blockquote> <p id=\"b320-8\" pgmap=\"320(74) 321(33)\">Section 8.3, concerning fees, states that, except as otherwise provided in the Blentlinger DRRA, Petitioners \u201cshall pay all fees (specifically including but not limited to impact fees, school mitigation fees[,] and water and sewer connection fees) required by Frederick County at the rate in effect at the time the fee is due.\u201d Section 8.3 further states that, in the event that any of the fees are eliminated due to a change in the law and \u201creplaced with a procedure or requirement that would impose some other burden on\u201d Petitioners, then Petitioners \u201cmay elect to pay the impact fee in effect prior to the change in the law.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b321-4\" pgmap=\"321\">Section 9.7 of the Blentlinger DRRA, titled \u201cAuthority to Execute,\u201d states:</p> <blockquote id=\"b321-5\" pgmap=\"321\">The BOCC hereby acknowledges and agrees that all required notices, meetings, and hearings have been properly given and held by the County with respect to the approval of this Agreement, and [Petitioners] agree[] not to challenge this Agreement or any of the obligations created by this Agreement on the grounds of any procedural infirmity or any denial of any procedural right.

On June 8, 2015, Cleanwater filed a memorandum in support of the petition for judicial review. In relevant part, Cleanwater contended that the Blentlinger DRRA was void for lack of consideration because Petitioners had failed to provide \u201cany \u2018enhanced public benefits\u2019 as consideration!!.]\u201d Cleanwater further argued that the middle school site was subject to BOE approval, which was uncertain, and that, as such, \u201c[t]here is no guarantee that the school site will be dedicated.\u201d (Emphasis omitted).</p> <p id=\"b322-5\" pgmap=\"322\">On August 21, 2015, Petitioners filed a memorandum in opposition to the petition for judicial review. Petitioners contended, in pertinent part, that the Blentlinger DRRA was supported by \u201cadequate consideration.\u201d Also on August 21, 2015, the County filed a memorandum in response to Cleanwa-ter\u2019s memorandum, arguing that substantial evidence supported the BOCC\u2019s approval of the PUD Ordinance, and that such approval fulfilled the requirements of State and County law. Although the County did not specifically address whether the Blentlinger DRRA was supported by adequate consideration, the County asserted that \u201c[t]he decisions challenged by [Cleanwater, ie., the PUD Ordinance and the Blentlinger DRRA,] were approved by the BOCC based upon substantial evidence in the record and in accordance with applicable requirements of State and County law.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b322-6\" pgmap=\"322(18) 323(25)\">On September 14, 2015, Cleanwater filed a reply memorandum, again contending that the Blentlinger DRRA was not supported by adequate consideration because there was no evidence in the agreement showing that the County provided vested rights in exchange for enhanced public benefits.</p> <p id=\"b323-4\" pgmap=\"323\">On September 28, 2015, the circuit court conducted a hearing on the petition for judicial review. On November 4, 2015, the circuit court entered an opinion and order affirming the BOCC\u2019s adoption of the PUD Ordinance and approval of the Blentlinger DRRA. The circuit court rejected the argument that the Blentlinger DRRA was not supported by adequate consideration, and concluded that the Blentlinger \u201cDRRA imposes both binding obligations and legal detriment to\u201d Petitioners.</p> <p id=\"b323-5\" pgmap=\"323\">On December 1, 2015, Cleanwater filed a notice of appeal. On February 3, 2017, in a reported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the judgment of the circuit court and remanded the case to the circuit court with instructions to vacate the Blentlinger DRRA. See Cleanwater Linganore, Inc. v. Frederick Cty., 231 Md.App. 620, 625, 643, 153 A.3d 874, 877, 888 (2017). In pertinent part, the Court of Special Appeals held that the Blentlinger DRRA was void for lack of consideration because it lacked any enhanced public benefits to the County. See id. at 625, 637, 153 A.3d at 877, 884. According to the Court of Special Appeals, many of the provisions of the Blentlinger DRRA</p> <blockquote id=\"b323-6\" pgmap=\"323\">do not reflect enhanced obligations of the developer. Rather, they reflect the obligations the developer would otherwise be required to satisfy during the course of the development of the property if no DRRA were in place. Indeed, the benefits relied upon by the developer (specifically those relating to road, sewer, water improvements, and tap fees) are required of the developer under the County\u2019s [APFO].</blockquote> <p id=\"A-L\" pgmap=\"323\">Id. at 639-40, 153 A.3d at 886. As to the middle school site, the Court of Special Appeals stated that it did not need to \u201cdecide whether the conveyance of a middle school site constitutes an enhanced public benefit to\u201d the County, and explained:</p> <blockquote id=\"b323-7\" pgmap=\"323(20) 324(73)\">Because [Petitioners] retain[ ] fee simple ownership of the middle school site if the BOE \u201cdoes not approve the Public School site or determines not to accept conveyance of the site,\u201d this \u201cbenefit,\u201d at the time of execution and recordation of the DRRA, was a conditional promise and potentially an illusory one to boot. Indeed, the offer by [Petitioners] to proffer the property in fee simple is not a definitive compulsory obligation to do anything other than offer the site for a middle school contingent on acceptance by the Board of Education.</blockquote> <p id=\"b324-4\" pgmap=\"324\">Id. at 641, 642, 153 A.3d at 886, 887 (brackets omitted). The Court of Special Appeals ultimately determined that the Blentlinger DRRA conferred no enhanced public benefit to the County, and concluded:</p> <blockquote id=\"b324-5\" pgmap=\"324\">As the developer\u2019s testimony and its counsel\u2019s argument reflects, the public benefit conferred by the [Blentlinger] DRRA consists of the developer\u2019s vested rights in the project and the applicant\u2019s obligations to satisfy ... APFO[ ] infrastructure requirements. Clearly, every development must satisfy APFO requirements regardless of whether a DRRA is executed. A DRRA, in contrast, requires the applicant to provide some public benefit beyond complying with statutory land use standards and otherwise satisfy [APFO] infrastructure requirements. The [Blentlinger] DRRA [ ] does not require the applicant to unconditionally convey property for a middle school or otherwise provide any extra or enhanced benefit to Frederick County or its citizens. Accordingly, under the circumstances of this case, the [Blentlinger] DRRA is void for lack of consideration.</blockquote> <p id=\"b324-6\" pgmap=\"324\">Id. at 643, 153 A.3d at 888.</p> <p id=\"b324-7\" pgmap=\"324\">Thereafter, Petitioners filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari, raising the following two issues:</p> <blockquote id=\"b324-8\" pgmap=\"324\">1. Did the Court of Special Appeals err by holding that a DRRA, in order to be valid, must include \u201cenhanced public benefits\u201d to the local governing body?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b324-9\" pgmap=\"324(29) 325(20)\">2. Did the Court of Special Appeals err by holding that Petitioners\u2019 proffer of a 24.5 +/- acre school site did not constitute adequate consideration for the DRRA, con-eluding instead that the proffer of the school site was a \u201cconditional promise and potentially an illusory one to boot?\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b325-4\" pgmap=\"325\">On May 9, 2017, this Court granted the petition.

Cleanwater Linganore, 453 Md. 7, 160 A.3d 546 (2017).</p> <p id=\"b325-5\" pgmap=\"325\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p> <p id=\"b325-6\" pgmap=\"325\">In Grasslands Plantation, Inc. v. Frizz-King Enters., LLC, 410 Md. 191, 203-04, 978 A.2d 622, 629 (2009), this Court set forth the standard of review that applies to an administrative agency\u2019s decision, stating:</p> <blockquote id=\"b325-8\" pgmap=\"325\">When reviewing the decision of a local zoning body, ... we evaluate directly the agency decision, and, in so doing, we apply the same standards of review as the circuit court and intermediate appellate court. Our role is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law. In applying the substantial evidence test, we have emphasized that a court should not substitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency from which the appeal is taken. Our obligation is to review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to the agency, since their decisions are prima facie correct and carry with them the presumption of validity.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b325-9\" pgmap=\"325\">Even with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts. We are under no constraint, however, to affirm an agency decision premised solely upon an erroneous conclusion of law.</blockquote> <p id=\"b325-10\" pgmap=\"325(17) 326(117)\">(Citations, brackets, and internal quotation marks omitted).

And, in Attar v. DMS Tollgate, LLC, 451 Md. 272, 279, 152 A.3d 765, 769 (2017), we explained that \u201cwe may not substitute our judgment for that of [the administrative agency] unless the agency\u2019s conclusions were not supported by substantial evidence or were premised on an error of law.\u201d (Citation omitted).</p> <p id=\"b326-4\" pgmap=\"326\">Because this case also involves statutory interpretation, we set forth the relevant rules of statutory construction:</p> <p id=\"b326-5\" pgmap=\"326\"> The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the General Assembly.</p> <blockquote id=\"Aij\" pgmap=\"326\">As this Court has explained, to determine that purpose or policy, we look first to the language of the statute, giving it its natural and ordinary meaning. We do so on the tacit theory that the General Assembly is presumed to have meant what it said and said what it meant. When the statutory language is clear, we need not look beyond the statutory language to determine the General Assembly\u2019s intent. If the words of the statute, construed according to their common and everyday meaning, are clear and unambiguous and express a plain meaning, we will give effect to the statute as it is written. In addition, we neither add nor delete words to a clear and unambiguous statute to give it a meaning not reflected by the words that the General Assembly used or engage in forced or subtle interpretation in an attempt to extend or limit the statute\u2019s meaning. If there is no ambiguity in the language, either inherently or by reference to other relevant laws or circumstances, the inquiry as to legislative intent ends.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b326-6\" pgmap=\"326(32) 327(73)\">If the language of the statute is ambiguous, however, then courts consider not only the literal or usual meaning of the words, but their meaning and effect in light of the setting, the objectives, and the purpose of the enactment under consideration. We have said that there is an ambiguity within a statute when there exist two or more reasonable alternative interpretations of the statute. When a statute can be interpreted in more than one way, the job of this Court is to resolve that ambiguity in light of the legislative intent, using all the resources and tools of statutory construction at our disposal.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b327-4\" pgmap=\"327\">If the true legislative intent cannot be readily determined from the statutory language alone, however, we may, and often must, resort to other recognized indicia\u2014among other things, the structure of the statute, including its title; how the statute relates to other laws; the legislative history, including the derivation of the statute, comments and explanations regarding it by authoritative sources during the legislative process, and amendments proposed or added to it; the general purpose behind the statute; and the relative rationality and legal effect of various competing constructions.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b327-5\" pgmap=\"327\">In construing a statute, we avoid a construction of the statute that is unreasonable, illogical, or inconsistent with common sense.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b327-6\" pgmap=\"327\">In addition, the meaning of the plainest language is controlled by the context in which it appears. As this Court has stated, because it is part of the context, related statutes or a statutory scheme that fairly bears on the fundamental issue of legislative purpose or goal must also be considered. Thus, not only are we required to interpret the statute as a whole, but, if appropriate, in the context of the entire statutory scheme of which it is a part.</blockquote> <p id=\"b327-7\" pgmap=\"327\">Bellard v. State, 452 Md. 467, 481-82, 157 A.3d 272, 280-81 (2017) (citation and brackets omitted).</p> <p id=\"b327-8\" pgmap=\"327\">MOTION TO STRIKE</p> <p id=\"b327-9\" pgmap=\"327(31) 328(79)\">In this Court, the County filed a brief contending, for the first time, that to be valid a DRRA must be supported by enhanced public benefits, and arguing that the Blentlinger DRRA does not require any enhanced public benefit, and, thus, is invalid.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On brief, the County also asserts that \u201cthe absence of an enhanced public benefit has a particularly acute impact on the reserved legislative powers of the County in the present case because the scope of the Blentlinger[ ] DRRA exceeds that authorized by\u201d the DRRA statute. The County maintains that Section 8.1 A of the Blentlinger DRRA\u2014ie., the \u201cfreeze provision\u201d\u2014exceeds the County\u2019s authority under the DRRA statute.</p> <p id=\"b328-4\" pgmap=\"328\">Petitioners filed in this Court a motion to strike the County\u2019s brief and a memorandum in support, contending, in pertinent part, that the County is judicially estopped from arguing that the Blentlinger DRRA is invalid and that the County\u2019s contention concerning the freeze provision of the Blentlinger DRRA is not properly before the Court. Specifically, Petitioners assert that, in the circuit court and the Court of Special Appeals, the County contended that the Blentlinger DRRA is valid; as such, Petitioners maintain that the County is judicially estopped from now changing its position and arguing that the Blentlinger DRRA is invalid. Petitioners also contend that any issue as to the freeze provision is not before this Court because the issue was not raised in a petition for a writ of certiorari or a cross-petition.</p> <p id=\"b328-5\" pgmap=\"328(100) 329(53)\">The County filed an opposition to the motion to strike, contending that judicial estoppel applies only where three circumstances are present, including where a party takes a factual position that is inconsistent with a position that it took in previous litigation. The County argues that it has not taken a factual position that is inconsistent with one that it took in previous litigation, and asserts that its change in position in the same litigation relates to the legal requirements governing the validity of a DRRA. The County maintains that it \u201craised the discussion of the freeze provision of the [Blentlinger] DRRA, not to create a separate issue for this Court to decide, but for the purpose of showing that the prejudice to the County of not requiring a DRRA to contain enhanced public benefits is particularly acute[.]\u201d Cleanwater also filed an opposition to the motion to strike \u201cjointing] in\u201d the County\u2019s opposition.</p> <p id=\"b329-4\" pgmap=\"329\"> On August 30, 2017, this Court issued an order providing \u201cthat action on the motion [to strike] be, and it is hereby, deferred pending oral argument.\u201d We now address the motion to strike, and we deny the motion. It is undisputed that, up until proceedings in this Court, in the circuit court and the Court of Special Appeals, the County took the position that the Blentlinger DRAA is valid. Indeed, on brief, the County readily acknowledges that in arguing that the Blent-linger DRRA is invalid it \u201chas changed its position in this case from that which it argued before the [circuit [c]ourt and [the] Court of Special Appeals.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b329-5\" pgmap=\"329\"> Judicial estoppel has been defined as \u201ca principle that precludes a party from taking a position in a subsequent action inconsistent with a position taken by him or her in a previous action.\u201d Dashiell v. Meeks, 396 Md. 149, 170, 913 A.2d 10, 22 (2006) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[J]udicial estoppel applies when it becomes necessary to protect the integrity of the judicial system from one party who is attempting to gain an unfair advantage over another party by manipulating the court system.\u201d Id. at 171, 913 A.2d at 23. To that end,</p> <blockquote id=\"b329-6\" pgmap=\"329\">[b]efore judicial estoppel may be applied, three circumstances must exist: (1) one of the parties takes a [ ] position that is inconsistent with a position it took in previous litigation, (2) the previous inconsistent position was accepted by a court, and (3) the party who is maintaining the inconsistent positions must have intentionally misled the court in order to gain an unfair advantage.</blockquote> <p id=\"b329-7\" pgmap=\"329(33) 330(71)\">Id. at 171, 913 A.2d at 22 (citation omitted). In Underwood-Gary v. Mathews, 366 Md. 660, 667 n.6, 786 A.2d 708, 712 n.6 (2001), this Court noted that \u201c[\u00bfjudicial estoppel has been defined as a principle that precludes a party from taking a position in a subsequent action inconsistent with a position taken by him or her in a previous action.\u201d (Emphasis added) (citation omitted). And, in Mona v. Mona Elec. Grp., Inc., 176 Md.App. 672, 726, 934 A.2d 460, 481 (2007), reconsideration denied (Nov. 26, 2007), the Court of Special Appeals concluded that judicial estoppel did not apply, explaining, in relevant part:</p> <blockquote id=\"b330-4\" pgmap=\"330\">Mark\u2019s claim in this case ... is not inconsistent with any position taken in previous litigation. Indeed, there was no \u201cprevious litigation.\u201d Instead of pointing to previous litigation in which Mark took an inconsistent position, MEG complains that Mark took inconsistent positions within this litigation. Specifically, MEG argues that, at the outset of this case, Mark alleged that MEG was legally obligated to pay a dividend in order to cover any debts he owed to MEG, but that assertion is inconsistent with Mark\u2019s later assertion that MEG acted illegally in making deductions from those dividends to cover his alleged debts. As MEG acknowledges, however, any inconsistency in Mark\u2019s position occurred within this litigation. Accordingly, the doctrine of judicial estoppel does not apply.</blockquote> <p id=\"b330-5\" pgmap=\"330\">(Emphasis in original). In other words, judicial estoppel applies where a party takes a position in subsequent litigation that is inconsistent with one taken in previous litigation, not where a party takes an inconsistent position within the same litigation.</p> <p id=\"b330-6\" pgmap=\"330(102) 331(10)\">Here, we conclude that the prerequisites that must exist before judicial estoppel may be applied are not satisfied. In our view, the County\u2019s change in position occurs in the same litigation; in other words, the County did not take a position in a previous action or litigation and then change that position in new litigation. And, there is no evidence whatsoever in the record that the County intentionally misled the court to gain an unfair advantage. Given that the first and third prerequisites for the application of judicial estoppel are not established, we need not address the remaining circumstance, i.e., whether the previous inconsistent position was accepted by the court.</p> <p id=\"b331-4\" pgmap=\"331\"> As to the contention that the County is raising a new issue concerning the validity of the freeze provision and that the issue is not properly before the Court, to the extent that the County is raising such an issue, we shall decline to consider any question as to the validity of the freeze provision in the Blentlinger DRRA. Notably, the County contends that it is not challenging the validity of the freeze provision, but rather it is arguing that the existence of the freeze provision is prejudicial in light of the alleged lack of adequate consideration, ie., enhanced public benefits. Nonetheless, we observe that none of the parties raised any issue as to the validity of the freeze provision in a petition for a writ of certiorari or a cross-petition. Accordingly, the issue is not properly before this Court. See Md. R. S\u2014131(b)(1) (\u201cUnless otherwise provided by the order granting the writ of certiorari, in reviewing a decision rendered by the Court of Special Appeals ..., the Court of Appeals ordinarily will consider only an issue that has been raised in the petition for certiorari or any cross-petition and that has been preserved for review by the Court of Appeals.\u201d); Vito v. Grueff, 453 Md. 88, 126 n.9, 160 A.3d 592, 614 n.9 (2017) (This Court noted that an \u201cissue was not squarely addressed by the circuit court, nor raised by [the party] in a cross-petition for a writ of certiorari. Thus, the issue is not properly preserved for our review.\u201d). To the extent that any issue as to the freeze provision is, as the County posits, simply a point made in support of the contention that, in order to be valid, a DRRA must be supported by enhanced public benefits, there is no reason to grant the motion to strike the County\u2019s brief on that ground.</p> <p id=\"b331-5\" pgmap=\"331(58) 332(43)\">As a final point, Petitioners argue that the County\u2019s brief should be stricken because the County relies on facts and exhibits outside of the record\u2014specifically, facts about the 2014 County election. Although information about the 2014 County elections is included in the County\u2019s brief ostensibly to explain its change in position with respect to the validity of the Blentlinger DRRA, because that information is not relevant to the issues before the Court in this case, we need not consider it. As such, we conclude that the inclusion of information regarding the 2014 election does not warrant granting the motion to strike.</p> <p id=\"b332-4\" pgmap=\"332\">DISCUSSION<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"AGB\" pgmap=\"332\">The Parties\u2019 Contentions</p> <p id=\"AKA\" pgmap=\"332\">Petitioners contend that to be valid a DRRA need not include a provision requiring that enhanced public benefits be bestowed upon a local governing body, and, thus, the BOCC did not err in approving the Blentlinger DRRA, as there was sufficient consideration. Petitioners argue that neither the plain language of the DRRA statute, nor the County\u2019s statutes governing DRRAs, nor the legislative history of the DRRA statute, includes the term \u201cenhanced public benefits\u201d or requires that a DRRA include enhanced public benefits. Petitioners assert that, because the DRRA statute and the County\u2019s statutes governing DRRAs are unambiguous and clearly do not require a DRRA to include enhanced public benefits to a local governing body, our analysis should end there. Petitioners maintain that Court of Special Appeals\u2019s reliance on Queen Anne\u2019s Conservation, Inc. v. Cty. Comm\u2019rs of Queen Anne\u2019s Cty., 382 Md. 306, 322, 855 A.2d 325, 334 (2004), is misplaced because that case did not address the consideration that is needed for a DRRA to be valid and mentioned the term \u201cenhanced public benefits\u201d only in dicta.</p> <p id=\"b332-7\" pgmap=\"332(42) 333(196)\">Petitioners assert that they have undertaken \u201csignificant commitments\u201d in the Blentlinger DRRA, including the proffer of the middle school site, as well as detriments, which constitute sufficient consideration for the Blentlinger DRRA. Petitioners maintain that the Blentlinger DRRA creates binding obligations on them that provide many benefits to the County, including, for example, Petitioners\u2019 agreement to pay school impact fees, as well as pay water and sewer capacity fees, and Petitioners\u2019 agreement to secure public rights-of-way from third-party property owners without assistance from the County. Petitioners contend that the County also received other benefits, such as \u201ccertainty as to the timing and scope of the development of the project over the span of twenty-five [ ] years.\u201d Petitioners argue that, in addition to being subjected to binding obligations, they incurred detriments under the Blentlinger DRRA, including, for example, a limit on the number of residential dwelling units to be built, and a waiver of the right to challenge the Blentlinger DRRA or any of its obligations on the ground of any procedural infirmity or any denial of a procedural right. Petitioners assert that the middle school site proffer is an additional benefit to the County and the BOE, and serves as additional consideration supporting the Blentlinger DRRA. Petitioners maintain that even a conditional promise constitutes consideration for a contract, and that their promise to proffer the middle school site constitutes consideration for the Blentlinger DRRA.</p> <p id=\"AeX\" pgmap=\"333\">Cleanwater responds that the plain language and legislative history of the DRRA statute, as well as case law, lead to the conclusion that enhanced public benefits as consideration are required for a DRRA to be valid. Specifically, Cleanwater contends that LU \u00a7 7\u2014303(a)(9) requires the local governing body to obtain enhanced public benefits from the developer in exchange for conferring vested rights. Cleanwater argues that enhanced public benefits are benefits, \u201csecured in the public interest, in excess of those that a developer would be required to provide in the ordinary course of development.\u201d Cleanwater asserts that, in Queen Anne\u2019s Conservation, 382 Md. at 322, 855 A.2d at 334, this Court expressly stated that a DRRA must be made \u201cin consideration of enhanced public benefits!!,]\u201d which is consistent with the DRRA statute\u2019s legislative history.</p> <p id=\"b333-5\" pgmap=\"333(17) 334(142)\">Cleanwater contends that the Court of Special Appeals correctly held that the Blentlinger DRRA was not supported by sufficient consideration due to the lack of an enhanced public benefit to the County. Cleanwater argues that the middle school site proffer does not constitute consideration because it was a condition of rezoning, and would have been required even absent a DRRA. Cleanwater asserts that, because the middle school site was required for Petitioners to secure rezoning of the Property, the middle school site did not serve as an enhanced public benefit given in exchange for the Blentlinger DRRA. Cleanwater also maintains that the other benefits identified by Petitioners are required under the APFO and other statutes, and thus do not constitute enhanced public benefits. In sum, Cleanwater contends that the County received nothing from Petitioners in exchange for the Blent-linger DRRA, and that, as such, the Blentlinger DRRA is \u201cvoid for lack of consideration (ie., enhanced public benefits).\u201d</p> <p id=\"b334-4\" pgmap=\"334\">Like Cleanwater, the County responds that a DRRA must bestow enhanced public benefits upon a local governing body. Also like Cleanwater, the County relies on Queen Anne\u2019s Conservation to support its position, and argues that the Blentlinger DRRA imposes no obligation on Petitioners that the PUD Ordinance did not already impose, and does not impose any obligation on Petitioners that is not otherwise required by law.</p> <p id=\"b334-5\" pgmap=\"334\">Consideration for Contracts</p> <p id=\"b334-6\" pgmap=\"334\">In Cheek v. United Healthcare of Mid-Atl., Inc., 378 Md. 139, 147-49, 835 A.2d 656, 661-62 (2003), we discussed consideration for a contract in some detail, stating:</p> <blockquote id=\"b334-7\" pgmap=\"334\">To be binding and enforceable, contracts ordinarily require consideration. In Maryland, consideration may be established by showing a benefit to the promisor or a detriment to the promisee. In particular, we have recognized that for[ ]bearance to exercise a right or pursue a claim, can constitute sufficient consideration to support an agreement.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b334-8\" pgmap=\"334(16) 335(13)\">A promise becomes consideration for another promise only when it constitutes a binding obligation. Without a binding obligation, sufficient consideration does not exist to support a legally enforceable agreement.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b335-4\" pgmap=\"335\">An illusory promise appears to be a promise, but it does not actually bind or obligate the promisor to anything. An illusory promise is composed of words in a promissory form that promise nothing. They do not purport to put any limitation on the freedom of the alleged promisor. If A makes an illusory promise, A\u2019s words leave A\u2019s future action subject to A\u2019s own future whim, just as it would have been had A said nothing at all. Similarly, the Restatement of Contracts explains that words of promise which by their terms make performance entirely optional with the promi-sor whatever may happen, or whatever course of conduct in other respects he may pursue, do not constitute a promise. Likewise, the promise is too indefinite for legal enforcement is the promise where the promisor retains an unlimited right to decide later the nature or extent of his performance. The unlimited choice in effect destroys the promise and makes it merely illusory.</blockquote> <p id=\"b335-5\" pgmap=\"335\">(Citations, brackets, ellipsis, and internal quotation marks omitted).

A benefit to the promisor or a detriment to the promisee is sufficient valuable consideration to support a contract. Legal detriment means giving up something which immediately prior thereto the promisee was privileged to retain, or doing or refraining from doing something which he was then privileged not to do, or not to refrain from doing.</blockquote> <p id=\"b336-5\" pgmap=\"336\">(Citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p> <p id=\"b336-6\" pgmap=\"336\">Requirements of DRRAs</p> <p id=\"b336-7\" pgmap=\"336\">LU \u00a7 7-303 sets forth both the required and permissible contents of a DRRA, providing in full as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b336-8\" pgmap=\"336\">(a) Required contents.\u2014A development rights and responsibilities agreement shall include:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b336-9\" pgmap=\"336\">(1) a legal description of the real property subject to the agreement;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b336-10\" pgmap=\"336\">(2) the names of the persons having a legal or equitable interest in the real property subject to the agreement;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b336-11\" pgmap=\"336\">(3) the duration of the agreement;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b336-12\" pgmap=\"336\">(4) the permissible uses of the real property;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b336-13\" pgmap=\"336\">(5) the density or intensity of use of the real property;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b336-14\" pgmap=\"336\">(6) the maximum height and size of structures to be located on the real property;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b336-15\" pgmap=\"336\">(7) a description of the permits required or already approved for the development of the real property;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b336-16\" pgmap=\"336\">(8) a statement that the proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan and development regulations of the local jurisdiction;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b336-17\" pgmap=\"336(16) 337(17)\">(9) a description of the conditions, terms, restrictions, or other requirements determined by the local governing body of the local jurisdiction to be necessary to ensure the public health, safety, or welfare; and</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b337-5\" pgmap=\"337\">(10) to the extent applicable, provisions for the:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b337-6\" pgmap=\"337\">(i) dedication of a portion of the real property for public use;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b337-7\" pgmap=\"337\">(ii) protection of sensitive areas;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b337-8\" pgmap=\"337\">(iii) preservation and restoration of historic structures; and</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b337-9\" pgmap=\"337\">(iv) construction or financing of public facilities.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b337-10\" pgmap=\"337\">(b) Permissible contents,\u2014An agreement may:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b337-11\" pgmap=\"337\">(1) set the time frame and terms for development and construction on the real property; and</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b337-12\" pgmap=\"337\">(2) provide for other matters consistent with this division.</blockquote> <p id=\"b337-13\" pgmap=\"337\">LU \u00a7 7-305 sets forth the procedures and process governing a DRRA, including that a public hearing must be held, that the local planning commission must review the proposed DRRA to determine whether it is consistent with the local jurisdiction\u2019s comprehensive plan, and that a DRRA must be recorded in the land records of the local jurisdiction within twenty days after the DRRA is executed.</p> <p id=\"b337-14\" pgmap=\"337\">LU \u00a7 7-302(a) authorizes the local governing body of a local jurisdiction to, \u201cby local law, establish procedures and requirements for the consideration and execution of agreements; and [ ] delegate all or part of the authority established under the local law to a public principal within the jurisdiction of the local governing body.\u201d (Paragraph break omitted).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To that end, the County has established procedures and requirements for the consideration and execution of DRRAs.

Stated otherwise, there is no evidence in the DRRA statute, its legislative history, or case law demonstrating an intent to require an enhanced public benefit as part of a DRRA. Nothing in FCC \u00a7 1-25-4 requires that a DRRA in Frederick County be supported by enhanced public benefits. Thus, we hold that the Blentlinger DRRA is not required to confer any enhanced public benefit to the County, and is supported by sufficient consideration.</p> <p id=\"b339-9\" pgmap=\"339(144) 340(52)\">We begin by examining the plain language of the DRRA statute. LU \u00a7 7-303(a), the relevant statute, sets forth the required contents of a DRRA. By its plain language, LU \u00a7 7-303(a) requires certain detailed items to be included in a DRRA, but an enhanced public benefit, or even a public benefit, is not identified among those required contents. Rather, LU \u00a7 7-303(a) requires a DRRA to include, among other things, a legal description of the real property subject to the DRRA, the duration of the DRRA, the density or intensity of use of the real property, and a statement that the proposed development is consistent with the local jurisdiction\u2019s comprehensive plan and development regulations. Significantly, LU \u00a7 7-303(a) does not mention, as one of the items that must be included in a DRRA, a requirement that a DRRA be supported by enhanced public benefits. Indeed, the term \u201cenhanced public benefit\u201d appears nowhere in LU \u00a7 7-303(a) or elsewhere in the DRRA statute, nor does the term \u201cpublic benefit.\u201d In short, the plain language of LU \u00a7 7-303(a) is unambiguous\u2014an enhanced public benefit is not a requirement of a DRRA.</p> <p id=\"b340-4\" pgmap=\"340\">Notwithstanding Cleanwater\u2019s and the County\u2019s contentions, we are unconvinced that LU \u00a7 7-303(a)(9) requires a DRRA to include an enhanced public benefit. LU \u00a7 7\u2014303(a)(9) provides: \u201cA [DRRA] shall include: [] a description of the conditions, terms, restrictions, or other requirements determined by the local governing body of the local jurisdiction to be necessary to ensure the public health, safety, or welfare[.]\u201d (Paragraph break omitted). LU \u00a7 7-30S(a)(9)\u2019s plain language is unambiguous, and merely requires the local governing body to determine, and include in the DRRA, a description of what it has determined to be necessary to ensure the public health, safety, or welfare. Tellingly, LU \u00a7 7-303(a)(9) does not require that a local governing body determine that any specifically identified condition, term, restriction, or other requirement is necessary to ensure the public health, safety, or welfare, or indicate in any way that a condition, term, restriction, or other requirement to ensure the public health, safety, or welfare constitutes an enhanced public benefit, or even a public benefit. We decline to read into the DRRA statute, and, specifically, LU \u00a7 7-303(a)(9), a requirement that is not evidenced by the clear language and plain meaning of the statute\u2014ie., we will not add words to the unambiguous DRRA statute to reach the strained result that Cleanwater and the County advocate. See Bellard, 452 Md. at 481, 157 A.3d at 280 (\u201c[W]e neither add nor delete words to a clear and unambiguous statute to give it a meaning not reflected by the words that the General Assembly used or engage in forced or subtle interpretation in an attempt to extend or limit the statute\u2019s meaning.\u201d (Citation omitted)).</p> <p id=\"b340-5\" pgmap=\"340(30) 341(116)\">Similarly, nothing in FCC \u00a7 l-25-4(A) requires a DRRA to provide for an enhanced public benefit. Like LU \u00a7 7-303(a), FCC \u00a7 l-25-4(A) sets forth the various requirements of a DRRA in the County, including, for example, the requirements that the DRRA contain a legal description of the property subject to the DRRA, the duration of the DRRA, and the density or intensity of use of the property. Unlike LU \u00a7 7\u2014303(a), FCC \u00a7 l-25-4(A)(l) also requires that a DRRA contain \u201c[a] lawyer\u2019s certification that applicant has either a legal or equitable interest in the property!)]\u201d That additional requirement is very different from setting forth a requirement that a DRRA in the County include enhanced public benefits. In short, nothing in LU \u00a7 7-303(a)\u2019s or FCC \u00a7 l-25-4(A)\u2019s plain language purports to include enhanced public benefits, or public benefits, as required content of a DRRA.</p> <p id=\"b341-4\" pgmap=\"341\">Although the plain language of LU \u00a7 7-303(a) and FCC \u00a7 l-25-4(A) is unambiguous\u2014and clearly does not require enhanced public benefits as part of a DRRA generally or in the County specifically\u2014and our analysis could end at this point, we nonetheless point out that our holding is fully supported by the legislative history and purpose of the DRRA statute. See Lamone v. Schlakman, 451 Md. 468, 496, 153 A.3d 144, 161 (2017) (\u201cAlthough the language of the statute is clear, a brief review of legislative history of relevant [statutory] provisions ... provides a context for our holding and confirms our interpretation of the statute.\u201d). A review of the DRRA statute\u2019s legislative history reinforces our conclusion that a DRRA is not required to confer enhanced public benefits to the county. Stated otherwise, a review of the DRRA\u2019s statute legislative history does not change the result or alter the plain meaning of LU \u00a7 7-303(a). The legislative history of the DRRA statute demonstrates that, in 1995, through House Bill 700, the General Assembly codified the use of development agreements when it enacted the DRRA statute. See 1995 Md. Laws 3242 (Vol. V, Ch. 562, H.B. 700). House Bill 700\u2019s bill file reveals that one of the main purposes of House Bill 700 was to permit vesting of rights through the use of DRRAs.</p> <p id=\"b341-5\" pgmap=\"341\">To that end, in a bill analysis of House Bill 700, the House Commerce and Government Committee explained House Bill 700\u2019s background in detail as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b342-3\" pgmap=\"342\">In a briefing paper provided by the Institute for Governmental Service, it was found that vested rights are defined legally in three ways: through common law, often under the principle of equitable estoppel; through just compensation and takings requirements in the federal and state constitutions; and through legislation. In focusing on the legislative remedies, the Institute found that states have used two approaches to solve the vesting problem: (1) prohibiting local governments from applying new regulations to ongoing projects by defining when vesting occurs, and (2) authorizing the use of development agreements.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b342-4\" pgmap=\"342\">To date, at least ten states have authorized development agreements in one form or another .... In Maryland, Montgomery County uses development agreements somewhat similar to those envisioned by this legislation. Development agreements can provide benefits for both developers and local governments. For the developer, a development agreement establishes the rules and regulations which will govern the project throughout its construction, and perhaps beyond. For the local government, the development agreement provides for greater certainty in the comprehensive planning process, as well as an opportunity to ensure the provision of necessary public facilities.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b342-5\" pgmap=\"342(149) 343(39)\">In Maryland, the Court of Appeals ruled in 1993 (Prince George\u2019s County vs. Sunrise Developments 330 Md. 297, 623 A.2d 1296 (1993) ]) that development rights do not vest in a property until construction begins on a structure that is visible to the general public. The effect of the ruling is to give a local government the ability to change a permissible land use until very late in the land use approval process. In fact, a change could occur after the issuance of a building permit, typically the last stage in the approval process. A similar bill was introduced in the 1994 session as House Bill 990. House Bill 990 received an unfavorable report from this committee. A workgroup was established in the interim which led to the development of House Bill 700. The work-group consisted [of] the following representatives: Linowes and Blocher; Fossett and Brugger; Maryland Builder\u2019s Association; Suburban Maryland Building Industry Association; Maryland Association of Counties; Maryland Municipal League; Calvert County Commissioner; Charles County Attorney; Chair of the State Economic Growth, Resource Protection, and Planning Commission; and the Critical Areas Commission.</blockquote> <p id=\"b343-4\" pgmap=\"343\">H.

Code (1957, 1995 Repl. Vol.), Art. 66B, \u00a7 13.01(f) did not include an enhanced public benefit as a requirement of a DRRA, and did not even mention the term \u201cenhanced public benefit.\u201d Thereafter, in 2012, Md. Code (1957, 1995 Repl. Vol.), Art. 66B, \u00a7 13.01(f) was recodified in Title 7 of the new Land Use Article; at that time, Md. Code (1957, 1995 Repl. Vol.), Art. 66B, \u00a7 13.01(f) became LU \u00a7 7-303 without substantive change. See 2012 Md. Laws 2157, 2291-92 (Vol. IV, Ch. 426, H.B. 1290). Indeed, the Revisor\u2019s Note to LU \u00a7 7-303 states that the \u201csection formerly was Art. 66B, \u00a7 13.01(f)[,]\u201d and that \u201c[t]he only changes are in style.\u201d LU \u00a7 7-303 has remained unchanged since 2012.</p> <p id=\"APh\" pgmap=\"347\">What we discern from this legislative history is that the DRRA statute has never required, and was not intended to require, a DRRA to confer enhanced public benefits to the county to be valid. In other words, the DRRA statute\u2019s legislative history fails to demonstrate that the provision of enhanced public benefits by the developer to the county is a requirement of a DRRA. There is simply nothing in House Bill 700\u2019s bill file to suggest that a purpose of House Bill 700, and ultimately the DRRA statute, was to ensure that local governing bodies received enhanced public benefits from developers. Importantly, the term \u201cenhanced public benefits\u201d does not appear anywhere in House Bill 700\u2019s bill file or in the DRRA statute as enacted. And, as demonstrated by the various bill analyses, the main purposes of House Bill 700 were to fix the problem of vesting caused by this Court\u2019s holding in Sunrise Development, 330 Md. 297, 623 A.2d 1296, and to allow developers and local governments to enter into DRRAs, which not only solved the vesting problem, but also resulted in mutually beneficial agreements through which both the developers and local governments achieved important goals.</p> <p id=\"b347-5\" pgmap=\"347(139) 348(29)\">As recognized by both the House Commerce and Government Committee and the Senate Economic and Environmental Affairs Committee, a benefit of a DRRA to the local government is that a DRRA \u201cprovides for greater certainty in the comprehensive planning process, as well as an opportunity to ensure the provision of necessary public facilities.\u201d However, these statements concerning the benefit to the local government speak only to the local government\u2019s ability to ensure the provision of \u201cnecessary public facilities,\u201d not the local government\u2019s ability to ensure \u201cenhanced public benefits.\u201d And, nothing in these statements leads to a conclusion that \u201cnecessary public facilities\u201d was intended to be the equivalent of \u201cenhanced public benefits.\u201d Moreover, tellingly, in the Senate Economic and Environmental Affairs Committee\u2019s floor report of House Bill 700, in summarizing House Bill 700 and outlining House Bill 700\u215b requirements for DRRAs, the provision of enhanced public benefits is not identified as an example of a specific item that must be included in a DRRA.</p> <p id=\"b348-4\" pgmap=\"348\">To be sure, House Bill 700\u2019s bill file includes a letter dated March 3, 1995, submitted by Maryland Association of Counties, Incorporated (\u201cthe Association\u201d) to the House Commerce and Governmental Matters Committee, in which the Association stated that it supported House Bill 700, and explained that House Bill 700 \u201csolves two problems\u201d:</p> <blockquote id=\"b348-5\" pgmap=\"348\">First, it clarifies that local governments already have the authority to establish developers agreements that define the terms and conditions of project approvals ....</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b348-6\" pgmap=\"348\">Second, a recent Supreme Court decision, see Dolan v. Tigard[,] 512 U.S. 374, 114 S.Ct. 2309, 129 L.Ed.2d 304 (1994), may unnecessarily limit the ability of a local government acquiring additional public benefits from a developer during development project approval negotiations. The new \u201crough proportionality\u201d test described by Dolan may restrict a community from securing a greater amount of desirable open space, density concessions, public infrastructure, or facility construction as part of project approval.</blockquote> <p id=\"A4q\" pgmap=\"348\">Significantly, although the Association mentioned \u201cadditional public benefits,\u201d and seemingly provided examples of what it considered to be additional public benefits, such as \u201ca greater amount of desirable open space, density concessions, public infrastructure, or facility construction as part of project approval,]\u201d the General Assembly did not amend House Bill 700 to provide, as a requirement for a DRRA, the inclusion of additional or enhanced public benefits to the county. Indeed, neither the examples that the Association provided, nor the term \u201cadditional public benefits,\u201d appeared in the original DRRA statute\u2019s requirements for the contents of a DRRA.</p> <p id=\"b348-7\" pgmap=\"348(52) 349(170)\">We reiterate the obvious point that, had it desired to do so, the General Assembly could have required a DRRA to be supported by enhanced public benefits. Cf. Bottini v. Dep\u2019t of Fin., 450 Md. 177, 206, 147 A.3d 371, 389 (2016) (\u201c[T]he General Assembly could have identified a bank account and the funds contained in a bank account as a separate classification of property subject to forfeiture, or as a specific form of tangible or intangible personal property distinct from money, had it desired to do so.\u201d (Citation omitted)); Montgomery Cty. v. Phillips, 445 Md. 55, 76, 124 A.3d 188, 200 (2015) (\u201cTellingly, the General Assembly could have, but did not, modify or otherwise raise the tax ceiling on the combined State agricultural land transfer tax and county agricultural land transfer tax that may be imposed.\u201d). Presumably, had the General Assembly intended to include the requirement that a DRRA be supported by enhanced public benefits, the General Assembly would have taken care to define the term \u201cenhanced public benefit,\u201d or otherwise delineate what would constitute an enhanced public benefit. Absent any indication in the relevant statutory language or the legislative history that the General Assembly intended that a DRRA be supported by enhanced public benefits, we decline to construe the DRRA statute to reach such a strained result.</p> <p id=\"A2q\" pgmap=\"349(209) 350(47)\">Importantly, nothing in case law that has been issued after the enactment of the DRRA statute leads to the conclusion that a DRRA must be supported by enhanced public benefits. Significantly, the term \u201cenhanced public benefits\u201d appears in only one opinion by this Court, Queen Anne\u2019s Conservation, 382 Md. at 322, 855 A.2d at 334, and was repeated later by the Court of Special Appeals in Cleanwater Linganore, Inc. v. Frederick Cty. (\u201cCasey\u201d), 231 Md.App. 373, 392, 151 A.3d 44, 55 (2016), and in its opinion in this case. In Queen Anne\u2019s Conservation, 382 Md. at 310, 311, 855 A.2d at 327, 328, this Court considered \u201cthe correct path to be followed by a person or entity, not a party to a DRRA, but who feels aggrieved by the execution of the agreement, in obtaining scrutiny of the legal bona fides of the DRRA[,]\u201d and held that the \u201c[ajppel-lants, in pursuing a challenge to the execution of the DRRA in th[e] case, were first required to file an appeal to the Board of Appeals and obtain a final administrative decision prior to seeking judicial review in the [trial cjourt.\u201d In other words, this Court determined that the trial court correctly dismissed the appellants\u2019\u2014non-DRRA parties\u2019\u2014action based on the appellants\u2019 \u201cfailure to exhaust an available and exclusive administrative remedy.\u201d Id. at 311, 855 A.2d at 328. In Queen Anne\u2019s Conservation, id. at 308-09, 322, 855 A.2d at 326, 334, this Court referenced \u201cpublic benefits\u201d on two occasions. In the introduction to the opinion, we stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b350-4\" pgmap=\"350\">[ ]DRRAs[ ] are a relatively recent addition to the Maryland toolbox of land use and development implements approved by the [General Assembly] for possible use by many local political subdivisions and the legal or equitable owners of real properties desiring to develop their properties. Although many states, such as California in 1979, preceded Maryland in recognizing the use of DRRAs or their equivalents, [the General Assembly] lingered until 1995 before enacting [the DRRA statute]. The legislation seems to be the result of the balancing of developers\u2019 and property owners\u2019 desires for a larger measure of certainty than that offered by proceeding to market through the traditional development processes, while risking the monetary investment to develop their property, against local governments\u2019 desire to receive greater public benefits on a more predictable schedule than might otherwise be attainable through the traditional processes.</blockquote> <p id=\"b350-5\" pgmap=\"350\">Id. at 308-09, 855 A.2d at 326 (emphasis added) (footnote and citations omitted). And, later in the opinion, in explaining one of the reasons why we disagreed with the contention \u201cthat a determination by the governing body of the local jurisdiction as to what terms, conditions, restrictions or other requirements are necessary to ensure the public health is the \u2018very essence\u2019 of the legislative function performed by local elected officials[,]\u201d we stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b350-6\" pgmap=\"350(76) 351(38)\">First, the negotiation of terms protective of public health, safety, or welfare, in a contract entered into by a local government body is a discretionary executive act, not a legislative one. See Montgomery County v. Revere Nat'l Corp., Inc., 341 Md. 366, 390, 671 A.2d 1, 12 (1996) (\u201cWhen the executive branch of the county government, in carrying out the laws and functions of government, enters into a contract, such action constitutes the exercise of executive discretion\u201d). A DRRA is not an ordinance or legislation as those terms are commonly understood; rather, it is a contract whose purpose is to vest rights under zoning laws and regulations, in consideration of enhanced public benefits.</blockquote> <p id=\"A3ip\" pgmap=\"351\">Queen Anne\u2019s Conservation, 382 Md. at 321-22, 855 A.2d at 334 (emphasis added).</p> <p id=\"b351-4\" pgmap=\"351\">As an initial matter, reading the opinion leads to the conclusion that the references to \u201cgreater public benefits\u201d and \u201cenhanced public benefits\u201d in Queen Anne\u2019s Conservation are nothing more than references to the fact that a local governing body may desire \u201cgreater public benefits\u201d and that a local governing body may bargain for \u201cenhanced public benefits\u201d as consideration in a DRRA. In Queen Anne\u2019s Conservation, the term \u201cenhanced public benefits\u201d is not defined or described in any manner. There is no reference to the DRRA statute or legislative history requiring enhanced public benefits as consideration in a DRRA. Simply put, the references to enhanced public benefits and greater public benefits in Queen Anne\u2019s Conservation fall far short of a holding that a DRRA must be supported by enhanced or greater public benefits\u2014ie., that a DRRA must consist of an enhanced public benefit to the county conferred by the developer. Indeed, the statements about \u201cgreater public benefits\u201d and \u201cenhanced public benefits\u201d are dicta. In Queen Anne\u2019s Conservation, id. at 310-11, 855 A.2d at 327-28, this Court\u2019s holding concerned a procedural matter as to whether the appellants challenging a DRRA, who were not parties to the agreement, had exhausted administrative remedies prior to seeking judicial review in the trial court. Nothing in Queen Anne\u2019s Conservation purported to address, let alone analyze, what contents are required for a DRRA to be valid, or whether LU \u00a7 7-303(a) requires enhanced public benefits. In other words, the references to \u201cgreater public benefits\u201d and \u201cenhanced public benefits\u201d \u201cwere neither part of nor essential to the holding[ ] in the [ ] case[ ] and therefore constitute mere obiter dicta[.T Silbersack v. ACandS, Inc., 402 Md. 673, 683, 938 A.2d 855, 860 (2008).</p> <p id=\"b351-5\" pgmap=\"351(19) 352(196)\">Additionally, in Queen Anne\u2019s Conservation, 382 Md. at 322, 855 A.2d at 334, the reference to \u201cenhanced public benefits\u201d must be read in the context of the paragraph in which the term appears. In the sentence preceding the sentence that includes the term \u201cenhanced public benefits,\u201d the Court stated: \u201cFirst, the negotiation of terms protective of public health, safety, or welfare, in a contract entered into by a local government body is a discretionary executive act, not a legislative one.\u201d Id. at 321, 855 A.2d at 334 (citation omitted). This sentence states that the ability to enter into, and negotiate the terms of, a DRRA is a discretionary executive act, insofar as the terms concerning the public health, safety, or welfare. Our remarks in Queen Anne\u2019s Conservation would be inconsistent if we were to announce, on the one hand, that the ability to enter into a DRRA and to negotiate terms related to the public health, safety, or welfare are discretionary executive acts, but mandate, on the other hand, that a local governing body must obtain enhanced public benefits as a requirement for a DRRA'\u2014ie., that enhanced public benefits are necessary to the public health, safety, or welfare, and that, as such, the local governing body must negotiate and obtain enhanced public benefits.</p> <p id=\"b352-4\" pgmap=\"352\">In Casey, 231 Md.App. at 378, 151 A.3d at 46-47, the Court of Special Appeals held that a DRRA did not include unlawfully broad language purporting to freeze local laws beyond that authorized by LU \u00a7 7-304, and that the BOCC made all required factual findings justifying the grant of PUD zoning. In Casey, id. at 380, 392, 151 A.3d at 48, 55, the Court of Special Appeals referenced \u201cpublic benefits\u201d on three occasions. In discussing the freeze provision of the DRRA statute, the Court of Special Appeals explained:</p> <blockquote id=\"b352-5\" pgmap=\"352\">Obtaining forbearance of the application of subsequent changes in relevant local laws provides certainty and stability to developers, whose projects may take many years to complete and/or sell-off or lease. Local governments derive, in return, negotiated greater public benefits than may be attained through typical governmental exactions or conditions of development approvals.</blockquote> <p id=\"b352-6\" pgmap=\"352(21) 353(46)\">Id. at 380, 151 A.3d at 48 (emphasis added). And, later in the opinion, immediately after quoting the House Commerce and Government Committee\u2019s bill analysis of House Bill 700\u2014 specifically, the language that \u201c[flor the local government, the development agreement provides for greater certainty in the comprehensive planning process, as well as an opportunity to ensure the provision of necessary public facilities\u201d\u2014the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b353-4\" pgmap=\"353\">What would achieve best the legislative purpose of balancing a developer\u2019s interest in legal stability against a local government\u2019s interest in certainty and obtaining enhanced public benefits; limiting, for example, the Casey DRRA\u2019s freeze provision to subsequent changes in the zoning code only, as urged by [the petitioner], or allowing it to apply to the expansive list of local provisions in the negotiated DRRA as written? If the DRRA [statute] only allowed DRRAs to freeze the application of local zoning ordinance provisions, a local government could undermine still the legal and financial stability of an on-going development project by changing the laws related to, for example, development or site plans, subdivision, or planning compliance. Where a developer assumed that its project could be thwarted by a last-minute or mid-stream change to any of these non-zoning laws, it would be less likely to undertake a substantial development at all in a jurisdiction. This, in turn, would frustrate the local government\u2019s interest in obtaining greater public benefits through negotiation of a DRRA\u2019s terms.</blockquote> <p id=\"b353-5\" pgmap=\"353\">Id. at 392, 151 A.3d at 55 (emphasis added).</p> <p id=\"b353-6\" pgmap=\"353(107) 354(101)\">First, to the extent that, in Casey, 231 Md.App. at 392, 151 A.3d at 55, the Court of Special Appeals read the DRRA statute\u2019s legislative history as providing that a local governing body must obtain enhanced public benefits, such a reading is mistaken. To be sure, both the House Commerce and Government Committee and the Senate Economic and Environmental Affairs Committee recognized, in their respective bill analyses, that a benefit of a DRRA to the local government is that a DRRA \u201cprovides for greater certainty in the comprehensive planning process, as well as an opportunity to ensure the provision of necessary public facilities.\u201d As we explained above, however, the Committees\u2019 statements about the benefit to the local government concern only a local government\u2019s ability to ensure the provision of \u201cnecessary public facilities,\u201d and not the local government\u2019s ability to ensure \u201cenhanced public benefits.\u201d And, nothing in the Committees\u2019 statements even suggests that \u201cnecessary public facilities\u201d was intended to be the equivalent of \u201cenhanced public benefits\u201d or that there was a requirement that a developer confer enhanced public benefits to a local governing body. Put simply, neither Queen Anne\u2019s Conservation nor Casey changes our holding that a DRRA is not required to be supported by enhanced public benefits.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b354-4\" pgmap=\"354\">Second, the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s statements in Casey referencing \u201cgreater public benefits\u201d and \u201cenhanced public benefits\u201d are dicta. In Casey, 231 Md.App. at 378, 381, 151 A.3d at 46-47, 48, the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s holdings concerned the freeze provision of a DRRA and of LU \u00a7 7-304, and whether the BOCC made the requisite findings for approving PUD zoning. As in Queen Anne\u2019s Conservation, nothing in Casey purported to address and decide the issues of what requirements a DRRA must include, and whether LU \u00a7 7-303(a) requires enhanced or greater public benefits. In other words, as in Queen Anne\u2019s Conservation, the references to \u201cgreater public benefits\u201d and \u201cenhanced public benefits\u201d in Casey \u201cwere neither part of nor essential to the holdings in the [ ] case[ ] and therefore constitute mere obiter dicta[.]\u201d Silbersack, 402 Md. at 683, 938 A.2d at 860. We do not consider the references in Casey to \u201cgreater public benefits\u201d and \u201cenhanced public benefits\u201d either precedential or persuasive as to whether the General Assembly intended to require that a DRRA be supported by enhanced public benefits.</p> <p id=\"b355-3\" pgmap=\"355\"> Having determined that a DRRA is not required to confer enhanced public benefits on a county to be valid, we turn to the issue of whether the Blentlinger DRRA is supported by sufficient consideration. We hold that it is. As an initial matter, contrary to Cleanwater\u2019s and the County\u2019s contentions, we know of no statute or case law requiring a DRRA\u2019s requirements to exceed requirements of a related PUD ordinance. In our view, a PUD ordinance and a DRRA are often a \u201cpackage deal,\u201d so it would seem commonsensical that the requirements of the two would largely mirror one another. And, we know of nothing that dictates that a DRRA\u2019s requirements must somehow exceed that of a PUD ordinance, or of any other regulation or local law. Simply put, we are unpersuaded by the argument that the Blentlinger DRRA is somehow void for lack of consideration on the basis that the Blentlinger DRRA\u2019s requirements are also required by the PUD Ordinance and other regulations and local laws, such as the APFO.</p> <p id=\"b355-4\" pgmap=\"355\">The consideration bestowed upon the BOCC, ie., the County, in the Blentlinger DRRA is sufficient. As we have explained, \u201cconsideration may be established by showing a benefit to the promisor or a detriment to the promisee.\u201d Cheek, 378 Md. at 148, 835 A.2d at 661 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see also Forty W. Builders, Inc., 178 Md.App. at 384-85, 941 A.2d at 1213 (\u201cIn Maryland, consideration may be established by showing a benefit to the promisor or a detriment to the promisee.\u201d (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). And, in Vogelhut, 308 Md. at 191, 517 A.2d at 1096, we explained:</p> <blockquote id=\"b355-5\" pgmap=\"355\">A benefit to the promisor or a detriment to the promisee is sufficient valuable consideration to support a contract. Legal detriment means giving up something which immediately prior thereto the promisee was privileged to retain, or doing or refraining from doing something which he was then privileged not to do, or not to refrain from doing.</blockquote> <p id=\"b355-6\" pgmap=\"355(15) 356(15)\">(Citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Additionally, \u201c[a] promise [may be] consideration for another promise [where] it constitutes a binding obligation.\u201d Cheek, 378 Md. at 148, 835 A.2d at 661.</p> <p id=\"b356-4\" pgmap=\"356\">Here, there were both benefits to the County and detriments to Petitioners, as well as binding promises on Petitioners\u2019 part, that constitute sufficient consideration for the County\u2019s entering into the DRRA, which guarantees vesting of rights. As to benefits to the County and detriments to Petitioners, in Section 2.2A of the Blentlinger DRRA, concerning development limitations, Petitioners agree to develop no more than 675 residential dwelling units\u2014ie., Petitioners agree that the maximum number of residential dwelling units permitted on the Property is 675. Pursuant to FCC \u00a7 1\u201419\u2014 10.500.6(H)(1)(a), however, a property that is designated as LDR in the Frederick County Comprehensive Plan may contain three to six dwelling units per acre. Thus, a maximum of 1,674 dwelling units could be permitted for the Property with the PUD zoning; and, by agreeing to limit the project to 675 residential dwelling units, Petitioners are relinquishing the right to pursue development of 999 additional residential dwelling units, or, at a minimum, the right to pursue development of 45 additional residential dwelling units, as Petitioners originally sought to develop 720 residential dwelling units. Clearly, this is a detriment to Petitioners, and the County benefits by limiting the number of residential dwelling units on the Property.</p> <p id=\"b356-5\" pgmap=\"356(129) 357(23)\">In Section 2.2E of the Blentlinger DRRA, Petitioners agree that, \u201cwith the exception of structures on the Public School Site and models for the Project, ... neither Frederick County, nor any agency, department, division and/or branch thereof shall issue any structural building permits, prior to January 1, 2020.\u201d Thus, as of the time of execution of the Blentlinger DRRA, Petitioners agreed to wait a period of just over five years before seeking building permits. In other words, Petitioners agreed to forego the right to seek structural building permits that they might otherwise have been entitled to seek but for the terms of the Blentlinger DRRA. Like the agreement to limit the number of residential dwelling units, the agreement to a limitation on the issuance of structural building permits obviously constitutes a detriment to Petitioners and effectively prevents them from proceeding with building up the development until January 1, 2020.</p> <p id=\"b357-4\" pgmap=\"357\">Moreover, the Blentlinger DRRA includes a plethora of binding promises by Petitioners that evidence consideration for the DRRA. For example, in Section 3.1 of the Blentlinger DRRA, to satisfy APFO requirements for the project, Petitioners agree \u201cto either construct or fund the construction of certain road improvements or contribute to escrow funds for road improvements, all as will be comprehensively set forth in an [APFO] Letter of Understanding[.]\u201d In Sections 3.2 and 3.3, Petitioners agree to comply with the sewer and water improvements required by the APFO Letter of Understanding, and to pay tap fees in accordance with the fee schedule in effect at the time of building permit application. In Section 3.4A, Petitioners agree to pay the school construction fee as a condition of APFO approval for the project at Phase II, notwithstanding the sunset of a school construction fee ordinance. And, pursuant to Section 3.4B, Petitioners agree that all \u201c[a]pplicable [s]chool [i]mpact [flees shall be paid at the time of the issuance of building permits in accordance with the fee schedule in effect at the time of the issuance of building permits.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b357-5\" pgmap=\"357(141) 358(23)\">As to property acquisition for public infrastructure, in Section 3.5A, Petitioners agree to \u201cexercise commercially reasonable efforts to secure [a third party\u2019s] right-of-way without the assistance of [Frederick] County\u201d in the event that such acquisition is necessary. In Section 3.5B, Petitioners agree that, if they demonstrate that they are unable to secure a public right-of-way through commercially reasonable efforts, then they may request that the County or the State Highway Administration assist in such acquisition at their \u201csole cost and expense.\u201d And, in Section 3.5C, Petitioners agree that, if the County decides not to acquire the right-of-way, or the two-year time period of assistance has passed, then Petitioners \u201cmay be permitted to make a contribution to the County equal to the entire anticipated project development costs, which shall include but not be limited to costs for: design, engineering, right-of-way acquisition, management, inspection, etc. in lieu of constructing the public infrastructure improvements^]\u201d unless the applicable APFO letter of understanding provides otherwise.</p> <p id=\"b358-4\" pgmap=\"358\">Additionally, in Section 7.1B, Petitioners waive the right to a \u201ctrial by jury in connection with any proceedings brought to enforce the terms of\u2019 the Blentlinger DRRA should they breach the terms of the DRRA and the BOCC is forced to bring a legal action for damages. In Section 8.3, concerning fees, Petitioners agree that, except as otherwise provided in the Blentlinger DRRA, they \u201cshall pay all fees (specifically including but not limited to impact fees, school mitigation fees and water and sewer connection fees) required by Frederick County at the rate in effect at the time the fee is due.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b358-5\" pgmap=\"358\">Finally, significantly, we conclude that the proffer of the middle school site is a conditional promise that constitutes sufficient consideration. In Section 3.4C, entitled \u201c[sjchool [sjite [dedication,\u201d Petitioners agree to convey, at no cost, approximately 24.5 acres of the Property to the BOE for a middle school site; specifically, Section 3.4C provides, in relevant part:</p> <blockquote id=\"b358-6\" pgmap=\"358(167) 359(64)\">[Petitioners] shall convey in fee simple to the [ ]B0E[ ], with no monetary consideration paid, the Public School Site shown on EXHIBIT 6, totaling a minimum of 24.5 \u00b1 buildable acres, to serve the Project and the surrounding region. The Public School Site will be conveyed to the BOE upon: i) the recordation of the first subdivision plat for lots in the Project; and ii) BOE\u2019s acceptance of the conveyance of land for the Public School Site .... A separate Memorandum of Understanding (\u201cBOE MOU\u201d) between the BOE and [Petitioners] shall be executed prior to unconditional Phase II approval for residential dwelling units in the Project (assuming commercially reasonable efforts by both parties), which MOU shall establish and control other aspects of the Public School Site and the rights and responsibilities of the parties relative to the Public School Site, and the construction of a public school .... In the event that the BOE does not approve the Public School Site or determines not to accept conveyance of the Public School Site, then [Petitioners] shall retain fee simple ownership of the Public School Site, and may use the Public School Site in a manner consistent with other uses with the Project. [Petitioners] acknowledge ] that use of the Public School Site may require regulatory approvals, including but not limited to, revision of the [PUD] .Ordinance.</blockquote> <p id=\"b359-4\" pgmap=\"359\">(Emphasis in original).</p> <p id=\"b359-5\" pgmap=\"359\">As an initial matter, we note that LU \u00a7 7-303(a) does not require that a DRRA include dedication of a portion of the real property for public use. Rather, as provided in LU \u00a7 7-303(a)(10)(i), a DRRA shall include \u201cto the extent applicable, provisions for the[ ] dedication of a portion of the real property for public use[J\u201d (Paragraph break omitted). Similarly, FCC \u00a7 1\u201426\u20144(A)(ll)(a) provides that a DRRA shall include, \u201c[t]o the extent applicable, provisions for the[ dedication of a portion of the property for public use[.]\u201d (Paragraph break omitted). In other words, under the DRRA statute and County ordinance, dedication of a portion of the property for public use is a requirement of a DRRA only \u201c[t]o the extent applicable\u201d\u2014ie., such dedication is not required as a matter of course with every DRRA. In other words, a DRRA could be valid under both State and County law without the dedication of land for public use.</p> <p id=\"b359-6\" pgmap=\"359(127) 360(138)\">Relevant here, FCC \u00a7 1-19-10.500.8(B), concerning public facilities, other than parks and recreation facilities, within PUD districts, provides: \u201cThe County Council [formerly, the BOCC] may require additional sites for other public facilities including schools, library services, or a fire and emergency medical service site to serve the proposed development where the County Council determines that a need exists based on established county standards of service.\u201d An applicant for PUD zoning is not required to proffer a school site or other public facility site to obtain PUD zoning; rather, as FCC \u00a7 1-19-10.500.8(B) demonstrates, the County Council, formerly, the BOCC, has the discretion to require such additional sites for public facilities such as schools where it determines that a need exists. Reading these statutory provisions together leads to the conclusion that LU \u00a7 7\u2014303(a)(10) (i) and FCC \u00a7 1-25-4(A)(ll)(a) are not automatically applicable to all DRRAs, as those provisions expressly state that only \u201cto the extent applicable\u201d shall a DRRA include provisions for the dedication of a portion of the property for public use; and under FCC \u00a7 1-19-10.500.8(B), the BOCC had the discretion to require the designation of a portion of the Property for public use, but was not required to do so. Simply put, under the relevant statutes, the Blentlinger DRRA was not required as a matter of course to include dedication of a portion of the Property for the middle school site. Nevertheless, despite not being required for the PUD Ordinance or the DRRA, Petitioners proffered the middle school site, and the proffer was incorporated into the Blentlinger DRRA.</p> <p id=\"b360-4\" pgmap=\"360(250) 361(21)\">Specifically, in Section 3.4C of the Blentlinger DRRA, Petitioners agree to convey in fee simple to the BOE, at no cost, the middle school site consisting of approximately 24.5 acres upon two conditions subsequent\u2014the recordation of the first subdivision plats for lots in the project, and the BOE\u2019s acceptance of the conveyance of the land for the middle school site. Thus, the conveyance of the middle school site rests on the BOE\u2019s acceptance or rejection of the site. This, however, does not make Petitioners\u2019 conditional promise of the middle school site \u201cillusory,\u201d as alleged by Cleanwater and the County. As we explained in Cheek, 378 Md. at 149, 835 A.2d at 662, \u201c[i]f A makes an illusory promise, A\u2019s words leave A\u2019s future action subject to A\u2019s own future whim, just as it would have been had A said nothing at all.\u201d (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Here, Petitioners have no control over whether the BOE will accept or reject the middle school site, and their future action\u2014either conveying the middle school site in fee simple to the BOE or retaining fee simple ownership of the site for use in a manner consistent with other uses with the project\u2014is not subject to their own determination. If the BOE accepts the middle school site, Petitioners\u2019 performance is mandatory; in Section 3.4C, Petitioners have expressly promised the middle school site if the BOE accepts it, and Petitioners will be required to deliver fee simple ownership of the middle school site under those circumstances. The proffer of the middle school site is valuable consideration for the Blent-linger DRRA.</p> <p id=\"b361-4\" pgmap=\"361\">In sum, we conclude that the Blentlinger DRRA\u2014indeed, any DRRA\u2014is not required to confer enhanced public benefits to the local governing body, ie., the County, to be valid; that the Blentlinger DRRA is supported by sufficient consideration; and that the Court of Special Appeals erred in concluding that the Blentlinger DRRA was void for lack of consideration.</p> <p id=\"b361-5\" pgmap=\"361\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

As such, we address the sufficiency of the consideration.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"3\"> <p id=\"b310-7\" pgmap=\"310\">.
