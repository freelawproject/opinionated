Waters, </em>35 Md. 531, 536 (1872).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">Remarkably similar to the formulation quoted by this Court in <em>Waters </em>in 1872, the current testamentary statute provides that \u201cevery will shall be (1) in writing, (2) signed by the testator, or by some other person for him, in his presence and by his express direction, and (3) attested and signed by two or more credible witnesses in the presence of the testator.\u201d Md. Code (1974, 2011 Repl. Vol.), Estates &amp; Trusts (\u201cET\u201d) \u00a7 4-102.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-11\">In fact, the statutory requirements for the valid execution of a will have remained virtually unchanged in Maryland for over two hundred years. In 1798, the General Assembly enacted the first testamentary statute in Maryland, which included strikingly similar language for devises:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>All devises and bequests of any lands or tenements, devisa-ble by law, shall be in writing, and signed by the party so devising the same, or by some other person in his presence, and by his express directions, and shall be attested and subscribed in the presence of the said devisor, by three or four credible witnesses, or else they shall be utterly void and of none effect[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">1798 Md. Laws, ch. 101, sub-ch. 1, \u00a7 4. This Court has previously traced the foundational roots of these longstanding testamentary formalities to the English Statute of Frauds. <em>See Casson v. Swogell, </em>304 Md. 641, 648-50, 500 A.2d 1031 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Relatively few changes have been made to the language of the 1798 statute. In 1884, the statute was amended such that only \u201ctwo or more credible witnesses\u201d were required for attestation. 1884 Md. Laws, ch. 293. In 1943, the statute was amended to add a paragraph (b), which provided exceptions to the statutory formalities for persons serving in the armed forces located outside of the United States.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 1943 Md. Laws, ch. 799. The current language of the statute first appeared in 1969 as Article 93, \u00a7 4-102 of the Maryland Code. <em>See </em>1969 Md. Laws, ch. 3, \u00a7 1. In 1974, the former Article 93 was recodified as the Estates and Trusts Article during Code Revision. <em>See </em>1974 Md. Laws, ch. 11, \u00a7 2. The statute has not been substantively amended since its enactment in its current form in 1969. <em>But see </em>2010 Md. Laws, ch. 72, \u00a7 6 (nonsubstan-tive amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">In this appeal, we must determine whether a will admitted to probate satisfied the statutory requirements for valid execution, particularly the requirement of attestation. For the following reasons, we hold that the will at issue satisfied the statutory requirements for valid execution, and therefore the circuit court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the testator\u2019s estate. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">Dr. Peter Castruceio died on February 19, 2013, at the age of eighty-nine. He was survived by his wife of sixty-two years, Sadie Castruceio, who was ninety-two years old at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\n<em>A. Drafting and Execution of the 2010 Will</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Peter signed a last will and testament on September 28, 2008, which he filed with the Register of Wills for Anne Arundel County for safekeeping. In September 2010, Peter asked his attorney, John Greiber, to retrieve the 2008 Will so that he could revise it. When Peter received the 2008 Will, he marked up the document in the presence of Mr. Greiber, and asked his longtime employee, Darlene Barclay, to transcribe his changes. Darlene made the requested changes and returned the draft 2010 Will to Peter, who reviewed it with Mr. Greiber on September 28,2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">On September 29, 2010, Peter signed the 2010 Will in the presence of three witnesses: Mr. Greiber, his daughter Samantha Greiber, and Darlene\u2019s daughter Kim Barclay, who had also been employed by Peter for approximately six years. Peter called the three witnesses into his office and requested that they sign the papers on his desk, which he identified as his will. Peter then signed the Will in the presence of Mr. Greiber, Samantha, and Earn. Next, each of the three witnesses signed the Will in the presence of Peter and each other. Six weeks later, on November 17, 2010, Mr. Greiber deposited the Will with the Register of Wills for Anne Arundel County, where it remained until one week after Peter\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">\n<em>B. Format and Substance of the 2010 Will</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">The 2010 Will, which is reproduced in the appendix to this opinion, consists of six pages, which are consecutively numbered as pages 1 of 6, 2 of 6, etc. The page numbers are centered on the bottom of each page. The words \u201cPeter Adalbert Castruceio\u201d are centered in large font on the top of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>page 1 of 6; otherwise, the font and type-size are consistent throughout the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">In the first paragraph on page 1 of 6 of the Will, Peter \u201cdeclare[s] this instrument as his WILL IN TESTAMENT [sic].\u201d The second paragraph on page 1 of 6 states that, upon his death, Peter \u201chereby declarete] the following:!.]\u201d Following these introductory paragraphs, the 2010 Will contains eleven consecutively numbered paragraphs labeled Item 1, Item 2, etc. Some paragraphs are further subdivided into consecutively numbered subparagraphs.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Item 1 names Mr. Greiber as Peter\u2019s personal representative for the administration of his estate. Item 7 leaves cash bequests of varying amounts to three specified individuals, including Darlene. Item 8 leaves \u201cthe rest and remainder\u201d of Peter\u2019s estate to Sadie, \u201cshould she one, survive [Peter] and two provided she has made and executed a Will prior to [Peter\u2019s] death.\u201d Item 10, entitled \u201cResiduary Clause,\u201d appearing on page 5 of 6, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-7\">Should, at the time of my death, my beloved wife not have a valid Will filed with the Register of Wills in Anne Arundel County dated prior thereto these, I hereby give, devise and bequeath all the rest and residue of my Estate and property, whether imposition, expectancy will remainder, including all property over which I may have Power of Appointment to the following individuals share and share alike per stirpes and not per capita to DARLENE BARCLAY, [address redacted], Glen Burnie, Maryland, 21061.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">Also on page 5 of 6 of the Will, below the \u201cResiduary Clause\u201d and Item 11, appears a concluding paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I, the above mentioned testator have hereunto set my hands and seals to this six page instrument, and have initial [sic] each page hereof, which instrument is intendant [sic] to be my Last Will and Testament, this 29^ day of September, 2010.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">(The date \u201c29th\u201d is handwritten above a blank line.) Contrary to this statement, none of the pages of the 2010 Will are initialed. Below this concluding paragraph, Peter signed his full name above the typewritten words \u201cPETER ADALBERT CASTRUCCIO[.]\u201d Below his signature are the words \u201cSIGNED, SEALED, PUBLISHED AND DECLARE [sic], BY PETER ADALBERT CASTRUCCIO.\u201d Another line down, the last two lines of page 5 of 6 read as follows: \u201cThe above named individual, does declare for his Last Will and Testament this instrument, have hereunto subscribed to have witness on the date last mentioned above, and at the location, and [....] \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The first two lines of the next page of the Will, page 6 of 6, appear to be a continuation of the sentence that began on the previous page: \u201cI do hereby attest that the testator to be of sound mind, fully able to understand this instrument, and the testator voluntarily and freely did sign same.\u201d Below these words are the signatures of Mr. Greiber, Kim, and Samantha, each appearing under the word \u201cWITNESS:\u201d and above a line that reads, \u201cSignature, residing at:[.]\u201d Below each signature appears the witness\u2019 address. (Mr. Greiber\u2019s address is typed consistent with the text of the document; Kim\u2019s and Samantha\u2019s addresses are handwritten in what appears to be the same handwriting as their signatures.) No other text appears on page 6 of 6, other than the pagination at the bottom of the page.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">\n<em>C. Petition to Caveat the 2010 Will</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AF\">On February 26, 2013, one week after Peter\u2019s death, Mr. Greiber filed a Petition for Administrative Probate with the Register of Wills for Anne Arundel County, requesting appointment as personal representative of Peter\u2019s estate and admission to probate of the 2010 Will. The next day, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Register of Wills issued an Administrative Probate Order, appointing Mr. Greiber as personal representative of Peter\u2019s estate and admitting the 2010 Will to administrative probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">At the time of Peter\u2019s death, Sadie had not filed a valid will with the Register of Wills for Anne Arundel County. Thus, under Mr. Greiber\u2019s interpretation of Peter\u2019s 2010 Will (and specifically the Residuary Clause), the residue of Peter\u2019s estate would pass to Darlene, not to Sadie. Seeking to avoid this result, on March 27, 2013, Sadie filed a Petition to Caveat Will in the Orphans\u2019 Court for Anne Arundel County. On July 2, 2013, Sadie petitioned the Orphans\u2019 Court to transmit issues related to the caveat to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">On August 1, 2013, the Orphans\u2019 Court entered an order transmitting seven issues to the Circuit Court for Anne Arun-del County for trial, designating Sadie as the plaintiff and the Estate of Peter Castruccio (\u201cEstate\u201d) as the defendant. The seven issues were designated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-7\">A. Was the six (6) page paper writing dated September 29, 2010, captioned \u201cPeter Adalbert Castruccio\u201d (the \u201cWill\u201d) executed by Peter Adalbert Castruccio (the \u201cTestator\u201d)[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-8\">B. Did the Testator execute the Will intending it to constitute his last will and testament?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-9\">C. Are all of the pages of the Will the genuine pages the Testator believed comprised the Will he intended to execute?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-10\">D. Was the execution of the Will procured by undue influence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-11\">E. Was the execution of the Will procured by fraud?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-12\">F. Was the Will actually attested and signed by credible witnesses in the presence of the Testator?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-13\">G. Were the contents of the Will read by or to the Testator or known to him at or before the time of its purported execution?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-14\">On September 17, 2013, the circuit court granted a motion to intervene filed by Darlene, and designated her as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>\n<em>D. Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">On October 10, 2013, the Estate filed a motion for summary-judgment on all seven issues. Sadie filed an opposition to the motion on October 30, 2013. The circuit court held hearings on the motion on February 21, 2014 and May 2, 2014. Meanwhile, on April 8, 2014, Sadie filed a cross-motion for summary judgment as to Issue F, arguing that the 2010 Will did not satisfy the statutory requirement of attestation because the witnesses did not sign on the same page as the testator or on \u201cphysically connected pages.\u201d Sadie submitted the affidavit of her attorney, who declared that he inspected the 2010 Will at the Register of Wills on March 27, 2013, and found that it \u201cconsisted of six separate, unattached pages, without any staple holes or other evidence of having ever been physically connected together.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Sadie also submitted the deposition testimony of Mr. Greiber and his daughter Samantha, both of whom were witnesses to the 2010 Will. In his deposition, Mr. Greiber recalled that the Will had been stapled when it was signed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-7\">Q. So he took his signature page and the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-8\">A. The whole will, I think everything was stapled together I\u2019m pretty sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-9\">Q. It was stapled at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-10\">A. I think, I\u2019m pretty sure. Again, Peter had a habit of stapling everything. I don\u2019t staple everything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-11\">Q. So\u2014and this is not a will but\u2014so if it was stapled, was it stapled like here\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-12\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-13\">Samantha also testified in her deposition that the 2010 Will was stapled at the time of signing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-14\">Q. Do you remember when he gave you the will\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-15\">A. Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-16\">Q. And again, if you don\u2019t remember please let me know. A. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-17\">Q. But whether it was actually stapled as one unit\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-18\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Q.\u2014or whether it was just loose papers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-4\">A. Stapled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">In addition, Samantha testified that she remembered seeing Peter initial each page of the Will:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-6\">Q. But you do remember seeing him sign it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-8\">Q. Do you remember seeing him initial each page?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-9\">[Counsel for the Estate]: Object to the question. Go ahead and answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-11\">A. Yes. Yeah. I remember him signing and then him getting up and giving the will to me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-13\">Based on this testimony and the affidavit of her attorney, Sadie argued that summary judgment as to the remaining issues (other than Issue F) was inappropriate because there were disputed issues of material facts. Specifically, Sadie noted that the 2010 Will admitted to probate did not match the physical description of the will provided by Mr. Greiber and Samantha: The 2010 Will was not stapled nor was each page initialed, even though Mr. Greiber and Samantha stated that it was at the time of signing.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-14\">\n<em>E. The Lower Courts \u2019 Rulings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b46-15\">On September 23, 2014, the circuit court issued a memorandum decision granting the Estate\u2019s motion for summary judgment on all issues and denying Sadie\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment as to Issue F. In reaching its decision, the circuit court \u201cproceeded ... on the assumption ... that the separate sheets of the Will were not mechanically affixed by a staple or other device and were not so affixed when deposited with the Register of Wills for safekeeping on November 17, 2010.\u201d The court then concluded, as to Issue F, \u201cthat the focus should be on a more holistic inquiry about whether the document purporting to be the will holds together as the unitary document completed by the testator and signed by the witnesses rather than an inquiry that at a certain point some or all of the pages were mechanically affixed to each other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>As to the remaining issues, the circuit court found that the 2010 Will contained a proper attestation clause, and therefore the presumption of due execution attached. The court also found that Sadie had not presented clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption. Finally, regarding Peter\u2019s testamentary capacity, the court found \u201cthat while Peter was at age 84, elderly, he appears to have been fully in control of what his desires and intentions were and was not one to be lead [sic] by others or even to take advice\u2014including good advice\u2014that he did not appreciate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">On October 2, 2014, the circuit court entered an order consistent with its memorandum decision. In its order, the court found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-5\">A. the six page paper writing dated September 29, 2010, captioned \u201cPeter Adalbert Castruccio\u201d (the \u201cWill\u201d) was executed by Peter Adalbert Castruccio (the \u201cTestator\u201d);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-6\">B. the Testator executed his Will with the intention that it constituted his last will and testament;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">C. all of the pages of the Will are the genuine pages the Testator believed comprised the Will he intended to execute;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">D. the Will was not procured by undue influence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-9\">E. the Will was not procured by fraud;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-10\">F. the Will was actually attested and signed by credible witnesses in the presence of the testator; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-11\">G. the contents of the Will were read by the Testator and known to him at and before the time of the execution of the Will on September 29, 2010.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-12\">On October 9, 2014, Sadie filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-13\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the circuit court in a reported opinion issued on July 28, 2016. Sadie filed a motion for reconsideration, which the intermediate appellate court granted in part and denied in part. The Court of Special Appeals issued a revised opinion on September 29, 2016. <em>Castruccio v. Estate of Castruccio, </em>230 Md.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>118, 146 A.3d 1132 (2016). Sadie then petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, which this Court granted on January 9, 2017. <em>Castruccio v. Estate of Castruccio, </em>451 Md. 248, 152 A.3d 753 (2017). Sadie presents three questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-5\">I. Can a Will satisfy the requirements of valid execution in Maryland if (a) the testator and the witnesses do not sign on the same page, or on physically connected pages, (b) the Will contains no proper attestation clause, and (c) the Will was not otherwise regular on its face because it expressly states the pages were initialed, but they were not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\">II. Can a presumption of due execution attach to a Will (a) executed by the testator and the witnesses on separate, loose pages, (b) containing no valid attestation clause, (c) expressly stating the pages were initialed, when they were not, and (d) lacking any other evidence that the witnesses signed in the presence of the testator, based on a common font, consecutive page numbering, and continuation of language?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\">III. Can summary judgment as to a Will\u2019s validity be granted where the physical description of the Will by two of the witnesses directly contradict[s] the actual physical condition of the Will submitted for probate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-9\">The question of whether a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was proper is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review on appeal. In reviewing a grant of summary judgment under Md. Rule 2-501, we independently review the record to determine whether the parties properly generated a dispute of material fact, and, if not, whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We review the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and construe any reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the facts against the moving party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number><em>Boland v. Boland, </em>423 Md. 296, 366, 31 A.3d 529 (2011) (quoting <em>Haas v. Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>396 Md. 469, 479, 914 A.2d 735 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">In Maryland, in order to be validly executed, a will must be \u201c(1) in writing, (2) signed by the testator, or by some other person for him, in his presence and by his express direction, and (3) attested and signed by two or more credible witnesses in the presence of the testator.\u201d ET \u00a7 4-102, The proponent of the will bears \u201c[t]he burden of proving the existence of these elements, by a preponderance of the evi-denee[.]\u201d <em>Groat v. Sundberg, </em>213 Md.App. 144, 152, 73 A.3d 374 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">One way to establish the validity of a will is through an attestation clause in the will itself. \u201cAn attestation clause is a \u2018provision at the end of an instrument (esp. a will) that is signed by the instrument\u2019s witnesses and that recites the formalities required by the jurisdiction in which the instrument might take effect (such as where the will might be probated).\u2019 \u201d <em>Slack v. Truitt, </em>368 Md. 2, 8 n.5, 791 A.2d 129 (2002) (quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 124 (7th ed. 1999)). \u201c[A]n attestation clause reciting facts necessary for the valid execution of a will is prima facie evidence of the due execution of the will, if it bears the genuine signatures of the testator and subscribing witnesses.\u201d <em>Van Meter v. Van Meter, </em>183 Md. 614, 617-18, 39 A.2d 752 (1944). Furthermore, \u201ca presumption of due execution attaches to a will that contains the testator\u2019s signature and an attestation clause signed by the witnesses.\u201d <em>Slack, </em>368 Md. at 7-8, 791 A.2d 129 (footnote omitted). \u201c[0]nce the presumption attaches, the burden of proof is on the caveator to show by clear and convincing evidence that the facts stated in the attestation clause are untrue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8, 791 A.2d 129 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">On the other hand, an attestation clause is not a requirement for a valid will. <em>See id. </em>at 8 n.5, 791 A.2d 129 (\u201cA formal attestation clause is not an essential part of a will.\u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number><em>Van Meter, </em>183 Md. at 617, 39 A.2d 752 (\u201cThe validity of the execution of a will depends, not upon an attestation clause, but upon conformity of the execution with the requirements of the statute, and also the testimony of the subscribing witnesses if they are produced and examined.\u201d). Nor is an attestation clause required in order to establish the presumption of due execution. <em>See Slack, </em>368 Md. at 12, 791 A.2d 129 (\u201c[A]n attestation clause is not the <em>sine qua non </em>of the presumption of due execution.\u201d). \u201c[I]n the absence of an attestation clause, if a proponent of a testamentary document can adduce sufficient evidence from the document and/or surrounding circumstances to make a <em>prima facie </em>case for the satisfaction of the statutory requirements for execution of a will, the presumption of due execution attaches.\u201d <em>Groat, </em>213 Md.App. at 156-57, 73 A.3d 374. Thus, a proper attestation clause in a will is itself sufficient to establish a prima facie case for the validity of the will, but is not necessary to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">\u201cThe attestation of the will is the act of the witnesses in seeing that those things exist and are done which the attestation clause declares were done and which the statute requires.\u201d <em>McIntyre v. Saltysiak, </em>205 Md. 415, 421, 109 A.2d 70 (1954). In other words, the witnesses\u2019 attestation confirms that the will was executed in accordance with the requirements of ET \u00a7 4-102. Attestation requires that \u201cthe testator directly or indirectly request[ ] those persons who do attest [the will] to subscribe their names to it as witnesses.\u201d <em>Casson, </em>304 Md. at 654-55, 500 A.2d 1031 (quoting <em>Gross v. Burneston, </em>91 Md. 383, 387, 46 A. 993 (1900)). \u201c[T]he testator need not formally ask the witness to sign the paper, his implied assent being sufficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 654, 500 A.2d 1031. Furthermore, \u201cwhere the testator signs a will in front of the witnesses, proper attestation does not require that the testator inform the witnesses that they are signing a will.\u201d <em>Slack, </em>368 Md. at 13, 791 A.2d 129 (citing <em>Casson, </em>304 Md. at 656, 500 A.2d 1031). Nor does attestation require that the witnesses \u201csee the testator sign the will.\u201d <em>Van Meter, </em>183 Md. at 617, 39 A.2d 752. But, if the witnesses do not observe the testator signing the will, then \u201cthe testator must <em>acknowledge </em>his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>signature before the witnesses or declare the document to be his will.\u201d <em>Slack, </em>368 Md. at 13, 791 A.2d 129 (citing <em>Casson, </em>304 Md. at 655, 500 A.2d 1031).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">In contrast, the witnesses must always sign the will in the presence of the testator. <em>See Groat, </em>213 Md.App. at 161-62, 73 A.3d 374; ET \u00a7 4-102(3). \u201cIn the presence of the testator\u201d means \u201cwithin the unobstructed range of vision of the testator, although if he is able to see it, without any material change of position, the fact that he does or does not avail himself of the privilege is immaterial.\u201d <em>Groat, </em>213 Md.App. at 161-62, 73 A.3d 374 (quoting <em>Brittingham v. Brittingham, </em>147 Md. 153, 160, 127 A. 737 (1925)). In other words, \u201c[i]t is not necessary for the testator to have watched the witnesses sign, as long as the testator <em>could </em>have watched them sign.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162, 73 A.3d 374 (alteration in original) (quoting Restatement (Third) of Property, Wills and Other Donative Transfers \u00a7 3.1 cmt. p (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">In this appeal, Sadie does not dispute that the 2010 Will satisfies the requirements of ET \u00a7 4-102(1) and (2)\u2014it is a writing, signed by Peter, the testator. Sadie also does not dispute that the Will was \u201csigned by two or more credible witnesses in the presence of the testator\u201d\u2014it was in fact signed by three credible witnesses in the presence of Peter and each other. Furthermore, there is no dispute over the requirement that the witnesses either see the testator sign the will or that he acknowledge his signature or declare the document to be his will. In fact, Peter signed the 2010 Will in the presence of the three witnesses, <em>and </em>he identified the document as his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Instead, Sadie contends that the 2010 Will does not satisfy the requirement of ET \u00a7 4-102(3) that the will be \u201cattested ... by two or more credible witnesses.\u201d Quoting <em>Shane v. Wooley, </em>138 Md. 75, 78, 113 A. 652 (1921), Sadie argues that attestation requires \u201cthat the witnesses must sign, either upon the same sheet as the signature of the testator, or on some sheet physically connected with it.\u201d Because Peter signed on page 5 of 6 of the 2010 Will, and the three witnesses signed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>page 6 of 6, and those pages were not physically connected at the time of signing (or, at a minimum, there is a factual dispute as to whether the pages were physically connected when signed), Sadie argues that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the Estate on the issue of attestation. In addition, Sadie contends that the 2010 Will is otherwise invalid because it does not contain a \u201cproper attestation clause,\u201d and because the Will \u201cexpressly states [that] the pages were initialed, but they were not.\u201d In the alternative, Sadie argues that even if these deficiencies do not necessarily invalidate the 2010 Will, the circuit court nonetheless erred in finding that the presumption of due execution attached to the Will, thereby requiring Sadie to rebut the presumption by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\n<em>A. Attestation on a Different Page than the Testator\u2019s Signature</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The primary issue in this case is whether attestation requires that the testator and the witnesses sign on the same page of the will, or else on physically connected pages. Sadie cites <em>Shane v. Wooley </em>for the proposition that attestation requires \u201cthat the witnesses must sign, either upon the same sheet as the signature of the testator, or on some sheet physically connected with it.\u201d <em>Shane, </em>138 Md. at 78, 113 A. 652. The Estate and Darlene respond that the \u201cphysically connected\u201d rule of <em>Shane </em>applies only when the attestation is \u201con a document separate from the will itself\u2019; this rule does not apply, they contend, to separate pages of a multi-page will.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\"><em>Shane </em>involved a one-page will that had been signed by the testatrix, placed in an envelope, and sealed. 138 Md. at 76, 113 A. 652. The following language \u201cappeared across the sealed portion of the envelope,\u201d followed by the signatures of three witnesses: \u201cWe have seen the said Mrs. Catherine Shane sign and seal this paper in our presence and at her request we hereby sign our names as witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The plaintiffs argued that the will was invalid because the witnesses signing on the envelope rather than the will itself did not satisfy the statutory requirement of attestation. <em>Id. </em>at 77, 113 A. 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>In <em>Shane, </em>this Court examined a variety of cases (both in state and out of state) and treatises, and arrived at the following observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abd\">While there is no provision of the statute of this State which requires in terms that the attestation clause and the signatures of the witnesses shall be at the end of the will or at any particular place of the will, as in some of the States of the Union, the weight of authority, however, appears to be that the witnesses must sign, either upon the same sheet as the signature of the testator, or on some sheet physically connected -with it, to constitute a valid will.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 78, 113 A. 652. After summarizing those authorities, the Court concluded that \u201cit is obvious, under the authorities cited, the formalities prescribed by law, in the execution of wills, have not been complied with, to constitute a valid will.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 80, 113 A. 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">As the Estate and Darlene note, however, the facts of <em>Shane </em>and the eases cited therein are materially distinguishable from the facts of this case. For example, the <em>Shane </em>Court quoted <em>Brengle v. Tucker </em>for the proposition that \u201c[t]o subscribe means that the witnesses shall sign their name to the same paper for the purpose of identification, and implies that attestation has been performed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78, 113 A. 652 (quoting <em>Brengle v. Tucker, </em>114 Md. 597, 602, 80 A. 224 (1911)). In <em>Brengle, </em>the testator wrote and signed a will from a hospital bed immediately before going into surgery. <em>Brengle, </em>114 Md. at 599-600, 80 A. 224. After writing the purported will on a piece of paper he had received from his doctor, the testator handed the paper back to the doctor and asked him to sign it. <em>Id. </em>at 600, 80 A. 224. The doctor complied. <em>Id. </em>Although there were three other people in the hospital room who had also witnessed these events, none of them signed the purported will. <em>Id. </em>at 601, 80 A. 224. The Court held that the purported will did not satisfy the statutory requirements because there was \u201conly one subscribing witness to [the] paper writing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 602, 80 A. 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Thus, the issue in <em>Brengle </em>was not <em>where </em>the witnesses must sign in order to satisfy the statutory requirement of attestation, but <em>whether </em>the \u201cwitnesses\u201d must sign the will <em>at all </em>in order to satisfy the requirement, when it is undisputed that they actually witnessed the testator write and sign the will. In this case, there is no dispute that three witnesses actually signed the 2010 Will in the presence of Peter and each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">The <em>Shane </em>Court also cited <em>In re Baldwin\u2019s Will </em>for the proposition that \u201c[t]he authorities hold that the attestation or subscription by witnesses must be on the same sheet of paper as that which contains the testator\u2019s signature, or else upon some paper physically connected with that sheet.\u201d <em>Shane, </em>138 Md. at 78, 113 A. 652 (quoting <em>In re Baldwin\u2019s Will, </em>146 N.C. 25, 59 S.E. 163, 165 (1907)). In <em>Baldwin, </em>Mr. Covington wrote a will that was dictated to him by the testator, Mr. Baldwin. <em>Baldwin, </em>59 S.E. at 164. Mr. Baldwin signed the will in Mr. Covington\u2019s presence, and Mr. Covington signed the will as a witness in the presence of Mr. Baldwin. <em>Id. </em>Later, Mr. Coving-ton took the paper writing with his and Mr. Baldwin\u2019s signatures to his home and \u201ctranscribed it on better paper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There, outside the presence of Mr. Baldwin, Mr. Covington signed this new copy of the will as a witness. <em>Id. </em>At some point after Mr. Covington returned the new copy to Mr. Baldwin, Mr. Baldwin signed it outside the presence of Mr. Covington. <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, another witness named Mr, Bowles signed the new copy of the will at the request and in the presence of Mr. Baldwin. <em>Id. </em>at 164-65. After Mr. Baldwin\u2019s death, his wife burned the original copy of the will, and only the second copy (on better paper) was admitted to probate. <em>Id. </em>at 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The Supreme Court of North Carolina held that the second copy of the will did not satisfy the statutory \u201crequirement that the will shall be subscribed in the presence of the testator by two witnesses at least.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This was because Mr. Covington signed the second copy of the will before Mr. Baldwin had signed it and outside his presence. <em>Id. </em>It was immaterial that Mr. Covington had signed the original copy in Mr. Baldwin\u2019s presence, because this copy \u201cwas not attached in any way to the paper offered for probate and had no physical connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>with it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the Court held that, \u201c[i]n the absence of any sort of physical connection between the two papers, resort cannot be had to parol proof to show a similarity of contents, and that they constituted one and the same will.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Thus, the issue in <em>Baldwin </em>was whether a witness\u2019 proper attestation of one copy of a will could essentially transfer to a second copy of the will, when the witness\u2019 signature on the second copy occurred outside the presence of the testator and consequently was invalid. In this case, all three witnesses signed the 2010 Will after Peter had signed it, in the presence of Peter and each other. All four signatories signed the same document (albeit on separate pages) as part of the same transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The <em>Shane </em>Court also relied on James Schouler, <em>Law of Wills, Executors, and Administrators </em>\u00a7 336 (5th ed. 1915). <em>Shane, </em>138 Md. at 79, 113 A. 652. That section is entitled \u201cAttestation on a Different Paper\u201d and provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">But the attestation or subscription by witnesses must be on the same sheet of paper as that which contains the testator\u2019s own signature, or else upon some paper physically connected with that sheet. No particular mode of connection is prescribed by law; and hence the fastening by tape, by eyelets, by mucilage, or even by a pin, seems unobjectionable. Where papers are thus connected, the testator may sign on one paper and the witnesses on another, provided their intent corresponded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">But attestation or a subscription by witnesses on a piece of paper, detached and separated from the will and the testator\u2019s signature, nor affixed in his presence to the paper at the time of execution, fails of compliance with the policy of our law; we may assume it to be void, as otherwise a door would be open to much fraud and perjury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">Schouler, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 336 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). Notably, the <em>Shane </em>Court did not cite to the next section of Schouler, \u00a7 337, which is entitled \u201cAttestation where a Will is written on Several Sheets.\u201d That section provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>[Ijf the will be written on several sheets, whether fastened together or not, and the last sheet alone is attested in form, the whole will is well executed, provided all the sheets were in the room.... and unquestionably, if the several pieces of paper are connected in their provisions and form a connected series, and are brought in this shape before the attesting witnesses at the time of their subscription, a single attestation will suffice for the whole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">The fact that the <em>Shane </em>Court cited \u00a7 336, which discusses attestation \u201con a piece of paper detached and separated from the will,\u201d but did not cite \u00a7 337, which describes a will \u201cwritten on several sheets, whether fastened together or not,\u201d supports the Estate\u2019s and Darlene\u2019s position that the <em>Shane </em>Court was only concerned with the validity of the attestation when the witnesses sign a document other than the will itself, not when the witnesses sign the will on a different piece of paper than the testator. Indeed, these were the facts in <em>Shane: </em>the testator signed a one-page will, while the \u25a0witnesses signed on a sealed envelope containing the will. Unlike here, where the three witnesses signed <em>the will </em>on a different page than the testator, the witnesses in <em>Shane </em>did not sign <em>the will </em>at all. Therefore, we conclude that the \u201cphysically connected\u201d rule of <em>Shane </em>does not apply to loose pages of a multi-page will. Instead, <em>Shane </em>stands for the proposition that, when the witnesses sign on a piece of paper that is not part of the will itself, the paper must be physically connected to the will in order to satisfy the statutory requirement of attestation.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">As we have just determined, <em>Shane </em>did not address the issue presented in this case: when the witnesses sign the will on a different page than the testator, must the pages be physically connected in order to satisfy the statutory requirement of attestation? In fact, the majority of the cases cited by the parties to this Court are generally concerned with the validity of a multi-page will whose pages are not physically connected at the time of execution, rather than the validity of the attestation when it is not on the same page as the testator\u2019s signature. <em>See, e.g., In re Estate of Beale, </em>15 Wis.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>546, 113 N.W.2d 380 (1962); <em>In re Covington\u2019s Estate, </em>348 Pa, 1, 33 A.2d 235 (1943); <em>In re Swaim\u2019s Will, </em>162 N.C. 213, 78 S.E. 72 (1913). Those cases generally hold that a multi-page will is not invalid merely because its pages are not physically connected, as long as \u201cthey are connected by their internal sense by coherence or adaptation of parts.\u201d <em>Swaim, 78 </em>S.E. at 73; <em>see also id. </em>(\u201c[T]he papers themselves bear intrinsic evidence that, while separate, they were tacked together in the mind of the testator.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">Sadie acknowledges that \u201c[t]he overwhelming majority of the cited material confirms that a properly executed will may be valid even if written on disconnected sheets,\u201d and she does not challenge this principle. Thus, Sadie does not dispute the validity of the 2010 Will merely because its pages were not physically connected. Nor does she dispute whether the page containing Peter\u2019s signature (page 5 of 6) and the page containing the witnesses\u2019 signatures (page 6 of 6) are part of the same document constituting the 2010 Will. Instead, Sadie argues that the 2010 Will was not properly attested, because the witnesses did not sign on the same page as the testator\u2019s signature or on a page physically connected to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The parties have cited, and this Court has been able to find, only one case in American jurisprudence that addresses this precise issue: <em>In re Kaiser\u2019s Estate, </em>150 Neb. 295, 34 N.W.2d 366 (1948).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The will in <em>Kaiser </em>\u201cconsisted of two sheets num<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>bered (1) and (2) respectively. The dispositive portion of the will thus written, and signed by the testator, all appeared on page (1). The perfected attestation clause thereof, subscribed by the witnesses, alone appeared on page (2).\u201d Kaiser, 34 N.W.2d at 370. The evidence did not affirmatively show \u201c[w]hether or not the two sheets were physically attached to each other at the time of execution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[Ajfter the execution of the will[,] both pages were placed in a sealed envelope and on the same day delivered into the custody of the county judge, who thereafter opened it only after [the] testator\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">The <em>Kaiser </em>Court noted that \u201c[t]here is no statutory provision in this state designating just where a will shall be attested and subscribed by the witnesses, or forbidding the use of separate sheets in making a will, or directing how or that they shall be physically attached to each other in order to make a valid will.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 373. The Court also observed, \u201c[i]n the case at bar, the sheets were not only connected by their internal sense, but identified by the subscribing witnesses as connected parts of [the] testator\u2019s will.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the Court upheld the validity of the will. <em>Id. </em>at 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Sadie attempts to distinguish <em>Kaiser </em>by noting that the will in that case \u201ccontained a <em>valid attestation clause,\u201d </em>and \u201cwas placed in a sealed envelope after it was signed, from which it did not emerge until the testator\u2019s death.\u201d Indeed, these additional facts provide further indications of the validity of the will in <em>Kaiser. </em>However, these additional facts have no bearing on whether attestation requires the witnesses to sign on the same page as the testator, or else on physically connected pages. If attestation required the witnesses to sign on the same page as the testator, or else on physically connected pages, then it would not matter that the will bore certain other indicia of its validity, such as having a valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>attestation clause and remaining in a sealed envelope. In other words, if the will was not properly attested as required by statute, then it would have been invalid, regardless of any other indicia of validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">This Court considered a similar issue in <em>Casson. </em>In that case, the Court rejected an argument \u201cthat the will is invalid because the signatures of both witnesses do not appear at the end of the will, and do not appear in close proximity to one another at any particular place on the document.\u201d 304 Md. at 657, 500 A.2d 1031. The Court noted that ET \u00a7 4-102 \u201cdoes not require the witnesses to sign together, or at any particular place on the will.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Therefore, the Court concluded that \u201c[wjhile the fact that the two witnesses did not sign in the same place may bear on the jury question of whether the will is a fraud, it does not constitute a fatal variance from the required procedure for lawful execution.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Furthermore, we believe that the holding of <em>Kaiser </em>comports with previous decisions of this Court emphasizing the effectuation of the testator\u2019s intent over strict compliance with the statutory formalities. For example, in <em>Slack, </em>this Court held that the presumption of due execution attaches to a will notwithstanding the absence of an attestation clause, as long as the will bears sufficient other indicia of due execution. 368 Md. at 12, 791 A.2d 129. Moreover, the <em>Slack </em>Court declined to invalidate the will at issue in that case even though one of the witnesses \u201ctestified that she did not know that the paper she was signing was a will, and could not remember whether she saw [the testatorj\u2019s signature on the document.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14, 791 A.2d 129. The Court noted that the purpose of ET \u00a7 4-102 \u201cwas to remove uncertainty in the making of wills and to prevent the practice of imposition and fraud upon testators.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17, 791 A.2d 129. The Court then observed that the circumstances of that case did \u201cnot suggest that there was any fraud worked upon the testator. The will was found in [the] testator\u2019s home after his death, duly signed and witnessed; this shows that the testator thought it was a valid will.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Therefore, the <em>Slack </em>Court concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>\u201cthe will was entitled to probate as a validly executed will.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18, 791 A.2d 129. Additionally, in <em>Casson, </em>this Court held that \u201c[t]o fulfill the requirement that a testator request a witness sign a document it is not necessary that the witness know it is a will.\u201d 304 Md. at 654, 500 A.2d 1031.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Thus, this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Casson </em>and <em>Slack </em>indicate that the Court is generally reluctant to impose formalities beyond those specifically required by statute, and that the testator\u2019s intention that the document act as his will is paramount. <em>Cf. Carney v. Kosko, </em>229 Md. 112, 117, 182 A.2d 28 (1962) (\u201c[A] will or a codicil need not be in any particular form, so long as it (a) makes a disposition of the testator\u2019s property, and (b) such disposition is to take effect only upon death.\u201d); <em>see also </em>Restatement (Third) of Property (Wills &amp; Don. Trans.) \u00a7 3.1, cmt. f (\u201cA court should never impose formal requirements beyond those in the statute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Moreover, we believe that Sadie\u2019s proposed rule\u2014that the witnesses must sign on the same page as the testator, or on physically connected pages\u2014would not serve the purpose of ET \u00a7 4-102, \u201cto prevent the practice of imposition and fraud upon testators.\u201d <em>Slack, </em>368 Md. at 17, 791 A.2d 129. To the contrary, we believe that Sadie\u2019s rule would result in the invalidation of numerous wills that otherwise comply with the statutory requirements and present no evidence of fraud. As the Court of Special Appeals noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">One need not strain to consider the unfortunate results that could occur when a will is drafted on word-processing software, as most undoubtedly are these days. Even if the places for the witnesses\u2019 signatures are initially adjacent to the testator\u2019s, the slightest revisions or additions to the body of the will may send them to a new page, presumably in violation of the strict rule that [Sadie] advances. The results may attend changes to the font, font size, or margins. Facing such potentially ruinous results, the testator might have to compose the document on a scroll.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-7\"><em>Castruccio, </em>230 Md.App. at 142 n.13, 146 A.3d 1132. In addition, \u201cthe physical-connection rule is fraught with vagueness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>and uncertainty. Would a paperclip or binder clip suffice? What if someone pinched the pages between her thumb and index finger while the witnesses signed? What if the pages were pressed together under a paperweight?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143, 146 A.3d 1132.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">For all of these reasons, we conclude that attestation does not require the witnesses to sign on the same page as the testator, or on physically connected pages. Instead, attestation requires (1) that two or more credible witnesses sign the will in the presence of the testator, and (2) that the witnesses either observe the testator sign the will, or that the testator acknowledges his signature on the document or acknowledges that the document is his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">In this case, three credible witnesses observed Peter sign on page 5 of 6 of the 2010 Will, and Peter informed the witnesses that the document was his will. After having witnessed this, the three witnesses each signed on page 6 of 6 of the 2010 Will. Whether they were physically connected or not, all six pages of the document were in the room, together, at the time of signing. The six pages are consecutively numbered, the font and typeface are consistent throughout, and the text flows continuously from one page to the next. \u201c[T]hey are connected by their internal sense by coherence or adaptation of parts\u201d and \u201cthe papers themselves bear intrinsic evidence that, while separate, they were tacked together in the mind of the testator.\u201d <em>Swaim, 78 </em>S.E. at 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The evidence does not reveal whether the pages were physically connected to each other at the time of signing, but this fact is immaterial to the Will\u2019s validity. Regardless of whether the last two pages (or any of the pages, for that matter) were physically connected, it is clear from \u201cthe papers themselves\u201d that they were intended to form a single document constituting the 2010 Will. Attestation does not require that the witnesses sign on the same page as the testator, or on physically connected pages. Therefore, the fact that the last two pages of the 2010 Will may not have been physically connected at the time of signing does not render the Will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>invalid, nor prevent the presumption of due execution from attaching to it. Accordingly, we hold that the circuit court did not err in denying Sadie\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment as to Issue F (attestation).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">\n<em>B. Imperfect Attestation Clause and the Presumption of Due Execution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Next, Sadie argues that the 2010 Will is invalid because it does not contain a \u201cproper attestation clause,\u201d and \u201cit expressly states [that] the pages were initialed [by Peter], but they were not.\u201d Alternatively, Sadie argues that even if these deficiencies do not necessarily invalidate the 2010 Will, they nonetheless should prevent the presumption of due execution from attaching to it. Therefore, Sadie asserts that she should not have been required to rebut the presumption by clear and convincing evidence. Accordingly, Sadie contends that the circuit court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of the Estate on all transmitted issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The Estate and Darlene respond that these purported deficiencies do not invalidate the 2010 Will because neither a \u201cproper attestation clause\u201d nor having the testator initial each page are requirements for a valid will. Furthermore, the Estate and Darlene maintain that even if the attestation clause in the 2010 Will was itself insufficient to give rise to the presumption of due execution, the Will contained other sufficient indicia of due execution such that the presumption should attach. Additionally, the Estate and Darlene assert that Sadie produced no evidence to rebut the presumption of due execution, let alone clear and convincing evidence. Therefore, the Estate and Darlene contend that the circuit court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the Estate on all transmitted issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Sadie is correct that page 5 of 6 of the 2010 Will states that Peter has \u201cinitial [sic] each page hereof,\u201d when in fact he did not, as his initials do not appear on any pages of the Will. However, Sadie cites to no authority, and we have found none, supporting her position that this error either invalidates the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Will or prevents the presumption of due execution from attaching to it. We see no reason why an error such as this\u2014 stating that the pages were initialed when in fact they were not\u2014should either invalidate an otherwise valid will or prevent the presumption of due execution from attaching to it, so long as the will contains sufficient other indicia of due execution. Having the testator initial each page of a multi-page will is not required by statute, and therefore we decline to impose such a requirement here. <em>See </em>Restatement (Third) of Property (Wills <em>&amp; </em>Don. Trans.) \u00a7 3.1, cmt. f (\u201cA court should never impose formal requirements beyond those in the statute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">Turning to the allegedly \u201cimproper\u201d attestation clause, we note that the attestation clause appearing in the 2010 Will is admittedly imperfect. It states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-5\">The above named individual, does declare for his Last Will and Testament this instrument, have hereunto subscribed to have witness on the date last mentioned above, and at the location, and [//<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] I do hereby attest that the testator to be of sound mind, fully able to understand this instrument, and the testator voluntarily and freely did sign same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The attestation clause does not recite the statutory requirement that the witnesses signed the Will \u201cin the presence of the testator.\u201d <em>See </em>ET \u00a7 4-102(3). Thus, it does not \u201crecite[ ] the formalities required by the jurisdiction in which the instrument might take effect (such as where the will might be probated).\u201d <em>Slack, </em>368 Md. at 8 n.5, 791 A.2d 129 (quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 124 (7th ed. 1999)). As such, the attestation clause in the 2010 Will, standing alone, does not provide prima facie evidence for the validity of the Will. <em>See Van Meter, </em>183 Md. at 617-18, 39 A.2d 752 (\u201c[A]n attestation clause reciting facts necessary for the valid execution of a will is prima facie evidence of the due execution of the will, if it bears the genuine signatures of the testator and subscribing witnesses.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>However, as discussed earlier in this opinion, we agree with the Estate and Darlene that an attestation clause is not a requirement of a valid will, and therefore an \u201cimproper\u201d or incomplete attestation clause does not serve to invalidate an otherwise valid will. \u201cThe validity of the execution of a will depends, not upon an attestation clause, but upon conformity of the execution with the requirements of the statute, and also the testimony of the subscribing witnesses if they are produced and examined.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 617, 39 A.2d 752; <em>see also Slack, </em>368 Md. at 8 n.5, 791 A.2d 129 (\u201cA formal attestation clause is not an essential part of a will.\u201d). Nor is a \u201cproper\u201d attestation clause required for the presumption of due execution to attach to a will. <em>See Slack, </em>368 Md. at 12, 791 A.2d 129 (\u201c[A]n attestation clause is not the <em>sine qua non </em>of the presumption of due execution.\u201d). \u201c[I]n the absence of an attestation clause, if a proponent of a testamentary document can adduce sufficient evidence from the document and/or surrounding circumstances to make a <em>prima facie </em>case for the satisfaction of the statutory requirements for execution of a will, the presumption of due execution attaches.\u201d <em>Groat, </em>213 Md.App. at 156-57, 73 A.3d 374 (citing <em>Slack, </em>368 Md. at 12, 791 A.2d 129).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">In this case, the circuit court did not err in finding \u201csufficient evidence from the document and/or surrounding circumstances to make a <em>prima facie </em>case for the satisfaction of the statutory requirements for execution of a will,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 157, 73 A.3d 374, and thus properly found that the presumption of due execution attached to the 2010 Will. Although the attestation clause itself is imperfect, each of the three witnesses signed their names under the word \u201cWITNESS:.\u201d <em>Cf. Slack, </em>368 Md. at 12, 791 A.2d 129 (that \u201c[t]he two witnesses, in the presence of the testator, signed beneath the words Witnessed By\u2019 \u201d provides an indication of due execution). The witnesses\u2019 signatures all appear on the same page, which is the next consecutively numbered page following the one that contains the testator\u2019s signature. <em>Cf. id. </em>(that the testator\u2019s signature \u201cwas nearly adjacent to the signatures of the witnesses\u201d provides an indication of due execution). Additionally, the imperfect attestation clause includes a recitation of some (though not all) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>the statutory requirements for execution of a will, including witnessing Peter sign the will and a statement of Peter\u2019s testamentary capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">Furthermore, the \u201csurrounding circumstances\u201d in this case provide additional evidence of satisfaction of the statutory requirements. All three witnesses testified that they observed Peter sign the 2010 Will, that he declared the document to be his will, and that they all signed the Will in his presence and in the presence of each other. <em>See Van Meter, </em>183 Md. at 617, 39 A.2d 752 (\u201cThe validity of the execution of a will depends, not upon an attestation clause, but upon conformity with the requirements of the statut\u00e9, and also the testimony of the subscribing witnesses if they are produced and examined,\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Therefore, based on the document itself and the circumstances surrounding its execution, we conclude that the circuit court did not err in finding sufficient evidence \u201cto make a <em>prima facie </em>case for the satisfaction of the statutory requirements for execution of a will,\u201d <em>Groat, </em>213 Md.App. at 157, 73 A.3d 374, and thus finding that the presumption of due execution attached to the 2010 Will.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the Estate on all transmitted issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\n<em>C. Disputed Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Finally, Sadie argues that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the Estate because she produced evidence that generated disputed issues of material facts. Specifically, Sadie contends that the 2010 Will admitted to probate did not match the physical description of the will provided by Mr. Greiber and Samantha in their depositions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Both Mr. Greiber and Samantha testified that they remembered that the 2010 Will was stapled when it was signed, and Samantha recalled that Peter had initialed each page. The Will admitted to probate, however, bore no indication of ever having been stapled, and did not contain Peter\u2019s initials on any of the pages. Sadie contends that whether the Will was stapled and initialed are material facts bearing on its validity, and therefore the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the Estate. The Estate and Darlene do not respond to Sadie\u2019s argument regarding disputed issues of material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">\u201cA material fact is a fact the resolution of which will somehow affect the outcome of the case. Consequently, a dispute over a non-material fact will not preclude summary judgment.\u201d <em>King v. Bankerd, </em>303 Md. 98, 111, 492 A.2d 608 (1985) (citation omitted). In other words,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">[m]erely proving the existence of a factual dispute is not necessarily fatal to a summary judgment motion. A dispute as to facts relating to grounds upon which the decision is not rested is not a dispute with respect to a <em>material </em>fact and such dispute does not prevent the entry of summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-7\"><em>Boland, </em>423 Md. at 366, 31 A.3d 529 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">As discussed in Part A above, whether the 2010 Will was stapled at the time of signing has no bearing on its validity. As such, resolution of this disputed fact would not affect the outcome of the case. Indeed, in granting the Estate\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the circuit court \u201cproceeded ... on the assumption ... that the separate sheets of the Will were not mechanically affixed by a staple or other device and were not so affixed when deposited with the Register of Wills for safekeeping on November 17, 2010.\u201d Therefore, the dispute about whether the 2010 Will was stapled at the time of signing \u201crelate[d] to grounds upon which the [circuit court\u2019s] decision [was] not rested.\u201d <em>Boland, </em>423 Md. at 366, 31 A.3d 529. Similarly, as discussed in Part B above, whether the 2010 Will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>was initialed by Peter also has no bearing on its validity. Accordingly, resolution of this disputed fact would not affect the outcome of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">Sadie contends that these disputed facts are material because the contrary descriptions of the 2010 Will by the witnesses indicate that the will that was signed by Peter and the three witnesses on September 29, 2010 might not be the same will that was admitted to probate. However, in order to defeat summary judgment, \u201c[a] plaintiffs claim must be supported by more than a \u2018scintilla of evidence[,]\u2019 as \u2018there must be evidence upon which [a] jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blackburn Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Paul, </em>438 Md. 100, 108, 90 A.3d 464 (2014) (second and third alterations in original) (quoting <em>Beatty v. Trailmaster Prods., Inc., </em>330 Md. 726, 738-39, 625 A.2d 1005 (1993)). Furthermore, when a witness to a testamentary document provides testimony that is contrary to the description provided in the document itself, \u201c[t]he court views such contradictory testimony with great caution and scans it with grave suspicion[.]\u201d <em>Van Meter, </em>183 Md. at 618, 39 A.2d 752; <em>see also Slack, </em>368 Md. at 15, 791 A.2d 129 (\u201cThis Court and most other state courts consistently have found that a witness\u2019 inability to remember certain events should not overcome the presumption of due execution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Therefore, we conclude that Mr. Grieber\u2019s and Samantha\u2019s inaccurate recollections about whether the 2010 Will was stapled and initialed on each page at the time of signing were insufficient to generate disputed issues of material fact. Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the Estate on all transmitted issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The statutory requirements for a validly executed will are that it must be \u201c(1) in writing, (2) signed by the testator, or by some other person for him, in his presence and by his express direction, and (3) attested and signed by two or more credible witnesses in the presence of the testator.\u201d ET \u00a7 4-102. When the testator and the witnesses sign on separate pages of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>multi-page will, attestation does not require that the pages be \u201cphysically connected\u201d at the time of signing. Furthermore, neither a complete attestation clause nor having the testator initial each page of the will are requirements for valid execution. Therefore, the absence of these elements in a testamentary document does not serve to invalidate the will, nor prevent the presumption of due execution from attaching to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">In this case, the Estate and Darlene produced \u201csufficient evidence from the document and/or surrounding circumstances to make a <em>prima facie </em>case for the satisfaction of the statutory requirements for execution of a will.\u201d <em>Groat, </em>213 Md.App. at 157, 73 A.3d 374. Thus, the circuit court properly found that the presumption of due execution attached to the 2010 Will, and Sadie does not argue that she produced clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption. Therefore, the circuit court correctly denied Sadie\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment as to Issue F (attestation), and properly granted the Estate\u2019s motion for summary judgment on all transmitted issues. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

According to Mr. Greiber, Peter was concerned that Sadie would leave her estate to certain family members of whom he did not approve. He sought assurances that Sadie would not leave her assets, or at least the assets that she would receive from him, to those family members. Thus, he conditioned Sadie\u2019s bequests under the 2010 Will upon her having made and filed a will that disclosed whether she intended to make testamentary gifts to those family members.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b57-6\">. The appellant in <em>Goroum v. Rynarzewski, </em>89 Md.App. 676, 599 A.2d 843 (1991) raised a similar issue, but the Court of Special Appeals did not address the argument on the merits. In <em>Goroum, </em>the attestation clause and the signatures of the witnesses appeared on a page that contained no other provisions of the will. 89 Md.App. at 684, 599 A.2d 843. \"[T]he testator [had] initialed and signed each and every page of his will, except the attestation page, in the presence of the witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 683, 599 A.2d 843. The appellant argued that the will was invalid based on one of the witnesses\u2019 testimony that it was the normal practice of the law office \"that the sheets were not stapled together when wills were signed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 680 n.2, 599 A.2d 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The court noted that \"[n]o one testified that the attestation page of <em>this will </em>was at any time unaffixed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 681, 599 A.2d 843. Furthermore, \"[a] law office\u2019s general practice to do things a certain way is not clear and convincing evidence that it was done that way in a specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>instance. Simply put, there is <em>no </em>evidence that at the time the testator and witnesses executed this will, <em>its </em>pages were unaffixed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the court declined to address whether the will would have satisfied the statutory requirements if the attestation page had not been affixed to the remainder of the will. <em>Id. </em>at 684, 599 A.2d 843.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b63-7\">. These symbols have been inserted to indicate the page break between the bottom of page 5 of 6 and the top of page 6 of 6 in the 2010 Will.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b65-8\">. Sadie only argues that the circuit court erred in finding that the presumption of due execution attached to the 2010 Will, She does not argue, in the alternative, that if the presumption did attach, she nonetheless produced clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption. Therefore, we need not consider whether Sadie produced sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption of due execution regarding the 2010 Will.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
