United States Senior District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, designated to participate <em>in place Of Judge O\u2019CONNELL, </em>pursuant to provisions of Section 294(d), Title 28 United States Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1003-4\">WORLEY, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">The parties stipulate that the sole issue here is whether \u201capplicant\u2019s mark \u2018Wearever\u2019 when used on vinyl floor tile so resembles opposer\u2019s registered mark \u2018Flor-Ever\u2019 for vinyl floor tile as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake among purchasers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board was of the opinion that the respective marks \u201chave substantially identical connotations,\u201d and, when coupled with other features of similarity, concluded that \u201cconfusion, mistake or deception of purchasers would be reasonably likely to occur.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">Applicant alleges error in that holding, urging primarily that the word \u201cever,\u201d the only common feature of the marks, is widely used to denote long wearing or lasting qualities, is therefore highly suggestive of such qualities, and can have little trademark significance. In addition, appellant urges that the board gave undue weight to the relative advertising efforts of the parties, appeared to be unduly influenced by the apparent good will appellee had established in its mark, and thus failed to properly evaluate the fundamental issue of likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">The record, running something over three hundred pages, contains numerous exhibits, thirty-eight third party registrations, and testimony of opposing witnesses. We find nothing therein which would require an affirmance of the board\u2019s decision, nor anything requiring separate discussion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">Section 2(d) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052(d), allows registration of a mark otherwise qualified unless it \u201cso resembles a mark registered in the Patent Office * * * as to be likely when applied to the goods of applicant, to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers.\u201d That is the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-12\">Here, with all due respect to the views of the board, we are unable to agree with its holding. Although the instant suffixes are identical, we are of the opinion the prefixes \u201cWear\u201d and \u201cFlor\u201d are so distinctly different in sound, appearance, spelling and meaning that the marks as a whole, as viewed in the market place, would not be likely to cause confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-13\">Under such circumstances it is neces- ' sary to reverse the decision appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-14\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
