She has challenged the District Court\u2019s order that she reimburse the District of Columbia in the amount of $4,165.10 for the expenses of treatment from September 9, 1954, to November 7, 1956, when the veteran was transferred to the rolls of the Veterans Administration which now bears the costs involved. She relies mainly<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> upon a provision of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101 (1958) which exempts from the claim of \u201ccreditors\u201d payments of benefits, due or to become due under any law administered by the Veterans Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">The District\u2019s argument may be paraphrased thus. As an instrumentality of Government the District is not a voluntary \u201ccreditor.\u201d It had not, unlike a private institution or an individual citizen, extended credit to the veteran. On the contrary, Congress in furtherance of a benign policy had by statute provided for St. Elizabeths,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the District Court by its order had committed the veteran to that hospital\u2019s care.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For the actual cost of maintenance and treatment, the Committee is liable to the District,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> at least from the date of her appointment, August 26, 1954. Accordingly, subsistence charges imposed pursuant to public authority may be recovered from a guardian or committee who in an official capacity, that is <em>after </em>appointment, has received the ward\u2019s disability payments from the Veterans Administration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Not being a \u201ccreditor\u201d in such circumstances, the District of Columbia is not here barred by the statute from securing reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-14\"> We conclude that the District\u2019s position is correct. Various state courts have likewise decided that a governmental authority required by law to care for an incompetent veteran is not a \u201ccreditor\u201d under circumstances comparable to those presented by this record. See, e. g., Department of Public Welfare v. Sevcik, 1960, 18 Ill.2d 449, 164 N.E.2d 10; In re Bemowski\u2019s Guardianship, 1958, 3 Wis.2d 133, 88 N.W.2d 22; In re Lewis\u2019 Estate, 1938, 287 Mich. 179, 283 N.W. 21. We hold only that the District was entitled to reimbursement for the actual cost of the maintenance, including treatment, of the incompetent veteran, for the period commencing September 9, 1954, and expiring November 7, 1956, when the ward was transferred to the rolls of the Veterans Administration. This disposition makes it unneces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>sary to consider the District\u2019s further contention that the disability funds on deposit in the bank had become \u201cinvestments\u201d subject to levy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-9\">. She also points to District of Columbia v. Reilly, 1957, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 9, 249 F.2d 524, where we held that the District was not entitled to recover amounts paid for a veteran patient\u2019s care <em>before </em>the Committee was appointed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b900-10\">.

The court initially might have committed the insane person to the custody of the Veterans Administration agreeably to D.C.Code, \u00a7 21-315 (1951); apparently Veterans Administration facilities were not available until November 1956.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b900-12\">.
