Order 27 regulates the handling of milk in the New York-New Jersey metropolitan area.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">During 1956 and 1957 hearings were held by the Department of Agriculture upon various proposals to amend Order 27. As a result of these hearings \u00a7 927.-65 was promulgated to be effective August 1, 1957. At that time it provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">\u201cSec. 927.65 <em>Net pool obligation of handlers. </em>The handler\u2019s net pool obligation shall be computed pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section: <em>Provided, </em>That milk specified in paragraph (h) of this section shall be eliminated from this computation and such milk shall be deemed excluded by the phrase \u2018milk received from producers\u2019 as such phrase is used in this section * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">* *****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-8\">\"(h) Milk specified in subparagraphs (1) through (3) of this paragraph shall be excluded from the computation of the handler\u2019s net pool obligation pursuant to this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-9\">\u201c(1) Milk received from farms in Nassau and Suffolk Counties in New York, which farms are not approved for sale of milk in New York City, and milk received from farms in New York City.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-10\">\u201c(2) Milk received at a handler\u2019s plant not in excess of an average of 800 pounds per day from such handler\u2019s own farm in the event that no milk is received at such plant from other dairy farmers, but is received from other plants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-11\">\u201c(3) All milk received at a handler\u2019s plant from such handler\u2019s own farm in the event that no milk is received from any other source at such plant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">Appellant, Ideal Farms, Inc. (Ideal) leases and operates 19 farms in Northern New Jersey. All of the milk from these farms is collected and shipped to a plant operated by Ideal in North Haledon, New Jersey. Appellant, in addition, buys milk from other plants. At the North Hale-don plant some of the milk is bottled and sold as such, either on routes owned by Ideal or on routes owned by independent retailers. The remainder of the milk is manufactured into various forms: cheese, butter, ice cream and flavored drinks.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-15\">Appellant, Franklin Lakes Dairy Producers, Inc. conducts an almost identical, though smaller, operation to that of Ideal except it supplements the milk it produces on its own farms with milk it buys from other dairy farmers.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-16\">Appellants contended that in purporting to regulate a handler\u2019s \u201cown-produced\u201d milk in \u00a7 927.65 of Order 27 the Secretary of Agriculture exceeded the authority conferred upon him by the Act. They filed their petition embodying this contention and others with the Secretary and a hearing was held before a Hearing Examiner. He issued a report containing proposed findings and conclusions recommending the dismissal of the petition. Exceptions were filed to the Examiner\u2019s report and subsequently a Judicial Officer of the Department of Agriculture acting for the Secretary pursuant to authority duly delegated to him heard arguments thereon and filed his opinion dismissing their petition. Jacob Tanis, 17 Agri.Dec. 1091 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-17\">The decision of the Judicial Officer constituted the final agency decision and the appellants then filed their complaint against the Secretary of Agriculture in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey to review his action. See 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 608c(15) (B). The appellants and the Secretary filed respective motions for summary judgment, arguments upon which were heard by Judge Wortendyke, who filed an opinion in which he found in favor of the Secretary, 1960,181 F.Supp. 62, and judgment was entered pursuant thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-18\">It is from that judgment that this appeal is taken. Other issues were explored before the Agency and the District Court but only one question remains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>to be settled here, namely: Did the Secretary of Agriculture exceed the authority vested in him by the Act in promulgating \u00a7 927.65 of Order 27, which purports to make a handler accountable to the producer-settlement fund for milk which he produces on his own farms from his own herds ?</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">In support of their contention appellants point to the word \u201cpurchased\u201d as it appears in \u00a7 8c(5) (A) and (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 608c(5) (A) and (C)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They argue that only milk \u201cpurchased\u201d is subject to regulation and that the word \u201cpurchased\u201d cannot be construed to cover milk which they obtain from their own farms.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Before discussing the legal question presented by this appeal, a brief reference to the operation of Order 27 may be useful. Milk is classified \u201cin accordance with the form in which or the purpose for which it is used.\u201d Minimum prices are set for each use classification. However, such minimum prices are not directly paid to the producers since they are paid a uniform price irrespective of the uses made of such milk by the individual handler to whom it is delivered. The seeming incongruity is resolved by the operation of the producer-settlement fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">Each handler subject to the Order must report monthly to the Market Administrator as provided in \u00a7 927.50 of the Order. The report shows the total quantity of milk received by the handler from all producers, and the use to which the said milk was put by the handler. The handler then multiplies the amount of milk put to each class use by the class price and adds the resultant figures to ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>rive at a total figure, based upon amount and class price for each class, and known as the handler\u2019s net pool obligation. The handler does not owe this money to the producers from whom he received the milk, but rather owes it proportionately to all producers in the entire milk marketing area.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">Upon receipt of all handlers\u2019 reports, the Market Administrator adds up the total weight of milk handled in the marketing area for the month in question. He then adds up the total use value of the milk as shown on each handler\u2019s report as the handler\u2019s net pool obligation. He then divides the weight of the milk into its total use value and arrives at a uniform price. See \u00a7 927.54 of the Order. The uniform price is commonly referred to as the \u201cblend\u201d price.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Under \u00a7 927.70 of Order 27 each handler must then pay his producers the uniform price as provided in the Act, 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 608c(5) (B) (ii).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus it can be seen that the handler owes to all producers as a class, the use value to which he puts milk received from producers, whereas the producer receives a uniform price for his milk regardless of the use to which it is put. This is known as the \u201cmarket wide pool\u201d since the uniform price is based on the utilization of milk throughout the entire marketing area.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Provision is made for the producer-settlement fund in \u00a7 927.75 of Order 27 wherein it is prescribed that, after the Market Administrator has determined the uniform price to be paid to all producers, he should calculate the amount of money that each handler owes to producers by multiplying the uniform price by the weight of the milk each handler has received. The resultant figure is compared with the handler\u2019s net pool obligation, to determine whether the handler pays into the producer-settlement fund or receives money from the producer-settlement fund. A handler whose net pool obligation is higher than the resultant figure pays the difference into the producer-settlement fund, whereas a handler whose net pool obligation is lower than the resultant figure receives the difference from the producer-settlement fund. This exchange of money among the handlers is to enable each handler to pay the uniform price to producers by making the handlers who put the bulk of their milk to a high use pay to the handlers who put the bulk of their milk to a low use.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-13\">Thus the appellants in essence seek to be exempt from making any payments into the producer-settlement fund on their \u201cown produced\u201d milk should their utilization thereof otherwise require' such.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-14\">We now return to the legal issue presented. In its opinion thp district court cited three cases as the basis for its conclusion that the regulation of \u201cown-produced\u201d milk by a handler is authorized by the Act. They are United States v. Rock Royal Co-operative, 1939, 307 U.S. 533, 59 S.Ct. 933, 83 L.Ed. 1446; <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Elm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>Spring Farm v. United States, 1 Cir., 1942, 127 F.2d 920,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Shawangunk Cooperative Dairies v. Jones, 2 Cir., 1946, 153 F.2d 700.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In each of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>cases the word \u201cpurchased\u201d was interpreted to mean \u201cacquired for marketing\u201d.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellants argue that in none of these cases were the principals producers in the sense that they operated their own dairy farms and that in each case they acquired or received the milk subjected to assessment from another entity. They insist that in interpreting the word \u201cpurchase\u201d to mean \u201cacquire\u201d or \u201creceive\u201d, title or possession must have passed from one to another and that \u201cthe very words indicate that at least two parties must be involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">' In effect appellants make the argument that although an agency cooperative was held to have \u201cpurchased\u201d milk from its principals in Rock Royal and Elm Spring, two parties were involved whereas here there being only one party no \u201cpurchase\u201d is possible as the word was construed in those cases. Such reasoning would mean that Congress intended to regulate a handler if he was the agent of a producer, but not a handler who is also a producer, although the effect in both instances is the same. Should the fact of agency make such a crucial difference? We do not think that such an illogical distinction was intended. Although not embodying the fact pattern of specific identity of producer and handler in the one entity present in appellants\u2019 situations the three cited cases make clear that the word \u201cpurchased\u201d is to be liberally construed so as to achieve the purpose of the Act and strongly buttress the position of the Secretary that \u201cown-produced\u201d milk of a handler is subject to regulation. The purpose of the Act and Order was succinctly stated in Elm Spring Farm v. United States, supra, 127 F.2d at page 927:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-9\">\u201c * * * The Act and Order seek to achieve a fair division of the more profitable fluid milk market among all producers, thereby eliminating the disorganizing effects which had theretofore been a consequence of cutthroat competition among producers striving for the fluid milk market. This is clearly set forth in the opinion in United States v. Rock Royal Co-operative, Inc., 1939, 307 U.S. 533, 548, 550, 59 S.Ct. 993, 83 L.Ed. 1446.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">Were we to accept appellants\u2019 construction of the word \u201cpurchased\u201d they would avoid the intent of the Act to achieve a fair division of the more profitable fluid milk market among all producers and they would avoid the necessity of sharing the burden of surplus milk. See United States v. Rock Royal Co-operative, Inc., supra, 307 U.S. at pages 548, 580, 59 S.Ct. at pages 1001, 1016.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">In the concededly broad construction here given to the word \u201cpurchased\u201d we are guided by the pronouncement of the Supreme Court in N. L. R. B. v. Lion Oil Co., 1956, 352 U.S. 282, 77 S.Ct. 330, 334, 1 L.Ed.2d 331 that \u201cin expounding a statute, we must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence but look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy.\u201d To the same effect are United States v. American Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 1940, <em>310 </em>U.S. 534, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 84 L.Ed. 1345 and Helvering v. Stockholm Enskilda Bank, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>1934, 293 U.S. 84, 55 S.Ct. 50, 79 L.Ed. 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Other provisions of this section of the Act explicitly recognize that a person or business entity may be engaged in the milk business in more than one capacity and that a producer is exempt from regulation only in his capacity as a producer. Section 8c(13) (B), 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 608c (13) (B), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">\u201cNo order issued under sections * * * 608c * * * of this title shall be applicable to any producer in his capacity as a producer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">In Acme Breweries v. Brannan, D.C.N.D.Cal.1952, 109 F.Supp. 116, the court had occasion to construe this provision. There the plaintiff was a manufacturer of beer and grew its own hops. The Secretary of Agriculture issued an order regulating the handling of hops. Plaintiff argued that it was not engaged in the \u201c \u2018handling\u2019 of hops\u201d since it only used the hops it grew. The court held, however, that while Acme was exempt from regulation as a producer under \u00a7 8c(13) (B) of the Act it could be regulated as a handler since it did something to the hops other than grow them. It was a part of the distribution system that Congress intended to regulate.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">Appellants attack any reliance on Acme Breweries v. Brannan, supra, claiming that sections of the Act controlling milk, 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 608c(5) (A-G) and \u00a7 608c (18) differ substantially from those regulating hops, \u00a7 608e(6) (A-G). Appellants call attention to the former in which reference is made to \u201cmilk purchased\u201d and to the latter where the words \u201cpurchase from or handle\u201d or \u201cpurchased, or handled\u201d are used. \u00a7 608c (6) (B). They vigorously argue that there was clearly spelled out in the Act authority to limit the total quantity of hops to be handled among all producers and alloting the quantity of hops which any handler might handle. Such contentions are not denied but they are not persuasive that the different language used in the regulation of hops and other commodities compels the conclusion that it was not the intention of Congress to regulate a handler of milk who dealt also with his \u201cown-produced\u201d milk. In Acme Breweries the plaintiff indeed argued that the word \u201chandle\u201d had a well defined meaning, i. e., \u201cto buy and sell; .to deal or trade in\u201d and that since it was a consumer of its own hops it could not be held to handle them. The court rejected this argument and looking to the purpose of the Act and the specific exemptions in \u00a7 8c (13) (A) and (B) held plaintiff to be a handler and subject to regulation. The court reasoned as noted above that while a producer may not be regulated per se Congress did intend to regulate him should he engage in the capacity of a handler. The analogy to this case is cogent. Moreover the thrust of appellants\u2019 argument goes directly counter to the liberal construction given to the word \u201cpurchased\u201d in United States v. Rock Royal Co-operative, Inc., supra, and Shawangunk Cooperative Dairies v. Jones, supra, where it was held to apply to an agency cooperative and a gratuitous bailee respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">Section 8c(5) (C) which is the statutory basis for the producer-settlement fund indicates that producers who are handlers are subject to regulation. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-11\">\u201cIn order to accomplish the purposes set forth in paragraphs (A) and (B) of this subsection, providing a method for making adjustments in payments, as among handlers (including producers who are also handlers), to the end that the total sums paid by each handler shall equal the value of the milk purchased by him at the prices fixed in accordance with paragraph (A) of this section.\u201d (Note 2, supra.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-12\">It could be argued that the parenthetical phrase was included merely to make it clear that producer handlers could be made to equalize on milk purchased from other producers. If this were all that was intended it seems hardly necessary to have included the parenthesis since a handler who purchased milk from other producers would clearly be covered as a handler with respect to such milk wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>er or not he might be a producer-handler with respect to milk of his own production. The more reasonable construction is that the parenthetical phrase was meant to reach a producer-handler who handles or distributes milk which he himself produces.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">Regulation of producer-handlers in their capacities as handlers is not of recent origin. Article VI, \u00a7 1(3) of the original Order 27 regulated such handlers in that it only permitted them to \u201c[s]ubtraet pro rata out of each class the quantity of milk received from the handler\u2019s own farm,\u201d in the computation of their \u201cNet Pool Obligation\u201d. See Rock Royal Co-operative, Inc., supra, 307 U.S. at page 551, note 14, 59 S.Ct. at page 1002. In 1941 Order 45 (7 C.F.R. 945.1 et seq., effective August 29, 1941), affecting the Washington, D. C. area, charged each handler a certain amount per hundredweight with respect to all milk received from producers including his \u201cown-produced milk\u201d to defray the expense of administration. In 1946, Order 4, affecting the Greater Boston Area (7 C.F.R. 904.1 et seq., effective June 1, 1946) imposed a similar charge. Since August 1, 1953, Order No. 3 (7 C.F.R. 903.1 et seq.) affecting the St. Louis Marketing Area has required handlers to pay into their producer-settlement fund on milk received from their own farms. See In re Benbush Dairy, 17 Agri.Dec. 1185 (1958). Similarly Order No. 19 (7 C.F. R. 919.1 et seq.) involving the Southwest Kansas Marketing Area has required such payments since July 1, 1954. See In re Sunflower Dairy, 15 Agri.Dec. 1 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">While it is true that only since 1953 have handlers been required to make payments into the producer-settlement fund it is also true that from the very beginning the Department of Agriculture has construed the Act so as to permit regulation of producer-handlers in their capacities as \u2018handlers. This contemporaneous and long standing construction of the Act by the agency charged with administering it is entitled to substantial weight. United States v. Leslie Salt Co., 1956, 350 U.S. 383, 396, 76 S.Ct. 416, 100 L.Ed. 441; Mazer v. Stein, 1954, 347 U.S. 201, 213, 74 S.Ct. 460, 98 L.Ed. 630; 1 Davis Administrative Law \u00a7 5.06 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-12\">The present provisions of the Act were first enacted as amendments to the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 31, by the Act of August 24, 1935, 49 Stat. 750.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In 1936 the Supreme Court held invalid certain sections of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 with respect to processing taxes. United States v. Butler, 1936, 297 U.S. 1, 56 S.Ct. 312, 80 L.Ed. 477. Thereafter Congress reenacted the section under discussion here in the Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, 50 Stat. 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-13\">While the 1935 amendments were before the Senate a discussion took place which indicates that Congress intended that producer-handlers be regulated in their latter capacity. This discussion in which Senators Copeland, Byrd and Murphy took part is set out in the margin.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>The appellant deprecates the use of this legislative history contending that \u201ca study of the record of this discussion discloses that no conclusions were reached.\u201d We do not agree. The record clearly discloses that the Senate was discussing H.R. 8492 in which the 1935 amendments were embodied and that these amendments were finally accepted and passed. The Senators were discussing the provisions of the Act which we are here construing. Appellants also cite the concurring opinion in Schwegmann Bros. v. Calvert Distillers Corp., 1951, 341 U.S. 384, 395, 71 S.Ct. 745, 751, 95 L.Ed. 1035 <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to support their opposition to the use of legislative history here.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">We first note that the explanation of the milk provisions of the Act made by Senator Murphy were not mere \u201ccasual statements from floor debate\u201d but were comments of a senator who clearly appears to have been in charge of those provisions on the Senate floor. Resort may be had to the statements of such an authoritative person. Wright v. Vinton Branch, 1937, 300 U.S. 440, 464, note 8, 57 S.Ct. 556, 81 L.Ed. 736; Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, 1920, 254 U.S. 443, 475, 41 S.Ct. 172, 65 L.Ed. <em>349; </em>Richbourg Motor Co. v. United States, 1929, 281 U.S. 528, 536, 50 S.Ct. 385, 74 L.Ed. 1016; Sutherland, Statutory Construction \u00a7\u00a7 5011, 5012 (3rd ed. Horack 1943); Note, A Decade of Legislative History in the Supreme Court, 46 Va.L.Rev. 1408 (1960). For the use of such statements of explanation in recent cases see e. g., Mitchell v. Kentucky Finance Co., 1959, 359 U.S. 290, 295, 79 S.Ct. 756, 3 L.Ed.2d 815; Steiner v. Mitchell, 1956, 350 U.S. 247, 254, 76 S.Ct. 330, 100 L.Ed. 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-15\">Appellants also object to the use of legislative history where the statutory language is unambiguous. That the language is not unambiguous would seem to flow from the holdings in Rock Royal and Shawangunk cases, supra. In any event, the words of Justice Frankfurter in Association of Westinghouse Salaried Employees v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 1954, 348 U.S. 437, 444, 75 S.Ct. 489, 492, 99 L.Ed. 510 now appear pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-16\">\u201cThis examination would conclude the construction of the section by English courts, that is, by any court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>reading legislation as it is written without drawing on parliamentary-debates. And considering that the construction we have found seems plain, the so-called \u2018plain meaning rule,\u2019 on which construction is from time to time rested also in this Court, likewise makes further inquiry needless and indeed improper. But that rule has not dominated our decisions. The contrary doctrine has prevailed. See Boston Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. United States, 278 U.S. 41, 48 [49 S.Ct. 52, 53, 54, 73 L.Ed. 170]; United States v. Dickerson, 310 U.S. 554, 561 [60 S.Ct. 1034, 1038, 84 L.Ed. 1356]. And so we proceed to an examination of the legislative history to see whether that raises such doubts that the search for meaning should not be limited to the statute itself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Appellants argue that prior to August I, 1957 \u201cown-produced\u201d milk was not subject to regulation and that because present conditions may require such regulation the breadth of the legislation may not be extended to cope with present exigencies. As to prior regulation we have established that the original Order 27 did so provide. But even were this not so, it has been established that the regulation of \u201cown-produced\u201d milk goes back in other areas to 1941. That such regulation may not have been included in Order 27 does not detract from the fact that the Department of Agriculture has for so long a time considered \u201cown-produced\u201d milk to be subject to regulation. We agree that the Department may not extend the breadth of the Act in order to 'meet present exigencies. But we do not agree that is what has been done.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">In their brief and at the oral argument appellants urged that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-11\">\u201c * * * of the ten billion pounds of milk accounted for in the New York and Northern New Jersey Milk Marketing Area, the quantity reported by handlers\u2019 <em>\u2018own prod/uction\u2019 is infinitesimal. </em>It has been determined that requiring all handlers who produce their own milk to account for it in the \u2018pool\u2019 results in an increase of payment to other producers in the area of 5 mills per cwt. of milk. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">Appellants estimate that this would amount to $9.00 per year per producer whereas their own costs would rise $38,-000 per year. They concede that this argument is advanced for the purpose only of supporting their position that the Act does not authorize the contested regulation. In effect, they argue that the amount of handlers\u2019 \u201cown-produced\u201d milk is allegedly so small (and the burden of the regulation so onerous upon the producer-handler) that it is unreasonable to assume that Congress intended to authorize such regulation. From what we have said before concerning the overall purpose of the Act it is obvious that we cannot agree. Moreover, the finding of facts and reasoning by the Secretary leading to the determination that \u00a7 927.-65 of the Order is designed to protect the regulatory scheme of the Act and is authorized by it,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> when viewed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>light of his expertise, overcomes the appellants\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Appellants place great relianee on two cases. They are Dairymen\u2019s League Cooperative Association v. Brannan, 2 Cir., 1947, 173 F.2d 57 and Vance v. Benson, (S.D.Miss.) unreported, and now on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">In Dairymen\u2019s League, the plaintiff was a cooperative which had acquired milk from its producers at so called country plants in New York where it was made into cream and sent to its plant in Newark, New Jersey, from where it was sold to other handlers. Dairymen\u2019s League alleged that the shipment from one of its plants to another constituted a purchase which would have afforded it a lower value on the cream. It first should be noted that the court in that case was not called upon to construe the word \u201cpurchased\u201d found in \u00a7 8c(5) (A) and (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 608c(5) (A) and (C), but was construing the word \u201cpurchaser\u201d used in defining Class III-D milk in \u00a7 927.4(b) (7) of Order 27 as it then existed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Second, the cream there moved from one handler operation to another handler operation within the same business entity and did not, as here, move from a producer operation to a handler operation. The court rejected the con-</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">tention of Dairymen\u2019s League that shipments from its country plants to its Newark plant constituted the latter a \u201cpurchaser\u201d as that term was used in \u00a7 927.4 (b) (7). Since the context in which the word \u201cpurchaser\u201d was used in Dairymen\u2019s League and the purpose involved there are clearly distinguishable from the situation here the appellants fail to derive the claimed aid from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">In Vance v. Benson, supra, the court, on facts similar to those at bar, held that a handler could not be regulated with respect to his \u201cown-produced\u201d milk. With due deference to that court, we cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">In view of the foregoing we hold that Judge Wortendyke correctly concluded :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-10\">\u201c * * * that the provisions of \u00a7 927.65 of Order No. 27 are fully in accord with the enabling statute and that the refusal of the Secretary to exempt the plaintiffs (appellants) from the obligation to include their own-produced milk in the calculation of their net pool obligations, was in all respects legal and within his statutorily delegated power.\u201d [181 F.

See note 2, supra, for complete text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b659-8\">. This (Rock Royal) is the leading case construing the section of the Act here involved. One of the four cooperatives concerned acted as a marketing agent for its members. It alleged that because it was merely the agent of its principals\u2014 the farmers \u2014 it could not be held to purchase the milk from them. In ruling on this contention the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-9\">\u201c * * * It is urged that cooperatives which merely act as agents for their members are not included in handlers purchasing from producers. This is said to be definitely shown by the provisions of 8c (5) (F) providing that nothing contained in the subsection shall be construed to prevent a Capper-Volstead cooperative from making distribution to its \u2018producers in accordance with the contract.\u2019 The Order defines a handler as including a cooperative association \u2018with respect to any milk received from producers at any plant operated by such association or with respect to any milk which it causes to be delivered\u2019 to other handlers. Under the provisions of the Order, Article VII, Sections 8 and 9, cooperative handlers as other handlers equalize their purchases by payment into the producer settlement fund, even though they are not required to pay the uniform price to their producers by reason of the exception of Arti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>cle VII, Section 1, and the provisions of 8c (5) (F), as explained at page 561 [59 S.Ct. at page 1007].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">\u201cCooperative contracts are of two general types, sale and agency. The Central New York Cooperative operates under the agency type.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-7\">\u201cIt is obvious that the use of the word \u2018purchased\u2019 in the Act, Section 8c(5)-(A) and (C), would not exclude the \u2018sale\u2019 type of cooperative. When 8c (5) (F) was drawn however, it was made to apply to both the \u2018sale\u2019 and \u2018agency\u2019 type without distinction. This would indicate there had been no intention to distinguish between the two types by (A) and (0). The section which authorizes all orders, Section 8c (1), makes no distinction. The orders are to be applicable to \u2018processors, associations of producers, and others engaged in the handling\u2019 of commodities. The reports <em>on </em>the bill show no effort to differentiate. Neither do the debates in Congress. The statutory provisions for equalization of the burdens of surplus would be rendered nugatory by the exception of \u2018agency\u2019 cooperatives. The administrative construction has been to include such organizations as handlers. With this we agree. As here used the word \u2018purchased\u2019 means \u2018acquired for marketing\u2019. Subsection (A) cannot be construed as freeing agents, cooperative or proprietary, from the requirement to account at the minimum prices for milk handled.\u201d 307 U.S. at pages 579-580, 59 S.Ct. at page 1015.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">The appellants in seeking to distinguish this ease from Rock Royal argue that '\u201cthe Court based its opinion that the Cooperative must pay into the Producers Settlement Fund upon the fact that the Cooperative did not have its own farms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">The fact is that Order 27 as then in effect exempted \u201cmilk received from the handler\u2019s own farm.\u201d United States v. Rock Royal Co-op., supra, 307 U.S. at page 551, note 14, 59 S.Ct. at page 1002. The Court did not say, as appellants intimate, that the Act would not permit such regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b660-12\">. Here (Elm Springs) a cooperative organized by officers and stockholders of a pre-existing corporation, engaged in handling milk, took over the business of that corporation. It then took title to cattle from farmers giving in return mortgages and stock. The cattle did not change possession and there was little change in the farmers\u2019 status. The court held the cooperative not to be a pro-</p>\n<p id=\"b660-15\">dueer and thus not exempt from the order then in effect. In discussing the construction of the word \u201cpurchased\u201d it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-16\">\u201cAppellant Cooperative relies upon a narrow reading of \u00a7\u00a7 8c(5) (A)-(E) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 608c (5) (A-E). These sections, which delimit the contents of orders to be issued under the Act, refer to milk \u2018purchased\u2019 from producers by handlers, and \u2018prices\u2019 to be paid by handlers for milk so purchased. The argument is as follows: \u2018Nothing in the language of the Act anywhere modifies the ordinary meaning of these words or authorizes an order to contain any monetary provisions applicable to a person, i.e., in this instance, a corporation, engaged in the distribution of milk given by its own cows. In such a case it is manifestly impossible for a \u201cpurchase\u201d to take place, with respect to milk which has been the property of such person, not merely from the instant of its being drawn into the pail, but even from the very earliest instant in its process of creation in which it could be recognized as having any existence whatsoever.\u2019 This contention is foreclosed by United States v. Rock Royal Oo-operative, Inc., 307 U.S. 533, 578-581, 59 S.Ct. 993, 83 L.Ed. 1446 * * * \u201d 127 F.2d at page 927.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b660-18\">. In that case (Shawangunk) Meadow Valley Farms, a corporate handler, ceased to operate its plant but in order that some fifty producers who had formerly delivered milk to it might maintain entrance to the marketing area, it arranged to have their milk delivered to plaintiff\u2019s plant. Plaintiff sent the milk out for pasteurization and returned it to Meadow Valley Farms. When plaintiff was made accountable for the milk it brought suit. In reversing the district court 59 F.Supp. 848 which held Order 27 not applicable to a \u201cmere gratuitous * * * bailee\u201d the court noted, 153 F.2d at page 704:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-20\">\u201cNor do we think that the Order as thus construed goes beyond the terms of the governing statute.

But since the Rock Royal case, supra, determined that the word \u2018purchased\u2019 was not to be literally construed, but was to read as the equivalent of the alternative statutory phrase \u2018acquired for marketing,\u2019 and since the \u2018acquired\u2019 of the statute can mean no</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"As7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>more than the \u2018received\u2019 of the regulation, plaintiff\u2019s contention is reduced to its claim that it did not acquire the milk <em>for marketing. </em>With this, however, we cannot agree, for, since no milk can enter the New York market without prior reception at an approved plant, plaintiff\u2019s acts here were indispensable to the total routing of the milk from the farms of the producers to its destination in New York City.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-6\">\u201cIn view of this interpretation of the Act, the objections made to the regulation and repeated here as pointing also to stat-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-12\">utory requirements \u2014 the necessity of a legal title, of a proprietary interest as distinguished from that of a gratuitous bailee, and of a more personal relation between individual handler and producer\u2014 all fall as irrelevant.

These producers and distributors would be required to make adjustments in payments by being compelled to contribute to the maintenance of an adjustment or equalization fund and to pay their pro rata share of the expenses to the authority or agency which administers the order.

Pursuant, in part, to a notice issued February 26, 1957 (22 F.B.. 1219), a public hearing was held on a proposal, among others for amendment of the milk marketing order regulating milk handling in the New. York metropolitan area. Some of the evidence bearing on the contested provision adduced at such hearing appears in the paragraph below.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-8\">\u201cProducer-dealers in general have largely a Class I or fluid utilization of milk. In Northern New Jersey, there are 62 producer-distributors (receiving no milk from others) and 22 dealers with producing farms. They are an important segment of the industry, producing seven percent, or 59,000,000 pounds, of the annual production of milk in the area, with five percent of Class I sales in such area. In view of the number of producer-dealers and their importance, their milk should be pooled with no exemption except for certified milk. Complete exemption would result in a competitive advantage to producer-dealers equal to the difference between the blend price and the Class I price on their Class I sales. A handler with a high fluid utilization would have to make such payments to the paol. Ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>emption of producer-dealers would open the way to economically unjustified expansion by such handlers due to the competitive advantage resulting from non-regulation. The family-farm type of producer-dealer operation should be exempt from pooling. It should be considered in relation to producers of the same production and not to other handlers. A fixed quantity exemption of a daily average of 1,000 pounds of milk should cover the family-farm type of operation with 50 to 60 cows and such businesses are not sufficiently significant to constitute a serious competitive factor in the marketing area. Handling of more than this amount or buying from or selling to other producers or handlers should result in pooling of a producer-dealer\u2019s entire production. There are 200 or 300 producer-dealers in Northern New Jersey and Upstate New York and pooling their milk with the milk of all other producers would increase the blend price although such price would not be greatly increased thereby. The question of equity between producer-dealers and other producers and handlers is an important consideration. A producer who bottles and sells all his milk but one can and sends that can to a country plant of another handler pools his surplus but does not pool his fluid utilization. Other producers must share in the total market utilization.\u201d Jacob Tanis et al., 17 Agri.Dec. 1091, 1093-1094.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b666-13\">.

If authority for its provisions cannot be found there, then it is conceded that the order is illegal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That subsection begins by specifying that an order issued under its sanction shall contain only those \u201cterms and conditions\u201d which are specified in the detail of its text. The provision thought to be relevant here appears in subsection 8c(5) (A) and authorizes the fixing of certain minimum prices \u201cwhich all handlers shall pay * * * for milk purchased from producers * * *.\u201d An additional reference to the same subject matter in subsection 8c(5) (C) does not require any separate or additional comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The complaint here is that a marketing order under section 8c(5) (A) and (C) has made the plaintiffs, as handlers of milk, accountable to the general producer-settlement fund for milk produced by their own cows on their own farms. The question of statutory construction is, in what meaningful sense can it be said that there has been a \u201cpurchase\u201d of milk by a \u201chandler\u201d from a \u201cproducer\u201d where an individual both produces and handles his own milk?</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">I would agree with the result the court reaches if I could find a satisfactory affirmative answer to this question, but I can find none. The opinion of the court quotes the old and properly repeated admonition of the Supreme Court that \u201cin expounding a statute, we must not be guided by a single sentence or a member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy.\u201d See N. L. R. B. v. Lion Oil Co., 1957, 352 U.S. 282, 288, 77 S.Ct. 330, 334, 1 L.Ed.2d 331, quoting from United States v. Boisdore\u2019s Heirs, 1850, 8 How. 113, 122, 12 L.Ed. 1009. In relating this language to the present situation the court demonstrates most persuasively that it is equitable and advances the overall scheme and purpose of the Act to regulate producer-handlers as has been done in Marketing Order No. 27. But if Congress has used restrictive language in the relevant operative provision of a statute, resort to the overall purpose of the legislation does not in my view justify relaxing a stated restriction in a way inconsistent with any reasonable construction of the restrictive language itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-11\">Here the operative language of the statute authorizes certain impositions upon handlers of milk who purchase from producers, and nothing more than that. It seems to me that no reasonable construction can make the \u201cpurchase\u201d concept cover the conduct of persons who as handlers simply process and distribute milk they have produced on their own farms.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-12\">I am not unmindful that in United States v. Rock Royal Co-Operative, Inc., 1939, 307 U.S. 533, 59 S.Ct. 993, 83 L.Ed. 1446, the Supreme Court held that a cooperative handling milk acquired from individual producers who are members of the cooperative is a \u201cpurchaser\u201d from these .members, whether the cooperative is of a \u201csale\u201d type or an \u201cagency\u201d type. But the Court caused this decision to turn upon the fact that Congress had made subsection 8c(5) (F) expressly applicable to both types of cooperatives, thereby indicating that no distinction should be made between types of cooperatives in the companion subsections 8c (5) (A) and (C). But the special treatment of cooperatives in section 8c (5) does not in my view afford any basis for the present interpretation of \u201cpurchase\u201d in a case involving merely one individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>who produces and handles his own milk as distinguished from a cooperative which handles milk for its several members.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Perhaps Congress overlooked the fact that the language it used excluded the individual who handles his own milk. Perhaps, advised of this restriction, Congress would wish to broaden the statute. Certainly, the argument of the government to us and the opinion of this court make a strong case for doing so. But I am unable to avoid the conclusion that by judicial decision we are now giving the Secretary of Agriculture authority which the statute as enacted by Congress withheld. I cannot reconcile such action with my understanding of the restricted role our polity assigns to courts in construing and applying statutes. Therefore, I regretfully dissent from a decision which may well be very helpful to the orderly and effective regulation of a vital industry.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b667-8\">. Here, different from United States v. Lehigh Valley Cooperative Farmers, Inc., 3 Cir., 287 F.2d 726, neither the Secretary of Agriculture nor the court has undertaken to justify the order under the \u201cincidental\u201d and \u201cnecessary\u201d powers conferred upon the Secretary by subsection 8c (7) (D). Nor do I see how regulation of milk not purchased could fairly be described as incidental and necessary to the regulation of milk that is purchased.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
