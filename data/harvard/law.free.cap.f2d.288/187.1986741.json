During these years it expended certain sums for title reports prepared by other companies, known as \u201cstarters,\u201d which upon purchase were included by it in its \u201ctitle plant\u201d for use in the preparation of its own future title reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>The question presented by the petition before us is whether the Tax Court was in error in holding these expenditures to be for the purchase of business assets and nondeductible as capital expense rather than for plant maintenance and deductible as ordinary business expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">The opinion of the Tax Court is reported in 34 T.C. 29.
