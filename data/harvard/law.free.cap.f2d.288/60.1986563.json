The complaint alleges that \u201cplaintiffs Maria Teresa, Maria Ana y [sic] Maria Luisa Padilla Garcia are actual residents of the State of New York, having resided abroad for more than 20 years.\u201d There is no allegation of defendant\u2019s residence or citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\"> The only possible basis for the district court\u2019s jurisdiction of the instant action is diversity of citizenship of the parties under either 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a) (1) (1958), or \u00a7 41 of the Jones Act, 39 Stat. 965 (1917), 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 863, now known as the Puerto Rican Federal Relations Act, see Public Law 600, \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5, 64 Stat. 319, 320, 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 731e and note, 737 note. The allegations of residence are insufficient to establish jurisdiction on the basis of either statute. Realty Holding Co. v. Donaldson, 1925, 268 U.S. 398, 45 S.Ct. 521, 69 L.Ed. 1014; Brooks v. Yawkey, 1 Cir., 1953, 200 F.2d 663, 664. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1653 (1958) amendment of the complaint may be granted to correct such defective allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">In accordance with the procedure followed in Brooks v. Yawkey, supra, and Keene Lumber Co. v. Leventhal, 1 Cir., 1948, 165 F.2d 815, we shall allow 20 days from the date of this opinion for the filing in this court of a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1653 for leave to amend. If such a motion to amend is filed and allowed, we shall proceed to dispose of the appeal on the merits. Otherwise, we shall be obliged to vacate the district court\u2019s judgment of dismissal, which was on the merits and with prejudice, and direct the district court to enter judgment dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. See Keene Lumber Co. v. Leventhal, supra, note 1 at page 818 of 165 F.2d.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
