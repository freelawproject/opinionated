Dodson, deceased. The District Court found after the taking of testimony that petitioner had not sustained the burden of proof showing that she was decedent\u2019s comr mon-law wife. Her claim to that status was the basis for her assertion of right to letters of administration. On the conflicting evidence we cannot say that the finding of the District Court was clearly erroneous, and accordingly its order is</p>\n<p id=\"b475-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
