Court-appointed counsel argues that such an appeal should be allowed because the trial judge failed to instruct the jury on the government\u2019s burden of proof of sanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-24\">Petitioner\u2019s sanity was presumed (and no instruction required) until \u201csome evidence\u201d of his insanity was introduced. Davis v. United States, 160 U.S. 469, 16 S.Ct. 353, 40 L.Ed. 499 (1895); Tatum v. United States, 88 U.S.App.D.C. 386, 190 F.2d 612 (1951). In this case petitioner\u2019s testimony was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-25\">\u201cQ. Mr. Wilson, will you tell us why you don\u2019t remember shooting Florence Smith and the various incidents which the police say you related to them? A. The only thing I can say, to me it had to be some sort of temporary insanity, some sort of insanity. I mean the way I felt toward this girl and the way we had been getting along, this thing, if it wasn\u2019t me sitting here it would be ridiculous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-26\">\u201cQ. Mr. Wilson, did you on the morning of February 20, 1959, have any intention or desire to kill Florence Smith? A. No, sir; not that morning or any morning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWT\">Petitioner\u2019s statement to the police that at the time of the shooting he \u201csaw red\u201d was also introduced. Nothing else concerning insanity appears in the evidence. Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel did not request an instruction on insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>The testimony presented to the trial court, above quoted, while it might amount to a <em>plea </em>of insanity, standing alone does not constitute such evidence of insanity as to require that the jury be instructed as to its effect in the ease. It is therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Ordered by the court that the petition is denied as frivolous.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
