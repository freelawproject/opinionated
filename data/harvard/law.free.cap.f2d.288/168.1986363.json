The Trustee excepted and filed counterclaims against them. Thereupon the appellants moved to dismiss the counterclaims, on the ground that the Trustee had failed to join parties alleged to be indispensable, and that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">After the Referee overruled their motion to dismiss the Trustee\u2019s counterclaims, the present appellants petitioned for review in the District Court. That court affirmed the Referee\u2019s ruling, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The Trustee says the Referee\u2019s order is interlocutory and therefore moves to dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We resolve the close question thus presented by retaining the appeal. On the merits, we hold the District Court was correct in affirming the Referee\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
