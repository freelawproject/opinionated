The actions were for personal injuries to plaintiff, a sheet-metal <em>mechanic, </em>consequent upon a fall on a construction job, and also a claimed loss of consortium. The fall was attributed to his stepping on a pipe coupling in an allegedly poorly lighted area of the building under construction. Plaintiff received compensation from his own employer, a subcontractor, and sued the defendants, who are the owners of the property, the general contractor, and another subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">We find no adequate reason to reverse the ruling of the District Court that the evidence was insufficient to raise an issue for the jury as to any negligence on the part of any defendant which could be said to be a proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injuries. The judgment from which he appeals is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
