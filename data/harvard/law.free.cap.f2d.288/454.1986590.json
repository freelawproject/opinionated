On August 15, 1960 the Union appealed the order granting the injunction to this Court. On September 13, 1960, the parties by formal settlement stipulation, thereafter approved by the Board, agreed to the entry of a consent order restraining the charged violations and directing the posting of appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>priate notices. On the entry of that agreed consent order, the court injunction had fulfilled its function. The Board in the language of the injunction had now made \u201cfinal disposition of the matters * * * pending before the * * * Board.\u201d That proceeding and the appeal therefrom had become moot. Nothing done in the related case of N. L. R. B. v. Carpenters\u2019 District Council of Miami, et al., 5 Cir., 1961, 288 F.2d 455 seeking enforcement by this Court under \u00a7 10(e), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(e), of the Board\u2019s consent order, was of any significance. If anything it only made more so that which was already moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Appeal dismissed as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
