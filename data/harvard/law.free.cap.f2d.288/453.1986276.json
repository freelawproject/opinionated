The conviction is said to have been essentially unfair and, therefore, unconstitutional in that two of the twelve jurors did not concur in the verdict of guilty. However, the appellant failed to present substantial evidence to support his charge that the verdict of the jury was not unanimous. Accordingly, the court below quite properly refused to disturb the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
