During the greater part of this period, both appellant and the Association made contributions to a group insurance annuity plan which is not in issue here. The present controversy relates to the computation of the benefits annually payable to appellant under a supplemental retirement plan, to which employees made no contribution. Appellant complains that the computation was erroneous, to his prejudice. The trial court granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-24\">Appellee concedes that appellant\u2019s rights under the supplemental plan are judicially enforceable. The issue before us is the scope and definition of those rights. See Hurd v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., D.C.N.D.Ill.1955, 136 F.Supp. 125, affirmed 7 Cir., 1956, 234 F.2d 942, certiorari denied sub nom. Seybold v. Western Electric Co., 1956, 352 U.S. 918, 77 S.Ct. 216, 1 L.Ed.2d 124. Over a long period of years the settlor-employer and the trustees of the supplemental retirement fund have construed the governing indenture and related documents as providing for annual retirement benefits which would (a) be supplemental to Social Security benefits, the latter benefits to be deducted from any amounts otherwise payable to an employee under the supplemental plan, and (b) be calculated upon the average regular' salary of the employee, exclusive of bonuses. The trustees have made payments to appellant and others in accordance with these determinations, both here challenged by appellant. After reviewing the controlling documents, on the basis stated in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Hurd case, supra,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we cannot say that the construction adopted was incorrect, or that it in any way invaded appellant\u2019s rights, or subjected him to discriminatory treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Appellant urges that there were a number of genuine issues of fact presented, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e), 28 U.S.C.A., and that he was entitled to go to trial. We disagree. This seems to us the sort of 'case in which summary judgment is not , only proper but is the course indicated by \u2019the letter and spirit of the Rules. For example, appellant raised no genuine issue of material fact with respect to the ' sums paid to appellant and others in certain years as \u201cbonuses\u201d or \u201csalary adjustments.\u201d These sums, while clearly '\u201cadditional compensation for services,\u201d and taxable as such, were not at any time Considered part of the employee\u2019s \u201cregular annual salary\u201d or \u201caverage salary\u201d within the meaning of the Plan.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These awards were made at the year-end by the appellant\u2019s superior officer \u201cif and when, in his judgment,\u201d the budget permitted. In 7 or 8 years, out of the 19 years of -appellant\u2019s employment, he received no award, for reasons unknown to him. The .awards he did receive averaged less than .$1,000 each. Appellant urges that he should have been given a chance to bring .out additional facts on this subject at a .trial, but does not suggest what such \u25a0facts might be, or how they would affect \u00a1the legal question presented. Appellant\u2019s affidavit in the District Court avers that \u201cThe entire history, too long to set \u25a0forth adequately ,in detail by affidavit instead of trial, of said retirement payment contract, involves circular notices by defendant to all employees, including \u25a0 plaintiff, correspondence, memoranda, and oral communications.\u201d We find nothing in these words standing alone, or indeed in combination with any other portion of appellant\u2019s affidavit and attached exhibits, to raise a genuine issue of material fact on the bonus question, or any other question in the case. Issues of law are presented, which we think the District Court correctly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">For these reasons, the judgment of the District Court will be</p>\n<p id=\"AXm\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b474-5\">. While we do not necessarily agree with all that is said in the two opinions in Hurd, we would reach our present conclusion even after giving appellant the benefit of every favorable inference to him to be drawn from those opinions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b474-6\">. Appellant urges that the affidavit of appellee\u2019s Comptroller to this effect should not have been considered by the District Court, alleging that it was argumentative and would not have been admissible at a trial. Be that as it may, appellant made no claim that he could prove facts contrary to those stated in the affidavit. If he is arguing that the construction given the Plan by the appellee is irrelevant, this does not help him, as the issue would remain one of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b474-10\">DANAHER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AOX\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">It has become certain that my colleagues and I do not read the materials at hand in quite the same way. I find myself unable to decide whether or not certain payments to the appellant, over and above his normal salary, constituted \u201cbonus payments\u201d as the appellee argues, or \u201cadjustments.\u201d One of appellant\u2019s exhibits indicates that such payments \u201chave always been considered as additional compensation for services during the particular year for which they have been granted and have always been included in our salary records and so reported for tax purposes.\u201d Since controversy developed, the appellee has denominated such payments as \u201cbonus.\u201d If they are not bonus payments, such \u201cadjustments\u201d became an important factor in computing the appellant\u2019s average annual salary. The difference to appellant amounts to $270 per year. This element of the case, it would seem, presents a genuine issue as to which a record should be made, and I would reverse to permit a proper showing upon this aspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">My colleagues\u2019 conclusion that the \u201cadjustments\u201d were \u201cnot at any time considered part\u201d of the appellant\u2019s salary can be reached, as I see it, only by aceept<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>anee of appellee\u2019s claim on that score. Appellant has challenged that construction, offering to establish his position by evidence of \u201ccircular notices by defendant to all employees, including plaintiff, correspondence, memoranda, and oral communications.\u201d I think the case is not ripe for summary judgment.
