On March 4, 1959, he published a \u201cFirst Codicil,\u201d reciting that whereas he had named the Bank as Executor and now desired to change the appointment, \u201cI hereby revoke the appointment\u201d of the Bank, and \u201cI hereby nominate, constitute and appoint my wife * * * and my daughter * * * as co-executrices of my Last Will and Testament.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He thereupon ratified and republished his will \u201cin all respects except as modified by this codicil thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b898-22\">Revocation of the appointment of the Bank was thus accomplished.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> His intention could not have been made more certain.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-23\">Our Code provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-24\">\u201cNo will or codicil, or any part thereof, which shall be in any manner revoked shall, after being revoked, be revived otherwise than by the re-execution thereof, or by a codicil executed in the manner hereinbefore required, and then only to the extent to which an intention to revive is shown.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-25\">With revocation of the appointment of the Bank complete, followed by the appointment of the testator\u2019s wife and daughter as co-exeeutrices, as shown, nothing short of a clear intention to revive the original appointment can satisfy the statute. Even a republication of the will merely ratifies the will as modified by its codicils.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The different instruments are to be read together as the expression of a single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>testamentary act. Of course, if a later codicil is so inconsistent with earlier provisions that all may not stand, a different problem arises, and one codicil will revoke another if it be unmistakably clear that the testator so intended.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">Applying such principles, it is clear that the testator by his second codicil did not revoke the appointment of his wife and daughter as co-executrices. Without reference to the First Codicil, the later instrument of October 1, 1959, was described by the testator as <em>\u201ca </em>codicil\u201d to his will. The second codicil merely interpolated into the original will of March 24, 1951, a bequest to a friend, renumbered the paragraphs of his will accordingly, and then reaffirmed its provisions. Read together, the instruments may clearly be reconciled to continue the Bank as Trustee but to appoint the wife and daughter to execute the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">The court erred in appointing the Bank as Executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b898-16\">. With, further particularity he specified: I give to my wife, Mary Hyland Remon, and my daughter, Ruth Remon Wenzel, or the survivor of them, as executrix or executrices, all the powers, authority, and discretion which were by my said Last Will and Testament conferred upon the American Security and Trust Company, a corporation, as executor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b898-26\">.
