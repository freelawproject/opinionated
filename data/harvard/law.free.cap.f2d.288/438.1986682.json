Federal jurisdiction is based on diversity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While the facts are not so very clear the negotiation of the contract and its performance all seem to have a Pennsylvania setting and the law of Pennsylvania is, therefore, applicable. Pa. Annots., Restatement, Conflict of Laws \u25a0\u00a7 332 (1936). The plaintiff, Miller, was a retiring member from a partnership composed of himself and the defendants. Most of the terms governing the amounts to be paid to Miller were clear to both parties and payments have been made as promised.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">One of the terms of the contract, however, was that Miller was to receive 15% of \u201cany damages collected by the partnership subsequent to the date of this agreement (whether by award of court or jury, or by an out-of-court settlement of any kind whatsoever)\u201d in a suit which was then pending by the partnership against the corporation known as Wen Products, Inc. and an individual defendant named Anton.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">This suit mentioned was being contested in federal courts in Illinois and eventually the plaintiffs (the partners) got a judgment upholding the validity of their patent and sustaining their claim of infringement. Before any master\u2019s report on damages, however, the parties after some period of negotiation settled the case. They settled it by the defendants (Wen and Anton) agreeing to pay $250,000 damages for their infringement and the Weller Company, in turn, gave the defendants in the patent suit a license with a royalty provision of 7%%.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Now, Miller, having received the stipulated portion of the $250,000 paid, claims that he is entitled to 15% of the royalties received by Weller and the trial court agreed with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-15\">We agree that the case was one for summary judgment but we think the judgment went to the wrong party. This was a contract drawn by lawyers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They used words of art. \u201cDamages,\u201d we think, is a word of art with a rather definite meaning. It is something paid in recompense for an infringement of a plaintiff\u2019s legal right by the defendant\u2019s liability-creating conduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Damages for patent infringement are compensation awarded to the patentee for a legal injury to his rights, compensation for an injury actually undergone.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Pennsylvania courts have said, citing the Restatement,- that when parties use words of art in an agreement the usual meaning of the word of art is to be ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>plied in deciding what the contract means.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">When the meaning of a word is so generally recognized in the law and when in a contract the word is used in an agreement which lawyers have drawn up and had their clients sign, we think that meaning for the word is to be applied in deciding what the obligations of the agreement are. To vary that meaning under these circumstances is, we think, contrary to the general rule that when the parties- have \u201cmemorialized\u201d their agreement in a written contract that instrument defines the extent of their obligations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The foregoing being our view of this case, the district court incorrectly decided it. The plaintiff has received his contractual share of the damages paid. He is not entitled to any part of the royalties received or to be received.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The judgment of the district court will be reversed and the case will be remanded with directions to enter judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b487-8\">. The complaint originally filed in this action imperfectly alleged diversity. We followed the procedure provided in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1653. See our opinion in Miller v. Weller, 3 Cir., 1961, 286 F.2d 172. The plaintiff has now amended his complaint to show the requisite allegations without objection by the defendants. We therefore have jurisdiction and proceed to the decision of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b487-10\">.
