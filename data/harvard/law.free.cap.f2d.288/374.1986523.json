Phelps Crosby sued to enjoin Claudia S. Johnsen from obstructing or interfering with the normal use of a four-foot passway extending from the rear of the latter's premises on Massachusetts Avenue to Que Street. She alleged she and her predecessors in title to. a Que Street parcel adjacent to the alleged passway had used it for more than, twenty years adversely and under a claim of right; that this use had been \u201ccontinuous, open, notorious, uninterrupted,, exclusive, peaceful, and with knowledge- and acquiescence of the owners of lot 30-[the servient estate], during said period', until in or about the month of June, 1954,. when the defendants erected or caused to be erected a fence obstructing and' closing said right of way, over the protest of the plaintiff and causing the-plaintiff to suffer irreparable injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-19\">After hearing evidence, the District. Judge made factual findings which justified his holding that, prior to 1954, \u201cthere was a sufficiently continuous use-of the alley for a sufficiently long period', of time to establish the prescriptive right in the owner and occupant of 2008 Que-Street [Mrs. C. Phelps Crosby] of a. right-of-way through that alley.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-20\">The owner of the servient estate appeals. We are of the view that the evidence as a whole gives substantial support to the trial judge\u2019s findings. His-judgment, which logically followed those-findings, must be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b422-22\">DANAHER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AZk\">(concurring separately).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-23\">The trial judge found established by a. preponderance of the evidence that there had been \u201ca sufficiently continuous use of the alley for a sufficiently long period of time to establish the prescriptive right\u201d claimed by the appellee. His findings-have not been shown to be clearly erroneous. He concludes, in effect, that user was \u201copen, notorious, exclusive, continuous, and adverse.\u201d Umhau v.
