Appellant is a deputy commissioner of the Bureau of Employees\u2019 Compensation. He issued a compensation order under the Act which the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York has in part set aside. 184 F.Supp. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Lars Hellberg, a carpenter working as a maintenance man for the Bush Terminal Railroad Company, injured his back on January 4, 1956, while engaged in his employment. He continued working for the week following the injury, but then was forced to retire for more than a month. From February 24, 1956, until April 25, 1956, Hellberg worked while wearing a back brace. On or about the latter date Hellberg entered the hospital and underwent an operation called a \u201cspinal fusion.\u201d The operation was deemed a success and Hellberg returned to the same job at the Bush Terminal on November 25, 1957.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">The workman filed a claim under the Act and a hearing was held. So much of the award of the deputy commissioner as directed the payment of compensation for the period prior to November 25, 1957, is not now in question on this appeal. In addition, the deputy commissioner\u2019s award required the payment of $9.69 a week from November 25, 1957, \u201cuntil disability shall have ceased, or until otherwise ordered.\u201d Accrued sums were to be paid at once; subsequent payments were to be made in biweekly installments. The district court entered a decree for a permanent injunction \u201csuspending and setting aside the enforcement of that part of the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s order, dated July 30, 1959, wherein it fixed an earning capacity of the claimant and ordered compensation payments based thereon to continue after November 25, 1957.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">The brief by the appellees does no more than express approval of the trial court\u2019s findings and opinion. It seems to us that the trial judge unduly emphasized what was the fact, namely, that Hellberg\u2019s wages since his return to work on November 25, 1957, at the Bush Terminal were in fact in excess of his preinjury earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">Subsection (c) of \u00a7 908 of the Act deals with disability payments for \u201cpermanent partial disability.\u201d Subsection (c) (21), which is applicable to this case, contains the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-14\">\u201cIn all other cases in this class of disability the compensation shall be 66% per centum of the difference between his average weekly wages and his wage-earning capacity thereafter in the same employment or \u2022 otherwise, payable during the continuance of such partial disability, but subject to reconsideration of the degree of such impairment by the deputy commissioner on his own motion or upon application of any party in interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-15\">While employee\u2019s wage-earning capacity is normally determined by his actual earnings, this is by no means necessarily so. Subsection (h) of \u00a7 908 directs that \u201cwage-earning capacity\u201d of an injured employee</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-16\">\u201cshall be determined by his actual earnings if such actual earnings fairly and reasonably represent his wage-earning capacity: <em>Provided, however, </em>That if the employee has no actual earnings or his actual earnings do not fairly and reasonably represent his wage-earning capacity, the deputy commissioner may, in the interest of justice, fix such wage-earning capacity as shall be reasonable, having due regard to the nature of his injury, the degree of physical impairment, his usual employment, and any other factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>or circumstances in the case which <em>may </em>affect his capacity to earn <em>wages </em>in his disabled condition, including the effect of disability as it may naturally extend into the future.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">The deputy commissioner found as a fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">\u201c[T]hat the claimant returned to employment on November 25, 1957, such employment consisting of the same job as he held on the date of the injury; that the basic pay rate of that job had increased, in conformity with general increases of pay in the industry; that the claimant earns more now than his average weekly wage at the time of the injury, but his present earnings are not truly representative of his earning capacity; that as a result of his injury the claimant was permanently partially disabled from November 25, 1957, to July 30, 1959, inclusive, on which date he was still disabled; that considering the nature and extent of his injury, the claimant had an earning capacity of $70.00 a week * * * which is reasonable, and he is entitled to * * * compensation, at $9.69 a week * * * for such permanent partial disability * * * <em>ft</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-9\"> It is conceded that an award of compensation may properly be given, under the above provision of law, even though the employee\u2019s actual earnings have not been diminished as a result of the injury, as was the case here. See Lumber Mutual Casualty Insurance Co. v. O\u2019Keeffe, 2 Cir., 1954, 217 F.2d 720, 723. We think that the deputy commissioner\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence and should have been allowed by the district court to stand, in view of the limited scope of judicial review accorded in such cases. O\u2019Leary v. Brown-Pacific-Maxon, Inc., 1951, 340 U.S. 504, 71 S.Ct. 470, 95 L.Ed. 483; Gooding v. Willard, 2 Cir., 1954, 209 F. 2d 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">The undisputed medical testimony of Dr. Jacob Urdang, a surgical orthopedist, was to the effect that the claimant had suffered a \u201cpermanent partial loss of use of the back and lower extremity\u201d; that forward flexion of the trunk from the lumbo-sacral was not within normal limits, and that straight leg raising on the left was \u201crestricted about 15 degrees.\u201d When asked if the claimant could do the work of a carpenter, despite these disabilities, the witness replied that \u201che could do the work almost unlimited if it didn\u2019t require bending, stooping, lifting and pulling.\u201d We can take judicial notice of the fact that the usual work of a carpenter entails \u201cbending, stooping, lifting and pulling\u201d; such activities, as Dr. Urdang further testified, could aggravate the claimant\u2019s injury and cause it to go into a severe disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">Hellberg himself testified that he requested light work upon his return to the Terminal but that as no light work was available he resumed his previous task as a maintenance man rather than forfeit certain seniority rights. Hell-berg also testified that since returning to work he has required assistance of a helper to perform tasks which he previously had accomplished alone. From time to time he wears a back brace to help relieve his pain. His duties require him occasionally to lift machinery of varying weights. Although it is true that the record does not contain detailed data as to exactly how many pounds one in Hellberg\u2019s line of work should be able to lift in order that he might be judged to have full wage-earning capacity, we are of the opinion that the instant record provides a sufficient basis for the deputy commissioner\u2019s conclusion that Hellberg\u2019s partial disability was of a permanent nature and in fact had impaired his wage-earning capacity. The medical evidence on the point probably could not have been made more explicit without transgressing the limitations of the art. Furthermore, as indicated, the claimant\u2019s injury could well cause some future disablement greater than that presently suffered, which is a factor that the Act directs to be taken into account in deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>mining his \u201cwage-earning capacity.\u201d Indeed, if the claimant were to await such aggravation before presenting his claim, he might well find the one-year limitation to be a bar. Pillsbury v. United Engineering Co., 9 Cir., 1951, 187 F.2d 987.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">For these reasons we are required to vacate the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
