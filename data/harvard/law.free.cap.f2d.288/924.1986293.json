The opposition is based on opposer's registration<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the mark \u201cKalistron\u201d which issued some three years prior to the first use alleged by applicant. The gocds specified in the registration are a flexible plastic sheeting or film for use as upholstery, wall coverings, pocketbooks, luggage, table tops, footwear and industrial uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">The issue here is whether applicant\u2019s mark \u201cKoveron\u201d so resembles opposer\u2019s mark \u201cKalistron\u201d as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers, where the products move in the same channel of trade and are sold to the same classes of purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">Opposer has urged that its registration of the marks \u201cKalitex,\u201d \u201cKali-grain,\u201d \u201cTapistron\u201d and \u201cWeldron\u201d and the use by one of its divisions of the mark \u201cKoverite\u201d make this case a proper one in which to consider and apply what it refers to as the \u201cfamily of trademarks\u201d doctrine. No authority has been cited to support this proposition. When the names are scrutinized to find some common family characteristic, we cannot find a factual basis to support opposer\u2019s position. Three of the names begin with the letter \u201cK\u201d, two other names end with the suffix \u201cron,\u201d We do not think opposer has established a right to the family of names comprising three syllable words beginning with the letter \u201cK\u201d and ending with the suffix \u201cron\u201d. While the mark \u201cKalistron\u201d may be said to possess family characteristics which relate it to some other marks of opposer, the opposed mark \u201cKoveron\u201d clearly does not. We do not think an average purchaser would relate the mark \u201cKoveron\u201d to this alleged \u201cfamily\u201d of marks in which opposer includes its mark \u201cKalistron\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-10\">Opposer also urges that we should here consider the fact that one Westray, a former officer of opposer, was hired by applicant as a consultant. The inference is that the name \u201cKoveron\u201d was adopted during the time that West-ray was so acting and was a part of applicant\u2019s plan of doing business in unfair competition with opposer. Such facts are not seen to be relevant to the issue in this opposition, namely likelihood of confusion, mistake or deception of purchasers will result from the use of applicant\u2019s mark on its goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-11\">We have reviewed the record in the light of opposer\u2019s arguments based thereon as establishing instances of actual confusion. The most that can be made of these arguments is that instances of unfair competition may have occurred between opposer and Westray\u2019s company, Laminated Services Incorporated. We find no relevancy or materiality of these facts on the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-12\">While it is true, as urged by opposer, that \u201cKalistron\u201d and \u201cKoveron\u201d are each three syllable words ending in the same three letters \u201cron\u201d, there are no other similarities except for the common initial letter \u201cK\u201d. When the marks are considered in their entireties they are distinctive in appearance and sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-13\">The witness Poitras testified that the mark \u201cKalistron\u201d is from a Greek name meaning \u201cmost beautiful.\u201d When asked about the meaning of the word \u201cKalistron\u201d the witness Mason testified \u201cWell, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>I didn\u2019t know the Greek interpretation of it. I just took it to be a trade-mark for a vinyl.\u201d He also further identified the mark as \u201c * * * a trade-mark for a vinyl wall covering distributed by U. S. Plywood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">The witnesses agreed as to the meaning of the word \u201cKoveron.\u201d Mason testified that the name was developed to be \u201cdescriptive\u201d of a covering which would \u201cnot tie us down to any product.\u201d Mason further testified that the name was picked as \u201ca name that would be descriptive of the product and yet, one that we could apply to paints or any other allied lines of wall coverings that we cared to manufacture in the future.\u201d The witness Poitras testified that if the word \u201cKoveron\u201d was split \u201cinto two words, Koveron, I would say that you were going to take a cover and put it on something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">This testimony, together with our comparison of the entire marks, makes it clear to us that the marks \u201cKalistron\u201d and \u201cKoveron\u201d do not stimulate similar psychological reactions or create similar associations.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">The testimony also is definite that the goods on which the marks are used are sold chiefly on architect\u2019s specification. The testimony of Mason describes two instances in which \u201cKalistron\u201d was specified by the architect but in which applicant was able to sell its \u201cKoveron\u201d as a competing material. In both instances the architects responsible for the original specifications had to agree to the change in material. Mason also testified that he knew of no instance where \u201cKoveron\u201d was accepted as a substitute for \u201cKalistron\u201d without the knowledge of the person originally specifying \u201cKalistron\u201d and without knowing that it was a different product than \u201cKalistron.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">While the witness Poitras referred generally to \u201ctwo instances of actual confusion,\u201d he could not say that \u201cKoveron\u201d was involved in either instance. When asked specifically \u201cNow, what instances can you say of confusion in which Koveron was involved?\u201d he answered \u201cI can\u2019t think of any particular instance where Koveron as a product was used, as confusion.\u201d He also testified that he knew of no instance of confusion on the part of the purchasing public between the two names. The witness Mason said he had not encountered any instance of confusion between \u201cKoveron\u201d and \u201cKalistron\u201d. In explanation of why this is so, Mason testified, \u201cKalistron, as stated before by Mr. Poitras, is known generally to all the better architects and as a general rule Kalistron is used in those architectural specifications. It is our job to sell the architect that Koveron is as good or better than Kalistron.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">The differences in the names make it seem unlikely to us that the mark \u201cKoveron\u201d when applied by applicant to the goods specified in the application will cause confusion, mistake or deceive purchasers. The decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AZTY\">.
