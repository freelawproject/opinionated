Plaintiff is executor of the estate of John B. Merrill, deceased, and administrator of the estate of Ann T. Merrill, deceased, both of which decedents were passengers on the fatal flight. At trial before a jury the plaintiff claimed that the accident was caused by the negligence of the pilot in taking a short cut over dangerous mountainous terrain, and in flying through clouds while not on an instrument clearance. The plaintiff also relied upon the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur. </em>The defendant asserted that the accident resulted from the incapacitation of the crew from some unexpected and unknown cause. The jury rendered a verdict for the defendant, and plaintiff appeals. No serious question can be raised as to the jury\u2019s rendition of this verdict upon the evidence presented, and the only points requiring discussion concern various evidentiary and procedural rulings made at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-17\">An important factor in establishing defendant\u2019s theory of the accident was the testimony by one of defendant\u2019s pilots, Kehmeier, that in investigating the scene of the crash five days after the accident he found a smoke mask with its straps pulled tight, \u201cindicating the mask had been in use at the time of impact.\u201d Plaintiff asserts that this testimony should have been excluded because defendant failed to show that the condition of the mask when found by Kehmeier was the same as at the time of the accident. Since, however, only five days had elapsed between the time of the accident and the discovery of the mask, there was a \u201creasonable probability the article has not been changed in important respects\u201d; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>the question whether or not the mask had been tampered with went only to the weight of the evidence to be evaluated by the jury. United States v. S. B. Penick &amp; Co., 2 Cir., 136 F.2d 413, 415. The testimony regarding the mask was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Plaintiff next complains of the refusal to allow cross-examination of Kehmeier as to his failure to object to testimony by committee chairman MacNamara at a CAB hearing, which was allegedly inconsistent with Kehmeier\u2019s testimony at trial. At the CAB hearing MacNamara testified that the mask was found in the \u201cmain circuit breaker panel\u201d and that an FBI examination disclosed \u201cno evidence which would indicate whether or not the mask was being worn at the time of the accident.\u201d Plaintiff accepted the court\u2019s ruling that this line of cross-examination would be valid only if Kehmeier had a duty to speak out if he heard inaccuracies in MacNamara\u2019s testimony. But plaintiff then failed to accept an invitation by the court to question Kehmeier as to his obligation to provide information regarding the mask. Furthermore, since Kehmeier was not called upon by the CAB to testify regarding the mask, though he gave testimony on another subject, it would appear that his duties in the investigation did not extend to a consideration of the relevance of the mask. In addition, the crucial part of MacNamara\u2019s statement merely recited the contents of an FBI report, of which Kehmeier apparently knew nothing. His failure to contradict MacNamara\u2019s summary of the report would therefore not be relevant for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">We find no error in the court\u2019s failure to read to the jury the portion of Hoffman\u2019s testimony on cross-examination relating to use of a \u201cshort cut\u201d when the jury requested \u201cThe testimony of Captain Hoffman re the use of the automatic pilot.\u201d The testimony which plaintiff wished to add relating to the short cut was not representative of Hoffman\u2019s testimony on that subject, which read as a whole revealed that there was no \u201cshort cut\u201d as suggested by plaintiff. Furthermore, the requested testimony was beyond the scope of the jury\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The objections based on the denial of plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial are disposed of at length in Judge Her-lands\u2019 opinion reported at 25 F.R.D. 68. Here we need only add that, taken as a whole, the papers received on the motion support, rather than impeach, Kehmeier\u2019s testimony relating to the smoke mask. The improper references to plaintiff\u2019s wealth were promptly stricken and the jury was adequately warned to disregard them.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
