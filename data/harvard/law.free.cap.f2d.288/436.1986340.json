L. R. B. v. Drivers, Chauffeurs, Helpers, Local Union No. 639, 362 U.S. 274, 80 S.Ct. 706, 4 L.Ed.2d 710, there was no violation of section 8(b) (1) (A) of the Act. The Court further finds that there was substantial evidence to support the finding of the Board that the respondent violated sections 8(b) (4) (A) and (B). Section 160(e), Title 29 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-21\">The questions of modification of the order by striking the phrase \u201cany other employer\u201d and whether proper objection was made, will be held in abeyance for further consideration of the Court, pending the decision of the Supreme Court in National Labor Relations Board v. Ochoa Fertilizer Corporation et al.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-22\">It is therefore ordered, adjudged and decreed that the order of the N.L.R.B. be enforced, except as to the violation of section 8(b) (1) (A), as set forth in paragraph 1(a) of said order and the phrase \u201cany other employer.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
