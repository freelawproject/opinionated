We agree. The Administrative Procedure Act requires all decisions to state not only findings and conclusions but also \u201cthe reasons or basis therefor, upon all the material issues of fact, law or discretion presented on the record * * \u00a7 8(b), 5 U.S.C. A. \u00a7 1007(b). The Board \u201cshould make the basis of its action reasonably clear. We cannot find that it did so here.\u201d Radio Station KFH Co. v. Federal Communications Commission, 101 U.S.App.D. C. 164, 166, 247 F.2d 570, 572; Pacific Far East Line, Inc. v. Federal Maritime Board, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 155, 275 F.2d 184. Cf. Secretary of Agriculture v. United States, 347 U.S. 645, 654, 74 S. Ct. 826, 98 L.Ed. 1015.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>The Board\u2019s order is therefore vacated and the case remanded for the Board to reconsider and clarify the rate base question. The Board should also pass upon the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that it is not fair to rate payers to let an accumulated depreciation reserve be depleted and depreciation charges thereby increased.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">The motion to dismiss Puerto Rico\u2019s petition for review in No. 15846 is denied. Puerto Rico\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition for review in No. 15847 is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-12\">.
