C. amplifiers, differential amplifiers, digital voltmeters, and industrial closed circuit television which are sold primarily to military establishments or their direct subcontractors. Selling prices vary from $250 for the D. C. amplifier to a $3,000 to $5,000 minimum range for its closed circuit television system.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-14\">Appellant took no testimony, relying on its registrations and cross-examination of Silberman.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-15\">The board was of the opinion that the respective product's were different; that there was nothing to show that they moved in the same trade channels or were bought by the same class of purchasers. It found that appellee\u2019s goods are sold by, as well as to, technically trained people, and concluded that there was no likelihood of purchaser confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-16\">We are unable to agree with that conclusion. Appellant argues, and we think correctly, that the issue should be decided primarily on the basis of the goods enumerated in the respective registrations. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Hofman, 258 F.2d 953, 46 CCPA 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-18\">There can be no doubt that the goods enumerated in appellee\u2019s registration are, at least in part, the same as those described in appellant\u2019s application; thus the similarity of the two marks becomes decisive.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-19\">It is obvious that Cintel and Kin-tel are identical except for the initial letters \u201cC\u201d and \u201cK.\u201d Even assuming, as appellee urges, that the \u201cC\u201d would be soft as opposed to the hard enunciation of \u201cK,\u201d we think the marks, both arbitrary in nature, are so nearly identical as to result in that likelihood of confusion contemplated by Section 2(d), if concurrently used on the goods of the respective parties. At least, should there be doubt on that score, we feel obliged to resolve it against the newcomer. F. Jacobson &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Jaybern Fabrics, Inc., 195 F.2d 926, 39 CCPA 937. Under such circumstances it is necessary to <em>reverse </em>the decision appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-20\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b987-21\">. Reg.
