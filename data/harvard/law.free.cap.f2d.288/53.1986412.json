W. Kellogg Company. Kellogg manufactured a gamma-ray projector (the \u201cKel-Ray projector\u201d) which was used to detect latent defects in pipe welds. The projector worked on the same principle as an X-ray machine, the rays being emitted from radioisotopes mounted in the projector. The radioisotopes were small pellets x *4\", which were irradiated by placing them in a nuclear reactor. Kellogg obtained the neutral pellets from an independent supplier and sent them to a nuclear reactor at Idaho Falls, Idaho, which was operated by appellee Phillips Petroleum Company under a contract with the Atomic Energy Commission. After sufficient bombardment in the reactor, the pellets were shipped to the Kellogg South Houston facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-17\">McVey was a laboratory technician and Northway the office manager of the Kellogg South Houston Nuclear Laboratory. They allege that, on or about March 13, 1957, McVey, in the presence of North-way, was opening a shipment of ten irradiated pellets which had recently arrived from Phillips\u2019 reactor, when \u201cthere was an unexpected and uncontrolled discharge of radioactive dust into the air inside the Kellogg Laboratory.\u201d Plaintiffs allege further that, as a result of this discharge, which they claim was due to negligence on the part of Phillips, they were exposed to radioactive dust, resulting in severe injuries to their respective persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-18\"> On appeal, the first point of error raised is the refusal of the district court to admit certain evidence offered in rebuttal by plaintiffs. Initially, it may be observed that questions as to order of proof are committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And we may also note the rule that rebuttal evidence is generally admissible only to meet the evidence brought out in defendant\u2019s case in chief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, we start with an analysis of those portions of the case for the defendant which the proffered evidence purported to rebut.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-19\">The first witness for the defense whose testimony is relevant to our inquiry was L. T. Newby, a County Stream and Air Pollution Inspector of the State of Texas. He recalled visiting the South Houston facility on March 18,1957, approximately five days after the alleged exposure incident involved in this case. He noted that at the time of his visit no one told him of contamination in the area. His testimony was corroborated by his cohort, Mr. Douglas. Dr. Emmert, the first of several medical witnesses, next appeared for the defense. Dr. Emmert. could find no physical evidence of exposure to radiation on the part of McVey on March 13,1957. Mr. Hawkins was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>next witness whose testimony is relevant. He was a former office employee at the Kellogg Nuclear Laboratory, and he testified that on a day in March 1957 the alarm bell went off in the laboratory, and at that time Mr. Northway was in the office and not in the laboratory where the alleged exposure incident took place. Hawkins also testified that McVey checked himself for traces of radiation on that day in March 1957, and that he found himself contaminated. Defendant then offered as a witness one Bradley, a representative of the manufacturer of an air monitor device which was in the Kellogg hot lab in South Houston and measured radiation in the air. He testified that an alarm bell would sound when the machine registered above 2,000 counts per minute, although that level was not considered dangerous, Bradley interpreted various charts on which the air monitor recorded the level of radiation in the air. On March 13, 1957, he found a sharp rise in counts per minute from 3,000 to 8,000 \u2014 an increase which would normally have set off the alarm bell. Bradley testified that this level was probably due to the fact that sources (i. e., isotopes) were being moved around. He then translated the 8,000 count per minute reading into one-third of a micro-curie, which is about three times the amount of radiation given off by a wrist watch with a radium dial. On March 14, the monitor rose to a reading of 10,000 counts per minute \u2014 \u201ctypically the thing we see following a period in which these capsules have been opened and the personnel are working with them.\u201d On the basis of his readings of three charts offered in evidence, covering the periods of August 6-September 8, 1956, October 1-November 1, 1956, and March 11-April 30, 1957, Bradley estimated that the total radiation detected by the monitor was one-fortieth of \u201cthe amount that these people \u2014 that would have been marginally hazardous for these people to have breathed continuously, not only during their 40 hours a week of occupation, but 168 hours a week throughout their lives. So that a very substantial safety factor is involved here, a very substantial safety factor.\u201d After Mr. Bradley, a Dr. Allen testified for Phillips. On the basis of his examinations of McVey and Northway following the alleged March 13, 1957 incident, Dr. Allen concluded that \u201cthere was no significant exposure to radiation * * *. They had none of the symptoms that I could refer to radiation syndrome * * Dr. Allen was followed by an eye specialist, Dr. Goar. He testified that, because of their shape, he did not believe the \u201copacities\u201d observed in the eyes of McVey and Northway were caused by irradiation. He also noted that \u201csevere enough radiation to produce lens changes would cause epilation, falling out of the lashes * * (In their case in chief, plaintiffs had put in testimony that these opacities were early radiation cataracts.) Next came Dr. Gamble, a hemotologist. On the basis of his blood studies, he found that neither Northway nor McVey were exposed to any significant amounts of radiation. Another physician, Dr. Collins, confirmed that Northway exhibited none of the symptoms of significant radiation exposure. Dr. Harris, an expert on the biological effects of radiation, confirmed this conclusion on th\u00e9 basis of the symptoms manifested by plaintiffs, stating that in his opinion \u201cthere was no significant radiation injury in either one of these cases.\u201d Dr. Hasterlik agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">In addition to this testimony, the defendant introduced the readings from each of the plaintiffs\u2019 pocket dosimeters for the week ending Friday, March 15, 1957. These meters make daily records of the amount of radioactivity to which the wearers are exposed. McVey\u2019s total exposure for the week ending March 15 was 270 milliroentgens. Northway\u2019s dosimeter recorded 45 milliroentgens for the same week. The maximum permissible weekly accumulation is 300 milliroentgens. These exposure readings were confirmed by weekly reports of exposure to radiation taken from the film badges which appellants wore. For the week ending March 15, 1957, McVey\u2019s film badge reflected exposure to 270 milli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>roentgens of radiation, North way\u2019s to 15 milliroentgens.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The proffered rebuttal evidence consisted of testimony by a representative of Tracerlab, an organization specializing in the detection and measurement of radioactivity. In late April 1957, Tracerlab made an examination of the Northway and McVey residences and discovered substantial amounts of radioactivity both in their homes and on their clothing. This evidence was offered, so plaintiffs argue, to rebut the thrust of the defense which they viewed to be the claim that plaintiffs were not exposed to a <em>sufficient amount </em>of radioactivity to cause them injury. Defendant contends that this is an erroneous view of its position. Defendant\u2019s claim is that it defended on two main grounds: 1) the alleged incident on March 13, 1957 never occurred, and 2) the injuries of which plaintiffs complain are not the result of exposure to radiation. The district judge ruled in favor of the defendant. \u201cI think the objection that it was not brought up in the defendant\u2019 (sic) case is well founded. If it was evidence that you needed to support your case-in-chief, you should have put it on before you rested.\u201d We agree with the district judge that the substance of the defense was as appellee, defendant, argues, and that the proffered evidence was not proper rebuttal. In any event, we cannot hold that the district judge abused his discretion in barring its admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Plaintiffs, appellants next charge that the district court erred in \u201cinstructing the jury to consider only appellants\u2019 exposure to radiation which occurred on March 13,1957, and in refusing to permit the jury to consider any subsequent <em>exposures </em>to radiation proximately resulting from the incident of March 13,1957.\u201d The jury\u2019s question was as follows: \u201cWe wish to know under Interrogatory No. 1(a) if alleged injury must have occurred on March 13, 1957 only, or if subsequent exposures due to the March 13th incident are to be considered. C. C. Anderson, Foreman.\u201d The court invited counsels' comments and considerable discussion between bench and bar took place before the court read the following answer to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">\u201cThis suit is based on an alleged incident occurring March 13, 1957 when two radioactive pellets upon opening the reactor can became pulverized and contaminated the air as radioactive dust. You should limit your consideration to the exposure to radiation on March 13, 1957 <em>and the injuries resulting from such exposure even though the symptoms of such exposure may have become manifest later.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-9\">\u201cYou may not consider radiation resulting from an <em>incident </em>occurring on any other date.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">This answer made clear that the jury could consider all <em>injuries </em>proximately caused by the March 13 incident. It is not at all clear that in charging the jury, \u201cYou may not consider radiation resulting from an incident occurring on any other date,\u201d the judge meant to answer the question of the jury to the effect that \u201cyou may not consider subsequent exposures due to the March 13th incident.\u201d If, however, we go with the plaintiffs to the extent of so assuming, we must still hold that, under the evidence in this case, the charge was correct. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged only the one massive exposure as the direct and proximate cause of their injuries.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And any expo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>sures subsequent to March 13 would have been due solely to the negligence of the plaintiffs, who could have been subject to continued exposure only if they had failed to decontaminate themselves in clear violation of the Kellogg safety rules or exposed themselves to a contaminated laboratory without wearing the protective garments for which Kellogg\u2019s safety rules provided. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Plaintiffs, appellants\u2019 third point alleges error in the admission of two written exhibits. The first was the form used by M. W. Kellogg Company to order the irradiation by Phillips of the pellets involved in this case. The form was prescribed by the Atomic Energy Commission. Plaintiffs claim that the numerous disclaimer of liability provisions in the document misled the jury in determining what standard of care Phillips was required to meet. In part VI of their complaint, plaintiffs charge Phillips with breach of implied warranty. The order form in question was admissible to show the terms and conditions on which Phillips dealt with Kellogg and, more specifically, that no implied warranty could exist under the terms of the contract.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The other document was Kellogg\u2019s application to the Atomic Energy Commission to receive radioactive materials. On the back were printed essentially the same disclaimers of liability on the part of the Government that were present in the Kellogg-Phillips contract. The defendant says this document was admissible in answer to plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that Kellogg was not duly licensed to receive radioisotopes. This allegation was met, however, by the introduction of Kellogg\u2019s license. In the case of the application for the license as distinct from the order form, we think the prejudicial effect of the disclaimer provisions in misleading the jury as to Phillips\u2019 legal duty outweighed any probative value the document had in the case. Thus, we think its admission was error. But, in view of the more than 150 exhibits introduced in the case, and the fact that the trial lasted more than a <em>month, </em>resulting in nearly 2800 typewritten pages of testimony, we think that error was so diluted as to be harmless within the meaning of Rule 61, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Plaintiffs, appellants\u2019 final point is that the district court erred in entering judgment on a conflicting jury verdict. The alleged conflict is between the jury\u2019s answers to Interrogatories One (a) and Four (a) and Interrogatories Eight and Nine.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">\n<em>\u201cInterrogatory No. One:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-9\">\u201c(a) Do you find that Jackson E.

E. Northway for his pecuniary loss, physical pain and suffering and mental anguish which he has sustained and in reasonable probability will sustain in the future as a direct and proximate result of the accident made the basis of this suit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">\u201cYou will answer in dollars and cents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-9\">\u201cAnswer: $5,000.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">A special verdict must, of course, be construed in the light of the surrounding circumstances, including the instructions of the court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> How this apparent inconsistency, so obvious to the legally trained mind, came about is not difficult to explain. After the jury had adjourned from the courtroom to commence its deliberations, its foreman sent a note to the district judge with the following question: \u201cIf 1(a) were answered \u2018no\u2019 would it be possible or in order to list some sum of money in No. 8.\u201d The district judge replied that \u201cunder the instructions that you should not consider the effects of your answers, I think 8 and 9 should be answered.\u201d Actually, the particular instruction, when considered in the light of the jury\u2019s question, permitted the jury to return answers which were apparently inconsistent with each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\"> It is the duty of the court to reconcile or harmonize the answers with each other, if that can reasonably be done.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Interrogatories 1(a) and 4(a) are plain and unambiguous. Judgment for the defendant could properly be entered on the answers to those interrogatories, for it is elementary that absent a showing of injury plaintiffs, appellants, had no claim entitling them to relief.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On the other hand, judgment for plaintiffs could not have been entered on the answers to Interrogatories Eight and Nine. For, although those interrogatories deal with compensation for injuries proximately resulting from the \u201caccident made the basis of this suit,\u201d the element of negligence is nowhere mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-18\">Moreover, unlike Interrogatories 1(a) and 4(a), Interrogatories Eight and Nine were ambiguous and easily misunderstood. For example, \u201cthe accident made the basis of this suit,\u201d as used in those interrogatories, could have been taken by the jury to mean repeated daily exposure to radioactivity first let loose around March 13. So construed, the jury\u2019s view of plaintiffs\u2019 injuries need not be confined to those caused by radiation on March 13, 1957. We think that such must have been the understanding of the jury in view of the district court\u2019s permission for them \u201cto list some sum of money in No. 8,\u201d even though \u201c1(a) were answered \u2018no.\u2019 \u201d In McVey\u2019s case, there is clear evidence that the jury had some such understanding, for it returned a \u201cqualification and explanation\u201d of its answer to Interrogatory No. 1(a) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-19\">\u201cQualifications and Explanations \u201cInterrogatory No. 1(a)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-20\">\u201cThe Jury feels that Jackson E. McVey did not receive enough radiation on March 13, 1957, to cause injury, but that subsequent exposures, due to the March 13th incident, plus an accumulation of prior exposures, were sufficient to cause some injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4W\">Under all of the circumstances, we agree with the district court that the intent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>the jury is reasonably clear, and that the inconsistency in their answers is more apparent than real.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">We find no reversible error in the record and the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"AGZ\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-14\">.
