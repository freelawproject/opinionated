Miller and Bazelon, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b170-25\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b170-26\">Appellant was indicted, tried and convicted for narcotics violations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The circumstances are that, upon the basis of a purchase of narcotics from a man named Hill, the police obtained a search warrant for certain premises. Executing the warrant, the police found our appellant, Hawkins, in a bathroom at the rear of the second floor. Narcotics parapher<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>nalia were on the bathroom window sill. An envelope containing heroin was thrown out of a rear second-story window, apparently the bathroom window, at or about the time the officers made their entry. Hawkins was arrested and within the next few minutes signed his initials on the envelope containing the narcotics. Police officers testified that at the same time he confessed to the ownership of the narcotics; at the trial Hawkins denied this.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">On this appeal Hawkins argues in his brief that the search warrant was invalid, because the affidavit upon which it was issued was insufficient; that the oral confessions should have been denied admission; that the evidence of the Government rebutted the statutory presumption arising from possession; that the court erred in permitting cross-examination of the defendant on the use of drugs; that the evidence was insufficient to corroborate his confessions; and that the evidence as a whole was insufficient to support the verdict. In addition to the points discussed in his brief appellant also urges that the punishments meted out to him are cruel and unusual and therefore invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\"> We think the search warrant was valid. The affidavit filed in support of the application was in detail and recited facts sufficient to justify a prudent police officer and the magistrate in believing that narcotics and narcotics paraphernalia were on the premises named. Appellant says that he was coerced into putting his initials on the envelope and in his alleged oral confessions. This issue was put to the jury under proper instructions. The question of whether the narcotics in the envelope thrown from the bathroom window had or had not been in the possession of the defendant was a question of fact, the evidence as to which was at least sufficient to go to the jury</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">Hawkins argues that the Government\u2019s evidence rebuts the presumption flowing from possession.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> His course of reasoning is that mere possession is not a crime; self-use of drugs is not a crime; possession is made a statutory presumption of purchase, sale or concealment; therefore, if the evidence shows the possession to have been for the purpose of self-use, the statutory presumption is rebutted. He fortifies his argument by the fact that the Government shows that at least two other occupants of the premises were drug users. He says that the evidence makes clear that he himself did use, instead of sell, any drugs coming into his possession, and that the free availability of drugs on the premises would make purchase unnecessary. One answer dispositive of this argument is that the Government did not rest its case upon the statutory presumption, but rather rested it upon the' facts shown by the evidence concerning the envelope, the admissions by the defendant, and the incidents of the search and the arrest. Even if the statutory presumption be deemed to have been rebutted, the affirmative evidence remained. It is to be kept in mind that the indictment was for purchase and concealment as well as for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">The argument in respect to cruel and unusual punishment rests in major part upon appellant\u2019s alleged possession solely for the purpose of personal use and the severity of the sentences required by the statute. He relies principally upon Petite v. United States,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but that case does not apply here. It dealt with multiple prosecutions, and the statement of policy by the Government, upon which the Court acted, included the premise \u201cthat several offenses arising out of a single transaction should be alleged and tried together\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The case at bar is not a multiple prosecution but involves several offenses arising out of the same or related transactions,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and they were al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>leged and tried together in two counts of the same indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Despite the earnest presentation by distinguished counsel, acting by appointment of the court, we find no error, and the judgment must be</p>\n<p id=\"Abz\">Affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b172-5\">BAZELON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">I reluctantly concur in the result reached by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">For me this case is troubling in two respects: First, from all that appears in this record, appellant is nothing more than an unfortunate addict, with a \u201ctragic dependency on drugs\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and no prior record of convictions \u2014 narcotics or otherwise. The statutory' presumptions that make virtually every possessor of narcotics a \u201cpusher,\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> have caught appellant in a web of legislation, which is primarily designed to deter and punish professional peddlers and \u201ctraffickers\u201d in narcotics.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Unfortunately, these statutes, which impose severe mandatory penalties that can neither be suspended nor diminished by probation or parole, are not calculated to provide \u201cthe medical and rehabilitative treatment\u201d which Congress recognized as essential \u201cto relieve [addicts] of their tragic dependency on drugs and to restore them to a constructive status in society.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-16\">As Judge Edgerton has pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap\">This legal situation troubles many judges. One writes: \u201cI have found myself helpless in spite of my distaste for being the instrument in sending away for ten years a poor wretch who for the third time has been caught peddling a small amount of narcotics in order to avoid the horrible convulsions which seize the addict who does not meet the demands of his drug-accustomed body.\u201d Mr. James V. Bennett, Director of the United States Bureau of Prisons, writes: \u201cI have attended a number of circuit conferences during the past year and * * * have talked to a number of Federal judges, and none of them have expressed to me anything but the sense of frustration they feel when they are confronted with the necessity of sentencing a narcotics violator.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>The second thing that troubles me about this case is that appellant\u2019s court-appointed counsel raises a number of points on this appeal which were not properly saved for review. And much of the evidence underlying some of these points was not sufficiently developed for us to say whether they involve plain error \u201caffecting substantial rights\u201d which we may notice under Rule 52(b), Fed.R.Crim.P., 18 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">For example, appellant now complains that his oral admissions and incriminating behavior were coerced and should have been excluded under McNabb v. United States, 1943, 318 U.S. 332, 63 5. Ct. 608, 87 L.Ed. 819. He argues, in the alternative, that his admissions were submitted to the jury without adequate instructions concerning their voluntariness.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The police testified that appellant admitted purchasing the drugs the night before and throwing them out of the bathroom window when the police arrived. The Government also introduced into evidence an envelope containing narcotics which bore appellant\u2019s initials. Appellant testified that he was forced to initial the envelope through physical coercion, and that his admissions of purchase, if any, were also the product of police brutality.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He said that the officers took him off the toilet, stripped him naked and led him into another room. Shortly thereafter the officers led him, now clothed in his underwear, to another room where they hit him with their fists on his head, stomach and chest. Subsequently, they allegedly led him to the kitchen where they knocked his head against the wall until he agreed to initial the envelope containing narcotics. Appellant also claimed he sustained a bruise on his forehead and that one of the officers at the police station observed this and asked if he were \u201ca fighter ?\u201d His testimony was corroborated by a neighbor who testified that, from her back yard, she saw \u201ctwo officers had him holding him up to the window holding his arms up,\u201d and that she heard appellant \u201cyell,\u201d \u201cOh, don\u2019t hit me any more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">The officers denied that they struck or otherwise abused appellant. Since there is a conflict in the testimony, the Government contends that the issue of coercion was for the jury. Catoe v. United States, 1942, 76 U.S.App.D.C. 292, 131 F.2d 16. It also contends that we cannot reach the question of whether the admissions were involuntary as a matter of law since appellant\u2019s counsel did not object to their introduction into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">Assuming we can reach this question, notwithstanding appellant\u2019s failure to object, I cannot say, in view of the conflicting testimony in the present record, that the admissions are involuntary as a matter of law. Wright v. United States, 1957, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 36, 45, 250 F.2d 4, 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">But I am sadly constrained to note that, notwithstanding the substantial corroboration of appellant\u2019s testimony, neither the prosecution nor the defense sought to ventilate the issue of coercion by (1) inquiring whether appellant was ever informed of his right to remain silent and (2) calling witnesses who could either corroborate or discredit the evidence of coercion. There were approximately ten other persons in the house at the time of the arrest who would, presumably, have also heard appellant\u2019s loud protestations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Similarly, there must have been persons available who could substantiate or rebut the testimony that appellant sustained a noticeable bruise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>on his head. I am unable to understand why both the prosecution and the defense would leave such obvious stones unturned in an effort to convincingly rebut or buttress the appellant\u2019s corroborated version of police brutality.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Since we do not know what this evidence would have shown, we cannot reverse. But the seriousness of these omissions is demonstrated by Hamilton v. United States, 1944, 78 U.S.App.D.C. 316, 140 F.2d 679, 680. There appellant\u2019s conviction for soliciting for the purposes of prostitution rested \u201csolely on the unsupported word of the arresting officer against the unsupported word of the appellant.\u201d We pointed out that, although \u201cit is the kind of ease in which a careful prosecutor should offer corroborating testimony if the record shows it to exist,\u201d neither side \u201cnor the trial judge saw fit\u201d to call readily available witnesses who \u201cmight have partially corroborated, or impeached, the arresting officer\u2019s version of the incident * * *.\" Appellant subsequently submitted affidavits from eye witnesses corroborating her version and requested a new trial on the grounds of newly discovered evidence. We reversed the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Appellant also contends that, even if the evidence of coercion were for the jury, it was submitted under faulty instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The trial judge properly charged the jury that \u201cthe Court doesn\u2019t admit in evidence any statement or any act which is the result of coercion.\u201d But when he elaborated this rule and applied it to the evidence, he only spoke of the defendant\u2019s act of initialing the envelope. He made no reference to the oral admissions. I cannot ignore the possibility that this may have misled the jury. It may have assumed that the voluntariness of the admissions was not in issue, and that appellant\u2019s incriminating statements were therefore voluntary as a matter of law. Thus the oral confession could have provided sufficient basis for conviction even if the jury found the initialed envelope involuntary and excluded it from consideration. Or, equally plausibly, the jury, believing the admissions to be voluntary as a matter of law, could have found the initialing also voluntary as a matter of fact, simply because it thought the circumstances underlying the admissions were much the same as those underlying the initialing.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">But since appellant\u2019s counsel not only failed to request the trial court to instruct the jury on the issue of voluntariness of appellant\u2019s admissions but expressed satisfaction to the charge as delivered, the issue is beyond our reach.
