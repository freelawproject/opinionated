Brown when she died, and that therefore he is entitled to be the administrator of her estate, James Blair petitioned the District Court to vacate its order granting letters of administration to David E. Sloan, and to appoint him in Sloan\u2019s stead. Sloan denied that a common law marriage had ever been contracted.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-22\">On conflicting evidence as to that issue, the District Court concluded there had been no common law marriage and dismissed the petition. We cannot say the conclusion was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
