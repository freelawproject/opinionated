The District Court held a hearing, agreed with the Patent Office that the claims were not inventive, and dismissed the complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-24\">\u201cAlthough a court, when it agrees with a Patent Office finding, often says so, agreement is not necessary to affirmance and disagreement is not sufficient for reversal.\u201d Abbott v. Coe, 71 App.D.C. 195, 197, 109 F.2d 449, 451. \u201cSince invention is a question of fact, a reasonable finding that claims lack invention should not be set aside.\u201d Besser v. Ooms, 81 U.S.App.D.C. 7, 8, 154 F.2d 17, 18. \u201cAs we pointed out in Abbott v. Coe, * * * a mere preponderance of the evidence is not sufficient with regard to invention; the Patent Office finding must be accepted if it is 'consistent with the evidence,\u2019 the Patent Office being an expert body pre-eminently qualified to determine questions of this kind.\u201d Esso Standard Oil Co. v. Sun Oil Co., 97 U.S.App.D.C. 154, 157, 229 F.2d 37, 40. The Patent Office findings do not appear to have been unreasonable. The District Court was therefore right in dismissing the complaints. Moreover, its findings are not to be set aside unless clearly erroneous. F.R.Civ.P. Rule 52 (a), 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
