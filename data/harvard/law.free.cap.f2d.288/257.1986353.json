The defendant is a manufacturer of combs. Prior to 1950, defendant manufactured all its combs by the sulphur vulcanizing method. Under this process rubber and sulphur are vulcanized under heat, resulting in a product recognized as \u201crubber\u201d or \u201chard rubber\u201d (hereafter both will be referred to as rubber). Until that time the defendant properly labeled its combs rubber. In 1950 defendant changed its manufacturing process to the injection mold type, which necessitated a change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>in the type of compound used to Kralastic D, a patented material made by the United States Rubber Company which was composed of approximately 13% nitrile rubber, 85% hardening resin and small percentages of stabilizer and color. Notwithstanding this change, the defendant continued to label its combs rubber. A complaint was instituted by the Federal Trade Commission and after extended hearings,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the following Cease and Desist Order was entered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfK\">\u201cIt Is Ordered that respondent, Vulcanized Rubber &amp; Plastics Company, a corporation, and its officers, agents, representatives, and employees, directly or through any corporate or other device, in connection with the offering for sale, sale and distribution in commerce, as \u2018commerce\u2019 is defined in the Federal Trade Commission Act, of any combs designed for use on human hair, to forthwith <em>cease and desist from representing, directly or by implication, </em>by any advertisement, packaging, ' labeling, branding, stamping, or other marking or indication <em>that such combs are \u2018rubber\u2019 or \u2018hard rubber\u2019 or made of \u2018rubber\u2019 or \u2018hard rubber\u2019 unless such combs are in fact made of vulcanized hard rubber.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">A petition for review was then filed with the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Vulcanized Rubber &amp; Plastics Company v. Federal Trade Commission, 103 U.S.App.D.C. 384, 258 F.2d 684. Prior to action thereon by that court, the defendant filed a compliance report with the Commission stating that it would forthwith label its combs rubber-resin. The Commission rejected this. The defendant moved and was granted leave to amend' its pending petition for review. This amendment informed the court of the Commission\u2019s interpretation and contended that it exceeded the bounds established by the complaint, findings and Order. In a per curiam opinion dismissing the petition for review, the court stated at 258 F.2d 685:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-9\">\u201cWe do not understand the order <em>as written </em>to be challenged, but only the Commission\u2019s subsequent interpretation of its order. However, this interpretation may be changed or it may never be enforced. We hold that there is no controversy calling for judicial review of the interpretation at the present time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">Subsequently, the defendant filed another compliance report with the Commission, still asserting the right to label its combs rubber-resin. The Commission rejected this and instituted the present action for violation of the Order and recovery of civil penalties. The district court on cross motions for summary judgment found for the plaintiff and fixed the penalty at $6,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>The precise issue to be determined in this appeal is whether the defendant by labeling its combs rubber-resin violated the Commission\u2019s cease and desist Order. Federal Trade Commission v. Morton Salt Co., 1948, 334 U.S. 37, 54, 68 S.Ct. 822, 92 L.Ed. 1196.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Defendant\u2019s principal argument is that the labeling of its combs as being made of rubber-resin, does not fall within the scope of the Commission\u2019s Order. Necessarily defendant urges that the Order, only prohibits it from labeling combs rubber, and that until there is a hearing by the Commission and a cease and desist order issued <em>specifically </em>prohibiting defendant from labeling its combs rubber-resin, an action for civil penalties cannot be maintained. We' feel that the language of the order and the background of administrative hearings in this case completely refutes defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The Hearing Examiner found that the term rubber had a fixed and definite meaning. It was used to describe a distinct process whereby rubber and sulphur are vulcanized under heat. In the administrative proceeding, defendant contended that although the term rubber was recognized as being descriptive of those ingredients and that process, the term had acquired a secondary meaning broad enough to include defendant\u2019s product which did not contain sulphur, was not vulcanized and only contained a small percentage of nitrile rubber. The Hearing Examiner disallowed this argument, and in his findings, which were adopted by the Commission, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-11\">\u201cThe gist of this \u25a0 proceeding is whether or not the representations of respondent in its advertising and labeling or branding of combs that are made of Kralastic D as \u2018Hard Rubber\u2019 or \u2018Rubber\u2019 are false, misleading and deceptive. It is found that they are false, misleading and deceptive as these combs are not made or composed of rubber or hard rubber but are made or composed in large part of materials other than rubber or hard rubber and do not contain any sulphur and are not made by the vulcanization process but are admittedly made by the injection mold or extrusion process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">The final Order drafted in light of the entire record, was designed to eliminate defendant\u2019s labeling practice both presently and in the future. Additionally, the Order not only prohibited the specific direct representations that the combs were made of rubber, but also prohibited any representation which <em>\u201cby implication\u201d </em>so represented the product <em>\u201cunless such combs are in fact made of vulcanized hard rubber.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis supplied). The labeling of the combs as being made of rubber-resin falls within this latter proscription of the Order. United States v. Piuma, D.C.S.D.Cal.1941, 40 F.Supp. 119, affirmed sub nom, Piuma v. United States, 9 Cir., 1942, 126 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>F.2d 601; In re Whitney &amp; Company, 9 Cir., 1959, 273 F.2d 211. It impliedly represents the combs to be made by a vulcanizing process which contains rubber and sulphur, when in fact the combs do not contain the ingredients nor are they produced by the process found by the Commission to be necessary to permit such labeling. Cf. Arrow Metal Products Corp. v. Federal Trade Comm., 3 Cir., 1957, 249 F.2d 83; Masland Duraleather Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 3 Cir., 1929, 34 F.2d 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">In the Piuma ease supra, the defendant was ordered to cease and desist from, among other things, representing <em>directly </em>or <em>indirectly </em>that his product was \u201ca gland tonic\u201d [40 F.Supp. 120] and that it was \u201cthe best gland remedy known.\u201d After a purported compliance by the defendant, the government instituted an action to recover civil penalties to which the defendant interposed the defense, inter alia, that he had changed certain language in the representation. The court made short shrift of the argument stating at page 123 of 40 F.Supp.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-1\">\u201cThe substitution of \u2018gland tablet\u2019 for \u2018gland tonic\u2019 or \u2018one of the best gland remedies known\u2019 for \u2018the best gland <em>remedy known\u2019 does not </em>materially change the nature of the representations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">In re Whitney &amp; Company, supra, [273 F.2d 212] is another example of effective enforcement of a Commission cease and desist order. The Order prohibited Whitney from:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">\u201cPaying or granting, <em>directly or </em>indirectly, to any buyer, anything of value as a commission or brokerage, or any compensation, allowance or discount in lieu thereof, upon purchases made for such buyer\u2019s own account.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">The Order was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals and that court directed compliance. Subsequently, Whitney sought to circumvent the Order by buying salmon for its own account at a price which contained a brokerage fee deduction and then reselling the salmon at a <em>price which </em>allowed as a discount, part of Whitney\u2019s brokerage fees. In holding this transaction was \u201can indirect grant of a discount in lieu of a commission or brokerage\u201d and therefore violated the Order, the court stated at page 214 of 273 F.2d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-9\">\u201cThe course followed by Whitney was a transparent attempt to circumvent the cease and desist order here in question. If persons subject to such orders were enabled to escape their effect by following such a course, these orders would be largely ineffective and unenforceable. <em>It was to preclude subterfuges of this kind that the order here in question expressly forbade indirect as well as direct discounts in lieu of a commission or brokerage to persons buying for their own account.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">Such is the situation in the case at bar. The defendant has attempted by a colorable compliance with the Commission\u2019s Order to frustrate its mandate. The substitution of the compound word \u201crubber-resin\u201d for \u201crubber\u201d on a product which is not produced with the ingredients and by the process held by the Commission to be the only recognized method to produce \u201crubber\u201d is as much a violation of the Order as if defendant had continued to label its combs \u201crubber\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b306-6\">. Tile record of the hearings encompasses 3,720 pages, together with approximately 200 exhibits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b306-7\">. Since there was no issue of fact presented, the district court properly disposed of the case on summary judgment. We note, however, a prior case in the District Court for the District of New Jersey, United States v. Hindman, 1960, 179 F.Supp. 926, where the court held an issue of fact was presented in the following circumstances. An action was brought to recover civil penalties under Section 5(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 45(1). Under the Commission\u2019s Order, the defendant was directed to \u201ccease and desist from representing, directly or indirectly: * * * that the military clothing offered for sale or sold, or any of it is custom made * * Subsequently, the defendant changed his label to read \u201ccustom-tailo'red.\u201d The court held at page 928: \u201cA jury trial will occur on the limited issue as to whether or not the label term \u2018custom-tailored\u2019 on defendant\u2019s uniforms <em>means to their purchasers </em>that they are \u2018custom-made\u2019 \u201d. (Emphasis supplied). The holding was erroneous, since the sole issue before the court was whether or not the labeling practice was within the proscription of the order and not whether the labeling practice was deceptive. United States v. Piuma, D.C.S.D.Cal.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>1941, 40 F.Supp. 119, 122-123, affirmed sub nom Piuma v. United States, 9 Cir., 1942, 126 F.2d 601. Moreover, creating an issue of fact as the court did in Hindman, would usurp the function exclusively vested by Congress in the Federal Trade Commission to determine the issue of whether a labeling practice is misleading or deceptive to the public.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b307-8\">. The scope of the Order prohibiting direct as well as implied representations that the combs were made of rubber, was warranted by the record and consonant with the legislative objects of the Federal Trade Commission Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">\u201cOrders of the Federal Trade Commission are not intended to impose criminal punishment or exact compensatory damages for past acts, but to prevent illegal practices in the future. In carrying out this function the Commission is not limited to prohibiting the illegal practice in the precise form in which it is found to have existed in the past. <em>If the Commission is to attain the objectives Congress envisioned, it cannot be required to confine its road block to the narrow lane the transgressor has traveled; it must be allowed effectively to close all roads to the prohibited goal, so that its order may not be by-passed with impunity.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied). Federal Trade Commission v. Ruberoid Co., 1951, 343 U.S. 470, 473, 72 S.Ct. 800, 803, 96 L.Ed. 1081.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b308-12\">HASTIE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AvF\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"AE3\">A restatement of the course of the administrative and judicial proceedings in this controversy is necessary to make clear the basis of my disagreement with the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-13\">Pursuant to an appropriate complaint, a hearing examiner of the Federal Trade Commission conducted a lengthy inquiry addressed to the question whether defendant Vulcanized Rubber &amp; Plastics Co. was deceiving the public by labeling combs of its manufacture as \u201crubber\u201d or \u201chard rubber\u201d when the combs were in fact made of a patented compound con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>taining 13% synthetic rubber, 85% resin and 2% coloring. The government\u2019s evidence indicated that the names \u201crubber\u201d and \u201chard rubber\u201d meant and connoted vulcanized hard rubber and nothing else. The compound used by defendant was described in its patent and in this proceeding as \u201crubber-resin\u201d. Indeed, in the report of the hearing examiner, whose findings were adopted by the Commission, the designation \u201crubber-resin\u201d is used twice to describe the material of defendant\u2019s combs. There was not even an intimation in the record that such a designation was either inaccurate or deceptive. It was solely the use of the labels \u201crubber\u201d and \u201chard rubber\u201d which was challenged as misleading. Concluding that such designation would mislead the public, the Commission ordered the defendant to cease and desist \u201cfrom representing, directly or by implication * * * that such combs are \u2018rubber\u2019 or \u2018hard rubber\u2019 or made of \u2018rubber\u2019 or \u2018hard rubber\u2019 unless such combs are of fact made of vulcanized hard rubber\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">In the light of the matter actually litigated and the recognition by the hearing examiner that defendant\u2019s combs were in fact \u201crubber-resin\u201d, it is significant that in the Commission\u2019s order the words \u201crubber\u201d and \u201chard rubber\u201d are placed within quotation marks. This is an additional indication that the proceeding was solely concerned with and directed at the use of the designations \u201crubber\u201d and \u201chard rubber\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Such being the circumstances and the apparent coverage of the Commission\u2019s cease and desist order, the defendant, after receiving the order, apprised the Commission that it was complying with its mandate by designating and describing its combs as \u201crubber-resin\u201d. The Commission replied that it rejected this report and considered the designation \u201crubber-resin\u201d a violation of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">The defendant then sought a judicial ruling on this controversy by filing its petition to review the cease and desist order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In issue were the scope and effect of the order and whether the restraint it imposed was warranted by the complaint and record before the Commission. After hearing, the court filed a per curiam decision dismissing the appeal. Vulcanized Rubber &amp; Plastics Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 1958, 103 U.S.App.D.C. 384, 258 F.2d 684. In so doing it distinguished the Commission\u2019s \u201cinterpretation\u201d from the order \u201cas written\u201d, stated that defendant\u2019s quarrel was with the former rather than the latter, and refused to adjudicate that controversy. Analytically, this unusual ruling must have been based upon an intermediate conclusion that the order \u201cas written\u201d did not make illegal the use of the designation \u201crubber-resin\u201d for the defendant\u2019s combs. For obviously, if it did, the petition challenged the order \u201cas written\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Thereafter, the Commission brought the present action in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for civil penalties and obtained a decision that defendant\u2019s use of \u201crubber-resin\u201d violates the very order which the District of Columbia Court of Appeals had examined and found not even to have been challenged in the controversy over the use of \u201crubber-resin\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">Thus, the defendant is now in this position. It is held to have violated an order by using a label \u2014 \u201crubber-resin\u201d \u2014which under the ruling of the District of Columbia court was not forbidden by the order as written. Moreover, the defendant, which never had an opportunity before the Commission or on direct appeal from its order to have a hearing on the question whether the description \u201crubber-resin\u201d suggests some vulcanized hard rubber content or is otherwise de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>ceptive, cannot have that issue litigated now because this is a collateral proceeding in which merely the meaning of the order, rather than its justification on the administrative record, can be litigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Administrative and judicial processes should not combine to impose such a dilemma upon a party. I see no way to solve this problem fairly except to hold that the ruling of the court below was inconsistent with the decision of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and, therefore, precluded by it. This would make it necessary for the Commission to challenge the defendant\u2019s use of \u201crubber-resin\u201d as deceptive in a new administrative proceeding, thus affording the defendant for the first time an opportunity to contest that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Accordingly, I would reverse the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b309-6\">. The amended petition for review alleged that the Commission\u2019s cease and desist \u201corder is arbitrary and capricious in that it prohibits petitioner from representing that combs sold and distributed by it * * * are \u2018rubber-resin\u2019 when such is the fact.\u201d Opposing that position, the Commission did not dispute the alleged coverage of the order, but rather defended the prohibition of the designation \u201crubber-resin\u201d as proper.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
