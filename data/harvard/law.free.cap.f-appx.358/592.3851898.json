After de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>parting upward one criminal history level to a Criminal History Category of VI and four offense levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, the district court sentenced Butler to 48 months in prison. Had the district court not imposed the upward departure, Butler faced a guideline range of 24 to 30 months. Butler contends that his sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">When reviewing sentences, \u201cthis court must first consider whether the district court made a significant procedural error. If no procedural error exists, the court then considers the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard, irrespective of whether the sentence falls within the Guidelines range.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Butler focuses his appeal on procedural unreasonableness \u2014 maintaining that the district court failed to consider all the factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in imposing the enhancement. Butler further complains that his sentence is not proportionate to those received by his codefendants, in violation of \u00a7 3553(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Butler did not raise any of his challenges to the upward departure in the district court, so we review his claims for plain error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For plain error, the appellant must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If the appellant makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-15\">The sentencing guidelines allow a district court to depart upwardly or downwardly based on the inadequacy of the criminal history category.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This court has noted that, because \u201cthe court\u2019s authority to depart derives from the Guidelines themselves, a sentence supported by a departure is ... a \u2018Guideline sentence.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We review for abuse of discretion when \u201cevaluating both a decision to depart and the extent of the departure.... In assessing the extent of a departure, we continue to look to our <em>Tpace-Booker </em>case law for guidance.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The district court does not abuse its discretion when upwardly departing \u201cif the court\u2019s reasons for departing 1) advance the objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2) and 2) are justified by the facts of the ease.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-16\">The district court in this case followed U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 when determining the sentencing range and gave a more-than-sufficient explanation for its decision up<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>wardly to depart. Indeed, the court based its sentence on the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), including Butler\u2019s history and characteristics, the need to promote respect for the law, the need for adequate deterrence, and the need to protect the public from future crimes by Butler. The district court focused on Butler\u2019s multiple prior felony convictions, which \u2014 as in this case \u2014 involved committing theft by check. The court also considered Butler\u2019s habit of unsuccessfully completing probation and parole terms. Because the upward departure under \u00a7 4A1.3 advanced the objectives in \u00a7 3553(a) and is justified by the facts of the case, the district court did not commit reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Butler further argues that the district court procedurally erred by giving him a longer sentence than his co-conspirators. He claims that the court did not follow the guidance of 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(6), which admonishes district judges to consider \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d Butler had two partners in crime, and he alleges that they received lower sentences than he did. Butler, though, has not shown that those defendants had \u201csimilar records.\u201d In fact, the appellate record in this case says nothing about the reasons for the other criminals\u2019 sentences. We have held in a persuasive unpublished opinion that we should uphold the district court\u2019s sentence where \u201c[t]he record is silent regarding the reasons for [the prisoner\u2019s] co-defendant\u2019s sentence and whether the defendants are similarly situated with respect to criminal history and circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The district court here did not reversibly err.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Even if the district court had committed a procedural error \u2014 which it did not \u2014 Butler\u2019s case comes before us on plain error review, and he cannot satisfy the third prong. Specifically, he has not described \u2014 much less proved \u2014 how a better explanation would have changed his 48-month sentence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Butler does not on appeal specifically address the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, nor did he object at trial to the length of the sentence. Under the totality of the circumstances in this case\u2014 and particularly in light of the policy statements of \u00a7 3553(a) \u2014 nothing indicates that Butler\u2019s 48-month sentence is anything but reasonable, and the sentence is within the scope of departures previously upheld by this court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b618-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
