Weaver, </em>367 F.3d 337, 346 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc) (quoting <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 530, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985)) (brackets in Kinney). \u201cStated differently, in an interlocutory appeal we cannot challenge the district court\u2019s assessments regarding the sufficiency of the evidence-that is, the question whether there is enough evidence in the record for a jury to conclude that certain facts are true.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 346-47. Instead, we \u201cconsider only whether the district court erred in assessing the legal significance of the conduct that the district court deemed sufficiently supported for purposes of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348 (citing <em>Behrens v. Pelletier, </em>516 U.S. 299, 313, 116 S.Ct. 834, 133 L.Ed.2d 773 (1996); <em>Johnson v. Jones, </em>515 U.S. 304, 313, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995)). Nevertheless, \u201c[w]here, as here, the admissibility of particular evidence is critical to a summary judgment founded on qualified immunity, this court has not hesitated to review the admissibility of the evidence on appeal.\u201d <em>Mersch v. City of Dallas, Tex., </em>207 F.3d 732, 735 (5th Cir.2000) (reversing district court\u2019s denial of qualified immunity on summary judgment when it was solely based on inadmissible evidence) (citing <em>Hayter v. City of Mount Vernon, </em>154 F.3d 269, 274 (5th Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">In the instant case, the district court concluded that Gaston, who was Supervisor of Booking at the detention center where Miller was held, did not personally engage in the constitutional deprivations allegedly committed against Miller, nor did Gaston have any knowledge of them. The district court, however, concluded that a genuine issue of fact existed over whether Gaston violated 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 by failing to properly supervise his deputies who did allegedly abuse Miller. The court also found a genuine dispute of fact existed over whether Gaston conspired with others to deprive Miller of his civil rights under \u00a7 1985, and whether Gaston was otherwise liable under state law. The district court made these determinations based exclusively on Miller\u2019s deposition testimony. In his deposition, Miller stated that he heard other parties testify in an unrelated proceeding that Gaston allowed prisoner abuse by his deputies and that Gaston implemented his own policies of \u201cabuse\u201d and \u201ctorture.\u201d Miller further stated that Gaston\u2019s abusive practices were \u201ccommon knowledge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-11\">The evidence in Miller\u2019s deposition is hearsay that is not subject to any qualifying exception. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801(c) (defining hearsay as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>tifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted\u201d). As Miller\u2019s testimony regarding Gaston\u2019s alleged liability is hearsay, it is inadmissible for summary judgment purposes. <em>See Fowler v. Smith, </em>68 F.3d 124, 126 (5th Cir.1995) (\u201cEvidence on summary judgment may be considered to the extent not based on hearsay or other information excludable at trial.\u201d); <em>Duplantis v. Shell Offshore, Inc., </em>948 F.2d 187, 192 (5th Cir.1991) (\u201cMaterial that is inadmissible will not be considered on a motion for summary judgment because it would not establish a genuine issue of material fact if offered at trial and continuing the action would be useless.\u201d) (internal quotes and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Miller\u2019s deposition testimony is the only evidence the district court cites that implicates Gaston in Miller\u2019s alleged harm. Such evidence is therefore critical to the district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment. Indeed, \u201c[without that testimony, [Miller] has no case.\u201d <em>Mersch, </em>207 F.3d at 737. As this evidence is clearly inadmissible, the district court committed manifest error in denying Gaston summary judgment on his claim of qualified immunity. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Accordingly, we REVERSE the district court order denying judgment for the defendant Gaston and RENDER judgment in favor of Gaston.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">REVERSED and RENDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b600-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
