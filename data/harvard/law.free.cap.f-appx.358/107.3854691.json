Cano, a <em>pro se </em>federal prisoner, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition for habeas corpus. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">In 1998, Cano was convicted of 69 counts related to a nationwide cocaine and marijuana trafficking and money laundering network. The district court sentenced Cano to one mandatory life sentence, twelve concurrent life sentences, and fifty-six concurrent sentences of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment. Cano appealed to this Court, which vacated his conviction on one count of possession with intent to distribute marijuana and affirmed his convictions on the other 68 counts. <em>United States v. Cano, </em>289 F.3d 1354 (11th Cir.2002). In November 2004, Cano filed in the district court a motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. In October 2008, the district court denied Cano\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-17\">In July 2009, Cano filed this petition, which he purported to bring under the \u201c1940th edition of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 451 et seq.,\u201d sections of the United States Code predating 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241 and 2255. Cano argued for collateral relief on two grounds attacking the jurisdiction of the district court over his criminal prosecution. The district court construed Cano\u2019s filing as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition and dismissed it because Cano previously had been denied \u00a7 2255 relief and \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause did not apply. Cano filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-18\">Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). Under limited circumstances, however, a provision of \u00a7 2255 permits a federal prisoner to file a habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(a), 2255(e). That provision, known as the \u201csavings clause,\u201d permits a federal prisoner to file a \u00a7 2241 petition if an otherwise available remedy under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [a defendant\u2019s] detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-19\">When a prisoner previously has filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, he must apply for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>and receive permission from this Court before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3), 2255(h). Such restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions, standing alone, do not render that section \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d within the meaning of the savings clause. <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1245 (11th Cir.1999). Thus, the savings clause does not permit a prisoner to circumvent the requirements for filing a \u00a7 2255 motion merely by filing a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">In <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>this Court established that \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause applies only when: (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that decision established that the petitioner was convicted of a \u201cnonexistent offense\u201d; and (3) \u201ccircuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1244. In order for a petitioner to avail himself of the \u00a7 2241 remedy, all three <em>Wofford </em>criteria must be met. <em>See id. </em>at 1244. A petitioner may not argue issues raised in his petition until he has \u201copen[ed] the portal\u201d to \u00a7 2241 by demonstrating that the savings clause applies. <em>See id. </em>at 1244 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Here, Cano is precluded from seeking relief under \u00a7 2241 because \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause does not apply.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Cano already has filed a prior \u00a7 2255 motion that was denied. On appeal, Cano does not make any argument that his claims are based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision, much less one that might establish that he was convicted of nonexistent offenses. Thus, Cano has not satisfied the first prong of the <em>Wofford </em>test. Because Cano has not shown the applicability of \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause, we, like the district court before us, do not consider the merits of Cano\u2019s habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">Cano argues that he was entitled to a hearing on the merits because his claims involved jurisdictional defects that cannot be precluded. Under <em>Wofford, </em>even if a petitioner claims the district court lacked jurisdiction in the underlying criminal proceeding, the petitioner cannot avail himself of the \u00a7 2241 remedy unless the savings clause criteria are met. <em>See Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1238 (applying the <em>Wofford </em>criteria to a claim that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to impose petitioner\u2019s sentence). Thus, we do not address Cano\u2019s claims that the trial court lacked jurisdiction in his underlying criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">Because \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause does not apply, the district court properly dismissed Cano\u2019s habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b134-14\">. The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b135-7\">. We find meritless Cano\u2019s argument that \u00a7\u00a7 2241 and 2255 were invalidly enacted and, therefore, that the district court erred in construing his petition as one brought under \u00a7 2241.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
