The debtor-in-possession in each proceeding is an incorporated nursing home. In 1998, Thelma Algood, the founder and manager of these homes, borrowed $11 million from National Health Investors, Inc. (\u201cNHI\u201d). The loan was secured by the nursing homes\u2019 real property, their accounts receivable, the guarantee of Algood\u2019s husband, Thomas, and the Mlgoods\u2019 stock in the five nursing home corporations. The documents evidencing the loan and security agreements were later modified \u2014 in 1993, in 1994, and in 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-16\">In December 1998, the loan was restructured once again. The loan documents contained a merger clause which recited that the restructured agreement superceded and replaced all previous agreements and, further, a proviso stating that the nursing homes\u2019 \u201cMedicaid Receivables, Medicare Receivables or CHAMPUS Receivables or any other healthcare accounts\u201d were no longer part of the collateral securing the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-17\">After the nursing home corporations sought relief under Chapter 11, NHI commenced adversary proceedings against them, seeking to enjoin them from using the \u201cgovernment receivables\u201d referred to in the above proviso on the theory that it held a security interest in such receivables. Ruling on the parties\u2019 reciprocal motions for summary judgment, the bankruptcy court disagreed. Construing the security agreement, which NHI had prepared, the court concluded that the agreement expressly excluded government receivables <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>as collateral for NHI\u2019s loan. The court also rejected NHI\u2019s alternative request to reform the security agreement \u2014 effectively to eliminate the above proviso \u2014 on the ground of \u201cmutual mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">NHI appealed the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision to the district court. On February 13, 2006, the district court entered an order affirming that decision. NHI now appeals, contending that the bankruptcy court erred in holding that NHI had no security interest in the debtors\u2019 government receivables and (assuming that it had no such interest) in refusing to reform the security agreement to provide such interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">For the reasons stated by the bankruptcy court in its dispositive ruling and the district court in its February 13 order, we agree that the merger clause and the proviso at issue eliminated NHI\u2019s previous security interest in the debtors\u2019 government receivables and that NHI is not entitled to a reformation of the security agreement on the ground of mutual mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
