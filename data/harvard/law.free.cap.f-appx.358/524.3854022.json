Parker and Margaret A. Parker appeal their convictions for tax fraud and for failing to file tax returns, and for aiding and abetting each other in the same, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7203 and 7206(1). Thomas Parker argues that the evidence was not sufficient to support his conviction for tax fraud. Because Thomas Parker did not renew his motion for acquittal at the close of all the evidence, this court reviews the evidence only for a manifest miscarriage of justice, looking to whether the record is devoid of evidence of guilt. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>293 F.3d 886, 895 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">To support a conviction for filing a false tax return under \u00a7 7206(1), evidence must be sufficient to show that: (1) the defendant wilfully made and subscribed to a materially false tax return; (2) the return contained a written declaration that it was made under penalties of perjury; and (3) the defendant did not believe that the return was true as to every material matter. <em>United States v. Clayton, </em>506 F.3d 405, 410 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Parker argues only that he did not \u201cwillfully\u201d defraud the Government. Because Parker does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support the other \u00a7 7206(1) criteria, this court need not address the same. <em>See Greenlaw v. United States, </em>554 U.S. 237, 128 S.Ct. 2559, 2564, 171 L.Ed.2d 399 (2008). Parker does not elaborate on what constituted his \u201clegitimate confusion.\u201d Moreover, his argument ignores that a certified public accountant, using Parker\u2019s computerized accounting records for his business, informed Parker that he owed taxes. Parker acknowledged his tax liability by entering into an installment plan with the IRS to pay the tax. Thus, the record is not devoid of evidence that Parker had knowledge that he should have reported more income than he did when he filed amended 1040-X returns and that he was therefore guilty of tax fraud. <em>See United States v. Bishop, </em>412 U.S. 346, 360, 93 S.Ct. 2008, 36 L.Ed.2d 941 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-13\">To establish a violation of \u00a7 7203, the Government had to prove (1) that Parker was required to file a return; (2) that he failed to file a return; and (3) that the failure to file a return was willful. <em>See Clayton, </em>506 F.3d at 408. Parker again argues only that the Government failed to prove that he \u201cwillfully\u201d failed to file tax returns because he had a \u201creasonable belief that he was not liable to file a tax return.\u201d Parker points to nothing to support his assertion that his belief was reasonable. Moreover, evidence from multiple sources indicated that the Parkers\u2019 business earned substantial income for the years in question. Therefore, any purported belief that he was not required to file an income tax return was not reasonable. The record is not devoid of evidence that Thomas Parker was guilty of failing to file tax returns for the years 2002 through 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-14\">Margaret Parker argues that the district court committed reversible error when it admitted Bonnie Edwards\u2019s documents titled \u201cSummary of Taxpayer Contact\u201d because the summaries were hearsay evidence. The Government argues, among other things, that its exhibits 18A and 18B <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>were not hearsay because they were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Exhibit 18B contained only the statements of Bonnie Edwards and is, therefore, not hearsay. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801(c). To the extent that Exhibit 18A quoted from a memorandum by the Parkers that was previously delivered to Edwards and was ostensibly offered to prove Margaret Parker\u2019s complicity in tax fraud, it is hearsay. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The exhibit, however, falls under the hearsay exception for business records. Although Edwards had retired by the time of trial, her notes were made on IRS Form 9297, which is titled \u201cSummary of Taxpayer Contact.\u201d That the notes were made on an IRS form indicates that it was the regular practice of the IRS to make such a record. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 803(6). Furthermore, Edwards testified that the IRS required her to keep such records. Edwards recognized the records and knew they were from her office. <em>See United States v. Box, </em>50 F.3d 345, 356 (5th Cir.1995). Edwards was therefore a qualified witness, and she sufficiently authenticated Exhibit 18A such that it falls under the exception to hearsay enunciated in Rule 803(6). Fed.R.Evid. 803(6); <em>Box, </em>50 F.3d at 356. The district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing Exhibit 18A into evidence. <em>See United States v. Franklin, </em>561 F.3d 398, 404 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>--- U.S. ---, 129 S.Ct. 2848, 174 L.Ed.2d 567 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b552-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
