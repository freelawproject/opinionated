Specifically, Villegas-Menjivar argues that the BIA erroneously interpreted \u00a7 1244.2(f)(2)(iv) as requiring that her spousal relationship had to exist at the time of the initial registration period.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">\u201cWe review only the [BIA\u2019s] decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, the BIA issued a written opinion, and, although it agreed with the IJ\u2019s ultimate conclusion, it did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s opinion. Accordingly, we review only the BIA\u2019s opinion. \u201cTo the extent that the BIA\u2019s or IJ\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, we review <em>de novo.\u201d Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1256 (11th Cir.2007). The BIA\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation, however, is entitled to deference \u201cunless that interpretation is \u2018plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Auer v. Robbins, </em>519 U.S. 452, 461, 117 S.Ct. 905, 911, 137 L.Ed.2d 79 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">Additionally, we review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003). INA \u00a7 242 limits our jurisdiction over denials of discretionary relief in immigration proceedings. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B); <em>see also </em>INA \u00a7 244(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a(a)(l) (stating that the grant of TPS is discretionary). Notwithstanding this jurisdictional bar, we have held that \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B) \u201cdoes not preclude review of non-discretionary legal decisions that pertain to statutory eligibility for discretionary relief.\u201d <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza, </em>321 F.3d at 1332. Furthermore, we retain jurisdiction over \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law\u201d raised in a petition for review. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Therefore, we have jurisdiction to consider whether the BIA\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1244.2(f)(2) is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the language of the regulation. <em>See Assa\u2019ad, </em>332 F.3d at 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-13\">The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security may designate any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>country for the TPS program if she finds that certain conditions exist in a country, including the occurrence of an environmental disaster. <em>Mejia Rodriguez v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>562 F.3d 1137, 1140 n. 3 (11th Cir.2009); INA \u00a7 244(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a(b)(l). Honduras was designated for inclusion in the TPS program in 1999. <em>Id. </em>at 1140. To qualify for TPS, an alien who is a national of a designated country must (1) be continuously present in the United States since the effective date of the most recent designation of that country; (2) continuously reside in the United States from the date that the Secretary designates; (3) be admissible as an immigrant, subject to certain exceptions; and (4) register during an appropriate registration period, \u201cto the extent and in a manner which the [Secretary] establishes.\u201d INA \u00a7 244(c)(l)(A)(i)-(iv), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a(c)(l)(A)(i)-(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Section 1244.2(f) sets forth the registration requirements for establishing eligibility for TPS. The regulation requires, in relevant part, that the alien establish that he or she registered for TPS:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">During any subsequent extension of such designation if at the time of the initial registration period: (i) The applicant is a nonimmigrant or has been granted voluntary departure status or any relief from removal; (ii) The applicant has an application for change of status, adjustment of status, asylum, voluntary departure, or any relief from removal which is pending or subject to further review or appeal; (iii) The applicant is a parolee or has a pending request for reparole; or (iii) The applicant is a spouse or child of an alien currently eligible to be a TPS registrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1244.2(f)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">We conclude from the record that the BIA\u2019s interpretation of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1244.2(f)(2)(iv) is consistent with the plain language of the regulation. Therefore, we defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the regulation as requiring both that (1) the applicant be married to someone who is currently eligible for TPS, and (2) the marriage be in existence at the time of the initial registration period. Because Ville-gas-Menjivar did not marry her husband until after the initial registration ended, she was not eligible for TPS. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-9\">. To the extent that Villegas-Menjivar also contends that the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the regulation is inconsistent with the humanitarian purpose of TPS and the interest of family unity, we are without jurisdiction to consider those arguments because Villegas-Menjivar failed to raise them before the BIA. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that \"[w]e lack jurisdiction to consider claims raised in a petition for review unless the petitioner has exhausted his administrative remedies\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
