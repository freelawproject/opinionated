He sought a sentence reduction based on Amendment 706 to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the base offense level for most crack cocaine offenses. <em>See United States v. Burns, </em>526 F.3d 852, 861 (5th Cir.2008). Foster appeals the district court\u2019s denial of that motion. Foster argues that the district court erred by determining that because the crack cocaine amendments did not lower his guidelines range, he was ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">Foster\u2019s argument is premised, in part, upon his assertion that the prohibition set forth in <em>United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. </em>220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), against the mandatory application of the Guidelines applies in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. This court determined in <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. ---, 130 S.Ct. 517, \u2014 L.Ed.2d --- (2009), that \u201cthe concerns at issue in <em>Booker </em>do not apply in a 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.\u201d Also, <em>\u201cBooker </em>does not alter the mandatory character of Guideline \u00a7 lBl.lO\u2019s limitations on sentence reductions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>One such limitation is that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction is not authorized if an amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). In Foster\u2019s case, the amended guidelines yielded the same sentencing range that was used when Foster was originally sentenced. The district court therefore did not err in denying Foster\u2019s motion. <em>See Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 237; \u00a7 3582(c)(2); \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b550-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
