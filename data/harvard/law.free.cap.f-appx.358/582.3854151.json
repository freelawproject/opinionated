Davis was arrested for burglary of a habitation after allegedly entering his neighbor\u2019s house carrying a hammer and a knife and barricading himself in a bathroom, while holding his neighbor at knife-point. After Davis refused to undergo a mental competency examination, the district attorney reduced the charge to theft, and Davis pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-21\">The district court determined that Davis\u2019s suit against law enforcement officials, the sheriffs department, and his neighbors was barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), because Davis\u2019s theft conviction has not been overturned or otherwise invalidated. Davis does not dispute the district court\u2019s ruling. Instead, he asks this court to expunge his record, to punish the defendants, and to award damages. Because he does not address the basis for the dismissal of his suit, he has waived any argument that his suit is not barred by <em>Heck. See Brewster v. Dretke, </em>587 F.3d 764, 768 n. 2 (5th Cir.2009) (pro se \u00a7 1983 litigant waives issue by failing to brief it). The appeal is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS, as it lacks any issues of arguable merit. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Davis\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel and change of venue are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b608-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
