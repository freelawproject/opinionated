He contends the sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable because: the sentence was greater than necessary to meet the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); and, the advisory guidelines range overstated the seriousness of his offense, resulting in a sentence too severe for his crime, which he characterizes as merely an \u201cinternational trespass\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard (if the issue is preserved in district court), the district court must still properly calculate the guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-14\">As noted, pursuant to <em>Gall, </em>we engage in a bifurcated review of the sentence imposed by the district court. <em>United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752 (5th Cir.2009). First, we consider whether the district court committed a \u201csignificant procedural error\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 753. If, as in this case, there is no such error, we then review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, as noted above, for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 751-53. (There was no objection in district court that the sentence is not reasonable. Because the contention fails under our usual standard of review, we need not decide whether review should be only for plain error.)</p>\n<p id=\"b534-15\">Because it is within the properly calculated guidelines range, Covarrubias\u2019 sentence is presumed to be reasonable. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 346-47, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Covarrubias asserts the lack of an empirical basis for U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 (unlawfully entering or remaining in the United States) should preclude this presumption; but, as he concedes, this contention is foreclosed by our court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 365-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. ---, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-17\">The district court considered Covarrubias\u2019 requests for a more, lenient sentence. His contentions that such a sentence would have met \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s goals and that his offense level overstated the seriousness of his crime are insufficient to overcome the presumption of reasonableness of his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See Gall, 552 </em>U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586 (\u201cThe fact that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>appellate court might reasonably [conclude] that a different sentence [is] appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d); <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006) (rejecting contentions that sentence was unreasonable where defendant asserted that his crime was merely \u201can international trespass\u201d and that his within-guidelines sentence was too severe for the crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b534-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
