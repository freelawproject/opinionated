Telemaque asserts because he detrimentally relied on the continued availability of INA \u00a7 212(c), the IJ\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> application of the subsequent repeal of the provision by the Illegal Immigration Reform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) is impermissibly retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">We review the IJ\u2019s statutory interpretation <em>de novo. Ferguson v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>563 F.3d 1254, 1269 n. 25 (11th Cir.2009). The IJ\u2019s determination is owed no deference when it involves the retroactive application of a statute. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The former provisions of INA \u00a7 212(c) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-6\">Aliens lawfully admitted for permanent resident who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation, and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years, may be admitted in the discretion of the Attorney General without regard to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section (other than paragraphs (3) and (9)(C)). Nothing contained in this subsection shall limit the authority of the Attorney General to exercise the discretion vested in him under section 1181(b) of this title. The first sentence of this subsection shall not apply to an alien who has been convicted of one or more aggravated felonies and has served for such felony or felonies a term of imprisonment of at least 5 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">IIRIRA took effect on April 1, 1997. Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-625. IIRIRA repealed \u00a7 212(c) and ended the availability of relief under its terms. Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-597. IIRIRA\u2019s repeal of INA \u00a7 212(c) did not apply to aliens who were in exclusion or deportation proceedings prior to the statute\u2019s effective date. Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-625-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">In <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), the Supreme Court considered the effect of \u00a7 212(c)\u2019s repeal on an alien who entered a guilty plea to an aggravated felony prior to IIRIRA\u2019s effective date, and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARs\">We find nothing in IIRIRA unmistakably indicating that Congress considered the question whether to apply its repeal of \u00a7 212(c) retroactively to such aliens. We therefore hold that \u00a7 212(c) relief remains available for aliens, like respondent, whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who, notwithstanding those convictions, would have been eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 2293.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">We recently considered and applied <em>St. Cyr </em>in the context of an alien seeking \u00a7 212(c) relief after a trial conviction for a drug trafficking felony. <em>Ferguson, </em>563 F.3d at 1259-71. In <em>Ferguson, </em>an alien who was convicted of a felony after trial sought to \u201cextend <em>St. Cyr </em>outside of the guilty plea context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1263. We held \u201creliance is a core component of <em>St. CyFs </em>retroactivity analysis as it applies to aliens challenging the application of IIRIRA\u2019s repeal of \u00a7 212(c).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1269-70. Because she did not enter a guilty plea and did not point to other actions that constituted a detrimental change in her position in reliance on continued eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief, we found the petitioner in <em>Ferguson </em>could not avail herself of the repealed statute\u2019s provisions. <em>Id. </em>at 1271. We joined the majority of circuits and held <em>St. Cyr </em>does not does not apply \u2014 and \u00a7 212(c) relief is unavailable \u2014 to aliens who were convicted after a trial, \u201cbecause such aliens\u2019 decisions to go to trial do not satisfy <em>St. </em>CyFs reliance requirement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-13\">Telemaque has advanced no legal argument and proffered no facts taking his case beyond the purview of <em>Ferguson. </em>Telemaque pursued the opportunity to contest his criminal charges and did not plead guilty to the trafficking offense; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>thus, he cannot demonstrate he detrimentally changed his position in reliance on continued availability of a \u00a7 212(c) waiver of inadmissibility. Such detrimental reliance is a critical element of any claim for \u00a7 212(c) relief based on an alleged impermissible retroactive application of IIRIRA. We deny his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b171-18\">. The BIA's decision is the agency's final judgment subject to appellate court review, except to the extent it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, the BIA expressly adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision with no additional analysis, so we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
