Without objection from the state, the district court proposed granting the motion and lowering Warren\u2019s offense level by two levels. Warren filed objections to the district court\u2019s proposed sentence, requesting additional consideration and a further reduction of his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court rejected Warren\u2019s objections, setting his term of imprisonment at the low-end of the recalculated range.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Warren argues that the district court erred in finding that \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l) of the Guidelines prohibited it from further reducing his sentence to a term less than the minimum amended guideline range. He asserts that the district court\u2019s reading of \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A) violated his Sixth Amendment rights because the court failed to consider the advisory nature of the Guidelines under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and thus, failed to recognize its authority to impose a downward variance due to the unwarranted disparity created among defendants convicted of crack-cocaine offenses and powder-cocaine offenses, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. When an appellant demonstrates that the sentencing court relied upon an invalid factor in determining his sentence, remand is appropriate unless we conclude, on the record as a whole, that \u201cthe error did not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Kendrick, </em>22 F.3d 1066, 1068 (11th Cir.1994). Given the facts of this case, even assuming arguendo that the district court erred in its determination as to the extent of its authority to grant a downward variance, there was no reversible error because the error did not affect Warren\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Despite concluding that \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A) prohibited it from reducing Warren\u2019s sentence below the amended guideline range, the district court addressed each of Warren\u2019s arguments for a further reduction in his sentence below the amended guideline range, including the applicable \u00a7 3553(a) factors, public safety, Warren\u2019s prison history and family relationships, as well as his first-offender status and acceptance of responsibility, and found that no further reduction was warranted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, even if the district couid; erred in finding that, regardless of <em>Booker, </em>it was prohibited from reducing Warren\u2019s sentence below the amended guideline range, that error was harmless. Any such error cannot be said to have affected the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence where it considered each of Warren\u2019s presented arguments for a further reduction and found that no such reduction would be warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b72-6\">. For the first time on appeal, Warren also argues that the district court erred in failing to consider, under \u00a7 3553(a)(6), the disproportionate manner in which the Guidelines apply to crack-cocaine offenses and power-cocaine offenses, resulting in unwarranted sentencing disparities. Because Warren did not raise this issue before the district court, the district court cannot be said to have abused its discretion in allegedly failing to consider a factor that was not brought to its attention. See <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 599, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (stating that it is \u201cnot incumbent on the District Judge to raise every conceivable relevant issue on his own initiative\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
