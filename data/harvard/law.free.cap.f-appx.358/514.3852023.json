He appeals his sentence of 57 months\u2019 imprisonment, claiming: the district court erred by refusing to grant him an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction under Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 3El.l(a); and, it abused its discretion by upwardly departing two criminal history categories and by imposing the highest sentence within the resulting Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-18\">Athough <em>post-Booker) </em>the Guidelines are advisory only, and an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-23\">Regarding the district court\u2019s refusing to grant an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction, its decision is reviewed \u201cwith even greater deference\u201d than clear-error review. <em>United States v. Buchanan, </em>485 F.3d 274, 287 (5th Cir.2007). A denial of a reduction under \u00a7 3E1.1 will not be reversed unless the decision is \u201cwithout foundation\u201d. <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 211 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, --</em>- U.S. ---, 128 S.Ct. 2452, 171 L.Ed.2d 248 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-25\">Sauceda quickly stated his desire to plead guilty and admitted the facts underlying his offense. His other statements and actions before the district court, however, failed to demonstrate the required \u201csincere contrition\u201d. <em>United States v. Beard, </em>913 F.2d 193, 199 (5th Cir.1990); <em>see also United States v. Le, </em>512 F.3d 128, 134 (5th Cir.2007) (holding guidelines enhancement could be affirmed on any basis supported by the record), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. ---, 129 S.Ct. 55, 172 L.Ed.2d 57 (2008). Accordingly, Sauceda has not shown the district court\u2019s decision was without foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-28\">The district court\u2019s departing upwardly and sentencing Sauceda at the top of the resulting Guidelines range was pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, p.s. (allowing an up<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>ward departure where criminal history category inadequately represents \u201cthe seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history\u201d) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (providing factors to be considered in imposing a sentence). Sauceda maintains the departure was not reasonable and that the district court abused its discretion. Our court reviews upward departures for reasonableness, which requires that we review \u201cthe district court\u2019s decision to depart upwardly and the extent of that departure for abuse of discretion\u201d. <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A within-Guidelines sentence, however, is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>United States v. New son, </em>515 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Sauceda contends the district court erred by considering his \u201cprior arrest record\u201d. Although consideration of prior arrests, without more, is specifically prohibited by the Guidelines as a ground for an upward departure, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(3), the record shows the district court considered Sauceda\u2019s extensive record of prior convictions, <em>not </em>his other arrests. Sauceda has not shown an abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision to depart upwardly or the extent of that departure, nor has he overcome the presumption of reasonableness afforded his resulting within-Guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b540-19\"> Pursuant to 5tii Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
