California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Quintanilla-Quintanilla filed a response. Thereafter, the FPD filed as supplemental letter brief, and Quintanilla-Quintanilla filed no further response. Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief and supplemental letter brief, and Quintanilla-Quintanilla\u2019s response discloses no non-frivolous issue for appeal. Quintanilla-Quintanilla\u2019s claim of duress is unsupported by any evidence and contradicted by the record, and his complaints about his sentence do not raise a non-frivolous issue given the standard of review and the colloquy in the record. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b613-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
