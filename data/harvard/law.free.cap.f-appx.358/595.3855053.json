Following amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines that lowered the offense levels for crack cocaine offenses, the district court granted a motion by Hawthorne pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and reduced his sentence to 188 months of imprisonment. Hawthorne now appeals, challenging the limits on the district court\u2019s discretion set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 and arguing that the district court had the authority to impose an even lower sentence. Hawthorne\u2019s arguments are foreclosed in light of our recent decision in <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 236-39 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Sept. 21, 2009) (No. 09-6657).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-23\">Hawthorne also argues that his \u00a7 3582 motion for a reduction of sentence required a hearing with him present. Because the district court \u201cmerely modifie[d] an existing sentence\u201d rather than impose a new sentence after the original sentence had been set aside, Hawthorne was not entitled to a hearing. <em>See United States v. Patterson, </em>42 F.3d 246, 248-49 (5th Cir.1994); Fed.R.CrimP. 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-24\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b621-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
