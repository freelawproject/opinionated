Arroyo argues that: (1) the district court should have used a lower base offense level because he had a minimal role in the conspiracy; and (2) his sentences were procedurally and substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>tively unreasonable. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Ordinarily, a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact we review for clear error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en </em>banc). However, where, as here, the defendant has failed to raise the issue before the district court, we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005). We review the ultimate sentence a district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">First, we reject Arroyo\u2019s claim that the district court plainly erred by not <em>sua sponte </em>granting him a minimal role reduction. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(a), a defendant may receive an adjustment for his minimal role in the offense if he is \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. n. 4. A four-level, minimal role reduction under \u00a7 3B1.2(a) applies to a defendant who lacks \u201cknowledge or understanding of the scope and structure of the enterprise.... It is intended that the downward adjustment for a minimal participant will be used infrequently.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Under <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>the proponent of the downward adjustment bears the burden of establishing his minimal role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. 175 F.3d at 934, 939. The determination of whether the defendant warrants a minimal role reduction requires a two-part analysis of a defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 940-45. First, the court \u201cmust measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which [he] was held accountable at sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945. \u201c[W]here the relevant conduct attributed to a defendant is identical to [his] actual conduct, [he] cannot prove that [he] is entitled to a minor role adjustment simply by pointing to some broader criminal scheme in which [he] was a minor participant but for which [he] was not held accountable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941. \u201c[W]hen a drug courier\u2019s relevant conduct is limited to [his] own act of importation, a district court may legitimately conclude that the courier played an important or essential role in the importation of those drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 942-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">In considering the second prong, the defendant\u2019s role is compared to the other participants in that relevant conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 945. To apply the adjustment under this prong, the district court must find that \u201cthe defendant was less culpable than <em>most other participants </em>in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. Even if a defendant\u2019s role is \u201cless than that of other participants engaged in the relevant conduct,\u201d he might not be entitled to an adjustment because, in some cases, there are no minimal participants. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">Applying the first prong of the <em>De Var\u00f3n test here, the </em>district court held <em>Arroyo </em>accountable only for the 8,697 kilograms of cocaine recovered by the Coast Guard. While Arroyo argues on appeal that he should have received a minimal role reduction because he was a \u201clowly placed participant\u201d in the larger conspiracy and had no interest in the contraband, had no decision-making authority, and was not involved in planning the voyage, he cannot meet his burden of proving entitlement to such a reduction merely by \u201cpointing to some broader criminal scheme in which [he] was a minor participant but for which [he] was not held accountable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941. Moreover, Arroyo\u2019s relevant conduct was limited to his own act of drug importation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>and as <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>held, \u201ca district court may legitimately conclude that the courier played an important or essential role in the importation of those drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 942-43. Because the relevant conduct for which Arroyo was held accountable was identical to his actual conduct \u2014 participating in the attempted importation of 8,697 kilograms of cocaine \u2014 his claim for a minimal role reduction fails under the first prong of <em>De Var\u00f3n.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Turning to the second prong of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>analysis, Arroyo has failed to present evidence that his conduct was less significant than his three codefendants. Arroyo emphasizes that he was simply a crew member, had no interest in the drugs, and had no decision-making authority. But the owners and organizers that Arroyo alludes to are not discernable from this record, and Arroyo cannot meet his burden merely by asserting that he was on the lower level of a larger criminal conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>at 944 (instructing that the district court should look to other participants in the offense only to the extent they are identifiable or discernable from the evidence). Therefore, Arroyo has not shown that the district court plainly erred in not <em>sua sponte </em>granting him a minimal role reduction. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298; <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">We likewise are unpersuaded that his sentences are unreasonable. In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we perform two steps. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190. First, we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court need not state on the record that it explicitly considered each factor and need not discuss each factor. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Rather, \u201can acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient\u201d under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>Id. </em>When the district court imposes a within-guidelines sentence, it need only \u201cset forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that [it] has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-diseretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). A sentence may be substantively unreasonable if it does not achieve the purposes of sentencing stated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 1191. A sentence within the guidelines range is ordinarily expected to be reasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>F.3d at 788. Moreover, when considering whether a defendant\u2019s sentence is reasonable, we have compared the sentence actually imposed to the statutory maximum. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 751-52 (11th Cir.2006) (upholding sentence as reasonable in part because it was \u201cappreciably below the length of the statutory maximum\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">The weight accorded to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is left to the district court\u2019s discretion, and we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors. <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007). The fact that we might reasonably conclude that a different sentence is appropriate is not sufficient to warrant reversal. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both the record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Arroyo also has not demonstrated that his sentences are procedurally unreasonable. The district court allowed both parties to present arguments on what the appropriate sentences should be, and considered Arroyo\u2019s arguments for a reduced sentence on the basis of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Particularly, the court heard Arroyo\u2019s argument as to the nature and circumstances of the offense \u2014 that he was at the low level of the broader conspiracy. The court also considered Arroyo\u2019s individual characteristics \u2014 that he was illiterate, 55 years old at the time of sentencing, in poor health, had no prior criminal history, and has a family in Colombia to support, and that he would be treated less favorably by the criminal justice system due to his alien status. The court further said that it considered the guidelines to be \u201cadvisory\u201d and that it considered the PSI, and twice said that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court nonetheless found the concurrent 135-month sentences to be \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing.\u201d On this record, Arroyo\u2019s arguments that the district court failed to adequately explain its reason for the sentences and that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Nor has Arroyo demonstrated that his sentences were substantively unreasonable. Arroyo argues that the district court erred in not varying below the advisory guidelines range to account for his status as a foreign national subject to an immigration detainer because that status will cause him to be ineligible for desirable prison programs that might otherwise be available. However, the district court was aware of Arroyo\u2019s status as a Colombian national, was not required to discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor, and was within its discretion to assign weight to each factor. <em>See Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d at 832; <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">As for Arroyo\u2019s argument that his sentences are unreasonably disparate when compared to other \u201cboat cases,\u201d the statistics that Arroyo points to and the circumstances of these unrelated cases are not part of this record. We therefore cannot determine whether the circumstances of those cases bear relation to the circumstances of this case. <em>See United States v. Campbell, </em>491 F.3d 1306, 1317 (11th Cir.2007) (holding that the statistics cited by Campbell regarding other defendants\u2019 sentences were merely \u201cbare numbers without context\u201d and thus, were unpersuasive). Moreover, we will not substitute our judgment with respect to the weight given to these statistics and again, the district court was not required to explicitly discuss this factor. <em>See Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d at 832; <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>In sum, the record shows that the district court gave Arroyo\u2019s case an individualized review, explicitly said twice that it considered the \u00a7 3553 factors, ultimately agreed with the government\u2019s assertion that the nature, circumstances, and seriousness of the offense weighed in favor of imposing concurrent 135-month sentences, and set forth enough to show that it considered both parties\u2019 arguments and had a \u201creasoned basis for exercising its legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456. Arroyo\u2019s sentences also were at the bottom of the guidelines range and well below the statutory maximum of life imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(1)(B); <em>Valnor, </em>451 F.3d at 752; <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. Moreover, this is a case involving an \u201cextraordinary\u201d quantity of cocaine \u2014 nearly 8,700 kilograms. For these reasons, Arroyo has not met his burden, in light of the record and the pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors, to show that his sentences were unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-7\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
