Campbell also alleged retaliation, conspiracy, and a denial of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-19\">The District Court, in a thoughtful, well-reasoned, and thorough opinion, granted summary judgment to defendants on all claims and dismissed the suit. After carefully reviewing the record and briefs of the parties, and for the reasons assigned in the district court\u2019s Memorandum and Order on May 7, 2009, we affirm the judgment of the district court. Accordingly, Campbell\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied. <em>See Schwander v. Blackburn, </em>750 F.2d 494, 502 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b593-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
