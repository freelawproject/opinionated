He was sentenced to the statutory minimum 120-month term of imprisonment as well as a five-year term of supervised release. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii). McCuin appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduction of sentence, in which he sought a modification of his sentence due to a retroactive amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines for crack cocaine offenses. The Government has filed a motion for summary affirmance, or, alternatively, for an extension of time within which to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence ordinarily is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, but a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. ---, 130 S.Ct. 517, \u2014 L.Ed.2d --- (2009). The district court lacked the discretion to impose a guidelines sentence that was lower than the statutorily mandated minimum penalty. <em>See United States v. Harper, </em>527 F.3d 396, 411 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. ---, 129 S.Ct. 212, 172 L.Ed.2d 157 (2008); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 559 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>--- U.S. ---, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008). McCuin\u2019s argument that the district court had the discretion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582 in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is unavailing because \u201cthe concerns at issue in <em>Booker </em>do not apply in an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.\u201d <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238. McCuin concedes that there is no authority for the district court to have imposed a sentence below the statutory minimum, but he seeks to preserve the issue in the event of a change in the jurisprudence regarding the application of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to defendants subject to mandatory minimum sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-13\">The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, the Government\u2019s motion for an extension of time is DENIED as moot, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b590-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
