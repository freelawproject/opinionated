This court has discretion to review Huang\u2019s petition because it seeks relief based on alleged changed circumstances in China. <em>See Panjwani v. Gonzales, </em>401 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>F.3d 626, 632 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cThe BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen is reviewed for abuse of discretion and its factual findings are reviewed for substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That discretion will not be disturbed unless the decision is \u201ccapricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so aberrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Pritchett v. INS, </em>993 F.2d 80, 83 (5th Cir.1993) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Huang was required to show changed country conditions in China to overcome the time and numeric limitations on her motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Huang has not shown that the BIA failed to consider the State Department Reports on Country Conditions and the other documents submitted. The BIA found that the documentary evidence reflected no change in country conditions in China. This decision is not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Panjwani, </em>401 F.3d at 632. Additionally, Huang\u2019s assertion that she fears forced sterilization for giving birth to two children in this country is based on self-induced changes in her personal circumstances, not changed conditions in China. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, the BIA\u2019s denial of Huang\u2019s motion to reopen based on a finding that the motion was untimely and successive was not an abuse of discretion. We decline to address Huang\u2019s argument that she is eligible for the underlying substantive relief of asylum, the withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b613-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
