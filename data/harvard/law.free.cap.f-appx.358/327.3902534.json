Moers seeks reversal of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s summary judgment in an adversary proceeding brought by his ex-wife, Appellee Nancy Premazon, in which she sought non-discharge of the Debtor\u2019s state court judgment debt to Premazon for attorneys\u2019 fees incurred and awarded in connection with these parties\u2019 child custody disputes. Moers contends on appeal that the Bankruptcy Court erred (and thus too the district court sitting in appeal by affirming the Bankruptcy Court) in ruling that\u2014 irrespective of the classification for purposes of Texas law by the family court and the state appellate court regarding the nature of these attorneys\u2019 fees \u2014 under federal bankruptcy law, the entire amount of the attorneys\u2019 fees for which Moers is indebted by judgment to Premazon is nondischargeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-18\">Both parties submitted to this court that, given the essentially undisputed facts and the entirely legal nature of the issue presented by this appeal, oral argument would not aid in our disposition of the case. We agree. Having now carefully reviewed the briefs of the parties and the record on appeal, including, without limitation, the exhaustive explication of the case by the Bankruptcy Court in its Memorandum of Decision dated April 1, 2004, we are convinced \u2014 as was the district court \u2014 that the Bankruptcy Court ruled correctly when it granted partial summary judgment that $120,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees, plus interest, owed by Moers to Premazon is non-dis-chargeable, subject to any offset Moers may establish, and denying Premazon\u2019s $45,000 conditional award of attorneys\u2019 fees; at the same time denying Moers\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s Memorandum of Decision, that court\u2019s partial summary judgment is, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1084-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
