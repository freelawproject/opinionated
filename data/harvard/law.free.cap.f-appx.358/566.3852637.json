Duke questions the propriety of his sentencing as a career offender and argues that \u00a7 3582(c) is applicable to his sentences based upon the amendments to the crack cocaine guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-19\">Duke may not use a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to challenge the appropriateness of the district court\u2019s application of a career offender enhancement in its calculation of his original sentences. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995). Moreover, because Duke\u2019s sentences were based on his prior convictions and not on the quantity of crack cocaine, he was not \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-20\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the Government\u2019s motion for an extension of time is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b592-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under die limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
