For the first time on appeal, he contends that the district court plainly erred in not awarding him a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 safety-valve reduction and in failing to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum. As the Government contends, the instant appeal is barred by the waiver-of-appeal provision in Segura-Lopez\u2019s plea agreement, which was knowing, voluntary, and enforceable. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 517 (5th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Portillo, </em>18 F.3d 290, 292-93 (5th Cir.1994); Fed.R.Crim.P. ll(b)(l)(N).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Segura-Lopez\u2019s argument that the Government breached the plea agreement by failing to request a safety valve reduction fails because the Government was under no affirmative obligation to request such a reduction. In addition, he had two criminal history points. Thus he was statutorily ineligible to receive the safety valve reduction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(l). Segura-Lopez\u2019s claim that the Government engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by withholding unspecified information regarding his eligibility for safety valve consideration is wholly conclusional and is not cognizable. <em>See Nichols v. Scott, </em>69 F.3d 1255, 1286 (5th Cir.1995) (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 case).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b583-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
