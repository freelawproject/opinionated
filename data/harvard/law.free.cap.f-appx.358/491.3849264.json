She also moves this court to appoint appellate counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-26\">Patterson acknowledged on the face of her complaint that she had not exhausted her administrative remedies, and in support of her claim that she was denied access to courts, Patterson alleged that she was denied access to the law library on three occasions. Patterson argues on appeal that she should have been allowed to amend her complaint prior to its dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>A civil rights plaintiff should be given an opportunity to amend her complaint before it is dismissed for failure to state a claim. <em>Bazrowx v. Scott, </em>136 F.3d 1053, 1054 (5th Cir.1998). Any error, however, may be harmless if the plaintiff has alleged her \u201cbest case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1054.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">A dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted is reviewed under the same de novo standard as a dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 733-34 (5th Cir.1998). \u201cThe complaint must be liberally construed, with all reasonable inferences drawn in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Woodard v. Andrus, </em>419 F.3d 348, 351 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>\u2014 U.S. ---, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Prisoners have a constitutional right to access the courts. <em>Bounds v. Smith, </em>430 U.S. 817, 821, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977). However, <em>\u201cBounds </em>did not create an abstract, freestanding right to a law library or legal assistance.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>518 U.S. at 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174. To prevail on a claim of denial of access to courts, a prisoner must show actual injury. <em>Id. </em>at 349-52, 116 S.Ct. 2174.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Although Patterson alleged that she had been denied access to the law library on three occasions, she failed to allege in the district court or in this Court that she had suffered an actual injury. Her failure to allege actual injury is therefore fatal to her \u201cdenial of access to courts\u201d claim. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the district court did not err by dismissing this claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Moreover, because Patterson has set forth her \u201cbest case,\u201d it was harmless error for the district court to dismiss her case without allowing Patterson an opportunity to amend. <em>Bazrowx, </em>136 F.3d at 1054.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">Finally, Patterson has moved this court to appoint appellate counsel. A plaintiff may request the appointment of counsel under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(1), the federal statute governing proceedings in forma pauperis. That section provides that this court may appoint an attorney \u201cto represent any person unable to afford counsel.\u201d Counsel is generally appointed under \u00a7 1915(e)(1) only in \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Santana v. Chandler, </em>961 F.2d 514, 515 (5th Cir.1992); <em>Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 213 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">In ruling on such requests in a \u00a7 1983 case, a district court must consider: (1) the type and complexity of the case; (2) whether the indigent is capable of adequately presenting her case; (3) whether the indigent is in a position to investigate adequately the case; and (4) whether the evidence will consist in large part of conflicting testimony so as to require skill in the presentation of evidence and in cross examination. <em>Ulmer, </em>691 F.2d at 213. Although not all of these considerations apply to requests for appellate counsel, \u201cthe duty to consider the appellant\u2019s ability to present fairly his or her case is the same.\u201d <em>Dilworth v. Box, </em>No. 94-41088, 1995 WL 295885, at *4 (5th Cir. April 20, 1995) (unpublished). Patterson has failed to set forth \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d that warrant appointment of counsel here, and, as such, her motion is denied. <em>Santana, </em>961 F.2d at 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b517-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut.
