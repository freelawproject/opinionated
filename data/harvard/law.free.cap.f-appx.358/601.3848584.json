In his petition, Espinal asserts that he is challenging the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider the order of the immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. In his supporting brief, however, Espinal argues that the IJ erred in holding that he had failed to satisfy the evidentiary burden for the relief sought and that the IJ used an improper standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">The government contends that the petition for review is timely only as to the denial of the motion for reconsideration. Because Espinal\u2019s petition for review was not filed within thirty days of the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s decision, his petition for review must be dismissed as to those rulings for lack of jurisdiction. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 213, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007); <em>Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 672, 676 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Although the petition for review is timely as to the denial of the motion for reconsideration, Espinal does not make any argument concerning the BIA\u2019s finding that he had failed to provide either additional legal arguments or new evidence, not included in his asylum application or prior testimony, upon which to persuade the BIA to reconsider or reopen the case. Accordingly, he has abandoned any challenge to that aspect of the BIA\u2019s ruling. <em>See Thun v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 793 (5th Cir.2004). The petition for review is DISMISSED in part for lack of jurisdiction and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b627-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
