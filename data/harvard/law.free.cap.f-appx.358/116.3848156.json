Seeing no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-23\">Hudson was arrested on charges for distribution of cocaine and resisting arrest in 2007. He moved to quash the warrants and to obtain copies of the supporting affidavits, and later moved for a writ of mandamus compelling their production. In response, the district attorney decided to <em>nolle prosequi </em>Hudson\u2019s charges, after which the state trial judge dismissed the mandamus petition. Thirty-two days later, the DA obtained a new indictment and reinstituted the charges. Hudson thereafter filed a Section 1983 civil rights claim in the Middle District of Alabama, alleging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>bad faith prosecution. He sought a stay of the criminal proceedings during the pendency of his Section 1983 claim, a permanent injunction against the DA (Hubbard) who brought the action, and declaratory judgment on the constitutionality of the warrant procedures in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">The magistrate judge reviewed Hudson\u2019s claims for frivolity, and recommended that the district judge abstain from issuing the injunctions and dismiss the Section 1983 suit <em>sua sponte. </em>The district judge agreed, concluding that <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), precluded an injunction against the state trial. To the extent that Hudson sought dismissal of the charges against him, the district judge considered this effort a complaint on the fact or duration of his imprisonment. The district judge determined that such a complaint is cognizable only in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus proceedings, and not in Section 1983 suits. The court dismissed Hudson\u2019s complaint <em>sua sponte, </em>pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">We review a district court\u2019s refusal to enjoin a state criminal proceeding for abuse of discretion. <em>Wexler v. Lepore, </em>385 F.3d 1336, 1338 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam). We review <em>de novo </em>a decision to dismiss a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Federal courts should not enjoin pending state court criminal proceedings absent special circumstances. <em>Younger, </em>401 U.S. at 53-54, 91 S.Ct. 746; <em>Green v. Jefferson County Comm\u2019n, </em>563 F.3d 1243, 1250 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cOur Federalism\u201d requires that federal courts apply this abstention doctrine if the challenged proceeding is a \u201cstate judicial proceeding ... implicating] important state interests [and] there [is] an adequate opportunity in the state proceedings to raise constitutional challenges.\u201d <em>Middlesex County Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>457 U.S. 423, 432, 102 S.Ct. 2515, 73 L.Ed.2d 116 (1982) (emphasis omitted). While state proceedings are accorded a presumption of propriety, federal courts are not entirely barred from enjoining proceedings. <em>See Hughes v. Attorney Gen. of Fla., </em>377 F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir.2004). The Supreme Court created exceptions to <em>Younger </em>abstention when \u201c(1) there is evidence of state proceedings motivated by bad faith, (2) irreparable injury would occur, or (3) there is no adequate alternative state forum where the constitutional issues can be raised.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1263 n. 6 (citing <em>Younger, </em>401 U.S. at 53-54, 91 S.Ct. 746).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">Hudson\u2019s claim is for \u201cbad faith\u201d: he fails to meet either of the other exceptions. While he broadly claims that the district attorney and state trial judge acted in bad faith, <em>Younger </em>requires more. He must make a \u201csubstantial allegation\u201d showing actual bad faith. <em>See Younger, </em>401 U.S. at 48, 91 S.Ct. 746 (noting that bad faith prosecutions are brought with no intention of securing a conviction or with an intention to harass). Hudson makes no allegation that the district attorney or judge acted with the kind of impropriety envisioned by the first <em>Younger </em>exception.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court properly declined to enjoin the state trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">Hudson also argues that the district court erred when it <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>his claim under the PLRA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) (\u201cOn review, the court shall ... dismiss the complaint ... if [it] fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d). Here, the magistrate judge treated Hudson\u2019s Section 1983 claim as a challenge to the \u201cfact or duration of his confinement.\u201d The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation that the claim be dismissed, as \u201chabeas corpus is the exclusive remedy for a state prisoner who challenges the fact or duration of his confinement.\u201d <em>Bradley v. Pryor, </em>305 F.3d 1287, 1289 (11th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The application to Hudson of the federal habeas statute \u2014 here, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 \u2014 is incorrect. Section 2254 habeas corpus relief challenges the fact or duration of a state criminal conviction: it is a postconviction remedy. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a) (\u201c[A] court shall entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the <em>judgment </em>of a State court ....\u201d) (emphasis added). Here, Hudson is challenging a pendant state criminal proceeding; so, his petition is governed by \u00a7 2241. <em>See Medberry v. Crosby, </em>351 F.3d 1049, 1062 (11th Cir.2003) (noting that all habeas petitions are governed by \u00a7 2241, and that \u00a7 2254\u2019s provisions do not apply to pretrial detention). To that end, the district court erred in accepting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation that Hudson\u2019s claims can only proceed on a \u00a7 2254 petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">But this error is not reversible, because we may \u201caffirm the district court\u2019s judgment on any ground that appears in the record, whether or not that ground was relied upon or even considered below.\u201d <em>Harris v. United Auto. Ins. Group, Inc., </em>579 F.3d 1227, 1232 (11th Cir.2009) (citation and alterations omitted). No construction of Hudson\u2019s allegations or his complaint yield a cognizable claim under Section 1983. His complaint fails to allege involvement in wrongdoing by the named defendants, precluding a potential claim for false arrest or imprisonment. <em>See Wallace, </em>549 U.S. at 389-90, 127 S.Ct. 1091. Here, the named defendants caused or allowed Hudson to remain in prison \u201cpursuant to [legal] process,\u201d for which a false arrest or imprisonment claim does not lie. <em>Id. </em>Hudson has similarly failed to allege facts (state prosecution has not ended in his favor) supporting a claim for malicious prosecution or for an improper warrant procedure in Calhoun County. His claims must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b144-7\">. Hudson's arguments on the reinstituted proceedings are similarly unavailing. A decision to <em>nolle prosequi </em>a case in Alabama is not a final disposition of the matter. <em>See Williams v. State, </em>494 So.2d 819, 823-24 (Ala.Crim. App.1986). The district court properly abstained from enjoining the state proceedings on this ground.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b145-6\">. Hudson\u2019s potential reliance on <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and progeny would be misplaced, as those cases examine the interrelationship between Section 1983 claims and Section 2254 petitions. Section 2241 habeas petitions to stay state criminal proceedings are governed by the same abstention principles set out above. <em>See Wallace v. Kato, </em>549 U.S. 384, 393-94. 127 S.Ct. 1091. 166 L.Ed.2d 973 (2007) (\u201cIf a plaintiff files a false arrest claim before he has been convicted (or files any other claim related to rulings that will likely be made in a pending or anticipated criminal trial), it is within the power [that is, the discretion] of the district court, and in accord with common practice, to stay the civil action until the criminal case or the likelihood of a criminal case is ended.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
