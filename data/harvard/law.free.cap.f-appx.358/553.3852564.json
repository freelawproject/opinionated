The district court granted summary judgment in Noble\u2019s favor, finding that McLaurin had not raised any issue of material fact under Mississippi negligence law. On appeal, McLaurin contends that the district court improperly weighed the evidence. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-15\">We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district court. <em>Noble Energy, Inc. v. Bituminous Cas. Co., </em>529 F.3d 642, 645 (5th Cir.2008) (citation omitted). In determining whether a genuine issue as to any material fact exists, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Fahim v. Marriott Hotel Servs., Inc., </em>551 F.3d 344, 348-49 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-16\">Mark McLaurin was employed as a scaffold carpenter by Friede Goldman Offshore. In 2002, Friede Goldman assigned McLaurin to build scaffolding inside a pontoon extension on the \u201cNoble Clyde Boudreaux,\u201d an offshore drilling rig owned by Noble Drilling. While McLaurin was working, a crane operated by a Friede Goldman employee was lowering a part of the roof structure on the pontoon. McLaurin placed his hand in a \u201cpinch point\u201d \u2014 a space between two objects\u2014 while the roof was being fitted. As a result, he sustained a severely crushed left hand and arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-17\">The relationship between Friede Goldman and Noble was contractual. Friede <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Goldman agreed to \u201cfurnish labor, material, and equipment required, on a Lump Sum Basis, to fabricate, paint and install lower hull pontoon extensions.\u201d Friede Goldman used its own equipment, conducted all operations in its own name, and directed its employees without Noble\u2019s instruction or interference. Noble did not assume responsibility for the safety of Friede Goldman employees under the terms of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The elements of a negligence claim in Mississippi are 1) duty, 2) breach of duty, 3) causation, and 4) injury. <em>Gulledge v. Shaw, </em>880 So.2d 288, 292-93 (Miss.2004). Specifically relevant to this case is the definition of the duty owed by a premises owner to the employees of an independent contractor.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">Where a party ... contracts with another ... to perform original construction or repair work ... and devolves upon the contractor the right and fact of control of the premises and the nature and details of the work, the owner has no liability for injuries experienced by the contractor\u2019s workers where those injuries arose out of or were intimately connected with the work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-7\"><em>Magee v. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Carp., </em>551 So.2d 182,185 (Miss.1989). The absence of contractual control would not foreclose liability. <em>Id. </em>If a plaintiff established that \u201cthe owner maintained <em>substantial de facto control </em>over those features of the work out of which the injury arose,\u201d even without a contract right, recovery may nonetheless be possible. <em>Id. </em>at 186 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">McLaurin attempted to establish Noble\u2019s control in both general and specific terms. McLaurin offered evidence that Friede Goldman and Noble created an extra-contractual joint safety protocol, that Noble had one of its employees on site, and that the Noble representatives routinely evaluated Friede Goldman\u2019s compliance with its overall plans. The district court concluded that this evidence spoke to Noble\u2019s control over the entire \u201cNoble Clyde Boudreaux\u201d project, not its control over the aspect of the work causing McLaurin\u2019s injury. The proof must explain control over the aspect of the work causing the injury. <em>Magee, </em>551 So.2d at 185. None of the evidence offered by McLaurin supports that Noble controlled the work on the pontoon extension that caused his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">McLaurin also asserts that Noble representatives had a responsibility to intervene when they witnessed Friede Goldman employees working under a suspended overhead load. It is not altogether clear whether this specific argument was made to the district court, but we also do not find that Noble objects to the raising of a somewhat different appellate argument \u2014 if it is in fact different. So we consider it. Working under an overhead load, McLaurin contends, violated Noble\u2019s own safety procedures. However, there is no evidence that Noble employees were present when McLaurin\u2019s injuries occurred. Instead, McLaurin offers an expert willing to testify to a \u201cmoral certainty\u201d that a Noble representative \u201cwould have been present\u201d at the pontoon extensions to observe the safety violation. We do not find such testimony to create a fact issue that anyone from Noble witnessed the incident and failed to intervene. In fact, McLaurin himself testified that no one from Noble told him how to perform his work, and that it was one of his Friede Goldman supervisors who told him to work inside the pontoon extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">McLaurin relies on a precedent that affirmed recovery for an injured employee of a contractor when the premises owner retained \u201cultimate authority for safety\u201d in the contract, issued step-by-step procedural instructions to the employees of the contractor, and paid the contractor a \u201cday <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>rate\u201d for its work. <em>Coho Resources, Inc. v. McCarthy, </em>829 So.2d 1, 10-13 (Miss.2002). The court specifically differentiated \u201cday rate\u201d jobs from \u201cturnkey\u201d contracts, which provide an independent contractor lump compensation for the entire job. <em>Id. </em>at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">By contrast, it is undisputed that in this case, Noble did not assume contractual authority for the safety of Friede Goldman employees. The evidence also shows that the details and procedures of Friede Goldman\u2019s day-to-day activities were controlled by its own rules and instructions. The agreement between Friede Goldman and Noble was a turnkey project, by which Friede Goldman took total control of its assignment until completion.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">McLaurin argues that Noble should nevertheless be held liable for its failure to intervene. In <em>Coho, </em>the court acknowledged that an owner could be liable to employees of an independent contractor for its own negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 13. However, such negligence was established by evidence that the defendant did \u201cretain and exercise substantial control\u201d over the contractor\u2019s work, and \u201cdirectly supervised\u201d the relevant activity. <em>Id. </em>Further, testimony in <em>Coho </em>showed that the contractor\u2019s crew was required to follow the step-by-step instructions of the owner\u2019s on-site employee. <em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The <em>Coho </em>facts do not exist here. Although there is evidence that Noble frequently had a company representative on site, there is no proof that he directed the aspect of the work causing the injury, nor that he was even present at the accident. The court has made clear that the mere presence of the owner\u2019s employee, even where he periodically inspects the work, does not create liability. <em>Magee, </em>551 So.2d at 185. An owner\u2019s reasonable access to the operation is not enough. <em>Coho Resources, Inc. v. Chapman, </em>913 So.2d 899, 910 (Miss.2005) (citing <em>Magee, </em>551 So.2d at 186-87).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">McLaurin has not offered any credible evidence that Noble substantially controlled the aspect of the work causing his injury. There were, therefore, no disputes of material fact preventing summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b580-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
