On appeal, McCain raises two challenges to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">McCain first alleges that his sentence violates the Sixth Amendment because his maximum sentence was increased pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), (\u201cACCA\u201d), based on prior convictions that were not proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by him during his plea hearing. Because McCain raises this constitutional argument for the first time on appeal, our review is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>478 F.3d 1382,1338 (11th Cir.2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">Both Supreme Court and this circuit\u2019s precedent foreclose McCain\u2019s arguments. The Supreme Court has held that neither the Constitution nor any statute is violated when a prior offense, not charged in the indictment, is used to increase a sentence. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). We have applied <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in holding that a district court does not violate the Sixth Amendment when a statutory maximum sentence is increased based upon judicial findings of prior convictions that were never proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt or affirmatively admitted by the defendant in his plea hearing. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005). Moreover, we have held that neither <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), nor <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) disturbed the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>AlmendarezTorres. Id. </em>Although various justices of the Supreme Court have questioned the soundness of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in subsequent decisions, until it is expressly overruled, we are bound to follow it. <em>See United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-12\">Because McCain\u2019s prior convictions were used only during sentencing to increase his statutory maximum sentence, his Sixth Amendment rights were not violated. Thus, there was no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-13\">McCain also claims that the statute he was convicted under, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), is unconstitutional on its face and because it exceeds Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power. McCain also raises this constitutional argument for the first time on appeal, thus, our review is for plain error only. <em>See Evans, </em>478 F.3d at 1338.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-14\">We have held that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) is not facially invalid because the term \u201ccommerce\u201d is not defined as \u201cinterstate or foreign.\u201d <em>See United States v. Nichols, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>124 F.3d 1265, 1266 (11th Cir.1997). We have also held that \u00a7 922(g) does not exceed Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power, and that <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995) does not suggest \u201cthat the \u2018minimum nexus\u2019 test should be changed.\u201d <em>See United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387, 389-390 (11th Cir.1996). Because McCain\u2019s Commerce Clause challenges to \u00a7 922(g) are foreclosed by our decisions in <em>Nichols </em>and <em>McAllister, </em>we conclude the district court did not plainly err by sentencing McCain under \u00a7 922(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b78-10\">. To satisfy this standard, an error must have occurred, that was plain, that affected substantial rights, and that \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1276 (11th Cir.2007) (internal brackets omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
