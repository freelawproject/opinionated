Hines paid a $325.00 premium for \u201cCommercial General Liability Coverage\u201d and a $437.00 premium for \u201cCommercial Property Coverage.\u201d The policy ran three months, from November 4, 2004 through February 4, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">During the policy period, Hines renovated the house. She then sold it to Robert and Kathryn Childers in August 2005. A few months later, the Childers sued Hines for negligence and other wrongs, alleging that Hines improperly installed new foundation piers, \u201cfailed to locate and remove wood rot in the flooring, failed to repair the sub-flooring of the house and failed to properly ventilate the foundation of the residence.\u201d Hines requested that Essex defend her in the Childers\u2019 lawsuit, limiting her request for defense to the claim of negligence. Essex declined and brought suit for a declaratory judgment. The district court found summary judgment in favor of Hines, requiring that Essex defend Hines. Essex appeals that judgment, which we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-16\">Under Texas law, which applies here, an insurer has a duty to defend a policyholder in actions brought by a third party who asserts claims potentially covered by the insurance policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When determining whether an insurer owes a duty to defend its insured, Texas courts follow the \u201ceight corners\u201d or \u201ccomplaint allegation\u201d rule,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which directs a court to examine only \u201cthe allegations in the pleadings and the language of the insurance policy.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The \u201clatest amended pleading upon which the insurer based its refusal to defend the action\u201d is the one to be analyzed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is the <em>factual </em>allegations in <em>this pleading </em>that matter;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the duty to defend is not affected by facts ascertained before or during the underlying litigation, or by the ultimate outcome of the underlying case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-17\">Allegations are read liberally in favor of the insured and all doubts are resolved in the insured\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cCourts may not, however, (1) read facts into the pleadings, (2) look outside the pleadings, or (3) imagine factual scenarios which might trigger coverage.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Yet, \u201cwe may draw inferences from the petition that may lead to a finding of coverage.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> So long as the complaint alleges at least one cause of action within the policy\u2019s coverage, the insurer must defend the insured.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>On appeal, Essex argues that the Childers\u2019 claim of negligence against Hines is barred from coverage under the policy because (1) construction work is not covered, and (2) even if construction work is covered, this particular claim of negligence is excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Essex urges that the policy does not cover Hines for construction work. In support, Essex points first to a form in the policy entitled \u201cCommercial General Liability Coverage Part Supplemental Declarations,\u201d which states that the Description of \u201cHazard/Insured Classification\u201d is \u201cDWELLING-SINGLE FAMILY-LESSOR\u2019S RISK ONLY.\u201d Because of the reference to \u201clessor\u2019s risk only,\u201d Essex argues that Hines was not covered for construction work; the policy apparently does not define the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Second, Essex directs us to a form entitled \u201cClassification Limitation Endorsement,\u201d which limits coverage to \u201conly ... those operations specified in the application for insurance on file with the company and described under the \u2018description\u2019 or \u2018classification\u2019 on the declarations policy.\u201d Third, the \u201cLimitation of Coverage to Designated Premises or Project\u201d section of the policy states that \u201c[tjhis insurance applies only to \u2018bodily injury[,] \u2018property damage,\u2019 ... arising out of (1) the ownership, maintenanee, or use of the premises shown in the Schedule and operations necessary or incidental to those premises; or (2) the project shown in the Schedule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">Together, Essex pushes that this language precludes coverage for construction work. Such a conclusion would not be completely implausible. Nonetheless, the \u201cRenovated Property Endorsement\u201d suggests just the opposite: \u201cThis policy covers a renovation project. This policy will cover the usable existing structure which predates the renovation project as insured property.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Where, as here, \u201cthe language used is subject to two or more reasonable interpretations, the construction which affords coverage will be adopted. The policy of strict construction against the insurer is especially strong when the court is dealing with exceptions and words of limitation.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> So long as it is not unreasonable, an interpretation favoring coverage will be adopted even if an interpretation militating against coverage is <em>more </em>reasonable.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">For its part, Essex does not posit what the insurance policy <em>does </em>cover, other than implicitly suggesting that the policy covered Hines as a landlord of an admittedly <em>vacant </em>house, one that Essex knew was being renovated. We will not labor to imagine in its stead. Suffice to say, that if a \u201cCommercial General Liability Cover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>age\u201d policy taken out by a contractor is not generally intended to cover \u201cconstruction,\u201d it might surprise the Texas Supreme Court; it seems to treat this conclusion as axiom.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In any event, Essex does not urge that this particular Commercial General Liability Coverage policy was designed to do something fundamentally different than the innumerable Commercial General Liability policies based on the same \u201cstandard form developed by the Insurance Services Office, Inc.\u201d and \u201cused throughout the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Even if the policy does cover construction work, Essex contends that it specifically excludes the negligent work alleged by the Childers. \u201c[W]hen the plaintiffs petition makes allegations which, if proved, would place the plaintiffs claim within an exclusion from coverage, there is no duty to defend.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201cTexas law places the burden of proving that an exclusion applies on the insurance company.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We narrowly construe exclusions, and draw all reasonable inferences in the insured\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Here, Essex puts forth two exclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The first excludes from coverage property damage that is \u201cexpected or intended from the viewpoint of the insured.\u201d This exclusion does not apply to the current case because the Childers sued Hines primarily for negligence, which does not involve an expected or intended act.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-14\">The second excludes from coverage \u201cproperty damage to ... that particular part of any property that must be restored, repaired or replaced because \u2018your work\u2019 was incorrectly performed on it.\u201d This exclusion further provides that it \u201cdoes not apply to \u2018property damage\u2019 to \u2018your work\u2019 arising out of it or any part of it and included in the Products/Completed Operations Hazard.\u201d The policy defines \u201cyour work\u201d to mean \u201cwork or operations performed by you or on your behalf and materials, parts or equipment furnished in connection with such work or operations\u201d including \u201cwarranties or representations made at any time with respect to the fitness, quality, durability, performance or use of \u2018your work.\u2019 \u201d Our precedent makes plain that the \u201cthat particular part\u201d language of exclusion \u201climits the scope of the exclusion to damage to parts of the property that were actually worked on by the insured.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \u201cIf work on any part of a property would leave an insured exposed for damages to the entire property, the exclusion should state: \u2018Property damage to property that must be restored, repaired or replaced because your work was incorrectly performed on any part of it.\u2019 \u201d Here, reading the factual allegations liberally in favor of coverage \u2014 as we must<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>\u2014the Childers seek damages beyond that of repairing Hines\u2019s renovation work, i.e. portions of the house which Hines did not replace or renovate, or did not claim she replaced or renovated.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Finally, Hines filed a counterclaim seeking attorney\u2019s fees and other damages against Essex for failing to undertake her defense and prosecuting this declaratory judgment action. Neither party addressed this counterclaim in their motions for summary judgment and the district court entered a final judgment in favor of Hines without noting it. We do not read the district court\u2019s final judgment as reaching the merits of Hines\u2019s counterclaim; we instead leave it to the district court\u2019s authority and discretion.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s summary judgment on the question of whether Essex has a duty to defend Hines under Texas law: it does.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b622-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
