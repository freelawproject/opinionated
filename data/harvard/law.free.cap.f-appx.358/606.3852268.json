Yet, when, as in this case, the BIA \u201caffirm[ed] without opinion\u201d the reasoning of the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), \u201cthe decision of the [IJ], and not the Board\u2019s summary affirmance, [is] the proper subject of judicial review.\u201d <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832 (5th Cir.2003). We conclude that the IJ\u2019s denial of Petitioner\u2019s application was correct and therefore deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">\u201cTo be eligible for withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate a \u2018clear probability\u2019 of persecution upon return.\u201d <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 138 (5th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Faddoul v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1994)). \u201cA clear probability means that it is more likely than not that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened by persecution on account of either his [or her] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Petitioner argued below, as well as on appeal, that her \u201canti-gang values\u201d and \u201cher refusal to abide\u201d by the rules set forth by local gangs, particularly their demands for money, led to her persecution and qualify her as a member of a particular social group, the community against gangs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, the IJ stated in an oral order that Petitioner\u2019s personal political views or refusal to pay bribes to local gangs were insufficient to qualify her as a member of a protected social group as each was not an \u201cimmutable characteristic,\u201d which is necessary to form the basis of a social group.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">In general, \u201c[i]n a petition for review ... determinations as to purely legal questions are reviewed de novo.\u201d <em>Andrade v. Gonzales, </em>459 F.3d 538, 542 (5th Cir.2006). Findings of fact must be upheld \u201c \u2018unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kane v. Holder, </em>581 F.3d 231, 237 (5th Cir.2009) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B)). There is some question as to whether the agency\u2019s construction of what constitutes a \u201csocial group\u201d is entitled to deference \u2014 either <em>Chevron </em>or <em>Skidmore, see Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984); <em>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944) \u2014 and even if it is a determination of law or fact. <em>See Ramos-Lopez v. Holder, </em>563 F.3d 855, 858-60 (9th Cir.2009) (stating that \u201cthe BIA\u2019s determination, in a published disposition\u201d of what is a social group \u201cis entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference,\u201d but not addressing the deference given to unpublished dispositions); <em>Argueta-Rodriguez v. INS, </em>No. 95-2367, 1997 WL 693064, at *5 (4th Cir. Oct.29, 1997) (unpublished) (Ervin, J., concurring in judgment) (reviewing the debate as to whether this determination is one of law or fact). This is an open issue in this Circuit. Nonetheless, because we conclude that Petitioner\u2019s argument fails under the most liberal standard of review, de novo review, we need not reach that issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>We find no basis on which to reverse the IJ\u2019s determination that Petitioner failed to establish that she was a member of a particular social group so as to qualify for withholding of removal. \u201cTo establish that he [or she] is a member of a \u2018particular social group,\u2019 an applicant must show that he [or she] was a member of a group of persons that share a common immutable characteristic....\u201d <em>Mwembie v. Gonzales, </em>443 F.3d 405, 414-15 (5th Cir.2006). Numerous other cases, like the IJ\u2019s opinion in this case, have held that one\u2019s personal anti-gang values or antagonistic relationship with gangs does not amount to a common immutable characteristic establishing a particular social group. <em>See, e.g., Cua-Tumax v. Holder, </em>343 Fed.Appx. 995, 997 (5th Cir.2009) (unpublished) (\u201cWe, like the BIA and IJ, hold that Cua-Tumax has failed to establish that he is a member of any particular social group. The categories of youth and gang recruitment are overly broad and offer no meaningful basis for distinguishing Cua-Tumax from other persons.\u201d); <em>Villanueva-Amaya v. Holder, </em>344 Fed.Appx. 97, 100 (5th Cir.2009) (unpublished) (\u201cThe petitioners failed to present compelling evidence that young Honduran males exposed to gang violence are part of [a] particular social group, who have common immutable characteristics.\u201d). We find no basis on which to distinguish these cases, where petitioners shared similar experiences with an identifiable group and still were not found to be members of a social group, from the instant case, where Petitioner fails to articulate how one would identify the members of her alleged social group and does not suggest that others participated in like activities or shared in her experiences. Therefore, we uphold the IJ\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Because we uphold the IJ\u2019s determination that Petitioner failed to demonstrate that she had the requisite status for withholding of removal, we need not reach her other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b633-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b633-8\">. Petitioner also implies that her anti-gang values could constitute a \"political opinion\" qualifying her for withholding of removal. However, as she fails to cite even one authority supporting this argument, the argument is waived. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A) (Appellant's brief must contain his or her \"contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.... \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
