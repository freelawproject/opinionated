The district did not err in finding that Amendment 706 had no effect on his offense level because Thompson was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Thompson pled guilty to one count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Using the 2000 edition of the Sentencing Guidelines, the probation officer found a base offense level of 26 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 because Thompson was responsible for 14.34 grams of cocaine base. The probation officer also determined that Thompson was a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 because he was at least 18 years old at the time of the offense, the offense was a felony drug offense, and he had at least 2 prior felony convictions for a crime of violence. The probation officer raised Thompson\u2019s offense level to 32 and recommended that Thompson receive a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total offense level of 29. Thompson automatically received a criminal history category of VI under \u00a7 4B1.1 because he was a career offender. A total offense level of 29 and a criminal history category of VI resulted in a guideline range of 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">At sentencing, the district court adopted the factual findings and guideline application of the PSI, determined a total offense level of 29, a criminal history category of VI, and a guideline range of 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. Accordingly, the district court sentenced Thompson to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment. On 14 March 2008, Thompson filed a <em>pro se </em>motion for appointed counsel in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. Rl-67 at 1-6. He asserted that he was entitled to a reduction in his base offense level based on Amendment 706 to the Guidelines and requested a downward variance based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Rl-68 at 1-14; Rl-69 at 1-7. The district court appointed a public defender to determine whether Thompson was entitled to seek a reduced sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Rl-70. Thompson filed a motion to withdraw his initial \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, which the district court granted. Rl-72, 73. Thereafter, Thompson filed a renewed <em>pro se </em>motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), arguing that he was entitled to a reduced sentence under Amendment 706 despite our decision in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. ---, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156, <em>and, </em>\u2014 U.S. ----, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009). R1-74 at 1-18. The district court denied Thompson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, finding that Amendment 706 had no effect on his base offense level because he was sentenced as a career offender, and cited <em>Moore </em>in support. Rl-76 at 1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b123-14\">On appeal, Thompson concedes that he was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction under <em>Moore </em>because he was sentenced as a career offender. Nevertheless, he wishes to preserve the issue for a subsequent appeal to the Supreme Court. Thompson also contends that one of his qualifying offenses under \u00a7 4B1.1 is no longer considered a crime of violence under the Guidelines and that he is preparing a writ seeking relief from his classification as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-15\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion and its conclusions regarding the scope of its legal authority <em>de novo. United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except where expressly permitted by statute or by Fed.R.Crim.P. 35. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B). One statutory exception to this general rule includes relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)] to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A district court lacks authority to grant a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction where the defendant was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Because Thompson was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, the district court did not err in concluding that it lacked authority to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Even if Amendment 706 would have reduced his base offense level, it did not alter the guideline range upon which his sentence was based. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. To the extent that Thompson\u2019s reply brief argues that he was qualified for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because he was incorrectly classified as a career offender at his original sentencing, he abandoned that argument by failing to raise it in his initial brief on appeal. <em>See United States v. Magluta, </em>418 F.3d 1166, 1185-86 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief are abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Because the district court did not err in concluding that Amendment 706 had no effect on his offense level since Thompson was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1., we AFFIRM his sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
