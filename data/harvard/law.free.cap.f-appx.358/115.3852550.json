The district court, acting <em>sua sponte, </em>denied her initial complaint for failure to state a claim, but granted her leave to amend. She filed an amended complaint and again sought leave to proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d). The court denied leave, but allowed her to supplement application for IFP status by filing financial documentation corroborating her monthly income, mortgage, and other expenses. She filed such documentation, but the court denied it. She then moved the court for reconsideration of its ruling, and the court denied her motion \u2014 under the impression that she failed to submit proof of her monthly in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>come and her monthly mortgage payment. Thomas now appeals the court\u2019s denial of her motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of an application for IFP status under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a) and motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion. <em>Martinez v. Kristi Kleaners, Inc., </em>364 F.3d 1305, 1306 (11th Cir.2004) (IFP); <em>Farris v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir.2003) (reconsideration). \u201c[P]proceeding [IFP] is a privilege, not a right,\u201d <em>see Camp v. Oliver, </em>798 F.2d 434, 437 (11th Cir.1986). The district court therefore has -wide discretion in ruling on an application for IFP status, and should grant the privilege \u201csparingly\u201d in civil cases for damages, <em>see Martinez, </em>364 F.3d at 1306. However, a district court cannot act arbitrarily or deny the application on erroneous grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 1306-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">When considering a motion filed pursuant to \u00a7 1915(a), \u201c[t]he only determination to be made by the court ... is whether the statements in the affidavit satisfy the requirement of poverty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1307. A person need not be \u201cabsolutely destitute\u201d or reduce herself to a public charge in order to proceed IFP; rather, \u201can affidavit will be held sufficient if it represents that the litigant, because of [her] poverty, is unable to pay for the court fees and costs, and to support and provide necessities for [herself] and [her] dependents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A district court may not deny an IFP motion without first comparing the party\u2019s assets and liabilities in order to determine whether the party has satisfied the poverty requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 1307-08. Moreover, a district court\u2019s review of a party\u2019s ability to pay is not limited by the application, as it may \u201clook beyond\u201d the application to determine a party\u2019s financial condition. <em>Id. </em>at 1307 n. 3 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Here, the district court overlooked evidence submitted by Thomas that supported her IFP claim. The court failed to compare her assets against her liabilities to determine whether she satisfied the poverty requirement. The court therefore abused its discretion in denying Thomas\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand with instructions that the court either grant Thomas IFP status or conduct further proceedings consistent with the foregoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
