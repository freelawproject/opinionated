We affirm for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">James Offord injured his head and spine when he fell off the trailer bed of an eighteen-wheeled truck. His employer, Western Express, had been hired by United States Gypsum Corporation (\u201cGypsum\u201d) to deliver sheetrock to Seacoast. Seacoast\u2019s employees were responsible for unloading the sheetrock from Offord\u2019s truck, but Offord had to first remove the tarps used to cover the load. Offord climbed on top of the load <em>to </em>remove one <em>of the </em>tarps, slipped on a wet plastic sheet, and fell to the ground below. Although he received workers\u2019 compensation benefits from his employer, Offord sued both Gypsum and Seacoast for additional damages. The district court entered summary judgment in favor of Seacoast and Gypsum on all claims. Offord now appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Seacoast only.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo.\u201d Fahim v. Marriott Hotel Servs., Inc., </em>551 F.3d 344, 348 (5th Cir.2008). Summary judgment is appropriate only \u201cif the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Offord contends that Seacoast unreasonably failed to warn him not to climb on top of his truck, provide him with safety \u201cfall\u201d equipment, or otherwise help him remove the tarp. He also asserts that Seacoast had a duty to \u201cinform and require plaintiff to follow [Seacoast\u2019s] safety rules,\u201d which prohibit climbing on top of trucks to remove tarps, and to follow OSHA guidelines. Though Offord mainly contends that Seacoast is independently liable for failing to provide him with a safe work environment, he begins by arguing that Seacoast is vicariously liable for, presumably, his employer\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">Under Louisiana law, a principal is generally not liable for the torts of its independent contractors. <em>See, e.g., Roberts v. Cardinal Servs. Inc., </em>266 F.3d 368, 380 (5th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 954, 122 S.Ct. 1357, 152 L.Ed.2d 353 (2002). There are two exceptions to this rule. A principal may be liable if (1) it maintains operational control over the injury causing activity or (2) the activity is ultrahazardous. <em>Id. </em>The district court found that neither exception was implicated. On appeal, Offord argues that the first exception applies because \u201cSeacoast exercises complete control of the loading and unloading of loads.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">Nothing in the record indicates that Seacoast controlled the manner in which Of-ford was to complete his work. As the district court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-12\">[T]he facts presented ... establish only that Seacoast ordered a load of sheet-rock from U.S. Gypsum, that U.S. Gypsum contracted with Western Express to deliver the sheetrock to Seacoast, that Western Express employees covered the load with plastic tarps for weather protection, and that Seacoast employees would accept and unload the sheetrock if its condition was found satisfactory upon inspection. [Seacoast\u2019s] standard procedure was simply to provide adequate space for untarping, and otherwise rely upon the expertise of the delivery drivers to accomplish this task in accordance with their training, their employer\u2019s directives, and any requirements imposed by the contractual arrangement between the shipper and transportation company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ak4\">The district court further noted that Of-ford, \u201cnot someone at Seacoast, decided how to remove the tarp\u201d and \u201cthat no one forced or directed him to climb up on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>load or did anything that caused him to be on the load.\u201d These findings are supported by the record. The district court was therefore correct to hold that Seacoast should not be held vicariously liable for Offord\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The district court was also right that Offord has not established any independent fault on Seacoast\u2019s part. \u201cGenerally, the owner or operator of a facility has the duty of exercising reasonable care for the safety of persons on the premises and the duty of not exposing such persons to unreasonable risks of injury or harm.\u201d <em>Manning v. Dillard Dep\u2019t Stores, Inc., </em>753 So.2d 163, 165 (La.1999). The extent of that duty is determined by the particular facts of the individual case. <em>Crane v. Exxon, </em>613 So.2d 214, 221 (La.Ct.App.1992). Offord argues that Seacoast negligently failed to provide him with safety equipment and help removing the tarp. In support, he cites several cases in which a principal assumed the duty to provide a safe work environment by actively supervising its independent contractors. <em>Id.; Moore v. Safeway, </em>700 So.2d 831 (La.Ct. App.1996). For reasons already discussed, these cases are distinguishable. There is no evidence that Seacoast controlled or actively supervised Offord\u2019s work. Offord points to no case imposing a duty on principals to provide safety equipment or assistance to its independent contractors, absent such a showing. <em>See Davenport v. Am,ax Nickel, Inc., </em>569 So.2d 23, 28 (La. Ct.App.1990) (\u201cWe are not aware of a Louisiana statute or jurisprudence which imposes a duty\u201d on a principal to provide an independent contractor \u201cwith adequate fall protection.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The Occupational Safety and Health Act standards, according to Offord, establish that Seacoast breached a duty of care to him. The duty of one employer to comply with OSHA standards for the benefit of another employer has only been recognized by this circuit in the multiemployer construction work site context. <em>Am. Petroleum Inst. v. OSHA, </em>581 F.2d 493, 509 (5th Cir.1978). This court has rejected any such duty outside the multiemployer work site context. <em>See Horn v. C.L. Osborn Contracting Co., </em>591 F.2d 318, 321 (5th Cir.1979); <em>Southeast Contractors, Inc. v. Dunlop, </em>512 F.2d 675, 675 (5th Cir.1975) (per curiam). Offord fails to brief whether such a worksite existed here and the record does not suggest that Seacoast acted as a general contractor. More importantly, Offord fails to identify any OSHA safety regulation that was potentially violated by Seacoast. These arguments are therefore waived. <em>Goodman v. Harris County, </em>571 F.3d 388, 399 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Finally, Offord argues that Seacoast had the duty to warn him not to climb on the tarp. He cites several cases stating that \u201c[i]t is the duty of one doing construction work to properly label, mark or barricade places in the construction site that present an unreasonable risk of harm to those in the area.\u201d <em>Toledano v. Sewerage &amp; Water Bd., </em>671 So.2d 973, 976 (La.Ct.App.1996); <em>see also, e.g., Carr v. Boh Bros. Const. Co., </em>557 So.2d 356, 358 (La.Ct.App.1990). None of the cited cases impose a duty to warn on facts similar to those at issue. Indeed, none of these cases deal with a principal\u2019s liability for injuries sustained by an independent contractor. Consequently, these cases do not alter the court\u2019s conclusion that Offord has failed to show that Seacoast acted negligently.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">The district court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of Seacoast on Offord\u2019s negligence claim. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b567-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
