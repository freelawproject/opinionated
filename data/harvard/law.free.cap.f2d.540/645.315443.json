In his complaint, White alleged that Korvettes violated 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1637 by failing to provide \u201ca brief identification ... of the goods or services purchased\u201d as required by the Act in connection with a series of 12 purchases made by him and his wife in 1971 and 1972. He sought the statutory minimum penalty of $100 for each violation plus costs and attorney\u2019s fees as provided in the Act. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640. The district court denied relief, holding that White lacked standing to sue and that the identification provided by Korvettes was sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree, and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">White or his wife on 12 occasions between June 1, 1971, and February 1, 1972,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> made purchases at Korvettes department store located at Rockville, Maryland, using White\u2019s Korvettes credit card. On each of these occasions, White or his wife was provided with a charge slip and a cash register tape associated with the purchase. Each charge slip indicated the date arid amount of the sale and, with the exception of the June 1 slip which showed no identifying designation at all, identified the goods purchased as either \u201cApparel\u201d or \u201cHard Goods.\u201d The cash register tape gave the date, the total amount of the purchase, and the price of each item.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">White kept these charge slips and cash register tapes. Upon receiving the monthly billing statement from Korvettes, which contained no identification of the purchased goods but only the date and amount of purchase,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> White compared the amount shown with the corresponding charge slips and cash register tapes. The district court found that using this procedure White was able to verify the accuracy of each billing statement involved in this case. 374 F.Supp. at 158, 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">The Korvettes department store at Rock-ville, Maryland, is composed of 64 separate departments, each offering a \u201cplethora of items of merchandise.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Items brought in 25 of these departments were checked out through that particular department\u2019s register. Goods selected from any of the other 39 departments could be purchased through a \u201ccentral checkout.\u201d Some of these departments identified goods with one of only two designations, \u201cApparel\u201d <em>or </em>\u201cHard Goods;\u201d others, such as the optical, watch repair, and shoe departments, provided more specific designations. For purchases made through central checkout, items were identified either as \u201cApparel\u201d or \u201cHard Goods\u201d or more specifically<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> depending <em>not </em>on the nature of the goods bought at these locations but on which of these two identifications happened to be permanently affixed to the imprinters used for charge card transactions at the checkout center selected by the customer. In short, the designation meant nothing except that the customer had fortuitously picked a particular checkout register.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>White claims that Korvettes\u2019 practices in this case violated the disclosure requirements of the Truth in Lending Act as applied to \u201copen end consumer credit plans\u201d by failing to give as part of each billing statement \u201ca brief identification (unless previously furnished) of the goods or services purchased.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1637(b)(2).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He seeks the statutory minimum penalty for each of the 12 violations plus costs and attorney\u2019s fees under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The court held that White was not an \u201caggrieved debtor\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and thus lacked standing to maintain this action since he \u201cfaced no actual or threatened injury as a result of defendant\u2019s billing practices.\u201d 374 F.Supp. at 158.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">It was plaintiff\u2019s regular practice to pay his bill within the 25 days allowed before a finance charge would- be incurred. He thus never sought any extension of credit from defendant which would have resulted in any obligation on his part to pay finance or interest charges for debt incurred. Furthermore, plaintiff has neither alleged nor proved that he ever failed to identify the goods for which he was billed. Thus, he has not alleged nor proved his need for pertinent information from defendant to permit him to compare the cost of- credit terms offered by defendant with those offered by other discount stores or lending institutions so that he might shop effectively for the best credit buy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-18\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b712-19\">We believe the district court\u2019s ruling in this case and its reliance on <em>Bostwick </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>319 F.Supp. 875 (N.D.Ohio 1970), is thoroughly undermined by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mourning v. Family Publications Service, Inc., </em>411 U.S. 356, 93 S.Ct. 1652, 36 L.Ed.2d 318 (1973). In that case the Court concluded that 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640 allows \u201cimposition of a civil penalty in cases where no finance charge is involved but where a regulation requiring disclosure has been violated.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-20\">In light of the emphasis Congress placed on agency rule making and on private and administrative enforcement of the Act, we cannot conclude that Congress intended those who failed to comply with regulations to be subject to no penalty or to criminal penalties alone. As the District Court concluded, imposition of the minimum sanction is proper in cases such as this, <em>where the finance charge is nonexistent or undetermined.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-21\"><em>Id. </em>at 376, 93 S.Ct. at 1664 (emphasis added). <em>See also Sellers v. Wollman, </em>510 F.2d 119, 123 (5th Cir.1975); <em>Palmer v. Wilson, </em>359 F.Supp. 1099, 1104 (N.D.Cal.1973), <em>vacated, </em>502 F.2d 860 (9th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number><em>Mourning </em>affirmed implicitly the position taken in <em>Ratner v. Chemical Bank New York Trust Co., </em>329 F.Supp. 270 (S.D.NY. 1971), as to congressional purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-5\">The scheme of the statute, as both sides agree, is to create a species of \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d to participate prominently in enforcement. The language should be construed liberally in light of its broadly remedial purpose. Thus construed, it plainly encompasses this suit. As plaintiff demonstrates in detail, but this court finds it sufficient to note briefly, the omission' with which defendant is charged occurred \u201cin connection with [a] consumer credit transaction . . . .\u201d The fact that there was no finance charge <em>at the time </em>of the omission is of no consequence. <em>The fact that there might never be one </em>(i. e., if despite defendant\u2019s invitation to pay only $10 and incur a finance charge, plaintiff paid the whole balance and incurred none) <em>is also unimportant, </em>as is the fact that plaintiff actually did thereafter incur and pay such a charge [emphasis added]. It is sufficient for present purposes that (1) there was a readily knowable \u201cfinance charge in connection with the transaction,\u201d and (2) this relatively trivial detail serves, after all, not as the <em>ground for liability </em>but merely as the initial step in what defendant accurately calls the statute\u2019s \u201csole measure of damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-7\">Beyond using the finance charge as such an available and handy reference point, presumably to be replaced in the normal case by the $100 minimum or $1,000 maximum, Congress made clear its broader scheme, and broader system of reimbursement, for private enforcement. It invited people like the present plaintiff, <em>whether they were themselves deceived or not, </em>to sue in the public interest [emphasis added]. Following familiar precedents, it encouraged such actions by providing, in addition to the incentive of public service, costs and a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee above the minimum recovery of $100. Cf. <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Piggie Park Enterprises, </em>390 U.S. 400, 88 S.Ct. 964,19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 280-81 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">Under the Truth in Lending Act as explicated above, we are convinced that White was \u201cadversely affected\u201d or \u201caggrieved\u201d within the standing requirements as developed in <em>Linda R. S. v. Richard D., </em>410 U.S. 614, 93 S.Ct. 1146, 35 L.Ed.2d 536 (1973); <em>Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., 409 U.S. 205, 93 S.Ct. 364, 34 L.Ed.2d 415 (1972); Sierra Club v. Morton, </em>405 U.S. 727, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972); and <em>Data Processing Service v. Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-14\">In <em>Linda R. S., supra, </em>the Court, while recognizing clearly that Congress may not confer jurisdiction on Article III courts to render advisory opinions,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> noted that Congress may \u201cenact statutes creating legal rights, the invasion of which creates standing, even though no injury would exist without the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 617 n. 3., 93 S.Ct. at 1148. <em>See also O\u2019Shea v. Littleton, </em>414 U.S. 488, 493 n. 2, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974). We conclude that in the disclosure requirements of the Truth in Lending Act Congress created precisely the type of statutory right discussed in <em>Linda R. S., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-15\">The Act creates specific duties in creditors and specific rights to information in debtors, and in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640 provides that any creditor who breaches his statutory duty will be subject to suit by the debtor for enforcement of his rights to the information. It is essential to note that Congress in creating this statutory scheme did not impose simply a general duty of \u201cadequate disclosure\u201d upon creditors and provide for suit only by debtors able to show that they were \u201caggrieved\u201d by the creditor\u2019s inadequate performance. Rather, Congress gave the debtor a right to specific information and therefore defined \u201cinjury in fact\u201d as the failure to disclose such information. <em>Compare Trafficante, supra. Cf. Robles v. EPA, </em>484 F.2d 843 (4th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>We believe that under the above analysis that neither the absence of any service charges nor the failure of Korvettes\u2019 practices to deceive White,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> relied on by the district judge, deny White standing to sue under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">The district court also noted that White failed to show any need for further information in order to allow him to shop effectively for credit. Clearly, the chief purpose of the Act is to make such comparison shopping possible, but that is not the exclusive purpose. The Act is also a \u201cdisclosure law\u201d intended to protect the public from false and fictitious charges and to thus avoid \u201cthe uninformed use of credit.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601. <em>See also </em>1968 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News at p. 1963. We conclude that the district court\u2019s focus on the legislative purpose was too narrow and that the Act\u2019s disclosure requirement is clear. We therefore, hold that White had standing to sue under the Act.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The district court concluded that the identification of goods or services provided by Korvettes to White at the time of purchase satisfied the disclosure requirements of the Act. It based its decision on these findings of fact: (1) the 12 transactions included purchases of \u201cclothing, slide projector trays, photographic prints, light bulbs, phonograph records and toys;\u201d (2) the clothing was identified on the charge slips as \u201cApparel\u201d and the other purchases were identified as \u201cHard Goods;\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (3) White was able to identify all but two of these purchases at the time his deposition was taken many months later; (4) White or his wife knew what had been purchased on each occasion at the time the relevant bill was paid; and (5) the imprinted terms supplied were sufficient to allow White to decide whether to pay his bill at once or defer payment under the credit terms available.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-13\">We agree with White that the district court erroneously construed the disclosure requirements of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1637(b)(2). It is agreed that the identification requirement was not met by the monthly billing statement, which showed only the date and amounts of purchases. Nor was it met by Korvettes\u2019 practice of furnishing the charge slip and cash register tape<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> at the time of purchase because neither identified the goods purchased.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As we have previously noted,\u201cApparel\u201d and \u201cHard Goods\u201d designations meant nothing. Unless the customer remembered, he could not know whether he had bought gourmet foods or auto accessories.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We hold that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>the designations \u201cHard Goods\u201d and \u201cApparel\u201d as applied to the purchases made by White did not provide \u201ca brief identification of the goods or services purchased.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The district court found that the first two of the 12 transactions involved in this case were rescinded when White\u2019s wife returned the items purchased and received a full refund.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> With respect to the final two purchases, the court found that White complained of the quality of the goods and services provided, refused to pay the bill, and attempted to repudiate the transaction, stating that if sued he would defend on the grounds that he received \u201cpoor merchandise.\u201d The court, relying on <em>Bostwick, supra, </em>concluded that White could not recover on any of these four transactions since \u201crescinding customers are not within the class of persons which the civil liability provisions of the Act seek to protect.\u201d 374 F.Supp. at 158. We believe with the Fifth and Ninth Circuits that <em>Bostwick </em>was wrongly decided and this position is untenable. <em>Sellers v. Wollman, supra; Eby v. Reb Realty, Inc., </em>495 F.2d 646 (9th Cir. 1974); <em>Palmer v. Wilson, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">But that is not the end of the matter. Although we hold the remedies are not mutually exclusive and that election is not required, it does not necessarily follow that in every such ease the buyer is entitled to both rescind and recover the statutory damages for failure to disclose. In each of the cited cases, recision was effectuated under the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1635, which creates a right of recision as to certain transactions, not including open end consumer credit plans of the type involved in this case. Where both remedies are made available by the Act, legislative intent to permit both in the same case is easier to discern. <em>See Sellers v. Wollman, supra </em>at 123; <em>Eby v. Reb Realty, supra </em>at 651-52. We leave open the question whether a buyer who rescinds <em>all </em>purchases is entitled to recover for nondisclosure. Such a situation may present possibility of abuse. Enabling one who makes no final purchase, expends no money, and incurs no finance charge or interest to recover from a nondisclosing dealer may go beyond the intent of Congress in enacting this legislation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-14\">But that is not our case. Here, whatever White\u2019s motivation, the transactions were genuine, and it matters not, we think, that two out of 12 transactions are in dispute and two others rescinded.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-15\">We reverse and remand with instructions that judgment will be entered for White on all counts and that costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> as determined by the district court be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-16\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b710-17\">.

This exemption has been written into the bill by your committee to avoid the possibility that anyone, <em>not a party to an actual transaction, </em>seeing an advertisement not complying with the disclosure requirements of the bill would attempt to seek civil penalties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-20\">1968 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News at 1976 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b715-21\">. We note that White appeared pro se in the district court. Since the question was not presented below, and has not been briefed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>appeal, we intimate no opinion whatsoever as to whether or not one who appears pro se is entitled to counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">In <em>Bone v. Hibernia Bank, </em>354 F.Supp. 310 (N.D.Cal.1973), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>493 F.2d 135 (9th Cir. 1974), the district judge simply asserted, without analysis, that \u201c[i]t is well settled\u201d that one who appears pro se is not entitled to counsel fees. We believe the authorities cited are insufficient to establish such an absolute rule. One of the two cases employed by the district judge directly supports his statement. The other does so by analogy in that it denies attorney\u2019s fees to a party represented by the Legal Aid Society. We believe that second case is wrongly decided. <em>Tillman v. Wheaton-Haven Recreation Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>517 F.2d 1141, 1147-48 (4th Cir. 1975). <em>See also Sellers v. Wollman, supra </em>at 123. There are many cases, <em>e. g., Miller v. Amusement Enterprises, Inc., </em>426 F.2d 534 (5th Cir. 1970) that award counsel fees in fact situations falling outside the traditional attorney-client relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-20\">We believe the question of attorney\u2019s fees in this case is an open one \u2014 ultimately dependent upon analysis of congressional purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION ON PETITION TO REHEAR</p>\n<author id=\"b716-4\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">In its petition for rehearing, Korvettes expresses concern that our opinion will outlaw designations such as \u201capparel\u201d and \u201chard goods\u201d even though accurately affixed to goods purchased. That was not the nature of the system used by Korvettes. As we made clear in our opinion,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">[f]or purchases made through central checkout, items were identified either as \u201cApparel\u201d or \u201cHard Goods\u201d or more specifically depending <em>not </em>on the nature of the goods bought at these locations but on which of these two identifications happened to be permanently affixed to the imprinters used for charge card transactions at the checkout center selected by the customer. In short, the designation meant nothing except that the customer had fortuitously picked a particular checkout register.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">At p. 647 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">It was the arbitrary nature of Korvettes\u2019 system that was presented by this appeal. For example, White\u2019s best recollection of purchases made on December 16 was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbQ\">Okay. Looking at the date and looking at the calendar that I have here, which shows that Hanukkah started on December 15, I would say that some of these items are <em>probably toys, </em>and perhaps it\u2019s all on one tape. I don\u2019t know but <em>perhaps everything was toys on there. </em>If that is not so, I really don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-13\">App. 224 (emphasis added). Those purchases were identified on the charge slip as \u201cApparel.\u201d App. 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-14\">We intimate no opinion as to whether the labels \u201chard goods\u201d and \u201capparel\u201d would satisfy the Act if properly affixed to the goods they identify.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-15\">We agree with Arlen Realty that the amendment to the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(g), which was not previously brought to our attention, makes it clear that White is entitled to a statutory recovery totaling $100 for the multiple violations involved in this case, and we so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-16\">Except as modified, we adhere to our prior opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-17\">BOREMAN, Senior Circuit Judge, dissented.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
