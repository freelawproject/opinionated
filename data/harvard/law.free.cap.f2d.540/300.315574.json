Because of the size of its service area, employees often have to travel away from their home base, both on day trips during normal business hours and on overnight trips. The company, in accord with a longstanding policy, reimburses its employees for legitimate expenses of transportation, meals and lodging when traveling on company business. In the present case, only reimbursements made for lunches eaten away from employee\u2019s normal duty area during non-overnight trips are at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>The company reimburses employees for these lunches if they are taken away from their normal work stations or job sites at the time of their noonday meal. The amount of reimbursement depends upon the employee\u2019s status. Union employees and operating employees of the Western Division (the only division of the company as yet ununionized) receive a flat rate of $1.40 per noonday meal eaten away from their normal post of duty. This is provided for in the union\u2019s collective bargaining agreement. The full $1.40 can be, and often is, claimed regardless of the amount actually spent on lunch \u2014 in many cases the reimbursement is claimed even when the employee brings his lunch from home. Other employees \u2014 those on a salaried basis \u2014 are reimbursed for their actual expenses up to $25 per meal. During 1963, the Tax year in question, the company paid its employees $139,936.12 in reimbursements for such noonday meals. The company did not withhold income tax for its employees with respect to this sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">In 1971, the District Director of Internal Revenue Service assessed against the company withholding taxes for these noon-meal reimbursements (plus interest thereon) totaling $36,615.72. The company paid the sum and sued for a refund. The district court held that the reimbursements were not \u201cwages\u201d under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401(a) relying primarily on a case from the Fourth Circuit, <em>Royster Co. v. United States, </em>479 F.2d 387 (4th Cir. 1973). Thus it held that the. reimbursements were not subject to withholding for income tax purposes and rendered judgment for the plaintiffs. The government appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Under the Internal Revenue Code provisions requiring collection of income tax at its source, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3401 <em>et seq., </em>an employer must withhold from an employee and pay to the government a certain portion of the'-employee\u2019s \u201cwages.\u201d Section 3401(a) defines \u201cwages\u201d as \u201call remuneration ... for services performed by an employee for his employer, including the cash value of all remuneration paid in any medium other than cash . .\u201d The regulations further make clear that the name by which the remuneration is designated is immaterial, as is the basis upon which it is paid.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The question which this case presents is whether reimbursements for noon meals on non-overnight trips constitute \u201cwages\u201d as so defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">Clearly, these reimbursements are non-deductible income to the employees. In <em>United States v. Correll, </em>389 U.S. 299, 88 S.Ct. 445, 19 L.Ed.2d 537 (1967), the Supreme Court upheld the ruling of the Commissioner <em>(see, e. g., </em>Treas.Reg. \u00a7\u2022 1.162-17(b)(3)(h)) that expenses incurred for meals on business trips are deductible only if the trip requires sleep or rest (i. e., an overnight stay). Thus, these reimbursements made for meals on a non-overnight trip are non-deductible income. <em>Wilson v. United States, </em>412 F.2d 694 (1st Cir. 1969) (reimbursement for \u201cmid-shift\u201d meal of state trooper, given if the trooper was more than 10 miles from home barracks, held non-deductible income). However, as the government concedes, not all payments constituting income to an employee fall into the category of remuneration for employee services or \u201cwages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>The Supreme Court although not having interpreted this particular section, on at least two occasions has given broad definition to that which constitutes remuneration for employee services. In <em>Commissioner v. LoBue, </em>351 U.S. 243, 247, 76 S.Ct. 800, 803, 100 L.Ed. 1142 (1956), the Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac_\">When assets are transferred by an employer to an employee to secure better services they are plainly compensation. . LoBue received a very substantial economic and financial benefit from his employer prompted by the employer\u2019s desire to get better work from him. This is \u201ccompensation for personal service\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 22(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">And in <em>Social Security Board v. Nierotko, </em>327 U.S. 358, 365-66, 66 S.Ct. 637, 641, 90 L.Ed. 718 (1946), the Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">We think that \u201cservice\u201d . . . means not only work actually done but the entire employer-employee relationship for which compensation is paid to the employee by the employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">These statements lead us to agree with the view taken by the Second Circuit in <em>Educational Fund of the Electrical Industry v. United States, </em>426 F.2d 1053 (2d Cir. 1970). In that case, the question presented was whether $140 paid to electricians in lieu of wages for successfully attending a one-week course at a school established by the union constituted \u201cwages\u201d for withholding purposes. The court held that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">The $140 payments to those who attended the school represented part of the benefit package which was negotiated as part of the wage structure under the collective bargaining agreement in effect between the employers and the union as representative of the electrical workers. The payments ultimately derived from the employers and represented a portion of the agreed upon remuneration for services performed by the employees within the intent of Section 3401(a), just as do payments from pension and vacation funds.</p>\n<p id=\"A4r\"><em>Id., </em>at 1056. This expansive definition of \u201cwages\u201d seems appropriate and harmonizes well with the underlying purposes of the withholding tax system to collect income at its source and to prevent unexpected burdensome tax liabilities come April 15.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-13\">Having found this view appropriate, the opinion of the Fourth Circuit in <em>Royster Co. v. United States, </em>479 F.2d 387 (4th Cir. 1973), appears unpersuasive. The court in <em>Royster </em>held that payments to salesmen to reimburse them for the cost of their noon meals while in their sales territory did not constitute \u201cwages\u201d for withholding purposes. The government concedes, as it must, that <em>Royster </em>is not meaningfully distinguishable from the present case. The <em>Royster </em>court took a narrow view of the meaning of \u201cremuneration for services\u201d holding that because the salesmen \u201cperformed no services while eating, directly or indirectly,\u201d the reimbursement for the meal was not remuneration for services. <em>Id., </em>at 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-14\">Remuneration for services cannot be viewed this narrowly. The employment relationship is a two-sided bargain, with the employee\u2019s services being given for a total package of remuneration, including salary, pension, paid vacation time and other remuneration such as reimbursed lunches. Clearly, in the present case, the employer had no obligation to pay for employee lunches. And certainly, the employee gains by the payment; otherwise, the employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>would have to pay for lunch himself. It cannot be doubted that the lunch reimbursements are part of a total package of remuneration designed to attract and hold good employees to the company. As such, they must be considered \u201cwages\u201d under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401(a) for withholding tax purposes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Since the noon meal reimbursements at issue in this case are \u201cwages,\u201d the employer is liable for withholding tax on them. Thus, the assessment of the District Director against the company was proper. The judgment of the district court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-10\">. Treas.Reg. \u00a7 31.3401(a)-1(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aba\">(1) The terms \u201cwages\u201d means all remuneration for services performed by an employee for his employer unless specifically excepted under section 3401(a) or excepted under section 3402(e).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab3\">(2) The name by which the remuneration for services is designated is immaterial. Thus, salaries, fees, bonuses, commissions on sales or on insurance premiums, pensions, and retired pay are wages within the meaning of the statute if paid as compensation for services performed by the employee for his employer,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Agc\">(3) The basis upon which the remuneration is'paid is immaterial in determining whether the remuneration constitutes wages. Thus, it may be paid on the basis of piecework, or a percentage of profits; and may be paid hourly, daily monthly or annually</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b366-10\">. This view accords well with the legislative history of a similar provision, the definition of \u201cwages\u201d under the social security tax system, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3121, a definition held to have \u201cthe same essential meaning\u201d as that for withholding. <em>Royster Co. v. United States, </em>479 F.2d 387, 390 (4th Cir. 1973). The House Report on the initial Social Security Bill, H.R. 7260, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-11\">Wages include not only the cash payments made to the employee for work done, but also compensation for services in any other form, such as room, board, etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-15\">H.R.Rep. No. 615, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 32 (1939-2 Cumm.Bull. 600, 606). The Senate Report contained similar language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-16\">The term \u201cwages\u201d is defined to mean all remuneration for employment, including the cash value of all remuneration paid in any other medium than cash. <em>That is, in addition to money payments, it includes payments in kind, rent, food, lodging, etc.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-17\">S.Rep. No. 628, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 49 (1939-2 Cumm.Bull. 611, 623) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b367-16\">. The company agrees that whatever these reimbursements are classified as, they are still excludable under Treas.Reg. \u00a7 31.3401(a)-1(b)(2) concerning traveling expenses. The regulation provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-17\">Amounts paid specifically \u2014 either as advances or reimbursements \u2014 for traveling or other bona fide ordinary and necessary expenses incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred in the business of the employer are not wages and are not subject to withholding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-26\">However, to be travel expenses, the employee must be on travel status; that is, he must be on an overnight trip. <em>United States v. Correll, </em>389 U.S. 299, 88 S.Ct. 445, 19 L.Ed.2d 537 (1967). Here the employees were not traveling overnight, and thus, the reimbursements were not travel expenses. Nor were the reimbursements necessary business expenses, for an employee\u2019s lunch without more, is not an \u201cordinary and necessary expense incurred in the business of the employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
