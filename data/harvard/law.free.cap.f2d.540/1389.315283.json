These same issues have been dealt with by this court in reviewing the appeal of defendants\u2019 coconspirator, Dan B. Buzzard. <em>United States v. Buzzard, </em>10 Cir., 540 F.2d 1383. For reasons discussed in that opinion we hold the trial court did have adequate subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-4\">Defendants also allege the trial court erred in imposing sentences requiring \u201ccommunity restitution\u201d as a special condition of probation. The trial court gave the maximum fine of $50,000 to each defendant, the individuals were also sentenced to one year in jail. The court then reduced the sentences of Thomas E. Wolf, Johnnie Mack Goodman and Kit Pettigrew to imprisonment for six months, remainder suspended to probation for five years on condition that they pay certain sums<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as restitution and reparations to the Curry-Roosevelt County Council on Alcoholism, Inc. The execution of the sentences of the remaining defendants was suspended to probation for five years on condition that they also pay certain sums<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to the Council. As a result of the trial court\u2019s sentencing, the Curry-Roosevelt County Council on Alcoholism, Inc. would receive $233,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-5\">The trial court\u2019s reasoning is indicated by the order as to Fred W. Johnson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1454-6\">It is further ordered that execution'of sentence as to both fine and imprisonment is suspended and you are placed on five years probation upon the usual conditions of probation and the special condition that you pay, in the form of restitution and reparation to the community at large, the sum of $15,000 to the Curry-Roosevelt County Council on Alcoholism, Inc., a non-profit organization to be utilized in a continuing program for treatment and community education regarding alcohol related problems. This amount is to be paid in regular monthly installments beginning June 1, 1975 under the direction of the Probation Officer of this Court and is to be fully paid within the probation period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1454-10\">Suspension of criminal sentences and the imposition of probation are governed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3651 which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1454-11\">While on probation and among the conditions thereof, the defendant\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1454-12\">May be required to pay a fine in one or several sums; and May be required to make restitution or reparation to aggrieved parties for actual damages or loss caused by the offense for which conviction was had</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1454-13\">We are compelled to reverse the trial court\u2019s sentencing because we are unable to conclude that the Curry-Roosevelt County Council on Alcoholism, Inc. or persons which it helps or represents were \u201caggrieved\u201d in the amount of $233,500 by \u201cthe offense for which conviction was had.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>4 Cir., 305 F.2d 183, <em>187, cert. denied, </em>371 U.S. 894, 83 S.Ct. 193, 9 L.Ed.2d 126; <em>United States v. Stoehr, </em>3 Cir., 196 F.2d 276, <em>284, cert. denied, </em>344 U.S. 826, 73 S.Ct. 28, 97 L.Ed. 643; <em>Karrell v. United States, </em>9 Cir., 181 F.2d 981, 986-87, <em>cert. denied, </em>340 U.S. 891, 71 S.Ct. 206, 95 L.Ed. 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-14\">We remand this case to the trial court for exercise of its discretion in reconsidering .solely the fines imposed upon the suspension of execution of the defendants\u2019 original sentences. In no event shall the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1391\">*1391</page-number>trial court increase those fines beyond what each defendant would have had to pay under the trial court\u2019s prior order to the Curry-Roosevelt County Council on Alcoholism, Inc. The incarceration imposed on some defendants and the probationary period given all defendants shall remain unaltered. These strictures on the trial court\u2019s power on remand are necessary to prevent any disadvantage to the defendants who sought review of erroneous court rulings and orders.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1454-7\">. The court required Wolf, Goodman and Pettigrew to pay respectively $10,000, $25,000 and $25,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1454-8\">.
