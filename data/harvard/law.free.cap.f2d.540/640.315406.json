Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) under a summons issued pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the basis of our decision also filed this day, in <em>In re Grand Jury Impaneled January 21, 1975, </em>529 F.2d 543 (3d Cir. 1976), we conclude that the agreements are not privileged and accordingly will affirm the district court\u2019s order enforcing the IRS summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-17\">In the course of its investigation of the tax liabilities of attorney Nathan Berlant, the IRS, on October 9, 1975, issued a summons to the Honorable Americo V. C\u00f3rtese, the Prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. The summons sought all contingent fee agreements and statements of distribution filed with the Prothonotary between 1971 and 1974 by the taxpayer or which bore his name. App. at 2a. At the time of issuance of the summons, attorneys in Philadelphia were required by Local Rule 202 to file copies of such agreements and statements with the Prothonotary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section (f) of Local Rule 202 provided that these copies \u201cshall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>impounded subject to inspection only by Order of the Court, by the client or by the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.\u201d The Prothonotary refused to produce the requested records on the ground, <em>inter alia, </em>that they were privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Proceedings to enforce the summons under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7604 were begun in the district court by the government on December 4, 1975. The Prothonotary moved to dismiss the summons. After a hearing on the petition to enforce the summons, and the filing of an <em>amicus curiae </em>brief by the Philadelphia Bar Association in support of the Prothonotary\u2019s motion to dismiss,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the district court, on March 31, 1976, issued an opinion and order enforcing the summons and denying the motion to dismiss. Notice of appeal was filed by the Prothonotary on April 12, 1976. Enforcement of the summons was stayed pending disposition of the instant appeal. App. at 84a. On April 28, 1976, this court expedited the appeal and listed it for disposition with <em>In re Grand Jury Impaneled January 21, 1975, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The Prothonotary contends, <em>inter alia</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that contingent fee agreements filed under Local Rule 202 are privileged as a matter of federal common law from production pursuant to an IRS summons. In <em>In re Grand Jury Impaneled January 21,1975, supra, </em>we assumed <em>arguendo </em>that as a matter of Pennsylvania law retainer agreements filed under Local Rule 202 were privileged against use in any investigation or court proceeding. We nevertheless held that any assumed state-created required reports privilege would not be recognized as a matter of federal common law so as to defeat a federal grand jury\u2019s subpoena. Enforcement of the grand jury subpoena would not, in our view, seriously frustrate the Court of Common Pleas\u2019 interest in voluntary compliance with its filing requirements. Thus, on balance we concluded that the assumed state-created privilege must yield to the grand jury\u2019s need for the information in order effectively to conduct its investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">We consider our decision in <em>In re Grand Jury Impaneled January 21, 1975, supra, </em>to control here. The scope of inquisitorial power granted the IRS Commissioner in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602 is not unlike that vested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>in federal grand juries.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And for the reasons stated in our earlier decision, we do not think the Court of Common Pleas\u2019 interest in voluntary compliance will be seriously impaired by enforcement of the instant summons. To enforce a summons, the IRS must show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4n\">(1) That the investigation has a legitimate purpose and that the inquiry may be relevant to that purpose, (2) that the information sought is not already within the government\u2019s possession and (3) that the steps required by the Internal Revenue Code have been followed .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-6\"><em>United States </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>514 F.2d 368, 372 (3d Cir. 1975). The enforcement proceeding is no mere \u201crubber stamp approval.\u201d <em>United States v. First National Bank, </em>540 F.2d 619 (3d Cir. 1976); <em>see United States </em>v. <em>Bisceglia, </em>420 U.S. 141, 146, 95 S.Ct. 915, 43 L.Ed.2d 88 (1975). As in <em>In re Grand Jury Impaneled January 21, 1975, supra, </em>the reasons generally asserted in support of federal court recognition of a state\u2019s required reports privilege are also not present here. After consideration of the asserted interests underlying Local Rule 202(f) and the federal government\u2019s interest in ensuring compliance with its tax laws, see <em>United States v. Bisceglia, supra, </em>we conclude that the federal interest must here prevail. See <em>Falsone v. United States, </em>205 F.2d 734, 742 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>346 U.S. 864, 74 S.Ct. 103, 98 L.Ed. 375 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">The district court\u2019s order shall be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b705-11\">.

App. at 25a-26a. On May 20, 1976, the Board of Judges of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County repealed actions (e) and (f). For the reasons stated in <em>In re Grand Jury Impaneled January 21, 1975, </em>529 F.2d 543 (3d Cir. 1976), we do not consider that repeal to affect the instant appeal.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b706-11\">. The Prothonotary also argues that he was not the proper person on whom to serve the summons because he cannot produce the records, absent an order of the Court of Common Pleas. We rejected that argument in <em>In re Grand Jury Impaneled January 21, 1975, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">Additionally, the Prothonotary contends that as a matter of comity the district court should have deferred enforcement of the subpoena pending an appropriate petition to the Court of Common Pleas for release of the requested records. We note initially that the Prothonotary did not raise this issue below and the district court did not discuss it in his opinion. Moreover, it appears that the IRS contacted President Judge Bradley of the Court of Common Pleas on July 2, 1975 and requested access to the records sought in the instant summons. President Judge Bradley refused the IRS request for access to the records on July 15, 1975. Appellees\u2019 Supplemental Memorandum at Ex. B (Affidavit of Robert M. McKee, IRS Special Agent, May 10, 1976). Finally, for the reasons stated in our decision in <em>In re Grand Jury Impaneled January 21, 1975, supra, </em>we do not consider deferral to have been necessary here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b706-8\">. On January 7, 1976, the district court entered an order enforcing the summons. However, that order was stayed to permit the Philadelphia Bar Association additional time in which to file its <em>amicus </em>brief. Submitted with the Bar Association\u2019s brief was an affidavit of the Honorable Edward J. Bradley, President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas, setting forth his views on the confidentiality provision of Local Rule 202. App. at 51a-53a. In President Judge Bradley\u2019s opinion, the assurance of confidentiality was necessary to ensure voluntary compliance with the filing requirement and compulsory production of the records to the IRS would frustrate the operation of Local Rule 202. <em>Id. </em>at 52a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b707-9\">. <em>United States v.
