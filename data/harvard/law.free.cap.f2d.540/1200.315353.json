Specifically, the Secretary contends that Sehwerman is obliged under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 215(a)(2) and 215(a)(5)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to compensate its drivers and mechanics in accordance with the maximum hours provisions of the FLSA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1265-21\">Sehwerman claims that its drivers and mechanics are exempt from the maximum hours provisions by virtue of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(1) which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-22\">\u201c(b) The provisions of section 207 of this title [maximum hours] shall not apply with respect to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-23\">(1) any employee with respect to whom the Interstate Commerce Commission has power to establish qualifications and maximum hours of service pursuant to the provisions of section 304 of Title 49 <em>if</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1265-25\">49 U.S.C. \u00a7 304(a) states in pertinent part that it \u201cshall be the duty of the [Secretary] . to regulate common carriers by motor vehicle . . and to that end [he] may establish . . . qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees, and safety of operation<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and; equipment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-28\">Pursuant to this authority, the Secretary has issued safety regulations governing the qualifications of drivers<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as well as the management, maintenance and operation of motor vehicles employed by such common carriers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, the Secretary has made these regulations specifically applicable to motor carriers engaged in the transportation of hazardous materials.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>common carrier by motor vehicle,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Schwerman contends that its drivers and mechanics are subject to the control of the Secretary of Transportation to the exclusion of the Secretary of Labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\">While the district court agreed that Schwerman\u2019s drivers and mechanics were subject to the regulations of the Secretary of Transportation issued pursuant to his authority under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 304, it was nevertheless of opinion that they were not exempt from the maximum hours provision of the FLSA. This determination was based upon the assumption that while Schwerman was engaged in some interstate cartage, that cartage was insufficient to bring it within the provisions of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213. Moreover, the district court was of the view that the fact that Schwerman held a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission and maintained certain records required by the Department of Transportation was not sufficient to relieve the company of its obligations under the FLSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-5\">We do not agree with the holding of the district court. Based upon a review of the relevant statutory provisions involved, as well as the record, we are of opinion that the district court failed to give controlling weight to the power of the Secretary of Transportation to regulate Schwerman\u2019s employees and instead erroneously focused on the extent to which the firm engaged in interstate cartage. This does not give effect to the plain language of \u00a7 213. Consequently, the judgment of the district court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-6\">Schwerman was formed in 1967, when its parent firm purchased the assets and operating authority of Petroleum Transit Corporation, a Virginia firm. Schwerman is a wholly owned subsidiary of Schwerman Trucking Company, a Wisconsin corporation with principal offices in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Like its subsidiary, the parent corporation is a common carrier by motor vehicle engaged in the transportation of liquid and dry bulk products by tank truck. As of 1974, the parent had authority to operate in approximately 45 states and actually maintained 55 terminals in some 30 states located primarily in the eastern half of the United States. The ICC subsequently approved the purchase and granted temporary operating authority to Schwerman. On January 12, 1970, the ICC awarded Schwerman permanent operating authority and issued it a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. That certificate authorized Schwerman to engage in transportation in interstate or foreign commerce from points in Virginia to points in North Carolina, West Virginia, the District of Columbia, Delaware, Maryland, Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-9\">Schwerman presently operates but one terminal facility, that being located at Norfolk, Virginia. Approximately one-half of Schwerman\u2019s drivers operate out of the Norfolk facility. The remainder of its drivers operate from Richmond, Virginia. Despite the fact that the company\u2019s drivers work from two separate locations, all of the firm\u2019s equipment is serviced in Norfolk. It is intermittently interchanged between the terminal and Richmond based upon the maintenance schedule and business needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-10\">In addition to its Norfolk facility, Schwerman maintained and operated a second terminal at Montvale, Virginia up through July 1969. From that location, it transported petroleum products to points in West Virginia. This cartage was authorized by the firm\u2019s interstate operating authority and was undertaken pursuant to an agreement with the American Oil Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>In 1969, American Oil terminated its relationship with Schwerman. This, in turn, precipitated the closing of the Montvale terminal. Despite the fact that the terminal has not since been operated, the company has retained ownership of the facility in hopes of reacquiring the American Oil account. In addition, Schwerman has refused throughout to sell its Montvale operating authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-4\">In order to preserve the validity of its interstate operating authority and in order to be in a position to utilize it whenever possible, Schwerman has regularly published, updated and filed a tariff booklet with the ICC setting forth the rates, rules and regulations applying to its transportation of products in interstate commerce. In addition, Schwerman has marked all of its equipment with decals showing the proper ICC authority identification numbers; it has filed its ICC operating authority with each State where its authority authorizes cartage; and it has filed the necessary fuel tax and motor vehicle registration with those States in which it was authorized to operate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-5\">Thus, despite the curtailment of its interstate cartage occasioned by the loss of its American Oil account,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Schwerman has continued to maintain itself as legally qualified to carry products in interstate commerce and at all times relevant to this action has held itself out to the general public as available to engage in such cartage. Also, throughout this period, Schwerman has continuously solicited interstate business, although its efforts have met with no great success. We are nevertheless mindful of the fact that it is not simply those carriers who actually obtain interstate business that are subject to the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Transportation. <em>Starrett </em>v. <em>Bruce, </em>391 F.2d 320, 323 (10th Cir. 1968), cert. den. 393 U.S. 971, 89 S.Ct. 404, 21 L.Ed.2d 384 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-20\">The success or failure of Schwerman\u2019s efforts to solicit interstate business is not the critical factor in determining whether the company is exempt from the provisions of the FLSA. Rather, the focus of inquiry must be'upon whether the Secretary of Transportation has the \u201cpower to establish qualification and maximum hours of service\u201d for Schwerman\u2019s employees. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(1). It is the existence of that power as opposed to its exercise which Congress has said is determinative as to the applicability of the FLSA. <em>Morris v. McComb, </em>332 U.S. 422, 434, 68 S.Ct. 131, 92 L.Ed. 44 (1947); <em>Starrett </em>at 323. Based upon the facts presented here, as well as the applicable law, we are of opinion that such power was vested in the Secretary of Transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>As has been noted, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 304 states that it is the duty of the Secretary to regulate common carriers by motor vehicle. Section 303(a)(14) of that same title defines such a carrier as \u201cany person [corporation] which holds itself out to the general public to engage in the transportation by motor vehicle in interstate or foreign commerce of passengers or property . . ..\u201d Thus, it is not what a corporation does but what it holds itself out to do that determines its status as a common carrier. <em>Starrett </em>at 323. In the instant case, Schwerman at all times relevant hereto held itself out as available for interstate cartage, solicited interstate business and handled any interstate shipments received. It was required to accept interstate freight offered at its going rates. As such, Schwerman falls squarely within the definition of a common carrier and is subject to regulation by the Secretary of Transportation. We are reinforced as to the soundness of this conclusion by the fact that the Secretary has already exercised this power by setting the qualifications and maximum hours of service of Schwerman\u2019s drivers. We are thus of opinion that the company is, by virtue of \u00a7 213(b)(1), exempt from the maximum hours provisions of the FLSA. A carrier may not be subjected simultaneously to the regulation of the Secretary of Transportation under the Motor Carriers Act and the Secretary of Labor under the FLSA. <em>Morris v. McComb, </em>332 U.S. 422, 437-438, 68 S.Ct. 131, 92 L.Ed. 44 (1947); <em>Wirtz v. Cad-dell Transit Corp., </em>253 F.Supp. 378 (W.D.Okl.1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">Having found that Schwerman comes within the exemption of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(1), the question remains whether the exemption extends to only the drivers or whether it extends to the mechanics. We are of opinion that it extends to the mechanics.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-6\">It appears from the record that when Schwerman receives a particular load for shipment, it is assigned to drivers operating out of either Norfolk or Richmond depending upon which is closer to the point of origin. Following the designation of a load, it is placed in a pool for selection by the individual drivers operating out of that particular area. The drivers then choose loads on the basis of seniority with the driver with the highest seniority having first choice as to which load or trip he desires each day. As a result, all trips, whether interstate of intrastate, are given to drivers on an indiscriminate basis. Schwerman\u2019s mechanics are similarly assigned work indiscriminately. All equipment, whether from Richmond or Norfolk and whether used in interstate or intrastate commerce is serviced on a regular basis at the Norfolk terminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-8\">Based upon these facts, we are of opinion that the decision in <em>Morris v. McComb, </em>332 U.S. 422, 68 S.Ct. 131, 92 L.Ed. 44 (1947), again is controlling. There, the Court was concerned with a common carrier by motor vehicle that was engaged primarily in the local transportation of property for the general public. The carrier employed forty full time drivers and fourteen mechanics. Only four percent of its total business annually involved interstate cartage. The remaining ninety-six percent of the services provided by the carrier were intrastate in nature. Those interstate trips which were undertaken were found not to have been distributed equally among the company\u2019s drivers, and, in fact, two of the drivers had not engaged in any interstate transportation during the entire period in question. Moreover, an unspecified number of drivers made only one interstate trip a year and in many workweeks individual drivers were engaged solely in intrastate transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-9\">Despite the small number of interstate hauls actually made and the unequal distribution among the firm\u2019s drivers of such hauls, the Court nevertheless found that the performance of such work was \u201cshared indiscriminately by the drivers and was mingled with the performance of other like driving services rendered by them otherwise than in interstate commerce.\u201d 332 U.S. at 433, 68 S.Ct. at 136. Thus, the Court concluded that athe ICC<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> had the power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>establish the qualifications and maximum hours of service for all the carrier\u2019s employees whose work activities affected the safety of operation of motor vehicles. This included those drivers who had not engaged in any interstate trips. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW7\">\u201cThe net result is a practical situation such as may confront any common carrier engaged in a general cartage business, and who is prepared and offering to serve the normal transportation demands of the shipping public in an industrial metropolitan center. From the point of view of safety in interstate commerce, the hazards are not distinguishable from those which would be presented if each driver drove 4% of his driving time each day in interstate commerce. In both cases there is the same essential need for the establishment of respectable requirements with respect to qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees. If the common carrier is required, by virtue of that status, to take this interstate business he must perform the required service in accordance with the requirements established by the Commission.\u201d 332 U.S. at 434, 68 S.Ct. at 137.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1269-4\">While it may be that in the instant case few of Schwerman\u2019s regular drivers have actually engaged in interstate cartage as a result of the manner in which individual hauls are assigned,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we are nevertheless of opinion that the reasoning of the Court in <em>Morris </em>is no less applicable to the facts presented here. It is clear that the work of each of Sehwerman\u2019s drivers may affect the safety of operation of motor vehicles engaged in interstate commerce. The fact that not all of Schwerman\u2019s employees work out of a single location (as was also the case in <em>Morris) </em>makes no difference in the result where work is assigned on an indiscriminate basis. See <em>Wirtz v. Caddell Transit Corp., </em>253 F.Supp. 378 (W.D.Okl. 1966). In either case, there is a need for the establishment of respectable requirements as to qualifications and hours of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-6\">The same reasoning applied to the drivers applies to the mechanics. \u201cWhat is thus true for the driver is true also for the mechanic who repairs his truck.\u201d <em>Morris, </em>332 U.S. at 432, 68 S.Ct. at 136. Their \u201cwork affects the safety of transportation,\u201d <em>Morris </em>at 431, 68 S.Ct. at 135, as surely as does that of the drivers. And <em>Morris </em>referred to <em>Ex Parte No. MC-2, </em>28 M.C.C. 125 (1941), which had held that mechanics were subject to the regulations by the ICC (now the Secretary of Transportation). It follows that we are of opinion Schwerman\u2019s mechanics were also exempt from overtime pay under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-7\">The judgment of the district court is accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-8\">\n<em>REVERSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1265-9\">.

Whether the cartage was authorized by its own certificate or that of its parent is not, however, a controlling factor here, for, as is more fully set forth in the body of the opinion, it is not only the authority under which the carrier operates, but also what the carrier holds itself out to do which determines the power of the Secretary of Transportation to regulate the employees of the carrier.
