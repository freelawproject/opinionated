She al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>leged, among other things, that Hooker failed to give adequate warnings of the dangers and fatal properties of TRI, and as a result, her husband by working with TRI sustained injuries which eventually led to his death. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, which had been limited solely to the adequacy of the warnings given by Hooker, the district court granted Hooker\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Wayne Dougherty, the plaintiff\u2019s decedent, was employed by Boeing Vertol Company in Pennsylvania as a helicopter transmission rebuilder. His primary duty was to disassemble, clean and then reassemble military helicopter transmissions. Dougherty\u2019s work was performed in two buildings in which were located degreasing tanks each containing 200 gallons of TRI heated to a temperature in excess of 190 \u00b0F. The disassembled helicopter parts were cleaned by submerging them into the TRI.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The TRI used in the degreasing operation was supplied to Boeing by Hooker. The TRI was packaged, shipped and stored in 55 gallon drums. Affixed to the drum was the following warning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">HOOKER permapower TRICHLOROETHYLENE MD GRADE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-8\">WARNING! VAPOR HARMFUL Use only with adequate ventilation. Avoid prolonged or repeated contact with skin. Do not take internally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-9\">VOLATILE SOLVENT NET WT. 660 LBS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-10\">Electrochemicals Division \u2014 Hooker Chemical Corporation Subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-11\">Niagara Falls, New York</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-12\">Packaged by</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-14\">Hooker had also prepared' and submitted to Boeing a \u201cData Sheet for Toxicological and Safe Handling Information\u201d which listed the following health hazards from inhalation of TRI vapor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-15\">Victim may experience nausea and vomiting, drowsiness, acquire an attitude of irresponsibility and behave in a manner resembling any stage of alcoholic intoxication.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-16\">As to precautions for normal use, the data sheet recommended \u201cgood housekeeping and normal operating procedures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-17\">In addition to the warnings submitted by Hooker, Boeing had in its possession Chemical Safety Data Sheet SD-14 prepared by the Manufacturing Chemists Association (MCA) which discussed the safe handling and use of TRI. The fifteen page MCA data sheet- listed several health hazards including the possibility of death from acute and subacute TRI poisoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-18\">Dougherty who had been employed by Boeing for several years prior to his death in January, 1971, died of cardiac arrest, the cause of which a consulting physician believed to be TRI poisoning. The complaint, filed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, asserts among other claims that Hooker failed to adequately warn of the dangerous nature of TRI.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-19\">The pretrial order directed the \u201cwarnings\u201d issue be tried first and apart from the other issues of liability and damages. At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case on warnings, Hooker moved for a directed verdict on the ground that the warnings were sufficient as a matter of law. The district court in an oral opinion granted Hooker\u2019s motion, holding that the warnings given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>\u2022were adequate and that, in any event, Boeing was independently aware of the possible fatal consequences of TRI inhalation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This appeal followed the entry of judgment for Hooker.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">As stated, the plaintiff sought recovery against Hooker based primarily on theories of strict liability and negligence. The intermingling at trial of these theories of liability (Restatement (Second) of. Torts \u00a7\u00a7 388 and 402A)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> requires a brief reference to both concepts as they bear upon the instant action. Section 402A strict liability arises from the sale of any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer. Pennsylvania holds that a product which contains inherent dangers is defective when sold if not accompanied by sufficient warning.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under such circumstances, the seller is held to strict liability if such a defective product reaches the ultimate consumer \u201cwithout substantial change in the condition in which it is sold.\u201d Section 402A(l)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-15\">Under \u00a7 388, liability arises when the seller, having reason to know that its product is likely to be dangerous for its intended use, and having no reason to believe that the intended user will realize its dangerous condition, nevertheless fails to exercise reasonable care to inform the user of the dangerous condition. Thus, the differences between the two concepts have been stated as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-16\">In strict liability it is of no moment what defendant \u2018had reason to believe.\u2019 Liability arises from \u2018sell[ing] any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer.\u2019 It is the unreasonableness of the condition of the product, not of the conduct of the defendant, that creates liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-17\"><em>Jackson v. Coast Paint and Lacquer Company, </em>499 F.2d 809, 812 (9th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-18\">Here, as we have noted, both theories were pleaded and apparently acknowledged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>by the parties and the court. The plaintiff, while asserting in its brief on appeal that it had established a <em>prima facie </em>strict liability case under \u00a7 402A, nevertheless refers to the various elements of \u00a7 388 to support its position that the defendant Hooker did not warn Boeing\u2019s employees. The defendant\u2019s response is also in terms of \u201cadequate warnings\u201d and implicates the negligence concept of \u00a7 388. The district court\u2019s opinion which focuses overall on the requirement of warnings apparently addressed itself to both theories when it granted the defendant\u2019s motion for directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">We find it unnecessary to discuss or to decide the applicability of \u00a7 402A <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in this factual context or whether the warning requirements under Pennsylvania law of \u00a7 402A<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> are the same or more stringent than those of \u00a7 388, for we are satisfied that a jury question was presented with respect to Hooker\u2019s exercise of reasonable care under \u00a7 388. In such a situation, it would be error to grant a directed verdict for the defendant if there is evidence reasonably tending to support the recovery by plaintiff as to any of its theories of liability. <em>Rochester Civic Theatre, Inc. v. Ramsay, </em>368 F.2d 748 (8th Cir. 1966); <em>Vareltzis v. Luckenbach Steamship Company, </em>258 F.2d 78 (2d Cir. 1958); <em>Clark v. McNeill, </em>25 F.2d 247 (5th Cir. 1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Therefore, putting aside considerations of strict liability, we turn to those principles of negligence law which are embodied within \u00a7 388 to determine whether as a matter of law, Hooker, the manufacturer of TRI, exercised reasonable care to warn Boeing\u2019s employees of the dangerous properties of TRI. Thus, for Hooker to be held liable, all the conditions of \u00a7 388 <em>(see </em>n.3 supra) must be met. <em>Suchomajcz v. Hummel Chemical Company, </em>524 F.2d 19 (3d Cir. 1975). Here, however, the trial court limited the only liability issue to be tried at this stage to the adequacy of the warnings, the third requirement of \u00a7 388. For our purposes, therefore, we too restrict our review to the evidence concerning only subsection (c) of \u00a7 388 (i. e.); whether Hooker failed \u201cto exercise reasonable care to inform them [the employees of Boeing] ... of the facts which made it [TRI] likely to be dangerous.\u201d Stated otherwise, in the context of this case, were the TRI warnings given by Hooker to Boeing sufficient to the extent that reasonable men could not differ in finding that Boeing was so activated or \u201ctriggered\u201d by the Hooker warnings that it would necessarily inform its employees of all TRI\u2019s dangerous propensities.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">Comment <em>n </em>to \u00a7 388 is concerned with warnings given to third persons. It states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-11\">Giving to the third person through whom the chattel is supplied all the information necessary to its safe use is not in all cases sufficient to relieve the supplier from liability. It is merely a means by which this information is to be conveyed to those who are to use the chattel. The question remains whether this method gives a reasonable assurance that the information will reach those whose safety depends upon their having it. . It is obviously impossible to state in advance any set of rules which will automatically determine in all cases whether one supplying a chattel for the use of others through a third person has satisfied his duty to those who are to use the chattel by informing the third person of the dangerous character of the chattel, or of the precautions which must be exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>cised in using it in order to make its use safe. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">Here, as in every case which involves the determination of the precautions which must be taken to satisfy the requirements of reasonable care, the magnitude of the risk involved must be compared with the burden which would be imposed by requiring them, and the magnitude of the risk is determined not only by the chance that some harm may result but also the serious or trivial character of the harm which is likely to result</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">Thus, while it may be proper to permit a supplier to assume that one through whom he supplies a chattel which is only slightly dangerous will communicate the information given him to those who are to use it unless he knows that the other is careless, it may be improper to permit him to trust the conveyance of the necessary information of the actual character of a highly dangerous article to a third person of whose character he knows nothing. It may well be that he should take the risk that this information may not be communicated . [I]f the danger involved in the ignorant use of a particular chattel is very great, it may be that the supplier does not exercise reasonable care in entrusting the communication of the necessary information even to a person whom he has good reason to believe to be careful. Many such articles can be made to carry their own message to the understanding of those who are likely to use them by the form in which they are put out, by the container in which they are supplied, or by a label or other device, indicating with a substantial sufficiency their dangerous character. Where the danger involved in the ignorant use of their true quality is great and such means of disclosure are practicable and not unduly burdensome, it may well be that the supplier should be required to adopt them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">The care to be exercised in discharging the duty to warn is therefore measured by the dangerous potentialities of the commodity as well as the foreseeable use to which it might be put. Thus, when Hooker sold TRI to Boeing, Hooker was required to exercise reasonable care in conveying to those who might use TRI or who might work with it, a fair and adequate warning of TRI\u2019s dangerous potentialities, to the end that the ultimate user might be sufficiently appraised of the possible consequences of exposure to or use of TRI. That duty under the principles of \u00a7 388, comment <em>\u201cn </em>\u201d, may be discharged by the supplier under appropriate circumstances by warnings given solely to its purchaser. Under other circumstances, steps may have to be taken by the supplier even beyond the warnings given to the purchaser. The determination of whether the method or means utilized to warn is sufficient will depend upon a balancing of considerations involving among other factors, the dangerous nature of the product, the form in which the product is used, the intensity and form of the warnings given, the burdens to be imposed by requiring warnings, and the likelihood that the particular warning will be adequately communicated to those who will foreseeably use the product. <em>Thomas v. Arvon Products Company, </em>424 Pa. 365, 227 A.2d 897 (1967); <em>Seibel v. Symons Corporation, </em>221 N.W.2d 50 (N.D.1974); <em>West v. Broderick &amp; Bascom Rope Company, </em>197 N.W.2d 202 (Iowa 1972); <em>Younger v. Dow Corning Corporation, </em>202 Kan. 674, 451 P.2d 177 (1969); <em>Tampa Drug Co. v. Wait, </em>103 So.2d 603, 75 A.L.R. 765 (Fla.1958); <em>Weekes v. Michigan Chrome &amp; Chemical Company, </em>352 F.2d 603 (6th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">The determination as to whether the supplier\u2019s duty measured by these considerations has been reasonably discharged comes within the function of the trier of fact. Here, however, the district court resolved that issue without permitting it to reach the jury. By so doing, it in effect held that the record was critically deficient of that minimum quantum of evidence from which a jury might reasonably find liability. <em>Denneny v. Siegal, </em>407 F.2d 433, 437-440 (3d Cir. 1969). <em>See also Huddell v. Levin, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>537 F.2d 726 (3d Cir. 1976).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> While the district court did not articulate the standard which it employed in directing the verdict for the defendant, our concern is not with the standard utilized but with its application. We thus turn to the evidence to assess the correctness of the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Referring then to the evidence, the relevant record developed by plaintiff with respect to warnings reveals that:</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">(1) The 55 gallon drums of TRI sold by Hooker had warnings affixed to them stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">\u201cVAPOR HARMFUL\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">\u201cUse only with adequate ventilation. Avoid prolonged or repeated contact with skin. Do not take internally.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">(2) The Hooker label resembled the warning on the MCA Chemical Safety Data Sheet SD-14, but the label made no reference to that document.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">(3) The Hooker label did not warn of the possibility of death. The MCA data sheet, however, does refer to the possibility of death resulting from acute and subacute TRI poisoning.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Hooker had knowledge of the MCA\u2019s requirements and of the MCA\u2019s TRI warning labels.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-18\">(4) The 55 gallon TRI drums were stored by Boeing outside the buildings where the degreasers were in use. The 200 gallon TRI degreasers were within the Boeing buildings where Dougherty worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-19\">(5) The Hooker data sheet prepared for Boeing made reference to only the following health hazards which could result from the inhalation of TRI vapor: nausea, vomiting, drowsiness and acquiring an attitude of irresponsibility. Significantly, absent from the \u201cData Sheet for Toxicological and Safe Handling Information\u201d which Hooker had prepared and submitted to Boeing was any reference to the possibility that death might be caused by the prolonged inhalation of TRI.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-20\">(6) David Shaulter, a co-worker of Dougherty, testified that he had never seen any warnings, no matter their content, on the degreasers which were inside the Boeing plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-21\">(7) Boeing, through its Manager of Safety Administration and Industrial Hygiene, James Par miter, testified to the contrary claiming that signs were placed by Boeing on the degreasers. These signs, according <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>to Parmiter, listed the procedures to be utilized in handling TRI and the precautions to be taken with respect to ventilation, breathing inhalation and skin exposure. No mention was made by Parmiter during his testimony that these warnings, which he claimed were posted on the degreasers, advised of the possibility of fatal consequences that might result from prolonged inhalation of TRI.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">(8) The MCA Chemical Safety Data Sheet SD-14 was in Boeing\u2019s files but had not been supplied by Hooker.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is that document that states that death may result from acute or subacute TRI poisoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">(9) In 1966, Boeing had prepared \u201cIndustrial Hazards Control Bulletin No. 18\u201d which stated that TRI was dangerously toxic.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">(10) On direct examination, Parmiter also testified that he understood the possible effects of inhaling TRI vapor to be limited solely to nausea, dizziness and some form of narcotic effect. On cross examination he acknowledged familiarity with the MCA data sheet, but denied knowledge that the safety literature contained information about the fatal effects that could result from inhaling TRI over an extended period of time. However, when referred specifically to relevant sections of Boeing\u2019s own safety literature, he acknowledged that excessive inhalation of TRI vapors could result in death.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-13\">Although Hooker argues in its brief that its warnings were adequate as a matter of law,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> based on the summarized evidence, <em>supra, </em>it is apparent that a jury could reasonably find:</p>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">(1) that Hooker, trading in a commodity \u201cburdened with a latent danger which could prove fatal,\u201d <em>see Tampa Drug Co. v. Wait, </em>103 So.2d 603, 75 A.L.R.2d at 775, had knowledge of safety literature which warned of the possibility of death from acute or subacute TRI poisoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-15\">(2) that Hooker at no time included such a warning in its safety literature or on its labels.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-16\">(3) that no such warnings of possible death resulting from the use of TRI were communicated by Hooker or by Boeing to Boeing\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-17\">(4) that because of the fatal propensities of TRI, Hooker was obliged to take reasonable steps beyond what appears in the record to warn Boeing\u2019s employees <em>(see </em>\u00a7 388, comment <em>n, </em>pp. 8-9 <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-18\">(5) that there was no reasonable basis for Hooker to rely on Boeing\u2019s independent knowledge of the fatal properties of TRI.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Nor was there a reasonable basis for Hooker to rely upon Boeing giving appropriate information to its employees of all the hazards of working with TRI. <em>(See </em>\u00a7 388, comment <em>n, </em>pp. 178-179 <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">In sum, a jury could have found that Hooker had not exercised reasonable care in informing TRI users of all TRI\u2019s dangers.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">We therefore deem it incumbent on this record for the jury, not the court, to resolve Hooker\u2019s eventual liability as to warnings. Similarly, on this record, it is the jury\u2019s function to determine, after balancing the \u00a7 388 considerations to which we have referred, whether Boeing\u2019s knowledge, if any, could have relieved Hooker from any requirement to warn Boeing\u2019s employees and thus, from any liability.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Concluding that the plaintiff has introduced sufficient evidence to create a triable issue as to the adequacy of warnings, we therefore hold that the district court erred in having granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case. We will reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-13\">. In addition to theories of negligence and strict liability both of which were predicated on inadequate warnings, the complaint also alleged causes of action for breach of warranty, outrageous conduct and various other torts. The pretrial order limited the trial of liability solely to the issue of the adequacy of warnings given by Hooker, but in so doing, did not delineate any particular theory. In its oral opinion, the district court utilized language characteristic of strict liability and negligence theories. Similarly, the parties on appeal have made no effort to distinguish between either theory nor have they analyzed the cases which they have cited in terms of one theory or the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-21\">The complaint also named three other defendants. Two of these defendants were dismissed by stipulation. The third defendant was never served. Hooker filed a third party complaint against Boeing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b241-6\">. Although the only issue tried was the adequacy of the warnings, the district court\u2019s opinion also refers to the issue of causation. In discussing causation, the district court judge noted the paucity of such evidence, but nevertheless correctly observed that the only issue before him was the matter of warnings. Causation, not having been an issue before the district court, is not an issue which we consider.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b241-7\">.

However, if proper precautions are constantly observed, this compound may be handled with safety. Prolonged, excessive, or repeated exposures to the liquid, or to atmospheric concentrations of the vapor above those recommended below are hazardous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-15\">10.1.4.1 <em>Acute Poisoning</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-16\">When a worker inhales an excessive amount of trichloroethylene vapor within a short period of time, the symptoms are essentially those of production of anesthesia. There may be, at first, irritation of the eyes, nose and throat, then dizziness, nausea, vomiting and gradual suppression of consciousness. The picture which develops depends upon the concentration inhaled and the duration of inhalation. If the concentration is high and inhalation prolonged, there will eventually be complete suppression of pain sense and almost complete loss of muscular activity. After a period of very rapid breathing, the respiration and circulation may fall and death follow. High concentrations of trichloroethylene may prevent proper utilization of the oxygen of the blood by the tissues. When this condition is present, physical activity may lead to severe or even fatal circulatory failure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-23\">* * * Sfe * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-24\">10.1.4.2 <em>Subacute Poisoning</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aup\">Subacute trichloroethylene poisoning may result from prolonged or repeated work in an atmosphere containing high concentrations of trichloroethylene but under conditions in which the amount absorbed is not sufficient to cause loss of consciousness.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b245-7\">. The district court judge in his oral opinion evidently assumed that this document had been supplied to Boeing by Hooker. Our review of the evidence does not substantiate this fact. In light of Hooker\u2019s acquaintance with MCA requirements, it would make no difference to our disposition whether or not it was Hooker which supplied Boeing with this document.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\">. We find the relevant cases cited by Hooker in support of its position to be inapplicable to the factual and procedural posture of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"AiA\"><em>Younger v. Dow Corning Corporation, supra, </em>which holds that a manufacturer that places adequate warnings on its product has no additional duty to warn the vendee\u2019s employees, did not involve a product with fatal properties and was submitted on stipulations of fact which included admissions that the warnings on the product labels were adequate, the very issue contested here.</p>\n<p id=\"AZ9\">In <em>Weekes v. Michigan Chrome &amp; Chemical Company, supra, </em>the court merely reversed a jury verdict for the plaintiff noting that a jury instruction which insinuated that the employee must get direct warnings in <em>all </em>cases was erroneous. There also the product in question did not have fatal properties as does TRI. The court held that proper jury instructions predicated on \u00a7 388 principles and respecting the supplier\u2019s exercise of reasonable care should have been given to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-20\"><em>Bertone v. Turco Products, </em>252 F.2d 726 (3d Cir. 1958) involves New Jersey law and does not discuss \u00a7 388. It involved no more than a dismissal of a third party complaint brought by the supplier against its purchaser for indemnification. While the opinion discusses similar concepts to that at issue here, it sheds no light on what is of is not an adequate warning in the context of the instant controversy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b245-21\">. It can be claimed that Boeing had knowledge of TRI\u2019s fatal properties inasmuch as Boeing had in its files safety literature which indicated all of the health hazards that could result from exposure to TRI. On this record, however, there is no evidence to support an as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>sumption by Hooker that Boeing would communicate this knowledge to its employees. Nor is there evidence as a matter of law that Boeing had \u201ceffective\u201d knowledge of TRI\u2019s fatal propensities. As the record reveals, while Boeing\u2019s safety manager ultimately acknowledged that TRI could cause death and that data sheets so stating reposed in Boeing\u2019s files, he nevertheless initially disclaimed any knowledge of TRI\u2019s fatal properties. It could be inferred by the jury that if Boeing\u2019s safety manager had no knowledge of the fatal consequences of prolonged inhalation of TRI, Boeing could not have taken steps to communicate this fact to its workers. At the very least his testimony with respect to his knowledge and hence, Boeing\u2019s knowledge, presented an issue of fact for the jury, <em>Standard Oil Co. v. Lyons, </em>130 F.2d 965 (8th Cir. 1942), and could not be resolved by the district court in its grant of a directed verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b246-16\">. Because of the limited scope of the issue tried to the jury, i. e., the adequacy of the warnings, we of course express no opinion as to any other aspect of the plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b246-8\">ALDISERT, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A6T\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">I would affirm the judgment of the district court for the reasons set forth by Judge John P. Fullam at trial. This court is again faced with predicting the outer limits of products liability that may ultimately be imposed by the Pennsylvania appellate courts under negligence and strict liability theories. The precedential and institutional value of our various opinions in this field is at best conjectural, and will depend upon how far Pennsylvania courts intend to extend liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">The majority is predicting that the Pennsylvania courts will hold that there were insufficient warnings here to protect the manufacturer as a matter of law from a products liability claim based on \u00a7 388: that it was not enough for the manufacturer to prove that (1) the purchaser of the product (here, the employer of plaintiff\u2019s decedent) \u201cknew all of the details concerning the dangerous characteristics of this product\u201d and (2) the manufacturer placed large warning labels on the drums and forwarded literature explaining the dangers and advising precautions. It is my prediction that the Pennsylvania appellate courts will hold these warnings to be sufficient as a matter of law to protect the manufacturer from a products liability claim whether predicated on negligence or strict liability. Any failure by the employer to warn his employee would be the subject of litigation implicating only the employer and employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">Accordingly, I would affirm for the reasons stated by Judge Fullam in open court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzO\">Under bur law, the plaintiff would be entitled to recover from the manufacturer of trichloroethylene if the plaintiff\u2019s decedent\u2019s death was caused by the exposure to that product and if the product was in what is known in the law as a defective condition, unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-14\">Under the law a product can be in a defective condition if at the time it left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>the manufacturer\u2019s hands it had a defect which rendered it dangerous to the user; and so far as the law is concerned, a defect can consist of failure to warn the purchaser of that product of any dangers inherent in the product.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">In other words, a manufacturer is not required to produce a product which is guaranteed not to cause harm under any circumstances. Obviously, a vast percentage of the products which are used in our society today do have some potential for harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The manufacturer, however, does have a duty to warn of any dangers inherent in the product.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">In this case the evidence is undisputed that when the product was sold by the Hooker Chemical Cumpany to the Boeing Vertol Company, it was accompanied by warnings in the form of the labels on the drums, D-l and D-2, and also that it was accompanied by various items of literature which are in evidence, including the data sheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">I rule as a matter of law that those warnings were adequate. They did include warnings in substance of every adverse effect that could be caused by the product, and they did, in fact, inform of every precaution which should be taken in handling the product.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">I would point out that this is not a case in which the plaintiff is suing the employer. Whether or not the employer adequately protected the rights of its employees, whether it adequately warned employees of the hazards involved in working near this degreasing process is not a matter which can be litigated in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">As you perhaps know, an employee cannot sue his employer for damages, but rather has a claim for benefits under workmen\u2019s compensation laws and under certain occupational safety laws which apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">In this case, for reasons which do not appear, the plaintiff\u2019s decedent did file a claim against the employer for workmen\u2019s compensation, but chose not to prosecute that claim, in consequence of which the claim was dismissed for lack of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">The suit here is against the manufacturer of the chemical.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">I would point out also that insofar as the manufacturer is concerned, under our law there is no duty whatever to warn of things which are known to the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">In this case it is uncontradicted and absolutely clear that the purchaser of the chemical, the Boeing Vertol firm, knew all of the details concerning the dangerous characteristics of this product and had full and complete knowledge of the hazards involved, the risks involved, and of the proper method of dealing with those risks. So that in my view under no circumstances could there be an issue of fact for a jury to resolve as to whether the defendant chemical company breached any duty that it owed to the plaintiff in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">Accordingly, I am granting the motion for directed verdict, and you will not be required to pass upon any issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-16\">Appendix 305-07.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
