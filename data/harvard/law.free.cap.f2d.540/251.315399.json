The Ohio Supreme Court on October 12, 1973, dismissed an appeal to it for want of a \u201csubstantial constitutional question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-17\">On February 15,1974, Thompson filed the instant petition for writ of habeas corpus in the district court, claiming that the ordinance was unconstitutionally overly broad, \u201cnot [having] been authoritatively construed as being limited to fighting words.\u201d On May 6, 1975, the district court denied the petition, because the state supreme court, in construing an \u201calmost identical\u201d ordinance in <em>Karlan v. City of Cincinnati, </em>39 Ohio St.2d 107, 314 N.E.2d 162 (1974), sufficiently narrowed the Cleveland Heights ordinance, which otherwise would be unconstitutionally overly broad, to proscribe only unprotected speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-18\">On appeal, Thompson claims that he cannot be convicted under the Cleveland Heights ordinance because state courts have never cured its unconstitutional over-breadth. <em>Karlan </em>failed to cure the over-breadth, Thompson argues, because it came almost three years after his verbal onslaught of July 24, 1971, and because by concerning only the Cincinnati ordinance it neither \u201cauthoritatively construed,\u201d <em>Gooding </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>405 U.S. 518, 520, 522, 92 S.Ct. 1103,1105,1106, 31 L.Ed.2d 408 (1972), nor \u201climit[ed] or properly definefd],\u201d <em>Lewis v. New Orleans, </em>415 U.S. 130, 133, 94 S.Ct. 970, 972, 39 L.Ed.2d 214 (1974), nor gave a \u201csatisfactory limiting construction\u201d to, <em>Plummer v. City of Columbus, </em>414 U.S. 2, 94 S.Ct. 17, 38 L.Ed.2d 3 (1973), the Cleve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>land Heights ordinance. Even if the ordinance had been properly limited, Thompson claims that the writ should have been granted because the municipal court judge never instructed the jury that it could convict only if it found Thompson\u2019s words to have been constitutional \u201cfighting words,\u201d <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568, 62 S.Ct. 766, 86 L.Ed. 1031 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">We sustain the denial of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Respondents-appellees, properly we think, make no assertion that the ordinance is sufficiently narrow on its face. Facially, and as \u201climited\u201d by the state court of appeals\u2019 journal entry in Thompson\u2019s direct appeal, the ordinance remains constitutionally overly broad. See, e. g., <em>Lewis, supra; Plummer, supra; Gooding, supra. </em>Even though Thompson\u2019s words \u201cmight have been constitutionally prohibited under a narrowly and precisely drawn\u201d ordinance, Thompson may still challenge the over-breadth of the ordinance to protect \u201cthe transcendent value to all society of constitutionally protected expression,\u201d lest \u201cpersons whose expression is constitutionally protected . . . refrain from exercising their rights for fear of criminal sanctions provided by [an ordinance] susceptible of application to protected expression.\u201d <em>Lewis, supra, </em>415 U.S. at 133-134, 94 S.Ct. at 972-973, 39 L.Ed.2d at 219, quoting <em>Gooding, supra, </em>405 U.S. at 520-521, 92 S.Ct. at 1105. Accord, e. g., <em>Walker v. Dillard, </em>523 F.2d 3 (4th Cir., filed July 10, 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">That the narrowing construction came three years after the verbal onslaught, however, does not preclude the construction from curing the unconstitutional overbreadth, <em>United States v. Thirty-seven Photographs, </em>402 U.S. 363, 375 n. 3, 91 S.Ct. 1400, 1408 n. 3, 28-L.Ed.2d 822 (1971); <em>Dombrowski v. Pfister, </em>380 U.S. 479, 491 n. 7, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 1123 n. 7, 14 L.Ed.2d 22 (1965); <em>Poulos v. New Hampshire, </em>345 U.S. 395, 73 S.Ct. 760, 97 L.Ed. 1105 (1953); cf. <em>Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham, </em>394 U.S. 147,155, 89 S.Ct. 935, 22 L.Ed.2d 162 (1969); <em>Deeds v. Beto, </em>353 F.Supp. 840, 842 (N.D.Tex.1973); see <em>Lewis, supra, </em>provided the ordinance prior to the narrowing construction \u201cafford[ed] fair warning to the defendants.\u201d <em>Lanzetta v. New Jersey, </em>306 U.S. 451, 59 S.Ct. 618, 83 L.Ed. 888 (1939); <em>Bouie v. Columbia, </em>378 U.S. 347, 84 S.Ct. 1697, 12 L.Ed.2d 894 (1964); <em>Locke v. Rose, </em>514 F.2d 570, 572 n. 3 (6th Cir.), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 423 U.S. 48, 96 S.Ct. 243, 46 L.Ed.2d 185 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\"><em>Karlan, </em>then, could have cured the unconstitutional overbreadth, notwithstanding it was decided almost three years after Thompson\u2019s verbal onslaught. The issue, then, is whether <em>Karlan </em>did, in fact, cure the unconstitutional overbreadth. Thompson argues that only an \u201cauthoritative constru[ction]\u201d or \u201cnarrowing state court interpretation\u201d of the particular Cleveland Heights ordinance could cure its unconstitutional overbreadth. Respondents just as adamantly argue that the narrowing construction of the \u201calmost identical\u201d Cincinnati ordinance cured the unconstitutional overbreadth. Though neither Thompson nor respondents have cited a case expressly holding that a construction of an \u201calmost identical\u201d ordinance, or statute, can or cannot sufficiently cure the unconstitutional overbreadth of the particular ordinance, or statute, in question, <em>Wright </em>v. <em>City of Montgomery, </em>406 F.2d 867, 874, 875 (5th Cir. 1969), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>401 U.S. 989, 91 S.Ct. 1218, 28 L.Ed.2d 528 (1971), recognized that state court constructions of \u201csimilar\u201d and \u201csubstantially identical\u201d ordinances cured unconstitutional over-breadth. A district court expressly adopted respondents\u2019 view in <em>Pritikin v. Thurman, </em>311 F.Supp. 1400, 1401 (S.D.Fla.1970).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-11\">\u201c[W]hile the Florida courts have not considered this ordinance, the construction they may have placed on ordinances or statutes similar to the one at bar are binding on this court just as if those words had been written into the ordinance itself. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">Accord, <em>Livingston v. Garmire, </em>308 F.Supp. 472, 474 (S.D.Fla.1970), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>437 F.2d 1050 (5th Cir.), <em>opinion withdrawn on other grounds, </em>442 F.2d 1322 (5th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>In addition to <em>Karlan, </em>Ohio appellate courts have narrowly construed \u201csimilar\u201d disorderly conduct ordinances in <em>Columbus </em>v. <em>Schwarzwalder, </em>39 Ohio St.2d 61, 313 N.E.2d 798 (1974), and <em>City of Kent v. Kelley, </em>44 Ohio St.2d 43, 337 N.E.2d 788 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Finally, Thompson claims that the municipal judge failed to instruct the jury that it could convict only for constitutional \u201cfighting words.\u201d If we had before us a transcript demonstrating that the jury was not so instructed, we would hold that the writ should have been granted because of the possibility that the jury convicted Thompson for protected speech. See <em>State v. Schwing, </em>42 Ohio St.2d 295, 306, 328 N.E.2d 379 (1975); cf. <em>Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham, </em>382 U.S. 87, 92, 86 S.Ct. 211, 15 L.Ed.2d 176 (1965); <em>Terminiello v. City of Chicago, </em>337 U.S. 1, 69 S.Ct. 894, 93 L.Ed. 1131 (1949). However, in the absence of a transcript of the court\u2019s instructions to the jury, and according to the state proceedings the presumption of regularity to which they are entitled, we have no alternative but to hold that Thompson has failed in carrying his burden of proving that the jury was not properly instructed. <em>Allen v. Perini, </em>424 F.2d 134, 138 (6th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>400 U.S. 906, 91 S.Ct. 147, 27 L.Ed.2d 143 (1970); <em>Phillips v. Black, </em>367 F.Supp. 774 (E.D.Ky.1973), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>497 F.2d 924 (6th Cir. 1974); <em>Goins v. Brierley, </em>464 F.2d 947 (3rd Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The responsibility of placing the charge before us was that of the appellant, and it would seem improper to place the onus of his not having done so on the appellees in this habeas corpus proceeding which attacks a judgment of conviction arising from a trial which was held more than four and one-half years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-13\">. Cleveland Heights had a similar ordinance as early as 1933. See <em>City of Cleveland Heights v. Christie, </em>128 Ohio St. 297, 190 N.E. 770 (1934).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b316-19\">. Respondents-appellees have never challenged Thompson\u2019s allegation as to the sentence, fine and court costs, in his petition for writ of habeas corpus, but we have found nothing in the habeas record verifying Thompson\u2019s statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b318-7\">McCREE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ALy\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">I respectfully dissent. Petitioner was convicted of violating an ordinance which, as the majority opinion recognizes and appellees concede, is unconstitutionally over-broad not only on its face, but also as it was construed by the state court of appeals when it heard petitioner\u2019s appeal in 1973. I do not think that the \u201cpresumption of regularity\u201d can be stretched far enough to support the majority\u2019s holding that the municipal court judge gave an instruction at petitioner\u2019s trial in 1972 that was limited to fighting words as required by the Constitution. I find it impossible to presume that the municipal judge anticipated by almost three years the construction given in 1974 to a similar ordinance by the state supreme court, which in 1973 had dismissed petitioner\u2019s appeal <em>sua sponte </em>because \u201cno substantial constitutional question exists herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">I would remand to permit the district court to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine what instruction was given to the jury. If it cannot be established that the overbroad ordinance was given a narrowing instruction as required by the Constitution, I would grant the writ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
