G. Carrasco, Inc., operates a liquid waste disposal service (known generally as J. C. Inc. Liquid Waste Disposal) in El Monte, California. J. G. Carrasco, the individual defendant, manages the firm. The company is engaged in the pickup, transportation (by means of tank trucks), disposal and dumping of liquid waste, primarily for industrial and commercial concerns. At least 99 percent of defendants\u2019 business is performed for industrial firms which produce goods for interstate commerce and for airlines engaged in interstate transportation. Throughout the period covered by this action, November 1971 to December 1974, defendants\u2019 annual gross volume of business exceeded $250,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-16\">During the period in question, at least two of defendants\u2019 employees rendered liquid waste removal services each workweek for at least one of the following industrial customers: Standard Oil, Chevron Oil, Chevron Chemical, Alcan Aluminum, Norris Industries, McCulloch Corporation and Shell Oil. Each of these companies produces goods which are sold and delivered to places outside the State of California. The liquid waste which defendants\u2019 employees remove from these customers\u2019 premises is a byproduct of their manufacturing processes and, as the district court found, if the waste is not removed \u201cthe industrial concerns would curtail or cease to produce [the] goods.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-18\">Similarly, during each workweek since May 1972, at least two of defendants\u2019 employees performed liquid waste disposal services for one or more of the following airlines: Western, United, American and Continental. Each of these airlines is en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>gaged in transporting passengers and materials to and from places outside the State of California. The liquid waste is generated by cleaning and repairing airplane parts at the airlines\u2019 repair facilities. The district court found that if the waste is not removed \u201cthe airlines would curtail or cease to clean and repair their airplanes at Los Angeles International Airport.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">The parties stipulated as to the precise nature of defendants\u2019 waste removal activities with respect to two typical customers: Norris Industries and Western Airlines. It was agreed that Western Airlines was and is engaged in interstate commerce and that Norris Industries produces goods for interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">It was further stipulated that \u201cNorris Industries would curtail or cease production without the disposal of its liquid waste,\u201d and that \u201cWestern Airlines will curtail or cease the cleaning and repair of their airlines (sic) if the liquid waste engendered from the cleaning cannot be disposed of legally.\u201d Moreover, it was undisputed that the airline customers \u201cengaged in the transportation of passengers, materials, and communications to and from places outside the State of California\u201d and that the \u201cindustrial concerns have been engaged in the production of goods which have been and are being sold, delivered, or shipped to places outside the State of California.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Upon review of these established facts, the district court found, inter alia, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AF5\">\u201cDefendants\u2019 employees who remove liquid waste from the premises of concerns engaged in the production of goods for commerce perform work which is a closely related occupation directly essential to the industrial firm\u2019s production of goods for commerce. Therefore, those employees are engaged in the production of goods for commerce within the meaning of Section 3(j) of the Act (29 U.S.C. 2030)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">\u201cThe work performed by defendants\u2019 employees is directly and vitally related to a functioning of an instrumentality of commerce. Therefore, the employees are engaged in commerce within the meaning of Section 3(b) of the Act (29 U.S.C. 203(b)).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">We cannot s\u00e1y that these facts found by the court are clearly erroneous or that the conclusions of law based upon these facts are invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">In <em>Schultz v. Instant Handling, Inc., </em>418 F.2d 1019, 1022 (5th Cir. 1969), the court held that \u201cthe removal of industrial waste and other debris\u201d from the premise's of major producers of goods for interstate commerce was \u201cessential to the continued operation of their . . . businesses\u201d and therefore clearly constituted an occupation or business directly essential to the production of goods for commerce. Similarly, in <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Dooley Bros. Inc., </em>286 F.2d 40,44 (1st Cir. 1960), <em>cert. denied, </em>366 U.S. 911, 81 S.Ct. 1086, 6 L.Ed.2d 236 (1961), employees of a trash removal service were held to be \u201cclosely related\u201d and \u201cessential\u201d to the production of goods for commerce when they removed rubbish and trash from concerns which produced goods for commerce. See also <em>Brennan v. Metropolitan Trash Inc., </em>513 F.2d 1324 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>422 U.S. 1042, 95 S.Ct. 2656, 45 L.Ed.2d 693 (1975); <em>Rural Fire Protection Co. v. Hepp, </em>366 F.2d 355 (5th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-14\">Those services necessary to complete the cycle of production, as well as those services necessary for its beginning, are essential to the cycle and its continuance. We therefore hold that the employees of defendants-appellants, J. C. Inc., Liquid Waste Disposal, a corporation, and its manager, J. G. Carrasco, individually, who regularly remove liquid waste from plants producing goods for interstate commerce and perform services for enterprises directly related to interstate commerce are engaged in the production of goods within the meaning of section 3(j) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(j) and section 3(b) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(b). Thus, all of defendants-appellants\u2019 employees are covered under section 7(a)(1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1), and are subject to its minimum wage and maximum hour provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-15\">Appellants also contend that the district court erred in ordering restitution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>unpaid overtime wages due under the Act. They insist that <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>Saghatelian, </em>514 F.2d 619 (9th Cir. 1975), compels such a result. We disagree. Even a cursory examination of the opinion in <em>Saghatelian </em>discloses that the facts there were unique and presented an overwhelming case against the court\u2019s exercise of its restitution jurisdiction. The court, therefore, declined to exercise its jurisdiction. In this case the trial court was not so persuaded and understandably so. We declined to reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment in <em>Saghatelian </em>and decline to do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">It appears that the trial court\u2019s equitable jurisdiction was properly exercised in each instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b519-8\">.
