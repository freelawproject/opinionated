Because we hold that the Commission applied a legally erroneous interpretation of \u00a7 666(a) in this case,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we grant the petition for review and modify the order of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-16\">I. THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b222-17\">The facts are undisputed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Bethlehem has many facilities throughout the country, employing thousands of persons. One of its facilities is a shipyard, called the \u201cSan Pedro Yard,\u201d located at Terminal Island, California. At the San Pedro Yard, a wide variety of ship repair and maintenance work is performed. Harbor craft and ocean vessels of all types are continuously brought into the Yard, and after the requested repair and maintenance work is performed, the ships are returned to their owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-18\">On February 19,1974, a Compliance Safety &amp; Health Officer conducted an inspection of the U.S.S. Navasota (a Navy oil tanker), which was at the San Pedro Yard for repairs. The Officer found that Bethlehem had permitted a bilge pump and the attached air hoses to obstruct a passageway which was used by the Bethlehem employees installing various valves and pipes and pumping bilge water in the engine area. As the result of this inspection, an amended citation was issued on March 8, 1974, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>a nonserious violation of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.51(a) and proposing no penalty. The regulation allegedly violated is a housekeeping provision which requires that \u201c[ajdequate aisles and passageways shall be maintained in all work areas.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-19\">On May 9, 1974, another Compliance Safety &amp; Health Officer conducted an inspection <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of a vessel, the U.S. Coast Guard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Vessel Glacier, docked at the San Pedro Yard for repairs. During the course of his inspection, the Officer observed welding and burning leads, oxyacetylene hoses and other hoses lying on the working surface, obstructing the passageways where welders and fitters were erecting steel bunkheads in the dry stores locker area. As a result of this inspection, a citation was issued on May 16,1974, alleging a \u201crepeat\u201d violation of the housekeeping regulation, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.-51(a). A penalty of $60.00 was proposed for the alleged \u201crepeated\u201d violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Bethlehem timely filed with the Secretary of Labor a notification of intent to contest the citation and the proposed penalty of $60.00, thus preserving its right to review 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 659(a). Pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 659(c) and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554, the Secretary issued a complaint against Bethlehem. The complaint stated that Bethlehem was guilty of \u201ca repeat violation within the meaning of Section 17(a) of the Act, in that [it] had been previously cited for violation of the standard\u201d (29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.51(a)). App. at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The matter was submitted to an administrative law judge for decision. Bethlehem did not contest that it had violated 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.51(a) for the second time at its San Pedro Yard, but it did contend that this second violation did not mean that it \u201crepeatedly\u201d violated the regulation within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a). In a stipulation, the parties agreed that the proposed $60.00 fine was reasonable should it be held that Bethlehem\u2019s actions fell within the scope of \u00a7 666(a), and that a $30.00 fine under \u00a7 666(c) <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> would be reasonable in the event that \u00a7 666(a) should be found inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">The principal issue<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> before the administrative law judge, then, was whether \u00a7 666(a) applied to the undisputed facts of this case. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-11\">\u201cAny employer who willfully or repeatedly violates the requirements of section 654 of this title, any standard, rule, or order promulgated pursuant to section 655 of this title, or regulations prescribed pursuant to this chapter, may be assessed a civil penalty of not more than $10,000 for each violation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-14\">The administrative law judge held that \u201cCongress reasonably intended only to embrace repeated instances of the same violation within the $10,000 range\u201d under \u00a7 666(a), and that this case involved a different violation, though of the same regulation. <em>Secretary </em>v. <em>Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>20 OSAHRC 227, 239 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-15\">The Secretary of Labor filed a petition for discretionary review of the administrative law judge\u2019s decision with the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. The Commission granted review, and on September 17,1975, reversed the administrative law judge. It held that the employer\u2019s state of mind was not relevant to a finding of a \u201crepeated\u201d violation within the meaning of \u00a7 666(a), and that a \u201crepeated\u201d violation occurred when the same regulation was violated for a second time, though the two violations were not factually identical. 20 OSAHRC 227, 229-30 (1975). The Commission accepted the stipulation of the parties and assessed a fine of $60.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Bethlehem has filed with this court a timely petition for review of the Commission\u2019s order and we have jurisdiction. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">II. THE MEANING OF \u201cREPEATEDLY\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Resolution of this case rests on the construction given the word \u201crepeatedly\u201d in \u00a7 666(a). This is a question of law, and our review is necessarily broad. As this court stated in <em>Frank Irey, Jr., Inc. v. O. S. H. R. C., </em>519 F.2d 1200, 1206 (3d Cir. 1974):<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXD\">\u201c[I]t is the duty of the courts to interpret the statute under which the agency functions and to determine whether the agency is acting within the congressional purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Our starting point is with the word \u201crepeatedly\u201d itself, though the meaning of a word in a statute cannot be determined in isolation. Webster\u2019s Third Edition does not define \u201crepeatedly,\u201d but it states that the word is the adverbial form of the adjective \u201crepeated.\u201d That adjective is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">\u201c1: renewed or recurring again and again: constant, frequent [ \u2014 absences] [ \u2014 mistakes] [ \u2014 changes of plan]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">2: said, done, or presented again [an often \u2014 excuse] [an eloquently \u2014 speech] [an easily \u2014 pattern]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">The usage examples given by the dictionary for the first definition can easily be converted to examples of the use of \u201crepeatedly\u201d while retaining the sense of the original phrase \u2014 e. <em>g., </em>\u201che is absent repeatedly.\u201d The usage examples given for the second definition cannot be so altered. This is illustrated by the following sentences:</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">It is a repeated speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">It is an often repeated speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-12\">It is a speech made repeatedly.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-13\">The first sentence uses \u201crepeated\u201d in the sense of the dictionary\u2019s second definition\u2014 the speech has been given before, perhaps only once before. Adding the adverb \u201coften\u201d to modify the adjective \u201crepeated\u201d makes the second sentence mean \u201cthe speech is given many times.\u201d The third sentence shows that \u201crepeatedly\u201d is the equivalent of \u201coften repeated,\u201d or, in other words, the plain and ordinary meaning of the word \u201crepeatedly\u201d is \u201cconstantly, frequently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-15\">The Secretary contends that the statute facially permits a far broader interpretation of \u201crepeatedly\u201d than the one applied by the Commission in the instant case (that is, an employer must violate the identical standard of regulation more than once in order to be guilty of a \u201crepeated\u201d violation), and therefore the Commission\u2019s interpretation is \u201ca <em>fortiori </em>rational.\u201d The Secretary points out that \u00a7 666(a) provides in part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8M\">\u201cAny employer who . . . repeatedly violates the requirements of section 654 of this title . . . may be assessed a civil penalty of not more than $10,000 for each violation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-18\">Section 654 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-19\">\u201c(a) Each employer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-20\">(1) shall furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-21\">(2) shall comply with occupational safety and health standards promulgated under this chapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-22\">The literal words of the statute, as understood by the Secretary, would permit the finding of a \u00a7 666(a) violation whenever the general duty to provide a work place free from serious, recognized hazards has been violated more than once, no matter how factually unrelated the two infractions may be. More strikingly, note that \u00a7 654 is violated each time <em>any </em>safety standard is violated, no matter how unserious the violation might be. Thus, the Secretary contends that the literal terms of \u00a7 666(a) would be applicable if two unrelated standards were violated in unrelated circumstances. The Secretary seems to recognize that this extremely harsh interpretation could not have been intended by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>The Commission\u2019s, interpretation of \u201crepeatedly\u201d as' requiring that the same standard or regulation must be violated twice before \u00a7 666(a) applies certainly narrows the potential reach of \u00a7 666(a), but it reads out of the statute entirely the reference to .\u00a7 654. Rather than being \u201ca <em>fortiori </em>correct,\u201d the' Commission\u2019s interpretation requires plain statutory language to be ignored in order to prevent an absurd result.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">Our court, has interpreted \u25a0 \u00a7 666(a). previously* but the\u201ccase dealt with the defi-. nition of \u201cwillfully,\u2019.\u2019 rather than \u201crepeatedly.\u201d Nevertheless, much of the discussion in our previous case, <em>Frank Irey, Jr., Inc. </em>v. <em>O. S. H. R. C., </em>519 F.2d 1200 (3d Cir. 1974),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is helpful to the resolution, of the instant case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADs\">\u201cIt is obvious from the size of the penalty which can be imposed for a \u2018willful\u2019 infraction \u2014 ten times that of a \u2018serious\u2019 one \u2014 that Congress meant to deal with a more flagrant type.of conduct,than that of'a \u2018serious\u2019 violation. .Willfulness con-, notes defianc\u00e9 or such reckless disregard of consequences as to be equivalent to a knowing, \u2022 conscious, . and. d\u00e9liberate flaunting of- the Act. Willful means more than, merely voluntary action or omission \u2014 it involves an element, of obstinate refusal to comply. \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">\u201cWe believe that a' restrictive definition is appropriate here since, otherwise there would be no distinction between a \u2018serious\u2019 offense and a \u2018willful\u2019 one. The' lack of demarcation would permit the agency to assess a higher penalty than that which is authorized for conduct defin\u00e9d as a \u2018serious\u2019 violation. A broad interpretation of \u2018willful\u2019 would disrupt the gradations of penalties and violations so carefully provided in the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1207. The Secretary points out that \u201crepeatedly\u201d is joined to \u201cwillfully\u201d in the statute by the disjunctive \u201cor,\u201d and he contends that therefore \u201crepeatedly\u201d means something different from \u201cwillfully.\u201d While there may be great merit in this contention, a broad interpretation of \u201crepeatedly\u201d would \u201cdisrupt the gradations of penalties and violations so carefully provided in. the Act\u201d just as much as a broad interpretation of \u201cwillfully.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A2o\">Though the legislative history is meager, it dbes provide some help in determining what Congress contemplated by the phrase \u201cwillfully or repeatedly.\u201d The original Senate bill did not contain a civil penalty for willfully or repeatedly violating standards or regulations under the Act, but it did provide for a criminal penalty of not more than $10,000. and/or six months in jail for willful violations. 1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; AdmimNews p. 5212. The House amendment provided a civil penalty of up to $10,-000., for willful or repeated violations. These two provisions were compromised at conference \u2014 the House\u2019s civil provision was retained and the Senate\u2019s criminal provision was modified to apply only to willful violations which result in the death of an employee. <em>Id. </em>at 5237-38. Thus, \u201cwillfully\u201d first appeared in a criminal provision, and \u201crepeatedly\u201d was added when that criminal provision was changed to a civil provision. The genesis of \u201cwillfully\u201d in a criminal provision strongly suggests that it was originally meant to require a strong showing of intent. To establish a civil violation, it is normally not necessary to show intent, and therefore it seems reasonable to conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>that the House added \u201crepeatedly\u201d to serve as an objective basis on which to attach liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">The compelling logic of <em>Frank Irey </em>indicates that \u00a7 666(a) is directed at particularly flagrant conduct, and therefore the objective conduct which \u201crepeatedly\u201d encompasses must be similar to that which would raise an inference of willfulness. The following discussion of \u00a7 666(a) by the Commission in an earlier case sets forth what we believe to be an appropriate starting point for the development of a workable definition of \u201crepeatedly\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">\u201cAs a starting point, it should be observed that the size of a penalty that can be imposed for a \u2018repeated\u2019 violation is ten times that for a singular \u2018serious\u2019 violation. Hence, it is obvious that Congress intended to deal with a more flagrant type of conduct than just a single serious violation. <em>Cf. Frank Irey, Jr., Inc. v. O. S. H. R. C., . </em>which discusses \u2018willful\u2019 violations of the Act. These are grouped with \u2018repeated\u2019 violations as,being the most severe in the hierarchy of civil penalties. The term \u2018repeated\u2019 is therefore read to mean happening more than once<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in .a manner which flaunts the requirements of the Act. With a test of whether the requirements of the Act are being flaunted it cannot be said abstractly just how many places of employment or conditions of employment should be considered. Each case must be decided upon its own merits and turn upon the nature and extent of the violations involved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-9\"><em>Secretary v. General Electric Co., </em>17 OSAHRC 49, 65-66 (No. 2739, 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">The mere occurrence of a violation of a standard or regulation more than twice does not constitute that flaunting necessary to be found before a penalty can be assessed under \u00a7 666(a). What acts constitute flaunting of the requirements of the Act must be determined, in the first instance, by the Secretary and the Commission, but they should be guided by our statements in <em>Frank Irey </em>quoted at page 161, <em>supra. </em>It should be noted that \u00a7 666(a) can be applicable even if the same standard is never violated twice, if the general or specific duty clauses of \u00a7 654(a)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> are repeatedly violated in such a way as to demonstrate a flaunting disregard of the requirements of the Act. Among the factors the Commission should consider when determining whether a course of conduct is flaunting the requirements of the Act are the number, proximity in time, nature and extent of violations, their factual and legal relatedness, the degree of care of the employer in his efforts to prevent violations of the type involved, and the nature of the duties, standards, or regulations violated.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">Since it is undisputed that Bethlehem was cited for only two violations of a specific standard, it has not \u201crepeatedly\u201d violated any standard. There is no need, therefore, to remand this case to the Commission for a determination of whether Bethlehem\u2019s conduct constituted a flaunting of the Act.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>The petition for review will be granted, the order of the Commission will be modified to assess a penalty in the amount of $30.00, in accordance with paragraph 25 of the stipulation (24a), and, as so modified, such order will be enforced.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b222-10\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-11\">\u201cAny employer who willfully or repeatedly violates the requirements of section 654 of this title, any standard rule, or order promulgated pursuant to section 655 of this title, or regulations prescribed pursuant to this chapter, may be assessed a civil penalty of not more than $10,000 for each violation.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b222-12\">.

The Secretary points out that \u00a7 666(a) does not require the imposition of \u00e1 $10,000. penalty; it merely permits that imposition of a penalty up to $10,000. Moreover, \u00a7 666(i) sets out factors which must be considered in setting the amount .of a penalty. Nevertheless, within the limits set out in the statute, the amount of penalty assessed for any violation is a matter of discretion, and a court\u2019s review is limited to abuse of discretion.
