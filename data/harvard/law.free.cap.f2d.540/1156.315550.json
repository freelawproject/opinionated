On June 16,1972, he was sentenced to a prison term of five years. On January 30, 1975, he was released pursuant to a Certificate of Mandatory Release, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4164, which obligated him to remain under supervision as if under parole until the expiration of his term less 180 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-21\">On July 2, 1975, the United States Board of Parole sought a parole violation warrant for Carson on two grounds: (1) that he had failed to submit his supervision report for May, 1975, and (2) that he had failed to report a change of address. The next day he was arrested in Biloxi, Mississippi, and on July 15 he was afforded a preliminary hearing before Chief Probation Officer Gerald W. Brown at Gulfport, Mississippi. Carson then was moved to the New York Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he arrived on August 15. His parole revocation hearing was held on September 24, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>The two charges against Carson of which he had notice prior to the hearing were detailed in a letter from his parole officer, Roger H. Berger, who originally had applied for the violator warrant and who appeared to testify at the proceedings. Carson, who was represented by counsel, denied both charges contained in the warrant. He claimed to have sent Berger a letter dated May 29,1975, which amounted to a supervision report and a report of his address change. The usual supervision report form apparently had not reached Carson because it had been mailed to him under a different name. At the hearing Carson produced a photocopy of the letter which he testified that he had sent as his supervision report to Berger at the end of May. He also testified that he had attempted to telephone Berger and to leave messages concerning his whereabouts. Berger denied having received either the letter or the telephone messages. Moreover, responding to questions, Carson admitted that, in visiting Biloxi and Canada on an earlier trip, he had traveled outside his parole district without receiving specific permission from his parole officer. He acknowledged, however, that on other occasions when he left the Southern District of New York he had always obtained specific permission, either written or oral, before departing. Berger testified, on the other hand, that he had not given Carson blanket permission to travel outside the district but that, on the contrary, he had advised Carson that he must stay within a 75-mile radius of New York City unless he received written permission from the Parole Board to go beyond this radius. Carson, in turn, conceded that he had received specific written permission for all trips outside the district except those to Canada and Mississippi.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-4\">The hearing then passed to consideration of Carson\u2019s activities apart from the specific violations charged in the warrant and his admitted travels outside the parole district. Information favorable to Carson concerning his attempt to earn a living by booking bands and operating a discotheque was elicited and corroborated. However, Berger also testified concerning various allegations contained in documents in Carson\u2019s parole file suggesting that he may have committed other offenses or engaged in undesirable conduct while on parole. The documents were never shown to Carson who had to rely upon Berger\u2019s summaries in fashioning his responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-7\">After a short conference following the hearing, the examiners orally announced that Carson\u2019s mandatory release had been revoked. They specified three specific violations as grounds for their decision: (1) Carson had failed to submit the proper supervisory report; (2) he had failed to report a change of his address; and (3) he admitted having departed the jurisdiction without permission. The examiners, furthermore, decided to confine Carson for the expiration of his term because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADq\">\u201cwe feel your release at this time would depreciate the seriousness of your mandatory release and promote disrespect for the mandatory release process and we do not think that there is a reasonable probability at this time that you would [conform to the] conditions of your mandatory release.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1222-8\">After the hearing, Carson renewed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On November 14, 1975, the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, Marvin E. Frankel, <em>Judge, </em>granted the writ. See 403 F.Supp. 747. Holding that Carson had been denied due process, Judge Frankel based his decision on (1) the three-month delay between the date of Carson\u2019s arrest in Biloxi and his hearing date, which was deemed excessive; (2) the hearing examiner\u2019s reliance upon undisclosed information; (3) the rambling disorderliness of the hearing; and (4) the inadequacy of the statement of reasons supporting revocation. We affirm the grant of the writ of habeas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>corpus. However, in doing so we find it unnecessary to pass on grounds (1) and (3) asserted by Judge Frankel. Nor does our holding imply that we necessarily share his characterizations of the Parole Board\u2019s conduct in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-6\">As with most procedural due process questions, a tension permeates parole revocation procedure. On the one hand, there is the disinclination to convert the revocation hearing into a full-blown adversarial process, equipped with the totality of formal rights and procedures associated with a criminal trial. On the other, there is the necessity of channelling the Parole Board\u2019s discretion in a responsible fashion, so that the decision, which is of prime importance to the parolee\u2019s life and liberty, is not tainted by unfairness or carelessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-7\">In <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972), the Supreme Court attempted to strike a balance between these divergent interests, the one institutional and the other individual. Beginning \u201cwith the proposition that the revocation of parole is not part of a criminal prosecution and thus the full panoply of rights due a defendant in such a proceeding does not apply to parole revocations,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 480, 92 S.Ct. at 2600, the Court nonetheless proceeded to recognize that revocation of parole inflicts a \u201c \u2018grievous loss\u2019 on the parolee\u201d and therefore the proceeding \u201ccalls for some orderly process . . . ,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 482, 92 S.Ct. 2593. This principle has since been applied in a variety of similar contexts. See, e. g., <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 93 S.Ct. 1756, 36 L.Ed.2d 656 (1973); <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 879 (1974); <em>Cardaropoli </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>523 F.2d 990 (2d Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-9\">In enunciating minimum requirements of due process for parole revocation proceedings, the <em>Morrissey </em>Court did not embrace the full trappings of a criminal trial. /Instead, it mandated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1223-11\">\u201c(a) written notice of the claimed violations of parole; (b) disclosure to the parolee of evidence against him; (c) opportunity to be heard in person and to present witnesses and documentary evidence; (d) the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses (unless the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not allowing confrontation); (e) a \u2018neutral and detached\u2019 hearing body . ; and (f) a written statement by the factfinders as to the evidence relied on and reasons for revoking parole.\u201d 408 U.S. at 489, 92 S.Ct. at 2604.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1223-12\">These requirements are designed to further a variety of specific but vital objectives: (1) minimization of surprise so that the parolee may formulate and organize a coherent and complete defense; (2) the opportunity directly (and thus more effectively) to challenge witnesses speaking against him; and (3) objective decisionmaking based on an accurate account of the parolee\u2019s conduct. With these \u201cminimum requirements of due process,\u201d 408 U.S. at 489, 92 S.Ct. 2593, in mind we turn to two of the contentions advanced by appellee in the district court, which we believe to be dispositive of this appeal: that there was inadequate \u201cwritten notice of the claimed violations of parole\u201d and insufficient \u201cdisclosure to the parolee of evidence against him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-13\">\n<em>Notice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-14\">Although Judge Frankel did not expressly rule on this issue, appellee emphasizes that the disparity between the notice afforded Carson and the Parole Board\u2019s asserted grounds for its decision offends the due process requirements outlined in. <em>Morrissey </em>and highlighted by our recent decision of <em>Kloner v. United States, </em>535 F.2d 730, Dkt. No. 75-2316, Slip Opin. 3661, 3668-69 (2d Cir. May 10, 1976). More specifically the Board, as its third ground for revocation of parole, relied upon Carson\u2019s admissions during the course of the hearing that in visiting Biloxi, Mississippi, and Canada, he had twice ventured outside his parole district without specific permission. Although the Board, well in advance of the revocation hearing, was aware of these violations,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> they were never mentioned as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>ground in the violator\u2019s warrant or in any subsequent notice, despite <em>Morrissey\u2019s </em>requirement of \u201cwritten notice of the claimed violations of parole,\u201d 408 U.S. at 489, 92 S.Ct. at 2604. Nevertheless the hearing examiners proceeded to inquire into Carson\u2019s allegedly unauthorized travels to Mississippi and Canada and to include this ground as a reason for revoking parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">Under these circumstances the absence of written notice with respect to the third violation cannot be squared with <em>Morrissey </em>and <em>Kloner. </em>It would have entailed little inconvenience to the Board to have supplemented the violator\u2019s warrant with further written notice apprising Carson that he must be prepared to answer charges concerning his impermissible trips, either by way of contradiction or mitigation as permitted by <em>Morrissey, </em>408 U.S. at 488, 92 S.Ct. 2593. As in <em>Kloner, </em>we are unwilling \u201cto speculate what action [the Board] would have taken if proper notice had been furnished with respect to the [third] claim and if the defendant had had the opportunity to prepare and present mitigating evidence in rebuttal.\u201d 535 F.2d at 735. Consequently, we find that the requirement of prior notice, so central and well recognized an element of procedural due process guarantees, see <em>Gagnon v. Searpelli, supra, </em>411 U.S. at 782, 93 S.Ct. 1756; <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, supra, </em>418 U.S. at 563-64, 94 S.Ct. 2963; <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 31-34, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967); <em>Cardaropoli v. Norton, supra, </em>523 F.2d at 996, has not been met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">We do not intend this decision to be viewed as establishing a rule to the effect that in the absence of prior notice to the parolee the Parole Board may never rely upon a parolee\u2019s admission of violations as a basis for revoking parole.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A <em>per se </em>ban of that sort would run counter to the teaching of <em>Morrissey </em>that \u201cit is important for the board to know not only that some violation was committed but also to know accurately how many and how serious the violations were,\u201d <em>id. </em>408 U.S. at 480, 92 S.Ct. at 2599, which was a clear invitation to the Board to inquire into the particulars of the parolee\u2019s conduct. Furthermore, such an ironclad rule could prove too impractical, since it would in effect compel the Board, each time an unexpected admission surfaced during the course of a hearing, to adjourn the proceeding to permit the giving of written notice of the violation admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-9\">The Board should not, therefore, be precluded in appropriate cases from basing revocation of parole upon new and unexpected violations disclosed during the course of a hearing. However, where the Board has advance information or reason to believe that a violation has occurred, prior notice to the parolee is essential. This was the essence of our holding in <em>Kloner. </em>Crucial to the decision in that case was the recognition that Kloner\u2019s admission was not a spontaneous or unexpected one, but was deliberately elicited by the Parole Board on the basis of prior information. As we emphasized there, \u201c[t]he second ground, however, was not the subject of any notice to Kloner prior to the revocation hearing, even though the alleged violation apparently was brought to the attention of the Regional Director of the Board of Parole some six months earlier.\u201d 535 F.2d at 735, &amp; n. 4. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>In such an instance, where the Board undisputably is aware of the alleged violation in advance of the hearing and probes for an \u201cadmission,\u201d we find no logical explanation for failure to provide notice to the parolee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">\n<em>Nondisclosure of Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">As a primary basis for granting the writ of habeas corpus, the district court found \u201cthat the hearing examiners relied upon undisclosed evidence in deciding that petitioner\u2019s parole should be revoked.\u201d 403 F.Supp. at 753. Although Parole Officer Berger summarized the contents of the documents and Carson was afforded the opportunity to respond to the summaries, the district court concluded that the use of such summaries failed to comply with <em>Morrissey\u2019s </em>requirement of \u201cdisclosure to the parolee of evidence against him,\u201d 408 U.S. at 489, 92 S.Ct. at 2604. We agree that a refusal to provide the parolee with access to the actual documents employed against him, without a showing of good cause for such secrecy, is impermissible.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1225-7\">A parolee must be afforded the opportunity for effective rebuttal of allegations against him. Although a formal hearing and formalized cross-examination are not necessary, the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Morrissey </em>that no one\u2019s interest\u2014 neither the public\u2019s nor the parolee\u2019s \u2014 is fostered by exposing a parolee to a substantial risk of recommitment upon the basis of erroneous impressions or conclusions grounded on innuendo or exaggeration, as distinguished from \u201cverified facts,\u201d 408 U.S. at 484, 92 S.Ct. 2593. To insure against such an eventuality \u201cOn request of the parolee, a person who has given adverse information on which parole revocation is to be based is to be made available for questioning in his presence.\u201d 408 U.S. at 487,92 S.Ct. at 2603. The Board may not circumvent this requirement by declining to offer the witness\u2019 live testimony and relying instead on summaries of what he would testify if called. Rather, only if the hearing examiner finds good cause for not producing the witness \u2014 specifically if he \u201cdetermines that an informant would be subjected to risk of harm if his identity were disclosed,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 487, 92 S.Ct. a.t 2603 \u2014 can the government be excused from proffering the \u201cbest evidence.\u201d Cf. <em>Birzon v. King, </em>469 F.2d 1241, 1244-45 (2d Cir. 1972). However, the Supreme Court has also recognized that \u201cthe process should be flexible enough to consider evidence including letters, affidavits, and other material that would not be admissible in an adversary criminal trial.\u201d 408 U.S. at 489, 92 S.Ct. at 2604.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-10\">Realistically viewed, the parolee\u2019s right to scrutinize documents containing incriminating information that will be used against him at his revocation hearing is just as important as his right to question adverse witnesses. Indeed, the institutional dislocation occasioned by permitting the parolee to have access to documents or letters that are to be used against him would be substantially less significant than that caused by having to produce live witnesses at the parolee\u2019s request. Cf. <em>Baxter v. Palmigiano, </em>425 U.S. 308, 96 S.Ct. 1551, 47 L.Ed.2d 810, 4491-92 (1976); <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, supra, </em>418 U.S. at 566, 94 S.Ct. 2963; <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 406, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971). Consequently, the institutional interests of the parole administration do not justify nondisclosure of relevant documentary information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-11\">Furthermore, because of the risks of distortion or subtle changes of meaning, a parole officer\u2019s summary of documents containing incriminating information that may be disputed by the parolee does not constitute an adequate substitute for the document itself, particularly since, as the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Morrissey, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>parole officer, who often is responsible for requesting the parole violation warrant and' convening the revocation hearing, cannot always be expected to approach his task with \u201ccomplete objectivity,\u201d 408 U.S. at 486, 92 S.Ct. 2593. \u201cParole agents are human, and it is possible that friction between the agent and parolee may have influenced the agent\u2019s judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486 n. 14, 92 S.Ct. 2603, <em>citing </em>4 Attorney General\u2019s Survey on Release Procedures: Parole 246 (1939).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For these reasons, absent a showing of unusual circumstances, we decline to hold that due process requirements were met in this case by the furnishing of oral summaries at the hearing itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">It must also be remembered that, although the Board is obligated to furnish a written statement of the evidence relied on, its parole revocation decision often is not predicated upon well defined and clearcut criminal offenses. Instead, the hearing examiners are afforded substantial discretion to revoke parole upon the basis of generalized impressions of the parolee\u2019s past conduct and predictions of future adjustment. In this case, for example, the examiners ordered Carson\u2019s reincarceration because, in their rather inelegant jargon, they concluded: \u201c[Y]our release at this tiliie would depreciate the seriousness of your mandatory release . . . and we do not think that there is a reasonable probability at this time that you would [conform to the] conditions of your mandatory release. . . . \u201d Assuming that a revocation decision may turn upon such impressionistic conclusions, it becomes all the more important to provide advance disclosure of the documentary proof upon which it is based in order to safeguard against the Board\u2019s substitution of rumor, exaggeration, or faulty characterizations concerning the parolee\u2019s conduct for facts. The due process requirements of <em>Morrissey </em>are designed to minimize just such a risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-7\">Turning to the record before us, a comparison of Parole Officer Berger\u2019s summaries at the revocation hearing in the present case with the actual content of some of the documents in question highlights the potential for inaccuracies and distortion inherent in such summarization. For example, one letter in the file stated that Carson attempted to obtain employment as a booking agent for a night club and that \u201c[t]here is some speculation that [one of the individuals associated with the club] has connections with organized crime.\u201d At the hearing this passage was unfavorably characterized as stating that \u201cof the associates that Mr. Carson wanted to go into business with, . other fellows involved were considered to be front men for the Mafia.\u201d Similarly, at the hearing Berger reported that during April-May of 1975, Carson \u201cwas under investigation by the FBI for the fraudulent . . cashing [of checks].\u201d Left unmentioned was the exculpatory statement that the documents further disclosed that there was \u201cno hard evidence\u201d against the parolee, and that \u201c[w]e have been informed by the FBI that the parolee is no longer the subject of their investigation.\u201d Finally, along similar lines, Berger informed the hearing examiner that Carson gave to an attorney a \u201cbum\u201d check that did not clear when deposited. The document in question, however, contained evidence which raised legitimate questions concerning the good faith of this attorney\u2019s allegations and that supported Carson\u2019s explanation that he had arranged to repay the debt through other means. Yet this document was never made available to the parolee. Thus the record amply supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that the parole officer\u2019s summary of relevant documents was not \u201cmeaningful.\u201d 403 F.Supp. at 753-54 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-10\">Nor can we agree with the government\u2019s apparent suggestion that nondisclosure of documentary proof is permissible as long as the evidence is used in the dispositional stage of the proceedings rather than in determining the existence of parole violations. All aspects of a revocation hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>are designed to answer the ultimate question of whether \u201cthe parolee is entitled to retain his liberty . . . 408 U.S. at 479, 92 S.Ct. at 2599. Although this decisionmaking is carried out in two stages \u2014 (1) the determination of whether there has been a violation and, if so, (2) the decision as to whether parole should be revoked\u2014 the second, or dispositional, step, like the first, \u201cdepends on facts,\u201d requiring an accurate assessment of the parolee\u2019s past conduct and of the likelihood \u201cof restoring him to normal and useful life within the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 480, 484, 92 S.Ct. at 2601. In both steps the need to filter out distorted summaries of relevant facts is important. Accordingly, we conclude that the requirement of \u201cdisclosure to the parolee of evidence against him\u201d does not turn on the stage of the proceeding in which the information is introduced.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1227-6\">In summary, tve hold that due process requires that the parolee be afforded access to the documents that will be introduced against him, unless the Parole Board meets the burden of establishing good cause for their nondisclosure, e. g., that disclosure will lead to reprisals or substantially interfere with a pending criminal investigation involving an allegation contained in the documentary record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-7\">Here the Board\u2019s failure to disclose relevant incriminating documents to the parolee was never justified and therefore cannot be permitted to stand. Neither at the parole revocation hearing, where the matter must ordinarily first be raised, cf. <em>Birzon v. King, supra, </em>469 F.2d at 1244-45, nor in these proceedings has the government offered any explanation for its unwillingness to disclose the \u201csecret file\u201d to Carson. Having examined that file, we, like Judge Frankel, \u201cperceive no evident justification for the secrecy.\u201d 403 F.Supp. at 753.</p>\n<p id=\"AFc\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1222-5\">. Carson originally sought the writ of habeas corpus in September, 1975, upon his arrival in New York but before the revocation hearing was held. His original application was based on the delay in holding the revocation hearing following his arrest in Biloxi. Judge Frankel did not rule on this application at that time since a hearing was then imminent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1223-10\">. The trip to Canada was revealed in documents dated June, 1975, available a few days before the violator\u2019s warrant was issued and three months before the <em>commencement o\u00ed the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>revocation hearing. Obviously, with Carson\u2019s arrest in Mississippi on July 3, 1975, the Board was made aware of his impermissible trip thereto and could have provided notice of this violation prior to the September hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1224-7\">. We also reject appellee\u2019s apparent argument that the due process right of notice outlined in <em>Morrissey </em>and <em>Kloner </em>is offended by technical and nonprejudicial variances between the written notice and the Parole Board\u2019s final findings of violations. For example, we find no infirmity in the fact that, although the notice in this case charged failure to submit a supervision report, the Board\u2019s reasoning faulted Carson for failing \u201cto personally visit the parole officer and take care of this matter.\u201d Since it is obvious that the failure to visit the office is a normal subject of inquiry when considering the failure to submit a report to the parole officer, Carson could not have been surprised when asked if he had ever visited his officer to acquire and complete a proper supervision report and the Board was not obligated to specifically charge Carson\u2019s failure to come to the parole office.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"Ap1\">. We find no merit in the government\u2019s suggestion that Carson waived his claim to disclosure by failing to specifically request \u201cfurther particularization.\u201d It is undisputed that prior to the hearing, Carson wrote letters to the Parole Board and asked to see his files. The Board denied the request. In any event, we would require the clearest evidence of an intentional waiver before denying a parolee the \u201cminimum requirements of due process.\u201d 408 U.S. at 489, 92 S.Ct. 2593.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1227-22\">. For this reason we reject the government\u2019s argument that nondisclosure in this instance is permissible since \u201c[t]here is no support in the record . . . for Judge Frankel\u2019s contention that these documents were used to find that Carson had violated his parole conditions.\u201d The record unequivocally supports the conclusion that undisclosed evidence formed an important part of the proof introduced at the dispositional stage of the hearing. See 403 F.Supp. at 753. Indeed, the United States Attorney acknowledged that \u201cthe government does not contend that [the documents were] not important at the hearing,\u201d and agreed with Judge Frankel\u2019s argument that \u201cisn\u2019t it clear to you that if you refer to papers in formulating your questions and your thoughts in the course of the hearing that those papers become part of the materials that affect your ultimate decision one way or another?\u201d Thus, the evidence was still used \u201cagainst\u201d the parolee as specified in <em>Morrissey. </em>See 408 U.S. at 489, 92 S.Ct. 2593.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1226-11\">.
