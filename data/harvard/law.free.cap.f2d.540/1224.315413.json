Assuming a private damage remedy would lie for a violation of \u00a7 316(d), the district court ruled that neither punitive damages nor damages for mental distress were proper elements of recovery. We reverse. We hold that a private right of action exists under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 316(d), and that in a proper case punitive damages and damages for mental distress may be recovered. The allegations of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint were sufficient to entitle them to introduce proof supporting the recovery of such damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-17\">In substance, the complaint alleged the following: On July 5, 1973, plaintiffs contracted with defendant for defendant to pick up plaintiffs\u2019 household furniture at New Haven, Connecticut, and to deliver it to plaintiffs at Columbia, South Carolina, on about July 18, 1973. The defendant delivered about eighty per cent of the goods on August 8,1973, and the remaining twenty per cent on October 10, 1973. Some of the items were lost and others were damaged. Because of the delay in delivery, plaintiffs incurred various out-of-pocket expenses. In addition,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzK\">plaintiffs suffered extreme mental anguish and distress by reason of the failure of the defendant to make delivery according to the contract, as the plaintiff F. Patrick Hubbard was starting a new career as a law professor, and the plaintiff Judy Hubbard, his wife, was at the time four months pregnant, and for these rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>sons the plaintiffs were particularly anxious to get established in their new home in July.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1290-4\">Plaintiffs alleged that the delay occurred because the defendant used its equipment to haul the goods of other unknown persons instead of plaintiffs\u2019 goods, \u201cwithout any valid reason therefor,\u201d and that defendant thereby gave an undue and unreasonable preference to such other persons. Plaintiffs further alleged that defendant \u201cacted in a reckless, willful, and wanton manner, in callous disregard of the rights of the plaintiffs.\u201d The prayer for relief sought $25,000 actual and punitive damages, interest, and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-5\">Defendant moved to strike all portions of the complaint relating to the plaintiffs\u2019 mental distress and to the defendant\u2019s scienter, on the grounds that damages for mental distress and punitive damages were not recoverable for undue discrimination against a shipper. The district court granted the motion and ordered the material stricken. The parties subsequently entered into a stipulation as to the remaining damages (out-of-pocket expenses and damages for loss and breakage of property), and judgment was entered for plaintiffs in the stipulated amount. The plaintiffs appeal from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-7\">In pertinent part, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 316(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1290-8\">It shall be unlawful for any common carrier by motor vehicle engaged in interstate or foreign commerce to make, give, or cause any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person ... in any respect whatsoever; or to subject any particular person . to any unjust discrimination or any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1290-19\">We have found no case discussing the issue of whether a private damage remedy will lie for breach of the duty imposed by this section. However, the Civil Aeronautics Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1374(b), imposes the same duty on common carriers by air, and it is well established that a private right of action exists for violation of that section. <em>See, e. g., Nader v. Allegheny Airlines, Inc., </em>167 U.S.App.D.C. 350, 512 F.2d 527, 537 (1975), rev\u2019d on other grounds, - U.S. -, 96 S.Ct. 1978, 48 L.Ed.2d 643 (1976); <em>Archibald v. Pan American World Airways, Inc., </em>460 F.2d 14, 16 (9 Cir. 1972); <em>Fitzgerald v. Pan American World Airways, Inc., </em>229 F.2d 499, 501-02 (2 Cir. 1956). Defendant has suggested no reason for reaching a different result under Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act, other than to point to the obvious fact that the Aeronautics Act cases involve discrimination against <em>persons, </em>whereas this case involves discrimination against <em>property. </em>We believe this difference is immaterial, and are persuaded by the logic of the cases under the Aeronautics Act; thus, we hold that a private right of action exists for violation of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 316(d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1290-23\">Defendant correctly observes, however, that the Carmack Amendment, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20(11),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> concerning limitation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>liability by common carriers, is made applicable to motor carriers by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 319, but not to carriers by air. Defendant contends that the Carmack Amendment precludes recovery of the sort of damages sought by plaintiffs here. If defendant\u2019s view of the Carmack Amendment is correct, then cases indicating that punitive damages may be recovered under the Aeronautics Act, e. <em>g. Nader </em>v. <em>Allegheny Airlines, Inc., </em>512 F.2d at 549-51; <em>Archibald v. Pan American World Airways, Inc., </em>460 F.2d at 16; <em>Wills </em>v. <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>200 F.Supp. 360, 366-67 (S.D.Cal.1961), are distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-5\">Defendant places principal reliance on language of the Carmack Amendment making any common carrier receiving property for transportation liable for the \u201cfull actual loss, damage, or injury to such property caused by it\u201d except where the I.C.C. has authorized the establishment of rates based on declared value, in which case liability may be limited to the declared value. (No suggestion is made that the exception is applicable to the instant case.) Based upon this language, defendant makes two arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-6\">First, it contends that the phrase \u201cto such property\u201d indicates that the liability of motor carriers is limited by the Carmack Amendment to damages for physical injury to or loss of the property being transported. This contention has been repeatedly rejected by the Supreme Court. In <em>New York, Philadelphia &amp; Norfolk R. R. v. Peninsula Produce Exchange, </em>240 U.S. 34, 36 S.Ct. 230, 60 L.Ed. 511 (1916), the Court construed the phrase \u201cto such property\u201d as limiting only the word \u201cinjury\u201d; thus, the words \u201closs\u201d and \u201cdamage\u201d are left unlimited, and the phrase \u201cany loss, damage, or injury to such property\u201d is \u201ccomprehensive enough to embrace all damages resulting from any failure to discharge a carrier\u2019s duty with respect to any part of the transportation to the agreed destination.\u201d 240 U.S. at 38, 36 S.Ct. at 232. The statute thus comprehends damages personal to the shipper, such as damages for delay in shipment. <em>Southeastern Express Co. v. Pastime Amusement Co., </em>299 U.S. 28, 57 S.Ct. 73, 81 L.Ed. 20 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-9\">Second, defendant argues that the word \u201cactual\u201d which precedes the phrase \u201closs, damage, or injury\u201d precludes the recovery of punitive damages, and possibly damages for mental distress as well. To accept this construction of the statute, we would be required to disregard the literal terms of the balance of its language and its evident overall meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-10\">As preface, we summarize the language of the Carmack Amendment, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20(11), the material portions of which have been set forth in the margin in n. 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqaa\">Any common carrier receiving property for transportation shall be liable for any loss, damage, or injury caused by it, and no contract or other limitation of any character shall exempt such carrier from the liability imposed. Any such carrier shall be liable for the <em>full actual loss, damage, or injury </em>caused by it notwithstanding any limitation of liability in any contract or in any tariff filed with the I.C.C., provided, however, that the provisions hereof respecting liability for full actual loss, damage, or injury, notwithstanding any limitation of liability, shall not apply where the I.C.C. has authorized the establishment of value-based rates, in which case liability may be limited to the declared value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>Even if we assume that <em>\u201cactual </em>loss, damage, or injury\u201d does not include punitive damages or damages for mental distress, it does not follow that the statute extinguishes a carrier\u2019s liability for these elements of damages. The initial portion of the statute, which imposes liability, speaks only in terms of <em>\u201cany </em>loss, damage, or injury.\u201d This liability is to attach regardless of any limitation of a <em>contractual </em>nature. The second portion of the statute, which contains the phrase \u201cfull actual loss, damage, or injury\u201d specifies that the liability it speaks of, <em>i. </em>e., liability for <em>actual </em>loss, may not be limited by contract <em>or by tariff. </em>Finally, the proviso permits liability to be limited where the I.C.C. has approved rates based on declared value, a circumstance not relevant here. Thus, to the extent that the Carmack Amendment has any impact on the availability of punitive damages and damages for mental distress under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 316(d), we think its only effect would be to permit a carrier to limit its liability for such damages <em>by tariff: </em>the negative implication of the statute is that while liability for <em>\u201cany </em>loss, damage, or injury\u201d may not be limited by contract, it may be limited by tariff to the extent that it exceeds \u201cfull <em>actual </em>loss, damage, or injury.\u201d Defendant has not drawn our attention to any such limiting tariff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-4\">Moreover, we are doubtful that the Car-mack Amendment was intended to place any limitation at all on carrier liability except in the event of I.C.C. approval of value-based rates. The basic thrust of the Amendment is to <em>prevent </em>limitations of liability, and we are not persuaded that Congress, by invalidating attempted limitations of liability to less than \u201cfull actual loss, damage, or injury,\u201d intended to extinguish liability which otherwise might exist in the absence of any contractual or tariff limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-5\">Our reading of the statute is bolstered by a further proviso contained therein, which states: \u201cnothing in this section shall deprive any [shipper] of any remedy or right of action which he has under the existing law . . While Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act, passed in 1935, c. 498, 49 Stat. 558, is not, strictly speaking, the existing law with respect to the 1906 Car-mack Amendment, c. 3591, \u00a7 7, 34 Stat. 593, and while it is true that the savings clause cannot validate remedies otherwise inconsistent with the body of the statute, <em>see Adams Express Co. v. Croninger, </em>226 U.S. 491, 507-08, 33 S.Ct. 148, 57 L.Ed. 314 (1913),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we think the quoted language tends to refute defendant\u2019s implicit contention that Congress in passing the Carmack Amendment effected any general limitation on the liability of carriers under other laws. <em>Cf. Nader v. Allegheny Airlines, </em>- U.S. -,---, 96 S.Ct. 1978, 1984-1985, 48 L.Ed.2d 643 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"pA-s\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-16\">Since we conclude that the Car-mack Amendment itself presents no barrier to the recovery of punitive damages or damages for mental distress for breach of the duty of nondiscrimination imposed by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 316(d), we must decide as a matter of federal law whether each element of damages claimed by plaintiffs should be allowed. With respect to punitive damages, we are persuaded by the reasoning of those cases which have indicated that such damages are recoverable under the nondiscrimination provision of the Civil Aeronautics Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1374(b). See, e. g., <em>Nader v. Allegheny Airlines, Inc., </em>512 F.2d at 549-51; <em>Archibald v. Pan American World Airways, Inc., </em>460 F.2d at 16; <em>Wills v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>200 F.Supp. at 366-67. We therefore hold that punitive damages are recoverable under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 316(d). In order to be entitled to punitive damages, plaintiffs must, of course, prove that the defendant acted \u201cwantonly, or oppressively, or with such malice as implies a spirit of mischief or criminal indifference to civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>obligations.\u201d <em>Wills, </em>200 F.Supp. at 367, <em>quoted with approval in Archibald, </em>460 F.2d at 16. Intentional, malicious conduct is susceptible to deterrence by the portent of sanctions such as punitive damages; thus, we believe that our decision is fully complementary to the congressional mandate and will help achieve compliance with the requirements of Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-5\">Defendant argues that the recovery of punitive damages in this case is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Chandler v. Aero Mayflower Transit Co., </em>374 F.2d 129 (4 Cir. 1967). <em>Chandler, </em>however, was an action based on the common law liability of a carrier for damage to goods in transit, not a discrimination case brought under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 316(d). Thus, we do not deem it controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-6\">Defendant also contends that any award of punitive damages against it would be futile and fail to achieve any deterrent effect, because the amount of the award would become a cost of service which would be borne ultimately by shippers through an increase in rates. We think that under a proper theory of ratemaking, punitive damages should not be considered as a cost of service in determining what rates are just and reasonable. They should be left uncompensated to diminish what would otherwise be the return to the carrier, who has selected the wrongdoing managers and employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-7\">The complaint alleged that defendant \u201cacted in a reckless, willful, and wanton manner, in callous disregard of the rights of the plaintiffs.\u201d These allegations were sufficient to permit the plaintiffs to introduce supporting evidence, and, if proven, to entitle them to an award of punitive damages. Thus, the allegations relating to punitive damages were improperly stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-11\">Finally, we consider whether 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 316(d) will support a recovery of damages for mental distress caused by a carrier\u2019s delay in delivering household goods. While there have been cited to us numerous South Carolina cases, with the parties each taking a different position as to the correct statement of applicable South Carolina law, we think it manifest that the question is one of federal law, since breach of the duty of nondiscrimination is a federal tort. The issue is one of first impression; we therefore turn to the general law of torts for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-12\">Traditionally, courts have been reluctant . to redress mental injuries, \u201c[bjecause of the fear of fictitious or trivial claims, distrust of the proof offered, and the difficulty of setting up any satisfactory boundaries to liability . . . .\u201d Restatement of Torts 2d \u00a7 46, Comment <em>a. </em>But these are poor reasons for denying recovery for any genuine, serious mental injury. \u201cSo far as distinguishing true claims from false ones is concerned, what is required is rather a careful scrutiny of the evidence supporting the claim; and the elimination of trivialities calls for nothing more than the same common sense which has distinguished serious from trifling injuries in other fields of the law.\u201d W. Prosser, Law of Torts \u00a7 12 at 51 (1971) (footnotes omitted). Some of the criteria which have been deemed helpful in undertaking \u201ccareful scrutiny of the evidence supporting the claim\u201d are:</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-14\">1. Whether the plaintiff has suffered other injuries concomitant to or resulting from the mental distress. Even the most cautious courts have allowed recovery for mental suffering accompanying physical injury caused by the defendant\u2019s wrongful acts. We believe that the existence of direct injury to the plaintiff\u2019s property is similarly a strong indication that claimed mental distress is actual rather than fanciful. <em>See </em>Restatement of Torts \u00a7 905 &amp; Comments c, d, e <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The presence of physi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>cal injuries caused by the mental distress itself is also a reliable indicator. <em>See </em>Prosser, supra, \u00a7 12 at 59-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\">2. Whether the mental distress is severe. <em>See id. </em>at 59; Restatement of Torts 2d \u00a7 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-5\">3. Whether the defendant\u2019s conduct is extreme and outrageous and of a sort likely to produce emotional distress in a person of ordinary sensibilities. <em>See </em>Prosser, supra, \u00a7 12 at 55-59; Restatement of Torts 2d \u00a7 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-6\">4. Whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was intentional or reckless. <em>See </em>Prosser, supra, \u00a7 12 at 60; Restatement of Torts 2d \u00a7 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-7\">5. Whether there is some special relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant establishing a higher than usual duty for defendant toward plaintiff. <em>See </em>Prosser, supra, \u00a7 12 at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-8\">In this case, the conduct of defendant which is alleged to have caused plaintiffs\u2019 mental distress concededly resulted in loss of and damage to plaintiffs\u2019 property and denial of plaintiffs\u2019 use of their property. Plaintiffs have alleged that their mental distress was severe, and that defendant\u2019s conduct was reckless, willful, and wanton. These allegations must be accepted as true in considering defendant\u2019s motion to strike. Plaintiffs and defendant occupy a special relationship, that of shipper and common carrier, which is said to create an extraordinary duty to safeguard plaintiffs\u2019 interests. <em>See id. </em>These factors tend to weigh in favor of plaintiffs\u2019 recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-9\">On the other hand, we have serious doubts that even willful discrimination against a shipper resulting in delay in the receipt of household belongings is extreme and outrageous conduct which would be grossly offensive to a person of normal sensibilities. While in some cases extreme outrage may be found where the defendant has knowledge that the plaintiff is especially susceptible to injury through mental distress by way of particular conduct not outrageous in itself, <em>see </em>Prosser, supra, \u00a7 12 at 58, and while plaintiffs arguably have alleged such special susceptibility,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> plaintiffs have failed to allege that defendant had any knowledge of their special circumstances. We thus must conclude that this factor is at best neutral in testing the sufficiency of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-14\">On balance, we believe the allegations of the complaint regarding mental distress are sufficient to permit plaintiffs to introduce proof on the issue and they were improperly stricken. Thus, the judgment should be reopened for further proceedings to determine if plaintiffs should be permitted recovery of punitive damages and damages for mental distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-15\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.
