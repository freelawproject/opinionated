Specifically, they contend that inmates who have been charged with violations of prison rules and regulations and who are also the subject of separate state criminal charges based on the same alleged conduct are improperly denied the right to services of counsel at disciplinary hearings called to determine the validity of the prison infractions and the right to \u201cuse immunity\u201d for testimony given at these hearings. The district court, in reliance on our opinion in <em>Palmigiano v. Baxter, </em>510 F.2d 534 (1st Cir. 1975),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> held that the inmates were entitled to the presence of counsel and to use immunity at the prison disciplinary hearings in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>question and granted permanent injunctive relief. The state appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">The facts are clearly set forth in the opinion of the district court. <em>Roberts v. Taylor, </em>390 F.Supp. 705 (D.R.I.1975). On December 3, 1972 appellee Roberts was charged by officials at the ACI with possession of a hypodermic needle and syringe, and assaulting and using abusive language to a correctional officer. After a brief initial appearance before the prison disciplinary board Roberts was then charged by the state police with a violation of Rhode Island criminal laws for possession of a hypodermic needle and syringe. At his arraignment on December 12, 1972, he entered a plea of not guilty. On December 21 Roberts appeared before the prison disciplinary board for a hearing on his prison infractions. At this hearing he requested permission to have representation of legal counsel and sought a grant of use and/or derivative use immunity concerning all testimony he would give on the violation on which he was also facing state criminal charges.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both requests were denied. <em>Id. </em>at 708. As a result Roberts refused to testify in his own behalf;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he also informed the hearing board members that had he been granted use immunity he would have presented exculpatory testimony in his own behalf. On the basis of the evidence adduced at the hearing, the board found Roberts guilty of all the violations charged and sentenced him to thirty days in segregation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">A similar pattern of events occurred with respect to Flint, the other named plaintiff. He was charged by prison authorities with using a dangerous weapon to assault two correctional officers and with assaulting an inmate with intent to kill. Flint was arraigned (and entered a plea of not guilty) on similar state criminal charges arising out of the same conduct. In appearances before the disciplinary board on the prison charges Flint requested the assistance of legal counsel and a grant of use immunity concerning all testimony he might provide on the charges against him. Because these requests were denied he refused to testify on his own behalf. He was found guilty on all charges, and was sentenced to thirty days segregation and thirty days loss of good time.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">In <em>Palmigiano </em>v. <em>Baxter, </em>510 F.2d 534 (1st Cir. 1974), we held that \u201cin cases where criminal charges are a realistic possibility, prison authorities should consider whether defense counsel, if requested, should not be let into the disciplinary proceeding, not because <em>Wolff </em>[v. <em>McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974)] requires it in that proceeding, but because <em>Miranda [v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966)] requires it in light of future criminal prosecution.\u201d 510 F.2d at 537. Subsequently, however, the Supreme Court reversed our decision. <em>Baxter v. Palmigiano, </em>425 U.S. 308, 96 S.Ct. 1551, 47 L.Ed.2d 810 (1976). In the Court\u2019s view <em>Miranda, supra </em>had no \u201csubstantial bearing on the question whether counsel must be provided at \u2018prison disciplinary hearings . . . 425 U.S. at 315, 96 S.Ct. at 1556 (citations omitted). The Court held that its decision in <em>Wolff </em>v. <em>McDonnell, supra, </em>compelled the conclusion that although inmates faced the possibility of state prosecution for conduct involved in their prison charges, they nevertheless did not have a right to either retained or appointed counsel in disciplinary hearings and that state authorities were not in error in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>failing to advise inmates to the contrary. <em>Baxter v. Palmigiano, supra, </em>425 U.S. at 314-315, 96 S.Ct. 1551.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Appellees contend that the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Baxter </em>is not necessarily controlling in the instant case. They point to the fact that <em>Baxter </em>involved a situation where there was only a <em>possibility </em>of criminal charges being filed whereas in the present case the inmates had already been arraigned on state charges before their disciplinary hearings on the prison infractions. We do not read the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Baxter, </em>however, to accord leeway for such distinctions. As noted, our opinion in <em>Palmigiano v. Baxter, supra </em>saw a need for legal counsel primarily because the statements inmates might make at the disciplinary hearing would perhaps be used in state court prosecutions for the same conduct. In reversing, the Supreme Court clearly confronted the problem of the possible use of hearing testimony in other contexts, but its ruling indicated that this possibility did not necessitate the presence of counsel at the hearing. The Court specifically emphasized that \u201c[p]rison disciplinary proceedings are not part of a criminal prosecution,\u201d <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, supra, </em>418 U.S. at 556, 94 S.Ct. at 2975, and it declined to hold that the presence of counsel was required \u201cto render pretrial statements admissible in other than criminal cases.\u201d <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>Palmigiano, supra, </em>425 U.S. at 315, 96 S.Ct. at 1556. We are therefore forced to conclude that appellees have no right to counsel at their disciplinary hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The district court also held that the inmates in the present case were entitled to a grant of use immunity. <em>Roberts v. Taylor, supra </em>at 710. The court based its decision on two elements in our opinion in <em>Palmigiano v. Baxter, supra. </em>We had held that an inmate subjected to interrogation at a disciplinary hearing \u201cis entitled to be advised of his right to remain silent, and cannot be further interrogated should he choose not to speak,\u201d and that \u201c[h]is silence may not be used against him at that time or in future proceedings.\u201d 510 F.2d at 536. We also had held that where an inmate was called to a disciplinary hearing under circumstances in which there was a realistic likelihood he would be subject to criminal charges for the same conduct \u201cand is informed that his silence will be used against him, . . . use immunity must be provided and the inmate must be so informed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court disagreed with this analysis and reversed. <em>Baxter v. Palmigiano, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">The critical factor in the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning \u2014 which is also determinative in the present case \u2014 is that \u201ca prison inmate in Rhode Island electing to remain silent during his disciplinary hearing, is not in consequence of his silence automatically found guilty of the infraction with which he has been charged.\u201d 425 U.S. at 317, 96 S.Ct. at 1557. As the Court observed, although he \u201c[is] advised that his silence [can] be used against him, [i]t is undisputed that an inmate\u2019s .silence in and of itself is insufficient to support an adverse decision by the disciplinary board.\u201d <em>Id.; see Morris v. Travisono, </em>310 F.Supp. 857, 873 (D.R.I.1970). The <em>Baxter </em>Court noted that the fifth amendment privileges an individual \u201cnot to answer official inquiries put to him in any . proceeding, civil or criminal, formal'or informal, where the answers might incriminate him in state proceedings,\u201d <em>Baxter v. Palmigiano, supra, </em>425 U.S. at 316, 96 S.Ct. at 1556, quoting <em>Lefkowitz v. Turley, </em>414 U.S. 70, 77, 94 S.Ct. 316, 38 L.Ed.2d 274 (1973), but the Court reasoned that because the Rhode Island prison system does not treat the option of remaining silent as a per se admission pf guilt the inmate is not directly \u201ccompelled to furnish testimonial evidence that might incriminate [him] in later criminal proceedings . . . ,\u201d and therefore the disciplinary hearing procedures do not constitute an improper attempt to compel testimony without granting immunity. <em>Baxter v. Palmigiano, supra, </em>425 U.S. at 316, 96 S.Ct. at 1557.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-12\">Appellees contend that the <em>Baxter </em>Court\u2019s reasoning does not necessarily con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>trol in the instant case, and that use immunity is required. They argue that the \u201cprison disciplinary process is [an] inherently coercive situation\u201d in which \u201can inmate must speak in the face of incriminating evidence in order to avoid an adverse inference should he remain silent\u201d; that the inmate\u2019s testimony is therefore compelled for fifth amendment purposes; and that use immunity is required to compensate for this compulsion. This claim cannot prevail, however, because it runs counter to the basic holding of <em>Baxter v. Palmigiano, supra. </em>The <em>Baxter </em>Court distinguished Rhode Island\u2019s disciplinary hearing, in which electing to remain silent can only give rise to adverse inferences, from proceedings where \u201cfailure to respond to interrogation [is] treated as a final admission of guilt.\u201d 425 U.S. at 318, 96 S.Ct. at 1557. The Court concluded that Rhode Island\u2019s disciplinary hearing procedures do .not require an inmate to waive his fifth amendment privilege. The Court noted that \u201cif inmates are compelled in [disciplinary] proceedings to furnish testimonial evidence that might incriminate them in later criminal proceedings, they must be offered \u2018whatever immunity is required to supplant the privilege\u2019 and may not be required \u2018to waive such immunity,\u2019 \u201d <em>id., </em>quoting <em>Lefkowitz </em>v. <em>Turley, supra, </em>414 U.S. at 85, 94 S.Ct. at 1557, but the Court explicitly stated that where, as here, an inmate can remain silent without there being a conclusive presumption of guilt, \u201c[t]his does not smack of an invalid attempt by the State to compel testimony . or to penalize the exercise of the privilege,\u201d 425 U.S. at 318, 96 S.Ct. at 1557, and the granting of use immunity is not required. We hold, therefore, that <em>Baxter v. Pahnigiano, supra </em>dictates that the judgment of the district court must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-18\">.
