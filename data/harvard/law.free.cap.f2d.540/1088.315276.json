Finding \u00a7 841 inapplicable to appellant be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>cause of his status as a registrant, we reversed the conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This judgment was in turn reversed by the Supreme Court, which held that registered physicians can be prosecuted under \u00a7 841 when their activities fall outside the usual course of professional practice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1153-5\">The case is before us now, on remand from the Supreme Court, for the sole purpose of considering appellant\u2019s claim that he was improperly sentenced. On 14 of the 22 counts, appellant was sentenced to concurrent terms of from 5 to 15 years <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and a substantial fine.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On the 8 counts said to relate to minors<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> he was sentenced, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 845(a),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to doubled sentences of from 10 to 30 years, said sentences to run concurrently with each other but consecutively to the 5 to 15 year sentence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is the legality of the enhanced punishment-under \u00a7 845(a) which appellant-contests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-18\">Relying on the authority of <em>Jordan v. United States District Court for the District of Columbia,</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>appellant argues that enhancement under \u00a7 845(a) was improper because there was neither a charge that the distributees were in fact minors, nor any finding to that effect.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Jordan </em>held that a defendant convicted of attempted robbery could not be given additional punishment under a statute authorizing such an enhanced penalty for one who commits a crime of violence when armed, unless the \u201cfacts in aggravation . . . [are] charged in the indictment and found to be true by the jury.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Appellee, on the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>hand, maintains that <em>Jackson v. United States</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>controls. In <em>Jackson, </em>the court held that where an additional penalty is sought under a statute authorizing it for a defendant previously convicted of a felony, the prior conviction need not be charged in the indictment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1154-4\">In our view, appellant\u2019s argument is the more persuasive. In <em>Jordan, </em>the court distinguished the <em>Jackson </em>decision, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1154-5\">In the second-offender situation . the criminal act which is proscribed is the same regardless of the background of the criminal; the previous offense is merely \u201can historical fact,\u201d as a result of which the penalty may appropriately be made more severe because of the demonstrated proclivities of the defendant. On the other hand, where the aggravation arises from the manner in which the crime was committed, in substance a different aspect of the offense is sought to be punished.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1154-6\">While the distinction between \u201can historical fact\u201d that bespeaks a defendant\u2019s \u201cdemonstrated proclivities\u201d and an \u201caggravation arisfing] from the manner in which the crime was committed\u201d that in effect amounts to a new offense is concededly somewhat elusive, we believe that the age of the distributee fits more squarely in the latter category and thus is an element of the offense which must be alleged in the indictment before sentence can be imposed under \u00a7 845(a).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1154-13\">A recent Supreme Court decision, <em>Mullaney </em>v. <em>Wilbur,</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>lends further support for this view. In <em>Mullaney </em>the Court found violative of due process Maine\u2019s requirement that a defendant charged with murder prove that he acted \u201cin the heat of passion on sudden provocation\u201d in order to reduce the homicide to manslaughter,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> in that it contravened the principle enunciated in <em>In re </em>Winship<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> that the prosecution prove beyond a reasonable doubt every fact necessary to constitute the crime charged. The state in <em>Mullaney </em>argued that the absence of the heat of passion on sudden provocation is not a \u201cfact necessary to constitute the crime\u201d of felonious homicide in Maine, but rather is a fact that comes into play only after the jury has determined that the defendant is guilty and may be punished at least for manslaughter.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Court rejected this contention, stating that the criminal law \u201cis concerned not only with guilt or innocence in the abstract but also with the degree of criminal culpability.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> And, in language particularly applicable to the instant case, the Court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AF-\">if <em>Winship </em>were limited to those facts that constitute a crime as defined by state law, a State could undermine many of the interests that decision sought to protect without effecting any substantive change in its law. It would only be necessary to redefine the elements that comprise different crimes, characterizing them as factors that bear solely on the extent of punishment.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>The circumstances here are analogous, While characterizing the minority of the recipient as a factor bearing solely on the applicable penalty, \u00a7 845(a) clearly reflects the legislature\u2019s view of the heightened culpability of one who distributes to a minor, Accordingly, in keeping with the spirit of <em>Mullaney </em>and <em>Jordan, </em>we hold that the enhanced punishment was improper, and vacate the sentences on counts 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24 and 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-12\">The trial judge did not reveal the reasons for imposing the sentences on the \u201cjuvenile\u201d counts consecutively to the \u201cadult\u201d count sentences. Unwilling to speculate as to what impact the now-vacated \u201cjuvenile\u201d counts might have had on the sentences imposed on the other counts, Judge MacKinnon and the writer think the preferred course is to remand for resentencing on all 22 counts.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1155-13\">Judge McGOWAN dissents from the remand for resentencing of the 14 counts which did not involve sales to minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-14\">The writer of this opinion also would require, for the reasons stated in his separate statement,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> that the trial judge articulate the bases for the sentence imposed on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-15\">Judge McGOWAN and Judge MacKINNON would not require a statement of reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-16\">In Judge MacKINNON\u2019s view, \u201cThere is no necessity to specify reasons for any sentence that may be adjudged. The reasons inhere in the crimes, the multiplicity thereof and the statutory penalties therefor. Sentencing is not an operation in semantics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ahn\">Judge McGOWAN states: \u201cIn common with Judge MacKINNON, I see no legal or other necessity to call upon the District Court for the specification of reasons for whatever sentences it may decide on remand to impose on the eight so-called juven'le counts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AH7\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-20\">Separate Statement of Chief Judge BAZELON:</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-21\">While finding improper the sentences predicated on 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 845 under the facts of this case, .we have expressed no view on the range of permissible sentences available on remand. It seems clear, however, that the trial court could not, absent an expression of sufficient cause, impose new sentences aggregating more than 45 years, the maximum duration of the aggregate sentence originally imposed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And in my view, serious questions may be presented if it appears that the sentence given on remand may still reflect the legislature\u2019s determination to treat more harshly those who distribute to minors (in light of the absence in the indictment of the age of the distributees). I believe that under the circumstances here presented \u2014 where the sentence originally employed has been invalidated, at least in part \u2014 it is reasonable to require the trial judge to clearly articulate the bases for the disposition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1155-22\">In addition to the oft-noted salutary purposes generally served by a statement of reasons,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> exposure of the factors which in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>form and shape the sentencing decision in a case such as this is \u201can indispensable aspect of basic fairness.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The burden on remand would be slight;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> requiring an explanation \u201cis not onerous if the matter [is] dealt with in a conscientious manner . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1156-12\">That requirement here would serve two important purposes. It would provide the appearance<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (in addition to the reality) of proper reconsideration of a sentence free from any taint on remand, as well as providing a procedure which comports with the rudimentary demands of fairness.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1152-26\">. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 <em>et seq. </em>(1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1153-6\">. <em>United States v. </em>Moore, 164 U.S.App.D.C. 319, 505 F.2d 426 (1974) (MacKinnon, X, dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1153-7\">. <em>United States v.

Appellant also argues that \u00a7 845(a) permits the doubling of a sentence only for one found guilty of \u201cdistributing\u201d a controlled substance to a minor, and that he could have been convicted only of \u201cdispensing.\u201d See Appellant\u2019s Brief p. 24 and Reply Brief p. 13 (this contention appears to have been abandoned, however, by virtue of its omission in Appellant\u2019s Supplemental Memorandum filed with this court on March 1, 1976). While our disposition of this case makes resolution of this point unnecessary, we note that appellant was indicted for, and convicted of, \u201cunlawful distribution <em>and </em>dispensation\u201d of a controlled substance. J.A. 32-36.

Although \u00a7 845(a) literally applies only to distributors, it is arguable that appellant may be so classified, in that he can be properly categorized as neither a \u201cdispenser,\u201d because his drug deliveries were not pursuant to a \u201clawful order,\u201d nor a \u201cpractitioner,\u201d because he acted outside the \u201cusual course of professional practice.\u201d <em>See United States v.

United States, </em>462 F.2d 243, 247 (2d Cir. 1972) (\u201cIn this particular case, . . . it is not improbable that the initial sentencing process with respect to the valid counts was to ' some extent affected by the conviction on the far more serious count 1, which was illegally brought. To purge this possible taint after the fact on a Rule 35 motion, we believe the trial judge should either have reduced the sentences on counts 2 through 4 or have given at least a summary explanation of his reasons for declining to do so . . . . If the original sentences on the valid counts are to stand, we think the latter is the minimum necessary to impart integrity to those sentences . . .\u201d); <em>United States v. Latimer, </em>415 F.2d 1288, 1290-1291 (6th Cir.1969) (upon finding that an ex parte communication to the trial judge concerning a possible misfiring of the defendant\u2019s gun might have influenced the sentence, the court remanded for resentencing with instructions that \u201cthe District Court not consider in any way any information regarding the presence of a misfired cartridge found in Latimer\u2019s pistol at the time of his arrest.\u201d The court also directed the district judge, \u201c[i]n order to clarify any doubt that may exist in this connection, . to file a statement of his reasons for imposing the sentence which he will give on remand.\u201d); <em>Washington v. Regan, </em>373 F.Supp. 1368, 1371 (D.N.J.1974), <em>vacated </em>510 F.2d 1126 (3d Cir. 1975) (upon resentencing the defendant as a first offender, the court imposed the same sentence previously imposed on defendant as a multiple offender. The court held that \u201c[g]iven the articulated state policy of treating multiple offenders more harshly . . . than other offenders, it is reasonable to require, on the particular facts of this case, that the sentencing judge articulate a basis for the sentence imposed. This is not to say that the sentencing judge does not have broad discretion to choose between the many sentencing options available, nor should this opinion be read to indicate that the same sentence may not be imposed again upon resentencing. It is, however, incumbent upon the trial judge to state why the petitioner received the same sentence he received when characterized as a multiple offender, if in fact, there is a basis for doing so.\u201d); <em>cf. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number><em>United States v.
