We find a substantial likelihood that the Comptroller failed to consider the relevant New York law in approving the new branch. We therefore vacate the judgment of the district court with instructions to remand to the Comptroller for further findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-24\">On August 6, 1974, Chase filed its application for permission to establish a branch banking office in Locust Valley. At the time the application was submitted, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>area to be serviced by the branch<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> contained 10,150 persons comprising 2200 families with an average annual income of approximately $20,000. Little room remains in the area for further residential development. Chase proposed to locate its branch at a site adjacent to a shopping center in Locust Valley; the branch would thereby serve the same community currently serviced by appellant, the Nassau Trust Company, and a branch of the Prudential Savings Bank of Manhattan.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Hempstead Bank and the Nassau Trust Company filed with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency protests opposing Chase\u2019s application. Hempstead argued that although the average family income of the area was relatively high, projected population growth was minimal. Hempstead contended that the needs of the community were sufficiently served by existing bank branches, the financial condition of which would be impaired by a drain of funds to the new Chase branch. It pointed out that deposits and loans in its own offices had either remained relatively stable or had diminished since 1970. The Regional Administrator of National Banks denied as untimely the Nassau Trust Company\u2019s request for a hearing on the matter, but officers of the competing banks were interviewed with respect to the propriety of approving Chase\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Unanimous recommendation to approve the application was made to the Comptroller by a Deputy Comptroller, the Chief National Bank Examiner, the Director of the Bank Organization ^ Division, and the Regional Administrator. The recommendation was based on findings that, although future growth in the area would likely be minimal, (1) establishment of the branch would add a competitive factor to the area; (2) the branch would enable Chase to extend its facilities into an area that it did not currently serve; and (3) the area was sufficiently affluent to support the branch without adversely affecting conditions. The Comptroller approved Chase\u2019s application on October 10, 1974, without making additional findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">Hempstead thereafter instituted this action to have the Comptroller\u2019s approval declared null and void as having been made in contravention of law. On February 4,1976, the district court after reviewing the administrative record upon which the Comptroller based his action, <em>Camp v. Pitts, </em>411 U.S. 138, 142, 93 S.Ct. 1241, 36 L.Ed.2d 106 (1973), held that the Comptroller had complied with the applicable law and that the record supported his decision. The district judge granted summary judgment for the Comptroller and this appeal by Hempstead followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">Federal law provides that a national bank, such as Chase, may establish branches only under the conditions permitted to state-chartered banks by the law of the state in which it is located. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 36(c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>First National Bank of Logan v. Walker Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>385 U.S. 252, 87 S.Ct. 492, 17 L.Ed.2d 343 (1966). The purpose of incorporating state standards into federal law is to prevent an institution licensed by one governmental entity from expanding into a geographical area forbidden to competing banks licensed by another entity and thereby to maintain competitive equality between state-chartered and federal-chartered banks. See <em>First National Bank of Logan </em>v. <em>Walker Bank &amp; Trust Co., supra, </em>385 U.S. at 258-61, 87 S.Ct. 492. To effectuate this purpose, courts have consistently held that in determining whether to approve branch applications from national banks, the Comptroller not only must con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>sider whether the relevant state allows branching in some form, but must also, in each case, make such specific findings as are required by state law. See, e. g., <em>First National Bank of Logan v. Walker Bank &amp; Trust Co., supra, </em>385 U.S. at 261-62, <em>87 </em>S.Ct. 492; <em>First Bank and Trust Co. v. Smith, </em>509 F.2d 663 (1st Cir. 1975); <em>First National Bank of Catawba County v. Wachovia Bank and Trust Co., </em>448 F.2d 637 (4th Cir. 1971); <em>First-Citizens Bank and Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Camp, </em>409 F.2d 1086 (4th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">In determining whether state standards have been satisfied, the Comptroller need not conduct formal hearings or make detailed findings. Nor may his judgment be questioned in a de novo hearing in the district court; any review is limited to the question of whether the decision was arbitrary, capricious or not in accordance with law in light of the administrative record. <em>Camp v. Pitts, supra. </em>The Comptroller\u2019s findings, however, must be adequate to allow for meaningful judicial review. See <em>Camp </em>v. <em>Pitts, supra, </em>411 U.S. at 142-43, 93 S.Ct. 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">In the present case, the Comptroller was required to determine the validity of Chase\u2019s application in accordance with the law of New York, which provides that a branch office may be authorized if it is found \u201cupon investigation that the public convenience and advantage will be promoted by the opening of such branch office . . . .\u201d N.Y. Banking Law \u00a7 29 (McKinney 1971). Although this language is general and leaves ample room for discretion, presumably it requires that a branch should be established in an area only if the banking structure in the community to be serviced is not adversely affected and that the public will thereby be better served.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The administrative record before us allows for substantial doubt whether this criterion was properly considered by the Comptroller. See <em>City National Bank v. Smith, </em>168 U.S. App.D.C. 221, 513 F.2d 479, 485 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">Throughout the record there are references to the benefits that will accrue to Chase if it is permitted to establish its proposed branch. Thus the National Bank Examiner and the Regional Administrator of National Banks found that \u201cestablishment of the branch would enable the bank to extend its facilities into an area not currently serviced by the applicant,\u201d and the Deputy Comptroller concluded, \u201c[t]his is a lucrative market in which applicant is not represented.\u201d We do not doubt the validity of these findings, but since the public\u2019s advantage may well not be identical to Chase\u2019s advantage, we consider the increased opportunities for the applicant\u2019s expansion irrelevant to the standards by which the Comptroller was required to evaluate the application. The paramount consideration is the public interest and not the private interest of a very large banking institution which seeks to grow larger.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">Nor is the fact that the new branch would add a competitive factor to the area sufficient to show that the Comptroller has properly evaluated \u201cthe public convenience and advantage\u201d as that phrase is used in \u00a7 29. While the Comptroller need not make explicit findings of fact, the record may not be so paltry and conclusory as to frustrate effective judicial review. 411 U.S. at 142-43, 93 S.Ct. 1241. The tautological statement that a new branch would add to competition in the area, unsupported even by a conclusion that additional competition is necessary or would promote the public interest, provides no basis for judicial analysis of the reasonableness of the Comptroller\u2019s approval of the application. On remand, reliance on competition becomes all the more doubtful, as the New York legislature has recently enacted a law permitting savings banks such as Prudential, which has a branch in the area, to offer checking accounts, a factor that may affect competi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>tion in Locust Valley without the addition of another bank branch. See 1976 Laws of New York, 199th Session Ch. 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">We do not accept the proposition, urged by the Comptroller, that additional competition per se promotes the public convenience and advantage and that therefore consideration of the New York standard is implicit in the Comptroller\u2019s findings. Those cases that' suggest that additional competition is synonymous with the public good concern the need to prevent monopolistic or oligopolistic conditions within the banking community. See <em>United States v. Phillipsburg National Bank and Trust Co., </em>399 U.S. 350, 90 S.Ct. 2035, 26 L.Ed.2d 658 (1970); <em>United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, </em>374 U.S. 321, 83 S.Ct. 1715, 10 L.Ed.2d 915 (1963); <em>Clermont National Bank v. Citizensbank National Association, </em>329 F.Supp. 1331, 1339-45 (S.D.Ohio 1971). In this instance, however, the record contains no allegation or evidence of the need for or desirability of additional competition. Indeed, the paucity of. supporting evidence or opinion in the.present record, where the conclusion that \u201ca competitive factor\u201d will be added stands alone, is best exemplified by comparison with the record in <em>Clermont, supra, </em>where the Comptroller found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">\u201cIt is evident that Clermont National Bank with resources of $43.9 million and operating eight offices, substantially dominates commercial banking within Clermont County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">\u201cIn my opinion, an extremely unhealthy competitive situation presently exists and a strong public need is evident within the Milford area for a banking alternate to Clermont National * * * Approval will bring about competition * * * Introduction of competition is needed and would clearly be in the public interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AV\">329 F.Supp. at 1340. The findings in that case, although conclusory, set forth the determinative reason for the Comptroller\u2019s decision and were sufficient to permit a reviewing court to determine whether the findings were sustainable on the administrative record. See <em>Camp v. Pitts, supra, </em>411 U.S. at 143, 93 S.Ct. 1241. In the instant case, no findings, conclusory, informal or otherwise, inform us of the propriety \u25a0of adding competition in the Locust Valley banking community. The most that one can find in the record is a description, without comment, of the amount of deposits held and loans made by competing banks. Articulation of the Comptroller\u2019s reasons for his decision is especially necessary with respect to competition, since, as the Comptroller implied in denying a branch application in <em>Camp v. Pitts, supra, </em>a surfeit of banks in one area may be as detrimental to the public as is a monopoly. Therefore, in the absence of any discussion or finding by the Comptroller concerning the adequacy of competition in the existing banking community, we find inadequate consideration of the public convenience and advantage from the summary statement in the present record.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">An additional rationale for granting Chase\u2019s application appears to have been the belief that the community to be serviced was sufficiently affluent to support the proposed branch \u201cwithout causing greatly adverse conditions.\u201d The quoted phrase suggests that the Comptroller\u2019s staff was aware that some drain of funds from existing banks to a new branch would occur. Thorough analysis of that possibility would seem to have been essential to a proper determination of whether Chase\u2019s presence in Locust Valley would promote the public advantage. The record, however, reveals that the staff fluctuated in its concern over this problem. The National Bank Examiner, in a report also signed by the Regional Administrator, found that the complaints of Hempstead and Nassau that their deposits had remained stable or declined in recent years, and thus that they could not afford additional cash drain, \u201cmay have some merit.\u201d Nevertheless, in a report signed only by the Regional Administrator, these same objections were summarily dismissed as having \u201clittle merit.\u201d Despite the existence of this apparent inconsistency, there does not appear to have been any sort of \u201cinvestigation,\u201d required by \u00a7 29, to resolve the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>complaints of the protesting banks and reconcile them with the \u201cpublic advantage.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The absence of any express findings of public convenience and advantage and our inability to discover consideration of that criterion implicit in the record<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> strongly suggest that the Comptroller\u2019s action was not taken \u201cin accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). We conclude, therefore, that we must remand this case so that the Comptroller can provide adequate explanation of his investigation of the applicant\u2019s satisfaction of New York\u2019s branching requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Finally, we need not and do not consider Hempstead\u2019s contention that the Comptroller also erred in not complying with the regulations of the New York State Banking Board which would have required a higher ratio of population to banks in the area before approving the proposed Chase branch. Since that regulation was repealed effective January 1, 1975, and since we must apply the law in effect at the time we render our decision, <em>Thorpe v. Housing Authority of the City of Durham, </em>393 U.S. 268, 281, 89 S.Ct. 518, 21 L.Ed.2d 474 (1969), no effect may now be given to the repealed regulation.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b122-16\">. Chase is a national banking association and may therefore establish and operate new branches only with the approval of the Comptroller, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 36(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b123-7\">. In determining whether to approve branches of national banks, the Comptroller considers the General Service Area, a functional term describing the area from which the branch expects to generate at least'75% of its loans and deposits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b123-8\">. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 36(c) provides that national banks may establish new branches \u201cat any point within the State in which said association is situated, if such establishment and operation are at the time authorized to State banks by the statute law of the State in question by language specifically granting such authority affirmatively . . . and subject to the restrictions as to location imposed by the law of the State on State banks.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b124-8\">. This seems to be a logical reading of the statute, not inconsistent with state court decisions regarding \u00a7 29. See <em>Tooker v. Albright, </em>71 Misc.2d 619, 336 N.Y.S.2d 278 (Sup.Ct. 1972); <em>Franklin National Bank v. Superintendent of Banks, </em>40 Misc.2d 565, 243 N.Y.S.2d 507 (Sup.Ct.1963); <em>State Bank of Kenmore v. Bell, </em>197 Misc. 97, 96 N.Y.S.2d 851 (Sup.Ct.1949).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b126-8\">. The only unfavorable factor mentioned in the staff recommendations to the Comptroller is that the future growth of the area appears to be minimal. In previous cases, the Comptroller has relied on the probability of substantial future growth in an area to support his approval of new branches. See <em>First National Bank of Fayetteville v. Smith, </em>508 F.2d 1371, 1376 (8th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 930, 95 S.Ct. 1655, 44 L.Ed.2d 86 (1975); <em>First-Citizens Bank and Trust Co. v. Camp, </em>409 F.2d 1086, 1093 (4th Cir. 1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b126-19\">.
