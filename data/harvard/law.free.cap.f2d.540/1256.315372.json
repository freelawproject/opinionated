Park I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1320-20\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1320-21\">Phillip Washington appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Washington asserts that his conviction for armed robbery was invalid because the trial judge did not instruct the jury to the effect that appellant\u2019s removal from the courtroom for creating a disturbance had no bearing on his guilt or innocence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-22\">In rejecting appellant\u2019s argument on direct appeal, the Supreme Court of Louisiana noted that appellant had neither requested a cautionary instruction nor objected to its absence in the state trial court. Appellant does not deny here his failure to act. Instead, he argues that the state trial judge should have given the cautionary instruction \u201cas an independent obligation of the court.\u201d We cannot agree. Appellant was represented by counsel at trial, and as the Supreme Court has recently observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGO\">[ujnder our adversary system, once a defendant has the assistance of counsel the vast array of trial decisions, strategic and tactical, which must be made before and during trial rests with the accused and his attorney. Any other approach would rewrite the duties of trial judges and counsel in our legal system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1320-23\"><em>Estelle v. Williams, </em>425 U.S. 501, 512, 96 S.Ct. 1691, 1697, 48 L.Ed.2d 126, 134 (1976). In <em>Williams </em>the Supreme Court held that counsel\u2019s failure to object to the defendant\u2019s appearance in court in prison garb barred assertion of constitutional error in a later habeas corpus proceeding. The same principle is applicable here. <em>Cf. Wright v. Texas, </em>533 F.2d 185 (5th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>Moreover, our examination of the record in this case convinces us that any error which might have been committed was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Harrington v. California, </em>395 U.S. 250, 251-52, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1969); <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); <em>Hernandez v. Beto, </em>443 F.2d 634 (5th Cir. 1971). Appellant was caught in the act of committing an armed robbery. Several eye witness identifications were made. The evidence against appellant was, in a word, overwhelming.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
