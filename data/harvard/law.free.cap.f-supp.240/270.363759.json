A corollary attack is made upon the provision of the State constitution excluding \u201cpaupers\u201d as persons entitled to vote in any election.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-17\">The common premise of the assaults is: that the plaintiffs are financially unable to pay the tax-$1.50 for each of the 3 preceding years for which the elector was assessable; and that they and other State citizens similarly impecunious are thereby deprived, solely on account of their poverty, of the privilege to vote, and \u00e1t the same time they are also denied a privilege accorded other citizens not so poor.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-28\">Notwithstanding the plaintiffs' impoverishment and eligibility to vote, their denunciation of the State constitutional and statutory poll tax requirements has been squarely refuted by the Supreme Court in Breedlove v. Suttles, 302 U.S. 277, 283, 58 S.Ct. 205, 82 L.Ed. 252 (1937). We are not at liberty to deviate from that precept. There the Court considered arguments akin to those of the plaintiffs here) including the economic factor, and rejected them. This court adhered to that precedent in Butler v. Thompson, 97 F.Supp. 17, 22 (1951), aff\u2019d per curiam 341 U.S. 937, 71 S.Ct. 1002, 95 L.Ed. 1365. In this it adverted to the like holding of this Circuit in Saunders v. Wilkins, 152 F.2d 235, 237 (1945), cert, denied 328 U.S. 870, 66 S. Ct. 1362, 90 L.Ed. 1640, rehearing denied 329 U.S. 825, 67 S.Ct. 119, 91 L.Ed. 701, an appeal touching the Virginia constitutional and statutory clauses now questioned. The tax is levied upon every adult resident irrespective of his intent to vote.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, no racial discrimination is exhibited in its application as a condition to voting. Cf. Butler v. Thompson, supra, 97 F.Supp. 17, 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-38\">Adequate answer to the attack upon the exclusion of paupers is that this disqualification-apparently of early historical origin and prevalent in several States-has not been employed to prevent the plaintiffs or their class from voting. Plaintiffs do not essay a showing that they, or anyone else in destitute circumstances, have been designated \u201cpaupers\u201d in the sense of the Virginia Constitution. Therefore, an expression by us upon the meaning the implications of that term would be entirely academic and without place here.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-53\">The complaint in each of these cases will be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-54\">Dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-34\">.

Constitution and \u00a7 24-120 of the Code of Virginia, in the listing of persons who have paid the poll taxes was declared invalid by this court in Hamm v.
