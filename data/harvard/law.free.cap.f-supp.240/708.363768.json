There, state grounds were relied upon in addition to the constitutional contention now urged before us. The Supreme Court of South Carolina held the statute unassailable on either state or federal grounds <footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, and the United States Supreme Court dismissed the appeal for want of a substantial federal question.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-22\">The effect of the Supreme Court\u2019s dismissal of the appeal from the Supreme Court of South Carolina, on the ground that there was no substantial federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>question, was tantamount to an adjudication upon the merits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As such, it substantially forecloses the question here.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">A number of other cases strongly indicate that the statute has no constitutional infirmity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Complaint dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b778-12\">. South Carolina Code, \u00a7\u00a7 56-901 and 56-357.1. Some of the requirements may actually exceed those applicable to ordinary physicians. Such circumstances are not relevant here, however, for the plaintiff can meet none of the requirements which must be met by applicants for ordinary physicians\u2019 licenses. If he could, he would be entitled to a regular physician\u2019s license.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b778-25\">. Dantzler v.
