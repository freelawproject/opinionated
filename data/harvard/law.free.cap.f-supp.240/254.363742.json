By those orders the ICC denied plaintiff\u2019s petition for an order which would \u201caccept as registered\u201d under the second proviso of section 206(a) (1) of the Interstate Commerce Act (the Act), 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 306(a) (1), as that section read before October 15, 1962, certain Maryland operating authorities issued by the Public Service Commission of Maryland (PSC), and for other relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\n<em>The Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Section 206(a) of the Act was amended by P.L. 87-805, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, 76 Stat. 911, approved October 15,1962. See 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 306(a) (1) (6) and (7). Before October 15 the second proviso of section 206 (a) (1), see note 1 below, provided an exemption from the broad policy of the Act that all common carriers operating in interstate or foreign commerce must obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the ICC. The legislative history of P.L. 87-805 shows that various abuses of that exemption had arisen, which Congress intended to correct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">The first section of P.L. 87-805, 76 Stat. 911, eliminated the second proviso from paragraph (1) of section 206(a). The second section added three new paragraphs to section 206(a), namely, paragraphs (6), (7) (A) and (7) (B). Paragraph 6 established stricter standards for registering intrastate certificates of public convenience and necessity. Paragraph (7) (A), see note 3 below, extended \u201cgrandfather\u201d rights to certain carriers who on the date of the enactment were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>lawfully engaged in operations under said second proviso, or who would have been lawfully engaged in such operations but for the pendency of specified litigation. Paragraph (7) (B), see note 4 below, granted such persons a grace period of 120 days within which to file their applications for certificates of registration under paragraph (7) (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\n<em>Facts and Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A4q\">In September 1962 plaintiff, a Maryland corporation, purchased certain assets of Tidewater Express Lines, Inc., which had conducted, inter alia, operations as a motor carrier of freight in intrastate commerce between specified points in Maryland.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Since Maryland law does not permit the transfer of intrastate operating authority,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> plaintiff was required to file an application with the PSC for the issuance of permits to operate over the routes formerly served by Tidewater. Such an application was filed on October 9, 1962. Meanwhile, plaintiff had begun to conduct certain intrastate operations which were exempt from regulation by the PSC.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">On October 15, 1962, the PSC issued to plaintiff permits <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to operate as a motor common carrier in intrastate commerce of freight between specified points in Maryland. Later that day plaintiff began its intrastate operations under one or more of the permits issued by the PSC. Plaintiff has never conducted any interstate operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">On October 16, 1962, in purported compliance with 49 C.F.R. 210.10, the ICC\u2019s published procedure for handling such matters under the law as it stood before the October 15, 1962 amendments, plaintiff tendered to the ICC a Form BMC-75 statement of its intent to operate as a motor common carrier in interstate or foreign commerce pursuant to the certificate exemption provisions of the second proviso of section 206(a) (1). The statement was not accepted for filing; so by petition filed on November 7, 1962, and supplemented on November 15, 1962, plaintiff sought an order which would \u201caccept as registered\u201d under said second proviso the Maryland operating permits referred to above.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">In an order dated February 4, 1963, 92 M.C.C. 737, the ICC noted that P.L. 87-805, amending section 206(a), had become effective on October 15, 1962, and that \u201con October 16,1962, the date of the described tender, the right to engage in operations in interstate and foreign commerce under the provisions of the former second proviso of section 206(a) (1) of the act had ceased and terminated and said exemption was no longer in force and effect; that on such date there was no provision in part II of the Interstate Commerce Act pursuant to which the BMC-75 statement of intent to engage in interstate or foreign commerce tendered by Central Maryland Lines, Inc., could be lawfully received, filed, or accepted.\u201d The ICC, therefore, denied the petition, and notified plaintiff that its Form BMC-75 statement supported by its Maryland permits was of no force or effect and could not be accepted for filing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>and that the carrier could not engage thereunder in operations in interstate or foreign commerce. On March 11, 1963, plaintiff filed a petition for reconsideration of the February 4 order, which was denied on March 29, 1963. Plaintiff filed suit in this Court on August 6,1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Meanwhile, on February 12, 1963, plaintiff had filed with the ICC an application for a motor carrier \u201cgrandfather\u201d certificate of registration under section 206(a) (7), Form BOR 99, 49 C.F.R. 7.99.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Plaintiff argues that the amendments to section 206(a) of the Act did not become effective until October 16, 1962, the day after its approval by the President, that plaintiff began its intrastate operations under its Maryland PSC permits on October 15, immediately after those permits were issued, and that plaintiff therefore had a vested right to register under the second proviso of section 206 (\u0430) (1), as that section read before the effective date of the amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">The amendments to section 206(a) indicate clearly that they were to become effective on October 15, 1962. P.L. 87-805 bears the notation \u201cApproved October 15, 1962.\u201d 76 Stat. 913. Paragraph (\u0431) begins: \u201cOn and after the date of the enactment of this paragraph * That language has been codified as \u201cOn and after October 15, 1962\u201d, 4? U.S.C.A. \u00a7 306(a) (6). Paragraphs (7) (A) and (7) (B) refer to persons engaged in certain operations \u201con the date of the enactment of this paragraph\u201d, which was also codified as \u201con October 15, 1962\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">Plaintiff argues that the words \u201con and after\u201d should be interpreted as though they read \u201cfrom and after\u201d, and cites cases holding that when the phrase \u201cfrom and after\u201d is used, a statute does not go into effect until the next day<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There is authority the other way,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but that conflict is immaterial, because the phrase \u201cfrom and after\u201d does not appear in the statute under consideration. Plaintiff further attempted but failed to show that the hour of approval of P.L. 87-805 by the President was after the hour of the issuance of plaintiff\u2019s Maryland permits by the PSC. Statutes rarely show the hour of approval by the President; P.L. 87-805 shows only that it was \u201cApproved October 15, 1962\u201d; the Congressional Record relates that the \u201cPresident * * * notified the Secretary of the Senate that on the following dates he had approved and signed the following bills and joint resolutions\u201d, and lists S. 320 (P.L. 87-805) as approved \u201con October 15, 1962\u201d.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-17\"> The general rule appears to be that in the absence of a record of the exact time at which a statute was enacted, it is regarded as in effect from the first moment of the day on which it was enacted. Arnold v. United States, 9 Cranch (13 U.S.) 103, 119, 3 L.Ed. 671 (1815); Leidigh Carriage Co. v. Stengel, 6 Cir., 95 F. 637, 640 (1899); Lloyd v. North Carolina R. Co., 151 N.C. 536, 66 S.E. 604, 45 L.R.A.,N.S\u201e 378 (1909); 82 C.J.S. Statutes \u00a7 406. Plaintiff could not have acquired <em>any </em>rights under the second proviso of section 206(a) (1), since the Maryland PSC permits were issued and plaintiff\u2019s intrastate operations thereunder began after the statute eliminating the second proviso took effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-18\">There is another reason why plaintiff was not entitled to file the registration statement which it attempted to file on October 16, 1962. The second proviso excused a carrier operating in intrastate commerce under a state permit from obtaining from the ICC a certificate of public convenience and necessity to operate in interstate commerce, but it provided that such transportation should \u201cbe otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Commission under this part\u201d. In Hart v. I.C.C., D.Minn., 226 F.Supp. 635 (1964), the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-4\">\u201cThe proviso means only that once a State has determined that operations of a carrier serve the public convenience and necessity, a carrier cannot be required to obtain an Interstate Commerce Commission certificate of public convenience and necessity in order to carry on interstate transportation within the State. Navajo Freight Lines, Inc v. U. S., 186 F. Supp. 377, 380 (D.C.Colo. 1960) (Three Judge Court); Gulf Coast Motor Freight Lines v. U. S., 35 F. Supp. 136, 137 (S.D.Tex. 1940) (Three Judge Court). There is nothing in the wording of the statute which requires the conclusion plaintiffs draw that the second proviso rights vest by the statute; rather, it seems the better construction to view a Commission determination that the conditions have been met as a prerequisite to second proviso authority.\u201d 226 F.Supp. at 641.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s registration statement was filed on October 16, 1962, the day after all rights to engage in interstate and foreign commerce under the second proviso had ceased and terminated. Plaintiff\u2019s right to operate in interstate commerce, therefore, never vested under the second proviso, and plaintiff must now conform to the requirements of section 206(a) as amended before it may engage in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The 1962 amendments, see notes 3 and 4 above, extended \u201cgrandfather\u201d rights to certain carriers who (1) on October 15, 1962, were lawfully engaged in intrastate operations in a single state, and (2) on that date were also lawfully engaged in such operations in interstate commerce under the second proviso, or would have been so engaged in such operations but for \u201cthe pendency of litigation to determine the validity of such person\u2019s intrastate operations\u201d. Plaintiff was admittedly not engaged in any operation in interstate commerce on October 15, 1962. It contends, however, that its application for the state rights in question was filed on October 9, 1962, and amounted to \u201cpending litigation to determine the validity\u201d of plaintiff\u2019s intrastate operations on October 15. It then claims that the intrastate rights are subject to the specific exception of the new Act referred to above.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">There is some question whether plaintiff may rely on its \u201cpendency of litigation\u201d argument in this proceeding, because it has not exhausted its administrative remedies. The application (Form BMC 99) which plaintiff filed with the ICC on February 11, 1963, has not yet been acted upon by the ICC. In view of the delay, we have considered plaintiff\u2019s argument, but find it without merit. The \u201cpendency of litigation\u201d clause refers to \u201clitigation to determine the validity\u201d of the carrier\u2019s intrastate operations, and does not include applications by the carrier to a state regulatory body for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>certificate which will permit it to begin such operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">The injunctive relief prayed in the complaint must be denied, and the complaint dismissed. Counsel should agree on a form of order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b325-10\">. See H.Rep.

The ICC construed the second proviso as requiring registration before any right to engage in interstate or foreign commerce vested in a motor carrier. Eg., tlie regulations of the Commission in effect immediately prior to the 1962 amendments stated that any common carrier \u201cwho after the effective date of this order proposes to engage in any operations in interstate or foreign commerce under the second proviso * * * shall, prior to commencing such operations\u201d file a statement of the proposed operations and comply with other regulations regarding issuance and tariff filing, 49 C.F.R. 210.10.

United States, 14 Federal Carriers Cases, 81,303 (S.D.
