He claims that the court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial and in an evidentiary ruling. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">The defendant put his character in issue by producing his wife as a witness and asking her whether she had ever known him \u201cto be engaged in any type of drug activity.\u201d She answered, \u201cNo.\u201d On cross-examination the state asked her, without objection, whether her opinion would change if she knew that the defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance on March 28, 1980. She answered, \u201cNo.\u201d The state then asked her whether her opinion would change if she knew that, on October 25,1982, approximately one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>year prior to the trial, he was charged with possession of cocaine. The court sustained the defendant\u2019s objection to the question on the basis that its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value, but denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial and gave an immediate curative instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The defendant\u2019s claim that the question involved prosecutorial misconduct, and thus required a mistrial, is utterly meritless. There is persuasive authority to permit such a question. See <em>Michelson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>335 U.S. 469, 482, 69 S. Ct. 213, 93 L. Ed. 168 (1948); Tait &amp; LaPlante, Handbook of Connecticut Evidence \u00a7 8.4. The assistant state\u2019s attorney specifically relied on that authority when he asked the question. The trial court\u2019s ruling was favorable to the defendant and was followed by a curative instruction. We can hardly find, therefore, that the asking of the question constituted misconduct amounting to \u201cconduct inside . . . the courtroom which results in substantial and irreparable prejudice to the defendant\u2019s case.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 887.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">We have reviewed the defendant\u2019s claim of evidentiary error and find it equally without merit. The defendant claims that the state could not impeach its own witness. The defendant has confused impeachment of one\u2019s own witness, which the court has the discretion to permit under some circumstances; see <em>Plawecki </em>v. <em>Angelo Tomasso, Inc., </em>1 Conn. App. 48, 51-52, 467 A.2d 944 (1983), cert. denied, 192 Conn. 801, 470 A.2d 1218 (1984); with contradiction of the testimony of one party\u2019s witness by testimony of another witness produced by the same party, which the court also has the discretion to permit. <em>Delfino </em>v. <em>Warners Motor Express, </em>142 Conn. 301, 307, 114 A.2d 205 (1955). The ruling of the trial court was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
