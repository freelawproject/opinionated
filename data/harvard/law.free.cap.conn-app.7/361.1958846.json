See <em>Duhl </em>v. <em>Duhl, </em>7 Conn. App. 92, 94, 507 A.2d 523 (1986). A trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion may be disturbed on appeal only where such discretion has been abused. See <em>Pickman </em>v. <em>Pickman, </em>6 Conn. App. 271, 276-77, 505 A.2d 4 (1986). \u201cFor us to conclude that the trial court abused its discretion we must find that the court \u2018either incorrectly applied the law or could not reasonably conclude as it did.\u2019 <em>Sweet </em>v. <em>Sweet, </em>190 Conn. 657, 664, 462 A.2d 1031 (1983) . . . .\u201d <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>6 Conn. App. 381, 382, 505 A.2d 740 (1986). Every reasonable presumption shall be made in favor of the trial court\u2019s action. <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The defendant\u2019s motion for modification of judgment requested that his alimony obligation be terminated. The trial court did not grant the requested termination, but concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s living arrangements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>caused a sufficient change in financial circumstances to warrant a reduction of her alimony to $200 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The trial court made the following factual findings. On July 13, 1976, judgment was rendered dissolving the marriage of the parties and the defendant was ordered to pay $400 per month as periodic alimony. In 1979, the plaintiff began living with another person who pays to the plaintiff $100 per week, or approximately $400 per month, for his food and other living expenses. He also performs handyman chores which included the construction of a deck on the outside of the plaintiffs house.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The defendant argues that the trial court found facts which require termination of his obligation to pay alimony. He argues that the weekly contributions by the plaintiff\u2019s live-in companion to the plaintiff are a \u201ccomplete and total duplication\u201d of his alimony payments. While there was a finding effectively demonstrating that the man with whom the plaintiff was living contributed to her a monthly sum and services which equalled or exceeded that of the monthly periodic alimony paid by the defendant, there is no finding that this money was only for the plaintiff\u2019s use. The trial court found that an undetermined portion of that weekly cash payment was used for \u201chis food and other living expenses.\u201d In the absence of a finding that the plaintiff was receiving some portion or all of such funds solely for her personal consumption, the defendant\u2019s argument that the payments were a duplication of the defendant\u2019s obligation loses its force. We cannot find, therefore, that the trial court could not have reasonably concluded as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
