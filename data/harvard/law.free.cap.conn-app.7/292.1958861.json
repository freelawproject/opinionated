O\u2019Keefe, Jr., </em>assistant state\u2019s attorney, with whom were <em>Julia DiCocco Dewey, </em>assistant state\u2019s attorney, and, on the brief, <em>Arnold Markle, </em>state\u2019s attorney, for the appellee (state).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b304-11\">Spallone, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1y\">The defendant, an antique dealer, is appealing from the judgment of conviction, after a jury trial, of larceny in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-122 (a) (2). His conviction was based on the receipt and retention of a stolen diamond ring. During the trial the defendant did not take the witness stand to testify in his own behalf. On appeal, he claims that remarks made by the assistant state\u2019s attorney during closing argument violated his rights as secured by the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, resulting in an unfair trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>The defendant\u2019s fifth amendment claim is dispositive of this appeal. Although this claim of error was not raised at trial, we find that the issue raised is of such gravity as to bring it within the ambit of <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>198 Conn. 1, 10, 501 A.2d 1195 (1985). The general rule is that an objection must be made and ruled upon in the trial court to preserve a claim on appeal, and counsel must state distinctly the grounds for his objection if he wishes to preserve his right to appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>198 Conn. 386, 395-97, 503 A.2d 576 (1986). Further, if the court rules adversely, counsel must take an exception. <em>McDermott </em>v. <em>New Haven Redevelopment Agency, </em>184 Conn. 444, 449, 440 A.2d 168 (1981). An exception to this rule is where the record adequately supports a claim that the defendant has clearly been deprived of a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 70. A claim of a violation of a defendant\u2019s fifth amendment rights falls within this exception. Id., 71-72. Therefore, we will review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The assistant state\u2019s attorney who prosecuted the defendant commented on the failure of either the defendant\u2019s attorney or the defendant himself to \u201ctell\u201d or \u201cexplain\u201d certain events several times during the course of his closing argument to the jury. The assistant state\u2019s attorney\u2019s remarks that are in issue were as follows: \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t [the defendant] tell the police the name of the person that he knew [was] involved in this investigation . . . \u201cFirst thing he did with the police ... on the date of the seizure of the ring was refuse to divulge the name of the person that was involved . . . \u201cMr. Watstein\u2019s [the defendant\u2019s trial counsel] argument [,] did you ever hear him explain why the thieves picked this man\u2019s house or why the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>thief picked this man\u2019s house [referring to the defendant\u2019s house]? Did you ever even hear him talk about it \u2014 the fact or explain the fact that this man had $750 in cash? Did you ever hear him explain why Mr. DeMartino wouldn\u2019t tell the police the name of the person he knew was involved in this crime? Did you ever hear him explain why he lied to the policemen, got them out of the house; had the ring stuffed in his pajamas. You didn\u2019t hear one single word about that, did you? All you heard were confusing examples by some paper shuffler. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The right of the accused not to take the stand is his constitutional privilege against compulsory self-incrimination. <em>Malloy </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>378 U.S. 1, 84 S. Ct. 1489, 12 L. Ed. 2d 653 (1964); <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1976-4), </em>33 Conn. Sup. 505, 507, 356 A.2d 187 (1976). Comment by the prosecuting attorney or the court on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify is prohibited by the fifth amendment to the federal constitution. <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 615, 85 S. Ct. 1229, 14 L. Ed. 2d 106, reh. denied, 381 U.S. 957, 85 S. Ct. 1797, 14 L. Ed. 2d 730 (1965). The Connecticut legislature has recognized and affirmed this right in adopting General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 (a) which reads in part: \u201c(a) Any person on trial for crime shall be a competent witness, and at his or her option may testify or refuse to testify upon such trial. <em>The neglect or refusal of an accused, party to testify shall not he commented upon hy the court or prosecuting official </em>. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) An indirect remark by the prosecuting attorney which draws the jury\u2019s attention to the fact that the accused failed to testify may also violate the accused\u2019s right. <em>United States ex rel. Leak </em>v. <em>Follette, </em>418 F.2d 1266, 1269 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1050, 90 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Ct. 1388, 25 L. Ed. 2d 665 (1970); <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 71-72. The test is: \u201c[w]as the language used [by the state\u2019s attorney] manifestly intended to be, or was it of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 72, quoting <em>United States ex rel. Leak </em>v. <em>Follette, </em>supra. Consequently, the prosecutor is prohibited from asking for explanations which only the defendant can provide because such questions are an indirect comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1976-4), </em>supra, 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">An analysis of the assistant state\u2019s attorney\u2019s remarks, regardless of the language in which they were couched, clearly shows that they pointed to the defendant as the only person who could supply the explanations and answers to the questions which the prosecutor posed to the jury. What the state\u2019s attorney cannot do directly, he must not do indirectly in abridgement of an accused\u2019s fundamental right to a fair trial. The remarks of the assistant state\u2019s attorney were prejudicial to the defendant and transgressed his privilege against self-incrimination and right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Because our holding on the defendant\u2019s second claim of error is dispositive of this appeal, we need not discuss the defendant\u2019s first claim except to admonish the state\u2019s attorney who may retry the case that he or she be more circumspect and be guided by the holdings of <em>State </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>196 Conn. 32, 490 A.2d 515 (1985) and <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>194 Conn. 530, 482 A.2d 300 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1192, 105 S. Ct. 967, 83 L. Ed. 2d 971 (1985) insofar as they deal with the measure of restraint required of a prosecutor in his argument to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-12\"> Although several issues were raised in the defendant\u2019s original and amended preliminary statements of issues, we discuss only those issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>which were briefed by the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Samaha, </em>180 Conn. 565, 565 n.1, 430 A.2d 1290 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b306-6\"> Prior to the enactment of Public Acts 1977, No. 77-360, General Statutes (Rev. to 1977) \u00a7 54-84 (now \u00a7 54-84 [a]) read in part: \u201cThe neglect or refusal of an accused party to testify shall not be commented upon to the court or jury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
