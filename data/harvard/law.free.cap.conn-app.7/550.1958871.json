On July 14, 1984, at approximately 7 p.m., Alan Herbert entered Betty Jo\u2019s Package Store in New London to purchase some soda. After leaving the store, Herbert was approached by the defendant who demanded that he repay some money he owed. The two men argued for a short time and the defendant then reached into a brown cloth bag that he was carrying, pulled out what appeared to a .45 caliber gun and pointed it at Herbert. When Herbert saw the gun, he ran into the package store to elude the defendant. One of the owners of the store called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Soon after receiving a complaint from Herbert, the New London police began to look for the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While searching an area the defendant was known to frequent, officer Glenn Davis saw the defendant, with whom he was familiar. As Davis approached in his police cruiser, the defendant ran across the street and headed down a driveway between two buildings. Davis followed the defendant and saw him throw a brown bag toward a dumpster. The bag hit the lip and fell to the ground where Davis retrieved it before losing sight of the defendant. Minutes later, another officer apprehended the defendant in a nearby wooded area. Davis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>then opened the brown bag to search it and found a twelve to sixteen inch sawed-off shotgun inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress the shotgun, claiming that by opening the bag without a warrant, Davis had conducted an unlawful search. The trial court denied the motion, finding that the defendant had not shown a reasonable expectation of privacy in the bag sufficient to entitle him to challenge the search. The court also held that even had the defendant shown the requisite expectation of privacy, he would not have prevailed since the warrantless search was justified by exigent circumstances: the possible presence of a gun inside the bag which was located in a crowded area. The defendant now claims the trial court erred in so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">\u201cA person may not object to the introduction of evidence resulting from an illegal search unless he first proves that he was a victim of that search. <em>Rawlings </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>448 U.S. 98, 104, 100 S. Ct. 2556, 65 L. Ed. 2d 633 (1980). One is a victim of a search when it violates his reasonable expectation of privacy in the area searched. <em>Rakas </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 143, 99 S. Ct. 421, 58 L. Ed. 2d 387, reh. denied, 439 U.S. 1122, 99 S. Ct. 1035, 59 L. Ed. 2d 83 (1978). Therefore, the first question that must be answered in any suppression case is whether the individual who seeks suppression had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the area searched. Id.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Daay, </em>5 Conn. App. 496, 498, 500 A.2d 248 (1985). An individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy if he subjectively believes that the area will remain private, and his subjective belief is one that society is willing to recognize as reasonable. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Here, the trial court correctly determined that the defendant did not show that he had an actual and reasonable expectation of privacy in the area searched. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>First, the defendant did not show that he subjectively believed that the bag would remain hidden either by introducing direct evidence of his belief, or by introducing circumstantial evidence from which the trial court could have inferred such a belief. Nor did he introduce evidence showing that any subjective expectation of privacy that he had was reasonable. He did not, for example, claim that he owned the bag, although he could have done so without running the risk of having that testimony used to prove his guilt of the possession charge. <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U.S. 377, 394, 88 S. Ct. 967, 19 L. Ed. 2d 1247 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The defendant asserts that he established a reasonable expectation of privacy in the bag merely by showing that he possessed it before he was confronted by the police. This argument runs counter to this court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Daay, </em>supra. In <em>Daay, </em>a case that is factually almost identical to the present case, this court held that a defendant who had dropped a suitcase he was holding when approached by the police, and who later denied ownership of the suitcase, could not challenge the legality of the subsequent search of it. In coming to that conclusion, this court reasoned that \u201cby dropping the suitcase to flee and by denying ownership of it, [the defendant] clearly disavowed any interest in it.\u201d Id., 498. That reasoning applies with equal force in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The defendant also contends that, by claiming ownership of some money found in the bag, he made the requisite showing that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in it. This argument is without merit. Even if we assume, arguendo, that by claiming an interest in the money the defendant showed that he had a subjective expectation of privacy in the bag, the trial court\u2019s decision to deny his motion to suppress still was correct since any subjective expectation of privacy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>defendant may have had in the bag could not be considered <em>reasonable </em>once he threw the bag away. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">\u201cThe party who seeks suppression has the burden of proving that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the area searched. <em>Rawlings </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 104. Since the defendant did not meet this burden, the trial court was correct in ruling that he could not challenge the search.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Daay, </em>supra, 499-500.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-211 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of possession of a sawed-off shotgun or a silencer when he owns, controls or possesses any sawed-off shotgun that has a barrel of less than eighteen inches or an overall length of less than twenty-six inches or when he owns, controls or possesses any silencer designed to muffle the noise of a firearm during discharge . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b563-7\"> The defendant makes no claim that the search also violated any rights guaranteed by article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b563-8\"> The police did not search for the defendant immediately but, rather, waited until Alan Herbert selected the defendant\u2019s photograph from a group of approximately 50 to 100 photographs which were shown to him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b566-15\"> The defendant also claims that the trial court erred in finding that the search was valid because the police had probable cause to arrest him and because the search was justified by exigent circumstances. Since we have held that the defendant was not entitled to challenge the legitimacy of the search, we do not need to consider these claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
