The sole issue raised on appeal is the correctness of the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Kiriaka\u2019s suit against the defendant, his fellow employee, was preempted by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act under General Statutes \u00a7 31-293a.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">The undisputed facts are as follows: On December 5, 1980, Kiriaka and Lipscomb were both employees of the intervening plaintiff, Puritan Furniture Company. In the course of their employment on that day, at about 10:45 p.m., Lipscomb was operating their employer\u2019s furniture van in a northerly direction on Route 137 in Stamford, with Kiriaka as a passenger, when he stopped on the highway and parked the vehicle at the easterly curb of the road with its lights and flashers on. After Lipscomb parked the truck, he remained in the cab and reviewed work papers. In the meantime, Kiriaka alighted and proceeded to cross the highway from east to west when he was struck by a motor vehicle owned by the defendant National Spring Water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Company and operated, in a northerly direction, by its agent and employee, the defendant Melvin Alterwitz.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">In this action, Kiriaka seeks to recover for the injuries which he received when struck by Alterwitz. The first count of his revised complaint seeks recovery from National and Alterwitz for the negligence and carelessness of Alterwitz in the operation of National\u2019s vehicle. Count two seeks recovery from Lipscomb because he \u201cwas also negligent and careless in that as an employee, within the course of his employment,\u201d he parked the van where parking was banned; he failed to put his flashing lights on; he failed to park off the highway; he failed to keep his lights on; and he failed to take precautions to prevent injury to lawful users of the highway, \u201cespecially his fellow employee.\u201d There is no allegation stating, as in the first count, that his injuries were caused by the \u201cnegligent operation\u201d of the truck by Lipscomb expressly or within the context of an action that \u201cis based on the fellow employee\u2019s negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle as defined in \u00a7 14-1\u201d to fall within an exception to the exclusivity provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act under \u00a7 31-293a for \u201cinjury or death from injury caused by the negligence or wrong of a fellow employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The defendant Lipscomb moved for summary judgment in his favor alleging that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact concerning his liability for Kiriaka\u2019s injuries. Kiriaka conceded that there was no material issue of fact, but claimed a question of law to be decided by the trial court: \u201cWhether a motor vehicle parked on the side of the road is in operation?\u201d On this issue, Kiriaka objected to Lipscomb\u2019s motion and also moved for summary judgment in his own favor. The trial court granted Lipscomb\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied Kiriaka\u2019s motion after finding that the action did not fall within the exception to \u00a7 31-293a because \u201cthe defendant Lipscomb was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>engaged in any activity related to driving or moving the van or related to circumstances resulting from the movement of the van.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Section 31-293a of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provides in relevant part: \u201cIf an employee or, in case of his death, his dependent has a right to benefits or compensation under this chapter on account of injury or death from injury caused by the negligence or wrong of a fellow employee, such right shall be the <em>exclusive remedy </em>of such injured employee or dependent and no action may be brought against such fellow employee <em>unless . . . the action is based on the fellow employee\u2019s negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle as defined in section 14.-1.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The trial court, in granting summary judgment in favor of Lipscomb, found that the plaintiff\u2019s action was not based on Lipscomb\u2019s negligence in the operation of the company van. Recognizing that \u201coperation\u201d is not defined in title 14 of the General Statutes, the court relied upon recent rulings interpreting the statutory exception in \u00a7 31-293a. <em>In Davey </em>v. <em>Pepperidge Farms, Inc., </em>180 Conn. 469, 429 A.2d 943 (1980), the court stated: \u201cWhile it is true that \u2018operation\u2019 is not defined in General Statutes \u00a7 14-1, the cases clearly indicate that operation as it refers to a motor vehicle relates to the driving or movement of the vehicle itself or a circumstance resulting from the movement of the vehicle. See <em>Plunkett </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em>150 Conn. 203, 209, 187 A.2d 754 (1963); <em>Reetz </em>v. <em>Mansfield, </em>119 Conn. 563, 178 A. 53 (1935); <em>Stroud </em>v. <em>Water Commissioners, </em>90 Conn. 412, 97 A. 336 (1916).\u201d <em>Davey </em>v. <em>Pepperidge Farms, Inc., </em>supra, 472 n.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The <em>Davey </em>rule confining \u201coperation\u201d within the context of \u00a7 31-293a \u201cto the driving or movement of the vehicle itself or a circumstance resulting from the movement of the vehicle\u201d was followed in <em>Dias </em>v. <em>Adams, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>189 Conn. 354, 358, 456 A.2d 309 (1983). In further support of its conclusion that this lawsuit does not fall within the exception to \u00a7 31-293a because Lipscomb was not engaged, at the time of Kiriaka\u2019s injury, in any activity related to driving or moving his vehicle or related to a circumstance resulting from the movement of the van, the trial court cited <em>Conti </em>v. <em>Rose Hill Poultry Co., </em>3 Conn. App. 246, 248, 486 A.2d 1145 (1985) and <em>Kegel </em>v. <em>McNeely, </em>2 Conn. App. 174, 178, 476 A.2d 641 (1984). We find that the trial court was correct in its application of the law to the undisputed facts before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">The plaintiff maintains in his brief \u201cthat there is no analogy in fact or fiction in the present Record to the case authority relied upon by the trial court.\u201d In that conclusion, he is mistaken. The error of this position is compounded by the plaintiff\u2019s reliance on cases and authorities which are irrelevant to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The issue before us relates to the negligent operation of a motor vehicle by an employee causing injury to a fellow employee entitling him to workers\u2019 compensation benefits. In order to find such negligent operation allowing supplementary tort recovery against the employee operator within the exclusion of \u00a7 31-293a, the fellow employee\u2019s injury must have been caused by the negligent movement or circumstance resulting from the movement of the employer\u2019s truck. Neither the allegations of Kiriaka\u2019s revised complaint nor the undisputed facts establish that his injury was caused by Lipscomb\u2019s movement of the van or by a circumstance following from its movement. The accident causing Kiriaka\u2019s injury was removed from Lipscomb\u2019s prior movement or operation of the vehicle. Lipscomb parked the truck by the side of the road. Kiriaka alighted from it. Kiriaka then proceeded, on his own, unrelated to the operation of the truck, to cross the highway where he was struck by a passing vehicle. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Kiriaka\u2019s actions which resulted in his injuries were removed in fact and law from the operation of the company van.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">\u201cOperation\u201d of a motor vehicle connotes the control and direction of it, the activity of an \u201coperator\u201d or \u201cdriver\u201d licensed for that purpose. The exception to \u00a7 31-293a relates to injury causally connected to the control and direction of the employer\u2019s vehicle. In the undisputed facts before the trial court, the accidental injuries to Kiriaka were unconnected and unrelated to Lipscomb\u2019s control, direction and movement of Puritan\u2019s van. His injuries admittedly arose out of and in the course of his employment in the circumstances of the case, but they cannot be extended to reach the exception to \u00a7 31-293a. His workers' compensation benefits are the exclusive remedy available to him under that provision of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The record before us on this appeal discloses that there was no genuine issue of material fact. Rather, with the exclusivity of workers\u2019 compensation benefits under \u00a7 31-293a, an issue of law emerged and summary judgment was properly granted to the defendant Lipscomb on the second count of the revised complaint and was properly denied to the plaintiff Kiriaka. See <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 91, 114, 491 A.2d 368 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
