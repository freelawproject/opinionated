The complaint also alleged that on April 12, 1984, the plaintiff had served on the defendant a notice to quit the premises on or before April 24,1984, and that, although the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>designated in the notice had passed, the defendant refused to vacate. The plaintiff therefore sought judgment for possession of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">On June 26, 1984, the defendant moved to dismiss the plaintiffs complaint claiming that the notice to quit dated April 12, 1984, was not legally sufficient. The defendant then argued that since proper statutory notice to quit is a condition precedent to the bringing of a summary process action under General Statutes \u00a7 47a-23, the court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter of the complaint. On July 11, 1984, the court, <em>Hurley, J.,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>denied the motion without opinion. On July 10,1984, the defendant again moved for dismissal claiming the identical grounds but adding the claim that the notice given was also defective because the plaintiff had not complied with the sixty days\u2019 notice requirement of General Statutes \u00a7 21-80. This motion to dismiss was granted by the court, <em>Walsh, J., </em>on July 26, 1984.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">In granting the motion to dismiss, the trial court relied on that portion of General Statutes \u00a7 21-80 (b) which provides: \u201c(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 47a-23, termination of any tenancy in a mobile manufactured home park shall be effective only if made in the following manner: . . . (B) By the owner giving the resident at least sixty days\u2019 written notice, which shall state the reason or reasons for such termination . . . .\u201d The court found that the lack of such sixty days notice, which was apparent on the record and agreed upon by the parties in oral argument, deprived the court of jurisdiction to hear the matter and, accordingly, granted the motion to dismiss. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>plaintiff appeals from the judgment of dismissal raising two claims: (1) that the court erred in granting the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for want of subject matter jurisdiction because in so doing the court lopked beyond the question of subject matter jurisdiction and improperly dismissed the case on its merits; and (2) that the court violated several of the plaintiffs constitutional rights by ruling that the defendant was a \u201cresident\u201d under General Statutes \u00a7 21-64 (5) whose \u201ctenancy\u201d could be terminated only after sixty days\u2019 notice under General Statutes \u00a7 21-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">A careful scrutiny of the complaint and the procedure followed reveals that the court erred in granting the motion to dismiss for reasons not raised below or briefed by the plaintiff. We find plain error and resolve the case on this basis despite the plaintiff\u2019s failure to raise the issue. Practice Book \u00a7 3063. As a result, we do not reach the claims the plaintiff did raise in her appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Practice Book \u00a7 143 provides in pertinent part that \u201c[t]he motion to dismiss shall be used to assert (1) lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter. . . . This motion shall always be filed with a supporting memorandum of law, and <em>where appropriate, with supporting affidavits as to facts not apparent on the record. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Here, no supporting affidavits were filed. The court not only had no affidavits before it, it also took no evidence. Nor is there anything in the complaint that would justify the court\u2019s apparent determination that the defendant was a resident of the park so as to trigger application of General Statutes \u00a7 21-80. The complaint, as stated earlier, alleged only that the defendant was occupying and was in possession of lot number ten and that the defendant had no right or privilege to occupy that lot. The allegation of occupancy and possession of a lot does not invoke the definition of a \u201cresident\u201d found in General Statutes \u00a7 21-64 (5) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>which defines a resident as \u201ca person who owns, or rents <em>and </em>occupies, a mobile manufactured home in a mobile manufactured home park.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Defense counsel did assert that the defendant would be prepared to offer testimony that he purchased the mobile home, and that the prior owner requested permission for approval of the plaintiff as a tenant in accordance with the procedure set out in General Statutes \u00a7 21-79, but received no response. Counsel argued that by complying with General Statutes \u00a7 21-79, the plaintiff became a resident under the definition in General Statutes \u00a7 21-64 (5), and was, therefore, entitled to sixty days\u2019 notice as specified in General Statutes \u00a7 21-80. The arguments of counsel, however, no matter how persuasive, do not constitute facts. Nor can the court assume jurisdictional facts by osmosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">At the time the trial court granted the motion to dismiss, an issue of fact on which the jurisdiction of the court depended existed: whether the defendant was a resident within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 21-64 (5) so as to be entitled to sixty days\u2019 notice to quit possession. \u201c \u2018A motion to dismiss may . . . raise issues of fact and would, therefore, require a . . . hearing [to determine the facts], . . . [Affidavits are insufficient to determine the facts unless, like the summary judgment, they disclose that no genuine issue as to a material fact exists.\u2019 1 Stephenson, Conn. Civ. Proc. (2d Ed. 1982 Sup.) \u00a7 108d p. S 73. \u2018 \u201cIn almost every setting where important decisions turn on questions of fact, due process requires an opportunity to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses.\u201d <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>[397 U.S. 254, 269, 90 S. Ct. 1011, 25 L. Ed. 2d 287 (1970)].\u2019 <em>Society for Savings </em>v. <em>Chestnut Estates, Inc., </em>176 Conn. 563, 574, 409 A.2d 1020 (1979). When issues of fact are necessary to the determination of a court\u2019s jurisdiction, due process requires that a trial-like hearing be held, in which an opportunity is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>provided to present evidence and to cross-examine adverse witnesses. The trial court erred in not holding such a hearing.\u201d <em>Standard Tallow Corporation </em>v. <em>Jowdy, </em>190 Conn. 48, 56, 459 A.2d 503 (1983); accord <em>Garden Mutual Benefit Assn. </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>37 Conn.
