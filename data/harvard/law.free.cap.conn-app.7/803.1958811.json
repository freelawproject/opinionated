On April 15,1986, we ordered that the trial court\u2019s order granting a stay of attachment be vacated and that a new hearing be held unless the defendants filed a new certification of service of their brief to opposing counsel on or before April 25,1986. At oral argument held on May 8,1986, the defendants\u2019 counsel did not appear, and the plaintiff\u2019s counsel informed us that he had not yet received a copy of the defendants\u2019 brief as ordered. Therefore, in accordance with our order of April 15, 1986, the order of the trial court staying the attachment should be vacated for failure of the defendants to defend against the appeal with proper diligence.
