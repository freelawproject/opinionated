The plaintiff seller, Universal Builders Corporation (Universal), contracted with the defendant, J. H. Hogan, Inc. (Hogan), to supply roof trusses and gables to Hogan for the construction of several buildings on property allegedly owned by the named defendant, United Methodist Convalescent Homes, Inc. (United Methodist). The plaintiffs original complaint was brought against United Methodist to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien which the plaintiff had placed on the property involved. Hogan was added as a defendant while the foreclosure action was pending, and the plaintiff amended its complaint to allege, in a second count, that Hogan owed it $7024 for materials and supplies it delivered to Hogan. Subsequently, Hogan filed a bond with the plaintiff in substitution for the mechanic\u2019s lien, and the plaintiff amended the first count of its complaint to reflect this fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Hogan counterclaimed alleging that the plaintiff had breached the contract in that it failed to deliver all the supplies in a reasonable time with the result that Hogan had to purchase substitute supplies elsewhere at a price $16,779 in excess of the contract price. Universal filed several special defenses to Hogan\u2019s counterclaim, alleging unconscionability, impossibility and rescission, and also alleging that Hogan had canceled the parties\u2019 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">The trial court concluded that no pleadings or evidence were submitted with regard to the first count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>and found the issues on that count in favor of United Methodist.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court found the issues in favor of the seller, Universal, on the second count of Universal\u2019s complaint in the amount of $7024, and in favor of the buyer, Hogan, on Hogan\u2019s counterclaim in the amount of $16,779, having concluded that the plaintiff failed to prove its special defenses to the counterclaim. It, therefore, rendered a judgment in favor of Hogan for $9755 plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">The plaintiff has appealed and claims essentially<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that (1) the legal bases employed by the trial court in awarding damages to the defendant were erroneous, (2) the defendant\u2019s demand for the delivery of materials to be supplied by the plaintiff was unconscionable and thereby terminated the parties\u2019 agreement, and (3) the trial court erred in concluding that no pleadings or evidence were submitted in regard to the first count of the complaint, and therefore erred in not considering the allegations contained in that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s first claim of error challenges generally the legal bases for awarding damages to the defendant. There exists no dispute as to the fact that the parties contracted to supply and to purchase a number of roof trusses and gables. The parties\u2019 agreement called for the \u201cfabrication and delivery [of such materials] as required by [Hogan\u2019s] project superintendent. ...\u201d The testimony of Universal\u2019s secretary-treasurer was that orders for materials pursuant to the parties\u2019 agreement were to be phoned into Universal as they were required. Hogan placed its ini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>tial order for fifty-eight trusses in late February, 1983. The trusses were ultimately delivered in the middle of March, 1983, and were paid for by Hogan at that time. Hogan placed a second order for 102 trusses during the second week of April, 1983. Delivery of those trusses was received by Hogan during the last week of May, 1983. Universal claims that no additional orders were placed. Hogan claims, however, that its project superintendent, as well as other employees, made numerous telephone calls to Universal to stress Hogan\u2019s need for a continuous supply of materials. Joseph Wolfer, Hogan\u2019s project superintendent on the United Methodist project, testified that while Hogan received the delivery of 102 trusses at the end of May, 1983, this amount was only one-half of their requirements at that point. Wolfer testified that Hogan required 100 additional trusses by the middle of June, 1983, and that he telephoned Universal several times during this period in order to express his dissatisfaction regarding the slowness of deliveries. John Wolanik, Universal\u2019s plant superintendent, testified to receiving telephone calls from Hogan personnel during this period, and that the subject of those calls concerned schedule coordination problems between Hogan and Universal.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Having experienced these scheduling and delivery difficulties, and being in need of materials, Hogan, at one point in May, 1983, sought quotes for and obtained trusses from another supplier.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The additional trusses were, at this time, sought in an effort to restore a measure of continuity to the United Methodist project which had become severely backed-up. On June 28, 1983, Frank P. Gillon, Hogan\u2019s president, sent Universal a letter which expressed Hogan\u2019s frustration over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Universal\u2019s course of performance. The body of the letter stated in its entirety: \u201cFor the past seven weeks, we have attempted to have your firm deliver wood trusses under our order numbered 1805.6.2. Your continued excuses and delays have severely handicapped us in expediting this project. Unless a minimum of 200 trusses are delivered by July 5,1983, you may consider your order cancelled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Universal contends that the effect of this letter was to terminate the purchase order. Hogan contends that the letter was intended to obtain Universal\u2019s undivided attention and to identify the specific needs and problems of Hogan. Gillon testified that he did not intend to waive any damage claims to which Hogan was ultimately entitled. Upon receipt of Hogan\u2019s letter, Universal deemed the order canceled. Universal considered it impossible for it to manufacture 200 trusses within the time specified. Thereafter, having received no further deliveries from Universal, Hogan purchased its remaining material requirements for the United Methodist project from other suppliers.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Under the Uniform Commercial Code, \u201c[w]hen reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the performance of either party the other may in writing demand adequate assurance of due performance . . . . \u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-609 (1). As \u201c[bjetween merchants the reasonableness of grounds for insecurity and the adequacy of any assurance offered shall be determined according to commercial standards.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-609 (2). See, e.g., <em>Kunian </em>v. <em>Development Corporation of America, </em>165 Conn. 300, 312-13, 334 A.2d 427 (1973). A party's failure to provide such assurance of adequate performance within a reasonable time is a \u201crepudiation of the contract\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-609 (4); after which the aggrieved party may resort to any remedy provided in the event of a breach. General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-610.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Applying these provisions to the present action, we conclude that the letter Hogan sent to Universal demanding 200 trusses by a specific date expressed properly Hogan\u2019s insecurity with respect to Universal\u2019s performance, and that Hogan thereby availed itself of its right to seek adequate assurance of that performance pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-609. \u201cThe right to such assurance is premised on reasonable grounds for insecurity. Whether a buyer has reasonable grounds to be insecure is a question of fact. <em>AMF, Inc. </em>v. <em>McDonald\u2019s Corporation, </em>536 F.2d 1167, 1170 (7th Cir. 1976).\u201d <em>Cherwell-Ralli, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rytman Grain Co., </em>180 Conn. 714, 719, 433 A.2d 984 (1980). Here, the trial court noted that the parties involved were all experts, and that they knew the construction business and its attendant problems of transportation, strikes, weather conditions, inventory and scheduling. In particular, the trial court noted that Universal\u2019s overseer of operations was an expert and was, as a result, aware of the traditional construction progression within the industry and by the trades. The court concluded that in view of the foregoing, Hogan\u2019s letter requesting the delivery of a minimum of 200 trusses could not be classified as an unconscionable request.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">Having concluded that Universal failed to deliver as requested, the trial court awarded Hogan $16,779 which represented the amount Hogan expended in excess of the contract price for materials in substitution for those which were originally to be supplied by Universal. We conclude that the measure of damages employed by the trial court was proper. Upon the repudiation of the agreement by Universal; see General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-609 (4); Hogan was entitled to \u201cresort to any remedy for breach as provided by . . . section 42a-2-711 [of the General Statutes] . . . . \u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-610. Section 42a-2-711 provides in part that upon a seller\u2019s failure to make delivery as required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>or upon his repudiation of the agreement, \u201cthe buyer may cancel and whether or not he has done so may in addition to recovering so much of the price as has been paid [may] (a) \u2018cover\u2019. . . . \u201d A buyer \u201c \u2018cover[s]\u2019 by making in good faith and without unreasonable delay any reasonable purchase of or contract to purchase goods in substitution for those due from the seller.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-712 (1). When a buyer chooses to cover he may recover from the seller the difference between his cost to cover and the contract price as well as any incidental and consequential damages. General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-712 (2). Expenses saved in consequence of the seller\u2019s breach are subtracted from the buyer\u2019s recovery. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">The trial court concluded that Hogan proved by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the trusses it purchased in substitution for those which Universal was obligated to supply under the parties\u2019 agreement totaled $16,779 above the contract price. There was no evidence produced from which the court could conclude that Hogan\u2019s cover was made in bad faith or with unreasonable delay. To the contrary, the court concluded that Hogan obtained the substitute, albeit slightly different, materials promptly on the open market in order to break the bottleneck in the construction schedule, and to end Hogan\u2019s frustration with Universal. The record below amply supports these conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">In deciding the plaintiff\u2019s first claim of error, we have thoroughly addressed the plaintiff\u2019s second claim of error, that the defendant\u2019s demand for the delivery of 200 trusses was unconscionable and thereby terminated the parties\u2019 agreement. The trial court concluded, and we agree, that in view of the parties\u2019 knowledge and understanding as experts in the construction industry, Hogan\u2019s demand, made after it had reasonable grounds for insecurity, could not be viewed as unconscionable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Moreover, we conclude that Hogan\u2019s actions were warranted and were in pursuit of an adequate assurance of Universal\u2019s performance. Under such circumstances, Hogan\u2019s actions did not constitute either a termination or rescission of the parties\u2019 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s final claim is that the trial court erred in concluding that no pleadings or evidence were submitted in regard to the first count of the complaint relating to the plaintiff\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien and the bond which was substituted for that lien by the defendant. This claim was admittedly pressed by the plaintiff so as to insure payment of its claim secured originally by the lien and subsequently by the bond. The trial court awarded damages to the plaintiff on the second count for the amount of that payment, which is fully reflected in the ultimate judgment in favor of Hogan in the amount of $9755.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Because we have concluded that the trial court did not err in its award of damages to the defendant on its counterclaim, and because the plaintiff has not been harmed by the failure of the court to act on the first count of the complaint, we consider this final claim of error to be moot, and therefore decline to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b332-6\"> Although the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision states this result, the judgment file does not contain a judgment regarding the first count of the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b332-7\"> The plaintiff\u2019s preliminary statement of issues sets out eight claims of error. Its brief does not, however, contain a statement of the issues as required by Practice Book \u00a7 3060P (d) (2). The issues discussed are therefore those which can reasonably be discerned from the arguments espoused by the plaintiff at oral argument and in its brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b333-5\"> This action by Hogan did not interfere with the parties\u2019 agreement in that Hogan\u2019s requirements for trusses on the United Methodist project exceeded the number of such materials to be supplied by Universal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
