The case was tried before a jury and the defendant was found guilty of the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the second degree, a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-56. The defendant appeals from the judgment of conviction alleging that he was denied the protection of the presumption of innocence and due process of law (1) because the decision of the state\u2019s attorney to seek an indictment for murder was not reasonably supported by the evidence, and (2) because the trial court denied his motions for judgment of acquittal and charged the jury on the elements of every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>lesser included offense to the original charge of murder where the evidence was insufficient to substantiate the original charge. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The following facts are undisputed. At approximately 11 p.m. on June 19,1981, Jocelyn Howard, the victim, was sitting with two friends, Rosemarie Smith and Donna Watson, at the upstairs bar of Jerry Mac\u2019s Cafe in Hartford. The defendant approached the bar and ordered a drink. The defendant was unknown to the three women. He offered to buy Smith a drink but she refused. Thereafter, the defendant became engaged in a heated argument with the victim who was seated next to Smith. The victim uttered profanities at the defendant. She arose from her chair to block the defendant\u2019s way and pointed towards him. The defendant claims that the victim confronted him with an object, either a knife or a razor blade. No other eyewitness saw such an object nor was one ever discovered. The defendant drew a knife from his jacket and interposed it between himself and the victim. The defendant claims that the victim fell onto his knife. The state claims that the evidence indicates that the defendant intentionally stabbed the victim. The knife entered the victim\u2019s upper chest severing the aorta. The defendant withdrew the knife from the victim\u2019s body, placed it back in his jacket and left the cafe. The victim died several hours later.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The next day, the defendant claimed that he learned that someone had died from a stab wound at the cafe. Soon thereafter and upon the advice of counsel, he gave the police a statement detailing his confrontation with the victim. The defendant was subsequently arrested and indicted by a grand jury for murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">At the close of the prosecution\u2019s case, the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the charge of murder. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person . . . . \u201d \u201cA person acts \u2018intentionally\u2019 with respect to a result . . . described by a statute defining an offense when his conscious objective is to cause such result . . . . \u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (11). The defendant alleged that the state had failed to present evidence to prove that the defendant intended to cause the victim\u2019s death. This motion was denied. After the presentation of the defendant\u2019s case, he again moved for a judgment of acquittal on the same ground. This motion was also denied. The jury was charged as to the elements of murder, as well as the lesser included offenses of manslaughter in the first degree, manslaughter in the the second degree and criminally negligent homicide. The jury found the defendant guilty of manslaughter in the second degree. See General Statutes \u00a7 SSa-SB.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the juiy rendered its verdict, the defendant made a final written motion for judgment of acquittal. This motion was denied without articulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The defendant\u2019s first argument is that the decision of the state\u2019s attorney to prosecute the defendant for murder constituted an abuse of prosecutorial discretion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He alleges that the prosecutor possessed insuffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>dent evidence to demonstrate that the defendant intended to cause the victim\u2019s death as provided by General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (11). The state argues that no such claim was presented to the trial court and therefore is not a proper issue for appellate review. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>186 Conn. 654, 658-59, 443 A.2d 906 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Narvaez, </em>3 Conn. App. 166, 168-69, 485 A.2d 1351 (1985). The state\u2019s argument continues, however, alleging that the existence of a grand jury indictment on the murder charge belies the defendant\u2019s allegation that the state\u2019s attorney abused his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The Appellate Court may only review those issues which were properly raised and ruled on by the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 658. In general, a claim of an abuse of prosecutorial discretion should be made by a motion to dismiss based upon the \u201cinsufficiency of evidence or cause to justify the bringing or continuing of such information or indictment or the placing of the defendant on trial . . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 815 (5); see Spinella, Connecticut Criminal Procedure, pp. 604-605. Practice Book \u00a7 816, however, prohibits a \u201cdefendant who has been indicted by a grand jury . . . [to] make a motion under [Practice Book \u00a7 815 (5)].\u201d The defendant made no formal objection to the prosecutor\u2019s actions charging the defendant with murder. He did challenge the sufficiency of the evidence of intent in his motions for judgment of acquittal but such challenge did not refer to an abuse of prosecutorial discretion. Nevertheless, because the defendant\u2019s claim raises an issue of his constitutional right to due process, we shall review his claim to the extent that it is clearly established on the record. <em>State </em>v. <em>Orsini, </em>187 Conn. 264, 271, 445 A.2d 887, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 861, 103 S. Ct. 136, 74 L. Ed. 2d 116 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>The due process clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution protects against vindictive or coercive use of the federal prosecutorial power. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>457 U.S. 368, 372, 102 S. Ct. 2485, 73 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1982). The fourteenth amendment protects persons from the state\u2019s abuse of its prosecutorial power. <em>See State v. Hayes, </em>127 Conn. 543, 581, 18 A.2d 895 (1941). Additionally, \u201cthe inherent supervisory powers of the court over legal process in this state\u201d guard against unfounded prosecution. <em>State v. Ellis, </em>197 Conn. 436, 478, 497 A.2d 974 (1985). The state\u2019s attorney is given \u201c \u2018broad discretion in determining what crime or crimes to charge in any particular situation.\u2019 <em>State v. Chetcuti, </em>173 Conn. 165, 168, 377 A.2d 263 (1977).\u201d <em>State v. Ellis, </em>supra, 478. \u201cThat power, however, is limited in the usual and lawful manner by the facts which the prosecutor may be reasonably expected to prove at trial. <em>People v. Eboli, </em>34 N.Y.2d 281, [357 N.Y.S.2d 435,] 313 N.E.2d 746 [1974].\u201d <em>State v. Darden, </em>171 Conn. 677, 682, 372 A.2d 99 (1976). \u201c[A]n indictment returned by a legally constituted nonbiased grand jury . . . if valid on its face . . . satisfies the requirements of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>Lawn </em>v. <em>United States, </em>355 U.S. 339, 349, 78 S. Ct. 311, 2 L. Ed. 2d 32, reh. denied, 355 U.S. 967, 78 S. Ct. 529, 2 L. Ed. 2d 542 (1958). \u201c \u2018The basic purpose of . . . indictment by a grand jury is to interpose, between the state and one accused of a crime ... a body of eighteen disinterested persons . . . to determine whether the state has shown probable cause for subjecting the accused to the expense, embarrassment and risk of such a trial.\u2019 <em>State v. Merrillo, </em>159 Conn. 264, 275, 268 A.2d 667 (1970).\u201d <em>State v. Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 33, 463 A.2d 566 (1983). The existence of a facially valid indictment affords ample assurance that the charges brought against the defendant were based upon probable cause. See <em>State v. Curcio, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>supra, 33; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobbs, </em>164 Conn. 402, 406, 324 A.2d 234, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 861, 94 S. Ct. 77, 38 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1973). The record before us provides no evidence demonstrating that the indictment was improper on its face or that the grand jury was biased, nor does the defendant make such a claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The defendant\u2019s second allegation suggests that the trial court erred in denying his motions for judgment of acquittal on the charge of murder because there was insufficient evidence to support a jury verdict of guilty on such a charge. The defendant made three motions for judgment of acquittal. All three motions were denied without articulation. The defendant\u2019s basis for making all three motions was the insufficiency of evidence to prove the charge of murder, specifically that the defendant intended to cause the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">In denying the defendant\u2019s motions for judgment of acquittal, the trial court must have found that \u201c \u2018the jury could have reasonably concluded, upon the facts established and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, that the cumulative effect of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>191 Conn. 233, 255, 464 A.2d 758 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1084, 104 S. Ct. 1455, 79 L. Ed. 2d 772, reh. denied, 466 U.S. 954, 104 S. Ct. 2163, 80 L. Ed. 2d 547 (1984), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Nemeth, </em>182 Conn. 403, 410, 438 A.2d 120 (1980). Our review of the record discloses sufficient evidence from which the jury could rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>sonably have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to cause the victim\u2019s death. There was evidence that the defendant and the victim were arguing immediately prior to the accident. There was also evidence that the knife entered a vital area of the body. The knife also penetrated the victim\u2019s body at a downward angle, to a depth of approximately five inches. The defendant fled from the scene of the incident. From such evidence the jury could have reasonably found that the defendant intended to cause the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">If we assume, arguendo, that the jury should not have been charged on the crime of murder, the defendant was not prejudiced by such alleged error. The jury impliedly acquitted the defendant of murder and found him guilty of the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the second degree.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Shipman, </em>195 Conn. 160, 162, 486 A.2d 1130 (1985). If any error was made, with respect to the charge of murder, it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cohane, </em>193 Conn. 474, 484, 479 A.2d 763, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 990, 105 S. Ct. 397, 83 L. Ed. 2d 331 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b195-6\"> \u201cA person is guilty of manslaughter in the second degree when: (1) He recklessly causes the death of another person General Statutes \u00a7 53a-56 (a). \u201cA person acts \u2018recklessly\u2019 with respect to a result . . . described by a statute defining an offense when he is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur .... The risk must be of such nature and degree that disregarding it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (13).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b195-9\"> The defendant\u2019s brief alleges that he was denied the presumption of innocence. The presumption of innocence refers to the assignment of the burden of proof, beyond a reasonable doubt, which the state must bear to prove every element of a criminal charge. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>198 Conn. 1, 21, 501 A.2d 1195 (1985); McCormick, Evidence (2d Ed., 1972) \u00a7 342. The trial court\u2019s jury instruction specified that the state bore the burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>of proving intent. The record does not show that the state was excused from its burden of proving intent, or any other element of the crimes charged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b198-7\"> The defendant does not claim that his right to due process was violated because the prosecutor\u2019s decision was motivated by vindictiveness. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>457 U.S. 368, 372, 102 S. Ct. 2485, 73 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1982). There is no claim that the prosecutor\u2019s decision denied the defendant\u2019s right to equal protection. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>188 Conn. 432, 474, 450 A.2d 828 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">The defendant does not assert that the due process clause of the Connecticut constitution, article first, \u00a7 8, affords a defendant any greater protection from prosecutorial discretion than that afforded by the fourteenth \u25a0amendment to the United States constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b199-8\"> Because we find that there was sufficient evidence of intent to warrant submission of a charge of murder to the jury, we need not speculate as to whether it was proper to instruct the jury on the lesser included offenses of manslaughter in the first and second degree and criminally negligent homicide. Such an instruction was proper. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-45 (c); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>180 Conn. 382, 399-405, 429 A.2d 919 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
