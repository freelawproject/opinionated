The judgment appointing a receiver had been stayed pending the appeal and, in the interim, the defendant lost his interest in the subject real estate through foreclosure. The plaintiff has also withdrawn the underlying trial court action from which the defendant appealed. Thus, the motion to dismiss should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
