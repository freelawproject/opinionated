The plaintiff concedes that the trial court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff was \u201cliving with another person\u201d was not clearly erroneous, but alleges that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate a change in her financial circumstances warranting the termination of alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>The parties were married for eleven years before their marriage was dissolved on December 4,1974. As part of the dissolution, the defendant was ordered to pay the plaintiff $125 per week as periodic alimony. This amount was modified twice and reduced to $50 per week on November 27, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The defendant filed a motion for the termination of alimony dated August 20, 1984, \u201cdue to the fact that the plaintiff is now cohabitating [sic] and due to a substantial change of circumstances.\u201d It is clear from the record and from oral argument in this court that this claim invoked the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (b). A hearing was held on the issues pursuant to \u00a7 46b-86 (b)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, on October 1,1984, the trial court ordered that the periodic alimony payments be terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (b) grants to the Superior Court discretion to \u201cterminate the payment of periodic alimony upon a showing that the party receiving the periodic alimony is living with another person under circumstances which the court finds should result in the . . . termination of alimony because the living arrangements cause such a change of circumstances as to alter the financial needs of that party.\u201d The trial court supported its finding of a change in financial circumstances by noting that the plaintiff was living with a male who had been paying the plaintiff $400 in rent per month for an unspecified amount of time, although at the time of trial he was no longer making such payments. The plaintiff also admitted taking trips with this person to Israel, Florida, California, Las Vegas, Mon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>treal and the Carribean. Clearly, these findings provided sufficient evidence of a change in the plaintiff\u2019s financial circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The plaintiff argues, however, that \u00a7 46b-86 (b) requires a substantial change in circumstances and some finding by the court that the relationship will endure before a court may terminate alimony. The plaintiff summarized this claim during oral argument before this court by stating that the trial court must find a substantial change in financial circumstances, namely the financial interdependence such as is found in a common law marriage, before it may order the termination of alimony payments. No such requirement is to be found in the statute nor do we feel that such a requirement is necessary to fulfill its purpose. Section 46b-86 (b) was enacted \u201cto \u2018correct the injustice of making a party pay alimony when his or her ex-spouse is living with a person of the opposite sex, without marrying, to prevent the loss of support.\u2019 H.B. No. 6174, 1977 Sess. (Statement of Purpose).\u201d <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>191 Conn. 468, 473-74, 464 A.2d 837 (1983). To further this purpose, the statute provides the Superior Court with a broad basis upon which to modify, suspend or terminate periodic alimony payments. \u201cWe note that the General Assembly chose the broader language of \u2018living with another person\u2019 rather than \u2018cohabitation\u2019 and that this provision requires only a \u2018change\u2019 of circumstances, not a \u2018substantial change\u2019 as required by \u00a7 46b-86 (a).\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>185 Conn. 42, 45-46, 440 A.2d 252 (1981). Once these two factors are found, the termination, suspension or modification of alimony becomes a matter for the discretion of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The trial court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff had experienced a change in financial circumstances can only be rejected by this court if it is clearly erroneous. See Practice Book \u00a7 3060D. The record in this case indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>cates that this finding was supported by evidence demonstrating that the plaintiff received rent from her male companion as well as evidence of the extensive trips they took together. \u201cIt cannot be said, therefore, that the finding was as a matter of law unsupported by the record, incorrect, or otherwise mistaken. See <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>[181 Conn. 217, 222, 435 A.2d 24 (1980)]. This court may not substitute its own opinion as to the living arrangements of the defendant for the factual finding of the trial court.\u201d <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>186 Conn. 387, 392, 441 A.2d 629 (1982). While the termination of alimony may be a harsh result,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the trial court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-7\"> The issue presented in this appeal arose from this hearing on the questions presented under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (b). A hearing on the issue of a change of circumstances under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (a) was subsequently held but is not part of this appeal by agreement of the parties at oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b107-14\"> The plaintiff expressly stated at oral argument before this court that her only challenge on appeal concerned the factual findings of the trial court, which she claimed were inadequate to justify the order of termination. She expressly waived any claim that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering termination as opposed to suspension or modification.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
