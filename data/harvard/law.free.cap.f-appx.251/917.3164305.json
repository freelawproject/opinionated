Rigmaiden appeals the sentence imposed following his guilty-plea conviction of possessing with the intent to distribute cocaine base. He argues that his sentence is unreasonable because it was imposed under what amounts to a de facto mandatory sentencing guidelines system resulting from this court\u2019s precedents bestowing a presumption of reasonableness on sentences which fall within a defendant\u2019s advisory sentencing guidelines range. Rigmaiden also argues that the district court failed to consider his arguments for a below-guidelines sentence, failed to analyze on the record the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and gave too much weight to the advisory Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">The 300-month term of imprisonment imposed in Rigmaiden\u2019s case fell within his properly calculated guidelines range and is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Rigmaiden\u2019s argument that the presumption of reasonableness used by this court returns the Sentencing Guidelines to their formerly unconstitutional, mandatory status is foreclosed. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">The district court\u2019s statements at sentencing reflect sufficient consideration of Rigmaiden\u2019s mitigation argument and of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Rigmaiden has not demonstrated that the district court clearly erred in exercising its broad sentencing discretion by imposing a sentence that failed to \u201caccount for a factor that should have received significant weight,\u201d gave \u201csignificant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor,\u201d or represented \u201ca clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors.\u201d <em>See United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 376 (5th Cir.2007), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 163, 169 L.Ed.2d 112 (2007). Accordingly, Rigmaiden has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b944-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
