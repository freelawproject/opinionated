Plancarte-Vazquez argues that the district court erred by attributing 30,000 kilograms of marijuana equivalent to him on the basis of inconsistent and unreliable witness testimony, and that the court should have imposed a lower sentence based on its finding that older family members controlled and directed PlancarteVazquez.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-23\">We conclude that the district court\u2019s drug-quantity calculation is supported by the record and is not clearly erroneous. We also conclude that the ultimate sentence was not unreasonable with regard to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court methodically considered the statutory factors, and because the sentence was within the advisory guidelines range, it is presumptively reasonable. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-65, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Lincoln, </em>413 F.3d 716, 717 (8th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-26\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b403-21\">. The Honorable James E. Gritzner, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa, sitting by designation in the Northern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
