Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Guillory first challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, arguing that the Government failed to prove that he possessed the firearm in question, a sawed-off shotgun. Although Guillory asserts that we should review under the rational jury standard, he did not move for a judgment of acquittal at any time in the district court. Thus, we review under the narrower \u201cmanifest miscarriage of justice\u201d standard. <em>See United States v. Galvan, </em>949 F.2d 777, 782-83 (5th Cir.1991). There was evidence that Guillory had constructive possession of the shotgun. He had control and dominion over the house, he had spent the previous night at the house, he was there during the day of the arrest, and he made a statement indicating that the shotgun belonged to him, describing it as a \u201ctoy\u201d that he had \u201cpicked up.\u201d Thus, the record is not \u201cdevoid of evidence pointing to guilt,\u201d nor is the evidence of constructive possession \u201cso tenuous that a conviction would be shocking.\u201d <em>United States v. Sam, </em>467 F.3d 857, 860 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Guillory next argues that the district court erred in imposing an enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), based on his possession of the firearm in connection with another felony, namely, possession of less than one gram of a controlled substance. Guillory\u2019s argument that there was an insufficient nexus between the possession of the shotgun and his possession of a small amount of drugs intended for personal use is unavailing in light of <em>United States v. Condren, </em>18 F.3d 1190, 1194 (5th Cir.1994), which is controlling on the facts of this case. We decline Guillory\u2019s suggestion that we reject <em>Condren </em>as incorrectly decided. <em>See Burge v. Parish of St. Tammany, </em>187 F.3d 452, 466 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">Guillory\u2019s constitutional challenge to the district court\u2019s factfinding for sentencing purposes also fails in light of controlling precedent. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465-66, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-12\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b896-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
