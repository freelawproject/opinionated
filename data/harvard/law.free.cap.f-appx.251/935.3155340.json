California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Davalos-Hernandez has moved to have other counsel appointed to represent her but has not specified any nonfrivolous basis for her appeal. Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and the motion by Davalos-Hernandez discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Davalos-Hernandez\u2019s motion to appoint new counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b961-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
