He argues that the search of his vehicle incident to his arrest was unjustified because officers did not reasonably believe that evidence relevant to the crime of arrest would be discovered inside. However, as Dunson concedes, the argument is foreclosed by New York v. <em>Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 460, 101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1981). He raises the issue to preserve it for possible Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-12\">Dunson next argues that the district court erred in denying him credit for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Whether a defendant has sufficiently demonstrated acceptance of responsibility is a factual question, and the standard of review is even more deferential than clear error. <em>United States v. Spires, </em>79 F.3d 464, 467 (5th Cir.1996). This court will affirm a sentencing court\u2019s decision not to award a reduction under \u00a7 3E1.1 unless it is \u201cwithout foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Hooten, </em>933 F.2d 293, 297-98 (5th Cir.1991) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-17\">The district court did not err in denying credit for acceptance of responsibility based on Dunson\u2019s failure to provide truthful answers about how he acquired the gun when confronted with evidence that the gun was stolen. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.1(a)); <em>Hooten, </em>933 F.2d at 297-98. Dunson\u2019s argument that he is being punished for exercising his Fifth Amendment right to silence is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Kleinebreil, </em>966 F.2d 945, 953 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-18\">Dunson additionally argues that his sentence is unreasonable as a matter of law because this court\u2019s use of a presumption of reasonableness for sentences imposed within the properly calculated guidelines range effectively reinstates the mandatory guidelines regime struck down in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). This court\u2019s rebuttable presumption does not run afoul of <em>Booker. See Rita v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b933-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
