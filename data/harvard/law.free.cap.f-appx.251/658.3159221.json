White was originally sentenced prior to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He contends the district court, in deciding the appropriate reduction under Rule 35, should have applied the law in effect at the time of the \u201cnew and separate re-sentencing,\u201d which would have prohibited, under <em>Apprendi </em>and its progeny, a life-sentence starting point. Instead, he argues, the district court should have used, as \u201cthe starting point,\u201d 35 years\u2019 imprisonment, <em>i.e., </em>the maximum constitutionally permissible sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>tence. White asserts the district court erred by mischaracterizing his argument as a collateral attack on his original sentence and finding it could not take into consideration the fact his original sentence was \u201cachieved only through a violation of [his] constitutional rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Ordinarily, the district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a Rule 35(b) motion is a discretionary decision that is not subject to appeal. <em>United States v. Manella, </em>86 F.3d 201, 203 (11th Cir.1996). In this case, however, White does not challenge the merits of the district court\u2019s Rule 35(b) determination, but instead asserts his reduced sentence was imposed in violation of his statutory and constitutional rights, and, therefore, we have jurisdiction to consider his appeal. <em>See id. </em>We review such questions of law <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Rule 35(a) provides: \u201cWithin 7 days after sentencing, the court may correct a sentence that resulted from arithmetical, technical, or other clear error.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a). Rule 35(b), in pertinent part, provides that a the district court may, upon motion by the government, reduce a sentence for the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to the government. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">White\u2019s argument that Rule 35 permits a new sentencing is based on a since-abrogated version of Rule 35(a) that permitted the district court to correct an file-gal sentence at any time. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 35(a) (1983). Contrary to White\u2019s assertion, Rule 35(b), by its own terms, provides for a reduction of a sentence, not the vacating of a sentence and a resentencing. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b). White is not permitted to have the benefit of Rule 35(a)\u2019s correction of a sentence, which was foreclosed to him as untimely, simply by subsuming a request for it within his Rule 35(b) argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-13\">Second, White\u2019s argument is essentially an attempt to avoid the prohibitions against: (1) the retroactive application of <em>Apprendi </em>to cases on collateral review; and (2) a petitioner bringing a collateral attack against his sentence through Rule 35(b). <em>See McCoy v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1245, 1258 (11th Cir.2001); <em>Fernandez v. United States, </em>941 F.2d 1488, 1492 (11th Cir.1991). Because he is no longer permitted to bring a collateral attack on his sentence by making a Rule 35(b) motion himself, White attempts to attack his sentence collaterally through his response to the Government\u2019s Rule 35(b) motion. He is not permitted to evade the constraints of amended Rule 35(b) and the rule against the retroactive application of <em>Apprendi </em>to cases on collateral review by couching his request in terms of the proper \u201cstarting point\u201d for the district court\u2019s reduction \u201ccalculus\u201d in the Rule 35(b) motion. Moreover, the only support he cites for the assertion that his argument is not a collateral attack on his sentence is a case based on the previous version of Rule 35. <em>See United States v. Shillingford, </em>586 F.2d 372, 375 (5th Cir.1978).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-14\">In conclusion, <em>Apprendi </em>had not been decided when White was sentenced originally and it is not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. Thus, the district court did not err in using White\u2019s original sentence as a starting point from which to reduce his sentence for substantial assistance. Accordingly, we affirm White\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b685-9\">. In <em>Bonner v.
