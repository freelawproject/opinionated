Clark and Ruben White (\u201cappellants\u201d), acting <em>pro se, </em>bring this suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 to challenge the constitutionality of Texas state property tax assessments, which the appellants allege were excessive and discriminately applied. The district court declined to reach the merits; rather, it granted the appellees\u2019 Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction \u2014 finding that federal jurisdiction was barred by the Tax Injunction Act (\u201cTIA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, because the appellants failed to exhaust available state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">We have already ruled on this case once before. Prior to initiating this present action, the appellants filed essentially the same claim in federal court, which a district court then dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. In <em>Clark v. Andrews County Appraisal Dist., </em>76 Fed.Appx. 525, 526 (5th Cir.2003), we held that Texas state remedial procedures were available and that the appellants could have, but had not, availed themselves of those procedures. <em>Id. </em>At that time, we affirmed the district court\u2019s prior dismissal for lack of jurisdiction under the TIA. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Since that decision, nothing has changed to warrant a different outcome in this case. The appellants continue to argue that a letter sent on March 23, 1998 to numerous tax officials should count as an attempt to initiate the administrative review procedures. But the appraisal review board will only schedule a protest hearing if the parties file a notice of protest. Tex. Tax Code \u00a7 41.44(a), (d). The March 23rd letter, which stated only that appellants wished to meet with the tax officials to discuss the property tax assessment, failed to meet the statutory requirements for a notice of protest. Tex. Tax Code \u00a7 41.44(d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On April 7, 1998, one of the tax officials sent a letter to the appellants noting that the March 23rd letter was insufficient to prompt a protest hearing and suggested the appellants file a protest form. Further, if the appellants thought the letter should have prompted a protest hearing, they could have asked state courts to compel the board to provide a hearing. Tex. Tax Code \u00a7 41.45(f). We conclude that the appellants failed to exhaust available state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">Appellants make two other arguments. First, they argue that this is not really a tax case but is actually a discrimination case. This argument fails because \u201c[b]asing a complaint upon alleged violation of civil rights, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343[ (a) ](3) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 or of the Federal Constitution will not avoid the prohibition contained in Section 1341.\u201d <em>Hickmann v. Wujick, </em>488 F.2d 875, 876 (2d Cir.1973). Second, appellants argue that exhaustion of state remedies is not required, but this court has held otherwise. <em>See Bland v. McHann, </em>463 F.2d 21, 24 (5th Cir.1972) (\u201cWe do not disagree with the general rule that exhaustion is not required in \u00a7 1983 cases; however, in this case \u00a7 1983 collides full force with a specific congressional limitation on federal jurisdiction. In such circumstances we are convinced that \u00a7 1341 must prevail.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">Although we construe <em>pro se </em>briefs liberally, we cannot construe the appellants\u2019 brief to cure the jurisdictional defects apparent in this case. An extensive review of the record reveals that the appellants did not exhaust available state remedies. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Therefore, the district court did not err in dismissing the appellant\u2019s claim for lack of jurisdiction. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b293-21\"> Pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b294-7\">. This is consistent with the state court judgment on this same issue: \u201cThis [letter] in itself, however, is wholly insufficient to show that they were entitled to judicial review of a final determination from the appraisal review board.\u201d <em>Nev. Gold &amp; Silver, Inc. v. Andrews Indep. Sch., 225 </em>S.W.3d 68, 76 (Tex.App.\u2014El Paso 2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
