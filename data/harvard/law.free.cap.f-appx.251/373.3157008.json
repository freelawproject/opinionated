We address and reject seriatim all of the arguments Roberson raises in this pro se appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-24\">First, the district court\u2019s revocation of Roberson\u2019s pretrial release became moot once he was convicted. <em>See Murphy v. Hunt, </em>455 U.S. 478, 481, 102 S.Ct. 1181, 71 L.Ed.2d 353 (1982) (per curiam). Second, when he claimed that the indictment lacked the signatures of the prosecutor and grand jury foreperson, the court obtained the signed copy and showed it to him. Third, the court did not err in setting Roberson\u2019s base offense level because he failed to meet his burden to show that he possessed the firearm solely for lawful sporting purposes or collection. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2); <em>United States v. Lussier, </em>423 F.3d 838, 843 (8th Cir.2005). Fourth, the repeal of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(v) does not invalidate his conviction under section 922(g)(1). Fifth, there is no indication in the record that the government lied to the court when it represented, in response to Roberson\u2019s pretrial motion for disclosure of a confidential informant, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>the informant did not participate in the offense and would not be called to testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Sixth, the Speedy Trial Act was not violated because no more than 45 nonexcludable days passed before Roberson was tried. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(c)(1) (70-day speedy trial clock), (h)(1)(F) (excluding time when defendant\u2019s motions are pending), and (h)(1)(J) (excluding time when defendant\u2019s motions are under submission). Seventh, the Double Jeopardy Clause was not violated when he was twice arrested \u2014 as opposed to twice tried or twice punished \u2014 for the same offense. Eighth, Roberson\u2019s claim for monetary damages for wrongful imprisonment is unavailing because he has not shown that he is wrongfully imprisoned. Ninth, his claim that the jail interfered with his ability to represent himself below does not find adequate support in the record. Last, Roberson\u2019s motion for a new trial was untimely because it was not based on newly discovered evidence. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(b)(2); <em>United States v. Martinson, </em>419 F.3d 749, 752 (8th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-16\">. The Honorable David S. Doty, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
