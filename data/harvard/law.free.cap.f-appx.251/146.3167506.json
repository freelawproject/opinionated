Reinat contends on appeal that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court plainly erred in imposing a sentence at the top of the guideline range without considering his individual characteristics, as required under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007). <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (setting out plain error standard of review). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-23\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the sentencing court must calculate the appropriate advisory guideline range and consider the range in conjunction with the factors set out in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2007), to determine an appropriate sentence. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number><em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). A sentence within a properly calculated advisory guideline range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-68, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The record reveals that the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, although the court did not explicitly discuss each factor on the record. It was not required to do so. <em>Johnson, </em>445 F.3d at 345. Reinat suggests that the court erred in mentioning information from a co-defendant\u2019s trial; however, the court did not rely on this information to resolve any disputed matters. We conclude that no error occurred, and that the sentence imposed was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
