At sentencing, the district court departed upward pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(4) and sentenced Ledezma-Esparza to an 84-month term of imprisonment. Ledezma argues that the district court did not comply with the methodology set forth in \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(4) to determine an appropriate sentence; that the reasons cited by the court are inadequate to support the extent of the departure; and that the district court failed to consider the disparity between Ledezma-Esparza\u2019s sentence and the guidelines sentences received by similarly-situated defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-18\">The Sentencing Guidelines permit an upward departure if the district court believes that there is reliable information suggesting that the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood of recidivism is not adequately represented by the applicable sentencing guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l). Upward departures under the Sentencing Guidelines are reviewed for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2954, 165 L.Ed.2d 975 (2006). An upward departure is within the discretion of the district court and, thus, reasonable if it \u201cadvance[s] the objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)\u201d and (2) is \u201cjustified by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-22\">In this case, the district court departed upward based on the need to protect the public and the fact that Ledezma-Esparza\u2019s violent criminal history was not adequately taken into account by the Sentencing Guidelines. The record shows that both the decision to depart and the extent of the departure were within the discretion of the district court. <em>Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 347; <em>United States v. Ashburn, </em>38 F.3d 803, 809 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-23\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Ledezma-Esparza challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>victions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This court has held that this issue is \u201cfully foreclosed from further debate.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b919-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
