DeLamos pled guilty. He now appeals the ninety-six-month prison term imposed by the district court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">DeLamos argues that the district court improperly sentenced him to a term exceeding two years under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) (2000) because his prior aggravated felony conviction was not charged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Under \u00a7 1326(a), an alien who illegally returns to the United States after being removed may be imprisoned for up to two years. However, \u00a7 1326(b)(2) provides that if the alien\u2019s \u201cremoval was subsequent to an aggravated felony,\u201d he faces a maximum prison term of twenty years; if the alien was deported after conviction of a non-aggravated felony, the maximum sentence is ten years under \u00a7 1326(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">DeLamos concedes that the Supreme Court ruled in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), that \u00a7 1326(b) is a penalty provision, not an element of the offense which must be charged in the indictment and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. However, he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was called into question by the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and its progeny and should no longer be considered binding precedent. Although <em>Apprendi </em>expressed some uncertainty regarding the future vitality of <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>we have subsequently concluded that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was not overruled by Apprendi, and remains the law. <em>See United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 352-53 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1010, 126 S.Ct. 640, 163 L.Ed.2d 518 (2005). We therefore conclude that DeLamos\u2019 claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">Accordingly, we affirm DeLamos\u2019 sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
