For the first time on appeal, Hernandez-Ignacio argues that the 16-level crime-of-violence increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) is erroneous because his Texas conviction of aggravated assault does not qualify as a crime of violence under either definition applicable to that provision. In <em>United States v. Guillen-Alvarez, </em>489 F.3d 197, 199-201 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 418, 169 L.Ed.2d 293 (2007), this court held that aggravated assault under Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 22.02(a) qualifies as a conviction for an enumerated offense of aggravated assault and a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). The 16-level erime-of-violenee increase under that subsection was not imposed in error, plain or otherwise. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-21\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Hernandez-Ignacio challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This court has held that this issue is \u201cfully foreclosed from further debate.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Aug. 28, 2007) (No. 07-6202).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b325-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
