The district court dismissed the claims for lack of jurisdiction, and Bridges has waived appeal of the jurisdictional issues by failing to address them in his brief. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">In any event, the district court correctly dismissed the claim against the VA for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 511. <em>See Zuspann v. Brown, </em>60 F.3d 1156, 1158-60 (5th Cir.1995). The district court also lacked jurisdiction over the claim against the SSA because that claim had not been administratively exhausted. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 327-28, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b954-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
