In his \u00a7 1983 complaint, Enriquez challenged the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles\u2019 procedures on due process and equal protection grounds. The district court dismissed Enriquez\u2019s complaint. Enriquez timely appealed to this court, but thereafter, in November 2003, this court affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">Enriquez\u2019s instant Rule 60(b) motion was filed in March 2006. In that motion, Enriquez asserted that newly discovered evidence proved that the district court\u2019s judgment was manifestly unjust, that it was obtained through fraud, and that it had been satisfied. To the extent that Enriquez\u2019s motion was brought pursuant to Rule 60(b)(2) and (3), the district court found that the motion was time-barred. To the extent that Enriquez brought his motion under Rule 60(b)(5), the district court denied the motion on the grounds that the grounds for relief raised therein had previously been visited and decided on appeal by this court. Enriquez timely appealed the denial of his Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-14\">Enriquez contends that, since his fraud claim is based on the premise that there was a fraud perpetrated upon the court, it cannot be time-barred. His allegations do not rise to the type of egregious behavior that would warrant relief under Rule 60(b) for fraud upon the court. <em>See Wilson v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., </em>873 F.2d 869, 872 (5th Cir.1989). To the extent that Enriquez uses the term \u201cmanifestly unjust\u201d to invoke the \u201ccatch-all\u201d provision of Rule 60(b)(6), he has not shown extraordinary circumstances justifying relief from the judgment. <em>See Bailey v. Ryan Stevedoring Co., Inc., </em>894 F.2d 157, 160 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-15\">Contrary to Enriquez\u2019s assertions, the Supreme Court decision in <em>Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 78-83, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005), has no bearing on Enriquez\u2019s case. Moreover, to the extent that Enriquez reiterates the arguments raised in his \u00a7 1983 complaint, those arguments are not properly before the court. <em>See Williams v. Chater, </em>87 F.3d 702, 705 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-16\">Enriquez has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying his Rule 60(b) motion. <em>See Gov\u2019t Fin. Servs. One Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Peyton Place, Inc., </em>62 F.3d 767, 770 (5th Cir.1995). The district court\u2019s order is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b928-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
