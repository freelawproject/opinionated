Guevara argues that the district court erred in admitting extrinsic evidence of his involvement in conspiring to transport illegal aliens in 2003. Guevara also contends that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence for creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury based on evidence that his co-defendant transported aliens in the bed of a pickup truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-18\">The district court admitted testimony detailing Guevara\u2019s involvement in a conspiracy to transport illegal aliens in 2003. The facts of the 2003 offense were similar to the facts of the instant case and therefore relevant to show a pattern of conduct. The probative value of the evidence was not outweighed by the prejudice. <em>See United States v. Beechum, </em>582 F.2d 898, 914 (5th Cir.1978) (en banc). The district court gave a limiting instruction to the jury, and the jury is presumed to have followed the court\u2019s instruction. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>48 F.3d 1389, 1396-97 (5th Cir.1995). Therefore, the court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the extrinsic evidence of Guevara\u2019s 2003 involvement in the smuggling of aliens. <em>See United States v. Buchanan, </em>70 F.3d 818, 831 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-19\">Guevara\u2019s argument challenging the sentence enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(5) is likewise without merit. Transporting aliens in the bed of a pickup truck creates a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury. <em>United States v. Cuyler, </em>298 F.3d 387, 391 (5th Cir.2002). The record does not contain any evidence that the bed of the truck was covered by a camper. As such, Guevara\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Pineda-Jimenez, </em>212 Fed.Appx. 369, 373 (5th Cir.2007), is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b886-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
