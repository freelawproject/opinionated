The district court erred in doing so without allowing an evidentiary hearing on Enriquez\u2019s arguments concerning the validity and scope of the agreement. <em>See Mid-South Towing Co. v. Har-Win, Inc., </em>733 F.2d 386, 390-92 (5th Cir.1984). We therefore reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the matter for an evidentiary hearing on the validity and scope of the settlement agreement. Enriquez\u2019s narrow motion to remand is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-19\">REVERSED AND REMANDED; ALL OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b910-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
