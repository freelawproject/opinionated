Efflom challenges the immigration judge\u2019s findings that his asylum application was untimely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>and that he did not establish eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">The timeliness of an alien\u2019s asylum application is usually a question of fact. <em>See Mehilli v. Gonzales, </em>433 F.3d 86, 93 (1st Cir.2005). On May 11, 2005, Congress enacted the Real ID Act, which added a new subsection to the judicial review provisions. This subsection stated that discretionary and factual determinations are outside the jurisdiction of the court of appeals. 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (West 2005); <em>see also Vasile v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 766, 768 (7th Cir.2005). The exception to this provision is for constitutional claims or questions of law raised by aliens seeking discretionary relief. <em>Higuit v. Gonzales, </em>433 F.3d 417, 419 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2973, 165 L.Ed.2d 955 (2006). Despite Effiom\u2019s contentions, the judge\u2019s consideration of evidence at the trial and its subsequent conclusion is factual in nature. Accordingly, we do not have jurisdiction to review Effiom\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Additionally, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Effiom\u2019s request for withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). Because we find Effiom would not be able to show that he is eligible for asylum based on the record presented, we find he cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">We also hold that any alleged defects in the removal hearing transcript did not prejudice Effiom\u2019s ability to present his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
