We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-23\">We conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the action, given that Racy ignored defendant\u2019s repeated discovery requests for over a year, ignored the district court\u2019s order compelling her to respond to such requests, and never provided any justification for her failure to respond. <em>See Doe v. Cassel, </em>403 F.3d 986, 990 (8th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (standard of review of Fed. R.Civ.P. 41(b) dismissal); <em>Hairston v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number><em>Alert Safety Light Prods., Inc., </em>307 F.3d 717, 718-19 (8th Cir.2002) (standard of review of Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(b)(2) dismissal); <em>Hutchins v. A.G.

Jasper County Jail, </em>437 F.3d 791, 794 (8th Cir.2006) (standard of review; relevant factors include ability of indigent person to investigate facts and present claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-8\">.
