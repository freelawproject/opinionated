The district court sentenced Graham to eighty months in prison, her sentence to run concurrent to a state sentence she was currently serving. Graham\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), representing that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but raising the reasonableness of Graham\u2019s sentence as a possible ground for reversal. Graham was advised of her right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. The Government elected not to file a responding brief. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-24\">After a thorough Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing before the magistrate judge, the district court applied the safety valve reduction to Graham\u2019s original guidelines range, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>gave Graham credit for time served in state prison on a related offense, considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) (2000) factors, and sentenced Graham to the low end of a properly calculated guidelines range. We find Graham\u2019s sentence to be reasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 455-57 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-65, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding the application of the presumption of reasonableness afforded a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for review. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Graham in writing of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Graham requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may file a motion with this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Graham. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
