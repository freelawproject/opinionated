Asyer asserts that he established changed country conditions excusing the untimeliness of his asylum application. We find that we do not have jurisdiction to review that determination. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000); <em>Almuhtaseb v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 743, 746-48 (6th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-22\">Asyer also challenges the finding that he failed to qualify for withholding of removal. \u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rush v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). Having conducted our review, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the finding that Asyer did not establish eligibility for withholding of removal. Finally, Asyer\u2019s claim that he was denied due process at the removal hearing because the Immigration Judge denied a continuance and proceeded without an interpreter fails because he has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by the alleged violation. <em>See Rusu, </em>296 F.3d at 320-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-23\">We accordingly deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
