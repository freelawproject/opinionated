Priddy argues that the four-level enhancement that he received pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) was error because his possession of ammunition was not \u201cin connection with\u201d his other felony offenses as the ammunition was the object of and occurred contemporaneously with the other two offenses to which he pleaded guilty. The Government moves for summary affirmance on the ground that the argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Armstead, </em>114 F.3d 504, 511 (5th Cir.1997). Priddy concedes that his ax-gument is foreclosed by <em>Armstead </em>but seeks to preserve the issue for possible Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">The \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement was appropriate in the instant case. <em>See Armstead, </em>114 F.3d at 511-13. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion for extension of time to file a brief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b966-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has detei'mined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
