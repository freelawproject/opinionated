Moreno argues that the district court erred in construing his \u00a7 2241 petition as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and that his claims fall within the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. He also contends that he was improperly sentenced under the Guidelines because his sentence was based on facts not admitted by him or proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt and he is therefore entitled to relief under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-11\">\u201c[A] \u00a7 2241 petition that seeks to challenge the validity of a federal sentence must either be dismissed or construed as a section 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). A petitioner can attack the validity of his conviction in a \u00a7 2241 petition, but only if he shows that his remedy under \u00a7 2255 would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255; <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001). A prior unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motion, or the inability to meet \u00a7 2255\u2019s second or successive requirement, does not make \u00a7 2255 inadequate or ineffective. <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 878 (5th Cir.2000); <em>see also Pack, </em>218 F.3d at 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-16\">Moreno has failed to show that the remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective; he has also failed to show that his claims, which challenge the validity of the sentence itself, are based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that he may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and that the claims were foreclosed by circuit law at the time when they should have been raised at trial, on appeal, or in an initial \u00a7 2255 motion. Consequently, Moreno is not entitled to relief under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904; <em>see also Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 213-14 (5th Cir.2000). Furthermore, Moreno\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claims do not fall under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 427 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-17\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Moreno\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b930-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
