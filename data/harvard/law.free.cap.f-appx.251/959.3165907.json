Romero-Hernandez first contends that his 46-month sentence, which was within the properly calculated sentencing guidelines range, was unreasonable. According to Romero-Hernandez, this court\u2019s applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>tion of a presumption of reasonableness to within-guidelines sentences effectively renders the Guidelines mandatory in contravention of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Romero-Hernandez\u2019s argument is foreclosed by circuit and Supreme Court precedent. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 553-54 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2463-68, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Romero-Hernandez also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This court has held that this issue is \u201cfully foreclosed from further debate.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Aug. 28, 2007) (No. 07-6202).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b985-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
