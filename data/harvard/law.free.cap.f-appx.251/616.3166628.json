Fox, <em>pro se, </em>appeal the district court\u2019s May 16, 2007 dismissal order. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b643-20\">Because plaintiff-appellants\u2019 federal action is based on events in a state court case, we review the state court case first.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-21\">A. State Court Case</p>\n<p id=\"b643-22\">In Florida state court, appellants Taylor and Fox filed a complaint against defendant Lee Spaziano, a real estate broker, alleging fraud in a real estate transaction. In the state court action, defendant Robert Lerner was Spaziano\u2019s attorney and defendant Cynthia MacKinnon was the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-23\">Appellants served Spaziano with their state court complaint on October 3, 2006. Spaziano\u2019s answer was due in twenty days, or by October 23, 2006, under Florida\u2019s rules of civil procedure. Spaziano, however, filed a motion for an extension of time to file an answer. It is Spaziano\u2019s motion for an extension of time that gives rise to appellants\u2019 action filed in federal district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-24\">According to appellants, Spaziano and his attorney, Lerner, failed to timely file their motion for a time extension under the Florida civil rules. Appellants contend that the motion did not appear on the state court\u2019s docket as of October 24, 2006, but did appear on the docket on October 30, 2006 as filed on October 23, 2006. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>ing to appellants, Spaziano and Lerner conspired with Judge MacKinnon to backdate the motion so that it appeared to have been timely filed and Spaziano could avoid a default judgment. Appellants also contend that Judge MacKinnon failed to schedule a hearing on appellants\u2019 motion for default judgment and refused to enforce the twenty-day deadline for filing an answer, as required by Florida\u2019s civil rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">B. Federal Court Action</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Appellants, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed this action in federal district court seeking damages and injunctive relief against Spaziano, Lerner and Judge MacKinnon. The complaint alleged violations of unspecified constitutional rights, brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (Count I); a violation of appellants\u2019 first amendment right to access to the courts (Count II); a violation of the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601 et seq., (Count III); a violation of 4 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101-102 (requiring state legislators and executive and judicial officers to swear an oath to support the United States Constitution) (Count IV); a conspiracy to violate appellants\u2019 civil rights, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985 (Count V); and a state law claim of fraud (Count VI).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">In lieu of an answer, defendants Spaziano and Lerner filed separate, but identical, motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim or, alternatively, for a more definite statement. Defendant MacKinnon filed a motion to dismiss, asserting, among other things, that she was entitled to judicial immunity. All three motions to dismiss argued that appellants\u2019 complaint contained vague and eonclusory allegations. In addition, defendants Spaziano and Lerner argued that appellants\u2019 complaint was a \u201cshotgun pleading\u201d and failed to comply with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8 and 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">While these motions were pending, appellants filed a motion for leave to amend their complaint and response to defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss. Along with them motion to amend, appellants provided a proposed first amended complaint with numerous exhibits attached. The district court docket clerk entered the appellants\u2019 motion to amend on the court\u2019s docket with a parenthetical notation that \u201c[v]oluminous proposed amended complaint placed in brown accordion folder pending ruling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss. The district court: (1) dismissed <em>with prejudice </em>all claims against Judge MacKinnon; (2) dismissed \u201cwithout leave to amend\u201d Count IV, the claim based on 4 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101-102, \u201cbecause no such cause of action exists\u201d; and (3) dismissed \u201cwithout leave to amend\u201d Count III, the Truth in Lending Act claim, and Count VI, the state fraud claim, \u201cbecause they are already pending in the state court suit.\u201d Furthermore, the district court dismissed <em>without </em>prejudice Counts I, II and V, which contained the \u00a7 1983, First Amendment and conspiraeyto-violate-civil-rights claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">The district court\u2019s order noted a number of deficiencies in appellants\u2019 complaint. Specifically, the district court concluded that the complaint was a \u201cprototypical \u2018shotgun pleading\u2019 \u201d and did not satisfy the \u201cshort and plain statement\u201d requirement of Rule 8(a) or the organizational requirements of Rule 10(b). The district court further noted that \u201c[e]ach of these shortcomings is an independent basis for dismissal of the complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-11\">The district court directed appellants to file an amended complaint, if any, on or before April 15, 2007, but advised the appellants that the amended complaint \u201cmust comply with Rule 8(a) and Rule 10(b), must not include any claims against Judge MacKinnon, and must not raise the claims that have been dismissed without leave to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>amend.\u201d Thus, the district court left appellants\u2019 case open for the filing of an amended complaint as to Counts I, II and V. The district court warned appellants that the \u201c[f]ailure to follow these requirements may result in sanctions including but not limited to dismissal with prejudice.\u201d The district court also denied appellants\u2019 \u201ccurrently pending motion for leave to amend\u201d that had accompanied appellants\u2019 proposed amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">On April 13, 2007, appellants filed an \u201cObjection\u201d to the district court\u2019s order granting the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss. After first noting the district court\u2019s instructions to file an amended complaint by April 15, 2007, appellants argued that they had already filed an amended complaint with attached exhibits on April 2, 2007. Appellants contended that their amended complaint was a timely amendment as of right under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a). They also complained that their amended complaint and exhibits had been wrongly omitted from the court\u2019s civil docket, citing Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 79(a). Appellants contended that the district court should consider their amended complaint filed on April 2, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">On April 23, 2007, the district court construed appellants\u2019 \u201cObjection\u201d as a motion for reconsideration of the April 4 dismissal order and summarily denied it. Appellants took no further action in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">On May 16, 2007, the district court entered a final order dismissing and closing appellants\u2019 case, without prejudice, for failure to prosecute. At the time of the May 16, 2007 order, counts I, II and V had been dismissed without prejudice in the April 4, 2007, 2007 WL 1064297, order and what remained was appellants\u2019 right to file an amended complaint that complied with the instructions in the April 4, 2007 order. The district court\u2019s May 16, 2007 dismissal order emphasized that the district court had granted appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss, had denied appellants\u2019 motion for reconsideration and had given appellants until April 15 to file an amended complaint, but appellants had failed to file an amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">Appellants filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">At the outset, we note what appellants are <em>not </em>challenging on appeal. First, appellants do not appeal the district court\u2019s April 4, 2007 order granting defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss and denying their motion for leave to amend their complaint. Nor do appellants appeal the district court\u2019s April 23, 2007 order denying their \u201cObjection,\u201d construed as a motion for reconsideration. Accordingly, we do not address the merits of these rulings. The sole order on appeal is the district court\u2019s May 16, 2007 order dismissing without prejudice and closing appellants\u2019 case for failure to prosecute.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal for want of prosecution for abuse of discretion. <em>Morewitz v. W. of Eng. Ship Owners Mut. Prot. &amp; Indem. Ass\u2019n, </em>62 F.3d 1356, 1366 (11th Cir.1995). A district court may impose a dismissal <em>with </em>prejudice for want of prosecution only if there is a \u201cclear record of delay or contumacious conduct by the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). Here, however, the district court dismissed appellants\u2019 case <em>without </em>prejudice, which was not an adjudication on the merits. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) (providing that an involuntary dismissal for failure to prosecute is an adjudication on the merits, unless the district court \u201cotherwise specifies\u201d). Under these facts, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion in dismissing what remained of appellants\u2019 case <em>without </em>prejudice in its May 16, 2007 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-13\">The district court\u2019s April 4 order identified several serious deficiencies in appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>lants\u2019 complaint that needed to be cured. First, with regard to appellants\u2019 claims that were dismissed with leave to amend, the district court found appellants\u2019 allegations insufficient to state a claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court explained that appellants\u2019 claims against Spaziano and Lerner \u201calleged, at worst, nothing more than violations of the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d The district court concluded that, even construing appellants\u2019 complaint to include an \u201cimplied allegation\u201d that one of the defendants back-dated the state court motion for a time extension, appellants did not state a claim for a violation of their constitutional rights because appellants alleged no facts \u201cfrom which one could conclude that Lerner was acting under color of law for purposes of Section 1983.\u201d As to Spaziano, the district court explained that \u201cthe worst that is alleged is that he cheated the Plaintiffs in a real estate transaction\u201d and that none of the facts alleged \u201ccould conceivably constitute a violation by Spaziano of the Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">The district court also concluded that appellants\u2019 complaint failed to comply with Rules 8(a) and 10(b) and was a \u201cprototypical \u2018shotgun pleading.\u2019 \u201d The district court noted that the complaint contained \u201ca rambling recitation full of factual allegations that could not possibly be material to any of the causes of action [plaintiffs] assert.\u201d Notably, appellants\u2019 original complaint included 43 separate paragraphs of factual allegations, with each count incorporated by reference all 43 paragraphs, and did not differentiate which facts formed the basis for liability for each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The district court warned appellants that each of these deficiencies constituted a separate ground for dismissal and then instructed appellants, if they desired to continue with the litigation, to file an amended complaint that addressed all of these deficiencies. The district court also instructed appellants to omit all claims against Judge MacKinnon and any claims the district court had dismissed without leave to amend (namely, the Truth In Lending Act and fraud claims and the claim asserting a violation of 4 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101 and 102).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">Despite these explicit instructions, appellants did not file an amended complaint by April 15 as required by the district court. Instead, on April 13, appellants filed an \u201cObjection\u201d in which they insisted that the district court consider their already-filed proposed amended complaint. However, appellants\u2019 proposed amended complaint was drafted and filed on April 2 and thus <em>before, </em>the district court\u2019s April 4 order and, not surprisingly, did not comply with instructions in the April 4 order. Indeed, the proposed amended complaint contained all of the same counts, claims and defendants and essentially the same facts, with some minor word changes, as the original complaint. Accordingly, the proposed amended complaint contained all of the same deficiencies as the original complaint and included all the claims, including those against Judge MacKinnon, that the district court had instructed appellants to omit. <em>See Hall v. United Ins. Co. of Am., </em>367 F.3d 1255, 1262-63 (11th Cir.2004) (explaining that a district court properly denies leave to amend if the complaint as amended would be subject to dismissal, i.e. would be futile).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">Appellants insisted that they be permitted to proceed on the proposed amended complaint despite the fact that it did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>comply with the April 4 order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When the district court refused to do so by denying their \u201cObjection,\u201d appellants did nothing further. They did not file another amended complaint attempting to comply with the district court\u2019s April 4 order or ask for more time to do so. Nonetheless, the district court waited until May 16, 2007, three weeks after it had denied appellants\u2019 \u201cObjection\u201d and one month after a compliant amended complaint was due, before dismissing appellants\u2019 case for failure to prosecute. Under these circumstances, the district court\u2019s dismissal <em>without </em>prejudice was not an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-6\">. We do not address appellants\u2019 claims dismissed with prejudice or without leave to amend because the district court instructed appellants not to include these claims in any amended complaint, and appellants do not appeal the April 4, 2007 order that dismissed them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b647-7\">. Appellants note that, under Rule 15(a), they had an automatic right to amend their complaint because defendants had not yet filed answers. <em>See Fortner v. Thomas, </em>983 F.2d 1024, 1032 (11th Cir.1993). Although appellants could have amended as of right, they instead sought leave to amend from the district court and filed a motion to amend, which the district court denied on April 4, 2007. Appellants have not appealed that order, much less shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying that motion especially since appellants\u2019 proposed amended complaint contained the same deficiencies as the original complaint and was subject to dismissal on the same grounds given by the district court in dismissing the claims in their original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Furthermore, the district court's April 4 order dismissed <em>without prejudice </em>those claims for which the pleading deficiencies might be cured and granted leave to file yet another amended complaint, which appellants failed to do.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b647-9\">. Appellants also strenuously object to the district court clerk's failing to enter their proposed amended complaint and exhibits into the docket with a separate file number and, instead, placing the proposed amended complaint in an accordion folder pending the district court\u2019s ruling on the motion for leave to amend the complaint. Appellants contend that the district court clerk\u2019s action shows that the district court \"disregarded\u201d their proposed amended complaint and exhibits. In this regard, appellants have also not shown any reversible error for several reasons. First, the district court expressly denied appellants\u2019 motion for leave to file an amended complaint, and the court docket contains a notation that the proposed amended complaint was placed in an accordion folder, which, at a minimum, infers that the district court was aware of the proposed amended complaint. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the district court was not aware, as appellants contend, it is clear that the proposed amended complaint provided to the district court clerk contained the exact same defects as the original complaint and did not comply, in any event, with the district court's April 4 order regarding amending the complaint. More importantly, after receiving the district court\u2019s April 4 order pointing out defects, appellants never filed another amended complaint complying with the district court\u2019s order as to those counts for which leave to amend was granted. Thus, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion in dismissing on May 16, 2007 what remained of appellants' case without prejudice for failure to prosecute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
