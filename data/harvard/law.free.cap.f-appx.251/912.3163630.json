(\u201cBoler\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of Boler\u2019s bad faith claim against its insurer, Employers Mutual Casualty Company (\u201cEMC\u201d). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-16\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b939-17\">In December 2002, a fire damaged Boler\u2019s body shop. The facilities were covered by an insurance policy issued by EMC, which included business interruption coverage with a limit of $120,000. After the fire, Boler timely filed a proof of loss for business interruption. Boler maintained that its business interruption losses amounted to $120,000.00. EMC, in contrast, determined that Boler\u2019s covered losses totaled only $51,525.57. This sum was tendered to and accepted by Boler; yet Boler continued to demand the remaining balance of the $120,000 policy limit. In June 2005, pursuant to the terms of the policy, EMC requested an appraisal. Approximately six months later, Boler\u2019s representative contacted EMC to discuss the possibility of mediating or arbitrating the dispute. EMC promptly declined, stating that the statute of limitations had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-18\">The following month, Boler filed suit against EMC in state court, seeking the balance of the policy limit. EMC removed the matter to federal district court and filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that Boler\u2019s claim was time barred. EMC also filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that the court should dismiss Boler\u2019s claim for failure to comply with the policy\u2019s appraisal clause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>which EMC had invoked in June 2005; or, alternatively, that the court should require Boler to comply with the provisions of the appraisal clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">Holding that Boler\u2019s claim was not time barred, the district court rejected EMC\u2019s motion to dismiss on that ground. The court determined, however, that Boler had failed to comply with the appraisal clause, which was a condition precedent to a suit against EMC. Accordingly, the court granted EMC\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed Boler\u2019s claim. Boler timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">\n<em>1. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">We review a district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standards as the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018In a diversity case such as this one, federal courts must apply the choice of law rules in the forum state in which the court sits.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This requires us to apply Mississippi law in interpreting Boler\u2019s Mississippi insurance contract issued by EMC.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">\n<em>2. Merits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b940-9\">Boler contends that the appraisal clause in the insurance contract is not a condition precedent to a suit against EMC, because (1) EMC \u201cdenied\u201d Boler\u2019s claim on the ground that it was time barred, thus EMC cannot now assert Boler\u2019s failure to comply with the appraisal clause as a defense, (2) EMC\u2019s \u201cdenial\u201d of Boler\u2019s claim prevented Boler from complying with the appraisal clause, (3) EMC waived its right to assert the appraisal clause as a defense, and (4) the appraisal clause is unenforceable because it is unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-17\">Boler\u2019s first and second arguments are premised on the erroneous assertion that EMC \u201cdenied\u201d Boler\u2019s claim. At no time did EMC assert that Boler\u2019s claim was not covered by the policy. Rather, EMC and Boler disagreed on the total dollar amount of Boler\u2019s business interruption loss. EMC timely and properly invoked the appraisal clause in June 2005. EMC\u2019s subsequent refusal to submit to additional mediation or arbitration with Boler does not invalidate the appraisal clause or EMC\u2019s invoking it; neither does it constitute a \u201cdenial\u201d of Boler\u2019s claim. As there was no denial of Boler\u2019s claim, the cases cited by Boler are inapposite so their holdings do not prevent EMC from asserting its invoking of the appraisal clause as a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-18\">Equally feckless is Boler\u2019s contention that EMC waived its right to assert Boler\u2019s non-compliance with the appraisal clause by (1) not raising the appraisal issue until after Boler filed suit, and (2) not seeking to compel Boler to participate in the appraisal process. This contention is both unpersuasive and factually incorrect. EMC properly invoked the appraisal clause prior to Boler\u2019s filing of the lawsuit. Additionally, nothing in the insurance policy requires EMC to take affirmative steps to compel Boler to participate in the appraisal process once invoked by EMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-19\">Boler\u2019s contention that the appraisal clause is unconscionable because EMC is not bound by the appraisal process and Boler must pay part of the cost of the appraisal, is grounded in an erroneous in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>terpretation of that clause. Under the terms of the appraisal clause, both parties are bound by the result of the appraisal process, as long as the loss is covered under the policy. This type of appraisal clause has been repeatedly enforced by Mississippi courts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That Boler may be required to pay part of the appraisal costs does not make the provision unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">EMC properly invoked the appraisal provision of the insurance policy. Contrary to Boler\u2019s argument, EMC never \u201cdenied\u201d Boler\u2019s claim. The district court did not err in determining that the Boler\u2019s compliance with the appraisal clause was a condition precedent to a suit by Boler against EMC, and thus did not err in granting summary judgment dismissing Boler\u2019s action. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b939-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
