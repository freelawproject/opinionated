Davis argues that the district court denied him meaningful access to the courts to assert his claims that he was imprisoned based on a void judgment. He contends that the judgment is void because his conviction was in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">Davis has not addressed the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 complaint based on the time-bar. Arguments must be properly briefed in order to be preserved for appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, 985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th </em>Cir.1993). Therefore, Davis has abandoned the dis-positive issue raised by the appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">Davis\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and, thus, is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal of Davis\u2019s complaint as frivolous. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Davis is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-14\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b943-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
