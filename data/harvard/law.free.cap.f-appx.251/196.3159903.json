Alvarado\u2019s attorney filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), challenging the district court\u2019s determination of the extent of the downward departure for substantial assistance, USSG \u00a7 5K1.1.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Alvarado filed a pro se brief challenging his sentence. Our review of the record discloses no reversible error; accordingly, we affirm Alvarado\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-23\">Counsel argues that the district court abused its discretion in determining the extent of the departure because the court believed that it was limited by the government\u2019s suggestion of an appropriate range. We find that the district court was aware of its discretion to determine an appropriate departure and that its determination of a departure amount in the middle of the range suggested by the government was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Pearce, </em>191 F.3d 488, 493 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-24\">In his pro se brief, Alvarado contends that the district court erred in determining his sentence by applying offense level 43, rather than 41, as was recommended by the probation officer, and thus, the departure sentence should also be lower. We find no merit to these contentions. The offense level of 41 was stated in an earlier version of the presentence report, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>was corrected because of the erroneous offense level. The revised presentence report correctly noted that Alvarado\u2019s offense level was 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Lastly, Alvarado contends that the district court\u2019s findings that he was a leader or organizer in the offense and that he possessed a firearm resulted in an increase in his sentence beyond the maximum authorized by the charges in the indictment, in violation of the ruling in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). First, we note that Alvarado did not receive an enhancement for possession of a firearm, but rather two levels were added because Alvarado was convicted of money laundering in addition to the drug offense. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2S1.1(b)(2)(B). Moreover, <em>Apprendi </em>prohibits the imposition of a sentence beyond the maximum authorized by the statute of conviction, it does not prohibit the consideration of relevant conduct in determining the applicable guideline range. Thus, Alvarado\u2019s argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">We find that the district court properly applied the Sentencing Guidelines, determined a reasonable departure amount based on Alvarado\u2019s substantial assistance, and considered the relevant sentencing factors before imposing the 315-month sentence. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2007); <em>see United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005); <em>Pearce, </em>191 F.3d at 493. Additionally, we find that the sentence imposed was reasonable. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546-47 (holding that sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm Alvarado\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Alvarado\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b222-25\"> <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1 (2005 &amp; Supp. 2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
