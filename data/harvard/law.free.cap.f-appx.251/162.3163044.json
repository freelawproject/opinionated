Hester seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appeal-ability. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that any assessment of the constitutional claims by the district court is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Hester has not made the requisite showing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability; deny Hester\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel, to place the case in abeyance, and for general relief; and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
