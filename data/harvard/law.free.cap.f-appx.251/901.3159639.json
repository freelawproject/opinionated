He argues that the Office of the Clerk of the 10th Supreme Court of Texas at Waco, Texas, violated his due process rights by failing to comply with its duty under Texas law to notify Brown\u2019s appellate counsel of record that his case had been remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-18\">However, because Brown\u2019s claims necessarily implicate the validity of his conviction, and because Brown has not shown that his conviction has been reversed or expunged, the district court properly eon-eluded that his claim was barred under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-21\">The district court dismissed a prior civil rights case filed by Brown as frivolous. <em>See Brown v. Wallace, </em>No. H-03-0827 (S.D.Tex. Jan. 25, 2005). That dismissal and the district court\u2019s dismissal of this civil rights claim as frivolous count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Brown is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-22\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b927-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
