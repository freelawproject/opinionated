Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Roda-Lopez argues that his sentence is unreasonable as a matter of law because this presumption of reasonableness effectively reinstates the mandatory guideline scheme condemned by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The Supreme Court recently upheld the use of the presumption. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-25\">Roda-Lopez challenges only the presumption of reasonableness, which is \u201can appellate court presumption.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He does not argue that the district court\u2019s sentence was unreasonable or otherwise erroneous and, thus, has waived any challenge to his sentence. <em>See United States v. Thames, </em>214 F.3d 608, 612 n. 3 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Valdiosera-Godinez, </em>932 F.2d 1093, 1099 (5th Cir.1991). Because Roda-Lopez has not challenged his sentence, this court has no occasion to review his sentence under the \u201cpresumptively reasonable\u201d or any other standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-26\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Roda-Lopez challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This court has held that this issue is \u201cfully foreclosed from further debate.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Aug. 28, 2007) (No. 07-6202).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-27\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b993-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
