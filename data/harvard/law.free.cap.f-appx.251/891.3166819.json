This court will uphold the finding that an alien is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>eligible for asylum if that finding is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">\u201cTo qualify for asylum, an alien must be a \u2018refugee.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tesfamichael v. Gonzales, </em>469 F.3d 109, 113 (5th Cir.2006) (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a)). A refugee is a person unable to return to his or her country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A)), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 353, 169 L.Ed.2d 10 (2007). \u201cPast persecution entails harm inflicted on the alien on account of a statutorily enumerated ground by the government or forces that a government is unable or unwilling to control.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1)). The harm or suffering \u201cneed not be physical, but may take other forms, such as the deliberate imposition of severe economic disadvantage or the deprivation of liberty, food, housing, employment or other essentials of life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114 (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">Karanja acknowledges that the IJ denied him relief based on the finding that he was not credible as well as on the finding that he had not established past persecution or a well founded fear of future persecution. He argues, however, that the BIA \u201crefused to endorse the IJ\u2019s negative credibility finding.\u201d We do not address the credibility issue because even accepting Karanja\u2019s allegations as true, he has not meet his burden of proof. <em>See Ozdemir v. INS, </em>46 F.3d 6, 8 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">The record does not support Karanja\u2019s assertion that he suffered significant harm to his home or \u201cway of life.\u201d Moreover, there is no authority which supports Karanja\u2019s argument that the emotional distress he suffered based on the alleged rapes of his wife and daughter is a type of harm that constitutes past persecution. Karanja cites <em>Campos-Guardado v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 285, 289 (5th Cir.1987), in support of his assertion. However, in <em>Campos-Guardado, </em>this court merely recognized that harm to a family member might support a finding of a reasonable fear of future persecution, not a finding of past persecution. <em>Id. </em>at 289. Further, Karanja failed to present any facts which showed that he suffered past persecution by a group that the government was unwilling or unable to control, as required by the INA. <em>See Tesfamichael, </em>469 F.3d at 113. Accordingly, his petition is DENIED. <em>See Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 78.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b917-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
