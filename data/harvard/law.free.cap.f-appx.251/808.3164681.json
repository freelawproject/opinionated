On appeal, we granted the Appellants\u2019 unopposed motion to consolidate. Appellants argue that their sentences, which are above the advisory Sentencing Guidelines range but within the statutory maximum, constitute reversible error. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-19\">We do not find that Appellants\u2019 two-year sentences are plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437 (4th Cir.2006) (providing review standard), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1813, 167 L.Ed.2d 325 (2007). Although neither district court specifically discussed by name the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors applicable to supervised release sentences, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), both courts gave reasons for the sentences that fit within factors outlined in \u00a7 3553(a). In short, both courts explained sufficiently why the defendants were given sentences outside their advisory sentencing ranges. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (noting that \u201c[w]here a [sentencing] matter is ... conceptually simple\u201d and the record makes clear that the sentencing judge considered the evidence and arguments, \u201cwe do not believe the law requires the judge to write more extensively\u201d); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006) (stating district court need not \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection\u201d or \u201cexplicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record\u201d) (internal quotation and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-24\">Accordingly, we affirm the sentences. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-25\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
