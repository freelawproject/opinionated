The district court sentenced him to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Moreno-Serafin asserts that his speedy trial rights were violated when the district court continued the ease for more than eighteen months, and that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. We affirm Moreno-Serafin\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-19\">Following his guilty plea, a presentence investigation report was prepared, making a recommendation as to Moreno-Serafin\u2019s sentencing. Moreno-Serafin then moved to withdraw his plea, asserting that he did not understand the plea and the consequences of pleading guilty. In support of this assertion, he noted that during the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing, Moreno-Serafin expressed that he did not want to plead guilty to the three charges that counsel stated he would. Moreno-Serafin was concerned that he would be subject to a twenty-five year sentence. Defense counsel explained to the court that MorenoSerafin asked him to schedule a change of plea hearing, that his sentencing exposure in the ten-to-twelve-year range had been explained to Moreno-Serafin, and that counsel had explained to Moreno-Serafin the possibility of a sentence reduction under the safety-valve provision of the guidelines. The court and counsel explained to Moreno-Serafin that he would not be sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>tenced to ten years on each count, but rather that the two charges, drug conspiracy and conspiracy to import drugs, would be consolidated for sentencing, and that any sentence on the money laundering conspiracy charge would likely run concurrently; therefore, he would not be subject to a twenty-five year sentence, as he feared. After this explanation, MorenoSeraf\u00edn stated that he understood and that he wished to plead guilty to the three counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The court then explained the charges and the possible penalties, ascertained that Moreno-Seraf\u00edn was aware of his trial rights, and asked if Moreno-Seraf\u00edn was admitting that he was guilty of the three charges. Moreno-Seraf\u00edn replied: \u201cFor conspiracy, yes.\u201d The court clarified that Moreno-Seraf\u00edn understood and was admitting his guilt of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute drugs, conspiracy to import drugs into the United States, and conspiracy to launder money. Moreno-Seraf\u00edn answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Moreno-Serafin\u2019s counsel also asserts that Moreno-Seraf\u00edn lacked an understanding of the consequences of his plea, as demonstrated by his response to the court\u2019s inquiry as to whether anyone made him any promise of a lesser sentence to induce his guilty plea. Moreno-Seraf\u00edn responded, \u201cThe attorney.\u201d The court inquired whether that promise was the \u201cpossibility of a safety valve lesser sentence\u201d and Moreno-Seraf\u00edn then asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s a safety valve?\u201d The court responded by asking Moreno-Seraf\u00edn to describe any promise of leniency that had been made to him. Moreno-Seraf\u00edn responded, \u201cHe simply told me that he would try to help me [get the best sentence.]\u201d After further inquiry of Moreno-Seraf\u00edn and counsel, the court accepted the guilty plea, finding that it was knowingly and voluntarily entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">We find no abuse of discretion by the district court in denying Moreno-Ser-</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">afin\u2019s motion to withdraw the plea. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>81 F.3d 1300, 1305 (4th Cir.1996) (providing standard); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>931 F.2d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1991); <em>see United States v. Puckett, </em>61 F.3d 1092, 1099 (4th Cir.1995) (holding that the key factor is whether the plea hearing was properly conducted). We have carefully scrutinized the Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 colloquy and find no error by the district court in determining that the plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered. <em>See United States v. Lambey, </em>974 F.2d 1389, 1394 (4th Cir.1992) (holding that a properly conducted Rule 11 proceeding \u201craise[s] a strong presumption that the plea is final and binding\u201d). Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Moreno-Serafin\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"AUX\">A valid guilty plea waives all non-jurisdictional defects. <em>Tollett v. Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973); <em>United States v. Willis, </em>992 F.2d 489, 490 (4th Cir.1993). The right to a speedy trial under the Speedy Trial Act is non-jurisdictional. <em>See Washington v. Sobina, </em>475 F.3d 162, 166 (3d Cir.2007) (citing cases); <em>United States v. Bell, </em>966 F.2d 914, 915 (5th Cir.1992). Thus, by knowingly and voluntarily pleading guilty, Moreno-Seraf\u00edn waived his right to claim a Speedy Trial Act violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">Moreno-Seraf\u00edn contends that these cases are contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s dictate in <em>United States v. Broce, </em>488 U.S. 563, 109 S.Ct. 757, 102 L.Ed.2d 927 (1989), in which the Court explained the exceptions to the principle that a guilty plea waives non-jurisdictional claims. Specifically, the Supreme Court held that when \u201cthe defendant\u2019s right [is] \u2018the right not to be haled into court at all upon the [] charge,\u2019 then \u2018[t]he very initiation of proceedings against him [operates] to deny him due process of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574-75, 109 S.Ct. 757 (quoting <em>Blackledge v. Perry, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>417 U.S. 21, 30-31, 94 S.Ct. 2098, 40 L.Ed.2d 628 (1974)). However, the cases to which this exception applied concerned claims of double jeopardy violations, not violations of the right to a speedy trial. <em>See Broce, </em>488 U.S. at 574-75, 109 S.Ct. 757 (citing <em>Blackledge, </em>417 U.S. at 30-31, 94 S.Ct. 2098; <em>Menna v. New York, </em>423 U.S. 61, 62 &amp; n. 2, 96 S.Ct. 241, 46 L.Ed.2d 195 (1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">As stated above, the right to a speedy trial is a non-jurisdictional claim that may be waived and indeed is waived by an unconditional guilty plea, such as that entered by Moreno-Seraf\u00edn. Thus, we need not resolve Moreno-Serafin\u2019s speedy trial issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">In conclusion, we affirm Moreno-Serafin\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
