Guzman argues that the district court erred when it refused to grant a downward departure, <em>see </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2A1.1 cmt. n. 2(B) (Nov.2005), and imposed an unreasonable sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-18\">Guzman argues that the district court wrongly refused to grant a downward departure. We lack jurisdiction to review the discretionary refusal of a district court to grant a downward departure unless the district court erroneously believed that it was without authority to depart from the advisory Guidelines range. <em>United States v. Norris, </em>452 F.3d 1275, 1282 (11th Cir.2006). The extensive analysis provided by the district court in reaching its decision establishes that the district court understood its authority to depart downward, but declined to exercise that authority. We are without jurisdiction to review that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-19\">Guzman also argues that his sentence is unreasonable. He argues that the district court violated the \u201cconcept of advisory guidelines\u201d by requiring defense counsel to explain why the characteristics of the defendant warranted a sentence below the Guidelines range. Guzman also contends that his sentence, which is 13 years longer than the sentence of his co-defendant, failed to achieve the goal of avoiding sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-20\">\u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unrea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>sonable in the light <em>of </em>both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhen we review a sentence for reasonableness, we do not, as the district court did, determine the exact sentence to be imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe must evaluate whether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[W]hen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Guzman\u2019s sentence of 600 months of imprisonment was reasonable. The sentence was within the advisory Guidelines range and below the statutory maximum sentence. Both the sentencing order and the transcript of the sentencing hearing establish that the district court sentenced Guzman, as the \u201cdirect perpetrator\u201d of a death, after careful consideration of Guzman\u2019s arguments in favor of mitigation, the Guidelines, and the sentencing factors of section 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Guzman\u2019s sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
