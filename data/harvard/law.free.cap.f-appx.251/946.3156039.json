The Government has moved for summary affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-23\">Slade argues that (1) the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) because the mere movement of a firearm from one state to another does not constitute a \u201csubstantial\u201d effect on interstate commerce and (2) \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional because it does not require a \u201csubstantial\u201d effect on interstate commerce. Slade correctly concedes that his sufficiency claim is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001), and that his constitutional challenge to \u00a7 922(g)(1) is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Rawls, </em>85 F.3d 240, 242-43 (5th Cir.1996). He raises these arguments only to preserve them for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>Slade additionally argues that the Government was required to prove that he knew the firearm in his possession was in or affecting interstate commerce and therefore, his indictment was fatally defective for failing to allege such knowledge on his part. He correctly concedes that this issue is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Dancy, </em>861 F.2d 77, 81-82 (5th Cir.1988), and seeks only to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">AFFIRMED; MOTION FOR SUMMARY AFFIRMANCE GRANTED; MOTION FOR EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE BRIEF DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b972-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
