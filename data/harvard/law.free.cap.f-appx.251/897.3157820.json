Green argues that the district court\u2019s refusal to allow counsel to comment on sentencing matters after the court announced its intention to impose, sua sponte, a non-guidelines sentence violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(i)(1)(C) and the Due Process Clause. The Government seeks enforcement of the sentence-appeal waiver in the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-22\">Our review of the record shows that Green\u2019s sentence-appeal waiver was knowing and voluntary and that, under the plain language of the plea agreement, the waiver applies to the circumstances at hand. <em>See United States v. Burns, </em>433 F.3d 442, 445-46 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005). Green\u2019s argument that the asserted sentencing error is not subject to waiver is not supported by relevant authority and is not persuasive. Accordingly, Green\u2019s appeal waiver bars review of the issues he seeks to raise on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b923-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
