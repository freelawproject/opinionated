He argues that his sentence is unconstitutional in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because it was based on facts not presented to a jury and to which he did not admit. The Government seeks to enforce the appeal waiver provision in Austin\u2019s plea agreement and moves for summary affirmance or dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-16\">Austin\u2019s appeal waiver was knowing and voluntary, and therefore, the waiver is enforced. <em>See United States v. Melancon, </em>972 F.2d 566, 567-68 (5th Cir.1992). Moreover, Austin\u2019s argument does not come within one of the enumerated exceptions to his appeal waiver. As such, we do not address the merits of Austin\u2019s challenge to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-21\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED. The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss is DENIED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b931-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
