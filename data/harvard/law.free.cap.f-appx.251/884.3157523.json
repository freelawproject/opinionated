Cain, </em>149 F.3d 374, 376-78 (5th Cir.1998). His \u00a7 2254 petition challenged his conviction for aggravated sexual assault. His Rule 60(b) motion argued that he was prevented by the district court from timely appealing the dismissal of his \u00a7 2254 petition. Morin now seeks a COA from this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Morin argues that a July 2006 motion for records and transcripts should have been construed as a timely notice of appeal from the dismissal of his habeas petition because it was filed within the one-year time limit required by Rule 60(b)(1)-(3). Alternatively, he argues that his July 2006 post-judgment motion was proper under Rule 60(b)(4)-(6). He notes that he was ordered by the district court before entry of the judgment dismissing his \u00a7 2254 petition not to file any more pleadings. He also notes that it took the district court approximately five months to respond to his July 2006 request for records and transcripts. Finally, he complains that he has never received a full and fair hearing by the district court, including with respect to the claims raised in his \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">Morin\u2019s notice of appeal from the dismissal of his \u00a7 2254 petition is not timely and is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a); <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 2364, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). Moreover, as Morin was not attempting to use his Rule 60(b) motion to alter the judgment in his underlying habeas petition, but instead attempting to vacate the judgment and have it reentered so he could file a timely notice of appeal, a COA is not necessary. <em>See Dunn v. Cockrell, </em>302 F.3d 491, 492 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.2002); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1). Accordingly, the motion for a COA is denied as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">Morin\u2019s appeal from the denial of his Rule 60(b) motion is unavailing. Regardless of whether his Rule 60(b) motion was timely filed, Morin was not entitled to relief under any subsection of Rule 60(b). <em>See Dunn, </em>302 F.3d at 493; <em>Latham v. Wells Fargo Bank, </em>987 F.2d 1199, 1204 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Wilson v. Atwood Group, </em>725 F.2d 255 (5th Cir.1984) (en banc). As the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Morin\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion, its judgment denying the motion is affirmed. <em>See Warfield v. Byron, </em>436 F.3d 551, 555 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">MOTION FOR COA DENIED AS UNNECESSARY; DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b910-34\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
