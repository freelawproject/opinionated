Davis\u2019s claim that a prison official violated his constitutional rights by opening Davis\u2019s incoming legal mail outside his presence is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Brewer v. Wilkinson, </em>3 F.3d 816, 825 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-22\">Davis\u2019s appeal lacks arguable merit, and it is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal and the dismissal of the instant appeal count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Davis also accumulated a strike in <em>Davis v. Inmate Trust Fund, </em>No. A-03-CA-732-SS and a strike in <em>Davis v. Baker, </em>No. 4:07-CV-068-A. Accordingly, Davis is now barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g). Davis\u2019s motions for the appointment of counsel and for oral argument are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-23\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTIONS DENIED; SANCTION IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b925-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
