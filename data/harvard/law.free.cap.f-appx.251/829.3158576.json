On appeal, Sargeant\u2019s sole alleged error is that the district court erred in granting only a three level departure from his advisory guidelines range. Sargeant does not allege that the departure decision resulted in a sentence imposed in violation of law or resulted from an incorrect application of the Guidelines. Accordingly, we dismiss Sargeant\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Hill, </em>70 F.3d 321, 324 (4th Cir.1995). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-20\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
