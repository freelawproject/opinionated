(\u201cSouthern Nuclear\u201d), in their employment discrimination lawsuit, alleging disparate treatment based on race, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, <em>et seq., </em>and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. Appellants argue that the district court erred by entering summary judgment after finding that because Appellants had not identified a similarly situated employee who had been treated more favorably, they had not established a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-24\">We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>considering all the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and making all reasonable inferences in his favor. <em>Brooks v. County Com\u2019n of Jefferson County, Ala., </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1162 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Maniccia v. Brown, </em>171 F.3d 1364, 1367 (11th Cir.1999). Summary judgment should be granted only if \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to her compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a). Because Appellants rely on circumstantial evidence to establish their disparate-treatment claim, we test the sufficiency of that claim by applying the burden-shifting framework established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), and <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). <em>See Chapman v. AI Transp., </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1024 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework, a plaintiff first must show an inference of discriminatory intent, and thus carries the initial burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. <em>See McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817. In a disparate-treatment case like this one, to satisfy her <em>prima facie </em>burden, a plaintiff must show: (1) she was a member of a protected class; (2) she was qualified for the position; (3) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) she was treated less favorably than a similarly-situated individual outside her protected class. <em>See Maynard v. Bd. of Regents of Div. of Univs. of Fla. Dept. of Educ. ex rel. Univ. of S. Fla., </em>342 F.3d 1281, 1289 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Holifield v. Reno, </em>115 F.3d 1555, 1562 (11th Cir.1997) (per curiam).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The plaintiffs successful assertion of a <em>prima facie </em>case \u201ccreates a rebuttable presumption that the employer unlawfully discriminated against her.\u201d <em>E.E.O.C. v. Joe\u2019s Stone Crabs, Inc., </em>296 F.3d 1265, 1272 (11th Cir.2002) (citing <em>U.S. Postal Serv. Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, </em>460 U.S. 711, 714, 103 S.Ct. 1478, 75 L.Ed.2d 403 (1983)). If the plaintiff successfully demonstrates a <em>prima facie </em>case, the burden then shifts to the employer to produce evidence that its action was taken for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. <em>See Joe\u2019s Stone Crabs, </em>296 F.3d at 1272. \u201cShould the employer meet its burden of production, the presumption of discrimination is rebutted, and the inquiry \u2018proceeds to a new level of specificity,\u2019 in which the plaintiff must show that the proffered reason really is a pretext for unlawful discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1272-73 (quoting <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 255-56, 101 S.Ct. 1089). \u201cAlthough the intermediate burdens of production shift back and forth, the ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the employer intentionally discriminated against the employee remains at all times with the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">The district court found that Appellants did not satisfy their initial burden to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. Again, to do so, a plaintiff must show: (1) she was a member of a protected class; (2) she was qualified for the position; (3) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) she was treated less favorably than a similarly-situated individual outside her protected class. <em>See Maynard, </em>342 F.3d at 1289. The instant appeal concerns only the fourth element of the <em>prima facie </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">\u201cIn determining whether employees are similarly situated for purposes of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case, it is necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>to consider whether the employees are involved in or accused of the same or similar conduct and are disciplined in different ways.\u201d <em>Holifield, </em>115 F.3d at 1562. To show that employees are similarly situated, the plaintiff must establish that the employees are \u201csimilarly situated in all relevant respects.\u201d <em>Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1091 (11th Cir.2004). The comparator must be \u201cnearly identical\u201d to the plaintiff to prevent courts from second-guessing a reasonable decision by the employer. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Here, the district court properly granted summary judgment because Appellants were unable to show that other, non-minority, employees were similarly situated but treated more favorably by their employer, and therefore they could not establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. Following allegations by two employees that McDowell and Sanders had created a hostile work environment, Southern Nuclear conducted an investigation and concluded that both McDowell and Sanders had committed this misconduct, and they were disciplined accordingly. McDowell was subsequently terminated because she failed to improve her attitude, and Sanders was later terminated for job abandonment. The alleged comparators did not participate in any conduct that was considered to create or promote a hostile work environment, and therefore are not similarly situated for purposes of the fourth prong of a <em>prima facie </em>case. Accordingly, Southern Nuclear was entitled to summary judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-6\">. Section 1981 guarantees all individuals \"equal benefit of all laws\u201d regardless of race, and specifically, it protects individuals against employment discrimination based on race. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981(a); <em>see also Johnson v. Ry. Express Agency, Inc., </em>421 U.S. 454, 459, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975). When a litigant asserts claims under both Title VII and \u00a7 1981, the statutes \"have the same requirements of proof and use the same analytical framework.\u201d <em>Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., </em>161 F.3d 1318, 1330 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b679-6\">. We DENY Southern Nuclear\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees, filed pursuant to Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927. Rule 38 provides that \"[i]f a court of appeals determines that an appeal is frivolous, it may, after a separately filed motion or notice from the court and reasonable opportunity to respond, award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.\u201d Under 11th Circuit Rule 28-1(0, a party\u2019s brief must contain a proper statement of facts, which means that it must \"state the facts accurately, those favorable and unfavorable to the party.\u201d Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927, \u201d[a]ny attorney ... who so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy personally the excess costs, expenses, and attorneys\u2019 fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">In <em>Schwartz v. Millon Air, Inc., </em>341 F.3d 1220, 1225 (11th Cir.2003), we held that in order \"to justify an award of sanctions pursuant to section 1927, an attorney must engage in unreasonable and vexatious conduct; this conduct must multiply the proceedings; and the. amount of the sanction cannot exceed the costs occasioned by the objectionable conduct\u201d. <em>See McMahan v. Toto, </em>256 F.3d 1120, 1128 (11th Cir.2001). This Court noted that \"bad faith\u201d is the touchstone of an award of sanctions, and \"La] determination of bad faith is warranted where an attorney knowingly or recklessly pursues a frivolous claim.\" <em>Schwartz, </em>341 F.3d at 1225.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-12\">In this case, Appellants\u2019 conduct does not rise to the level of bad faith and unreasonable and vexatious conduct required by \u00a7 1927 and the case law of this circuit. <em>Schwartz, </em>341 F.3d at 1225. Though their claims failed on summary judgment because they did not present evidence of a proper comparator, McDowell and Sanders filed an appeal challenging this decision based on their belief that two former co-workers were proper comparators. In short, this does not evidence knowingly or recklessly pursuing a frivolous claim. <em>Schwartz, </em>341 F.3d at 1225. Thus, Southern Nuclear is not entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in defending against this suit on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
