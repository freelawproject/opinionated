Citing <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 489, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Niave contends that the three-year supervised release term imposed by the district court for the instant conviction of illegal reentry violated due process because the indictment, which did not allege a prior felony conviction, charged an offense punishable by a maximum supervised release term of one year. Niave concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Towes v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). He contends that the holding of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>has been cast into doubt by the decision in <em>Apprendi. </em>Niave seeks to preserve the issue for possible Supreme Court review. Niave raises no issue with respect to the revocation of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-14\">\u201cThis court has repeatedly rejected arguments like the one made by [Niave] and has held that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding despite <em>Apprendi.\u201d United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED and the district court\u2019s judgment of conviction and order revoking supervised release are AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion for an extension of time within which to file a brief is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b999-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
