Joiner was sentenced to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-27\">On appeal, counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), assert<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>ing there were no meritorious grounds for appeal, but contending Joiner\u2019s sentence is unreasonable because it failed to take into account his personal characteristics and is greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) (2000). Joiner was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but did not do so, and the Government elected not to file a responsive brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">The district court appropriately calculated the advisory guideline range and considered it in conjunction with other relevant factors under the Guidelines and \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432-33 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). Joiner\u2019s 135-month sentence, which is at the lowest end of the applicable guideline range and below the statutory maximum, is therefore presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-65, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the conviction and sentence. ' This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
