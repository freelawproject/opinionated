He does not challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that his civil rights claims could not succeed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 because the defendants were not state actors. He also does not challenge the court\u2019s finding that Adams\u2019s claims of retaliation were conclusional. These issues are thus deemed abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">Adams contends that the district court evinced bias against him by dismissing his lawsuit without holding a trial or an evidentiary hearing. The court\u2019s dismissal of the lawsuit does not evince bias. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994). Because Adams has not shown the existence of a genuine issue of material fact, he cannot establish that the district court erred in failing to hold a trial. <em>See Plaisance v. Phelps, </em>845 F.2d 107, 108 (5th Cir.1988). Adams has failed to \u201cplead \u2018enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litigation, </em>495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-17\">Adams also asserts that the defendants violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7. 2000d, by refusing to treat him. His claims in his original complaint were insufficiently specific to put the court on notice that he was raising a claim under \u00a7 2000d, and the court\u2019s interpretation of his allegation as arising under \u00a7 1983 was appropriate based on the facts Adams presented. <em>See id. </em>Although Adams clarified his intent to raise a \u00a7 2000d claim in his postjudgment motion to reopen the case, we are without jurisdiction to entertain a challenge to that order because Adams failed to file an additional or amended notice of appeal from the denial of that motion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(B)(ii); <em>Taylor v. Johnson, </em>257 F.3d 470, 475 (5th Cir.2001). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>Adams\u2019s \u201cEmergency Motion to Fifth Circuit for Due Process\u201d is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b898-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
