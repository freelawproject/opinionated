For the reasons stated below, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The Act provides, in part, that a juvenile \u201cshall not be proceeded against in any court of the United States\u201d unless the government certifies to the appropriate district court that the offense charged is a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5032. On August 24, 2005, the government filed a one-count juvenile information charging C.A.M. with \u201cconspiracy to participate in a racketeering enterprise.\u201d (J.A. 8) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(d)). Along with the information, the government filed the certification required under \u00a7 5032, certifying that the \u201cracketeering enterprise\u201d was a crime of violence. (J.A. 9). On the same day, the government filed a motion to transfer C.A.M.\u2019s case for adult prosecution. Neither the information nor the certification describe the nature of the racketeering enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">On August 25, 2005, C.A.M. made his initial appearance before a United States Magistrate Judge. On June 14, 2006, the district court granted the government\u2019s motion to transfer. C.A.M. noted a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Jurisdiction over juvenile proceedings in federal court is governed by the Act. In general, a \u201cjuvenile\u201d is one \u201cwho has not attained his eighteenth birthday.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5031.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">Under the Act, a juvenile alleged to have committed a crime of violence may be prosecuted as an adult in federal court if the government certifies to the appropriate district court that \u201cthere is a substantial Federal interest in the case or the offense to warrant the exercise of Federal jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5032. Proper certification under \u00a7 5032 by the government is necessary to create subject matter jurisdiction over a juvenile proceeding. <em>United States v. White, </em>139 F.3d 998, 999-1000 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">The Act does not define crime of violence. However, courts have used the definition of crime of violence set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Doe, </em>49 F.3d 859, 866 (2d Cir.1995) (\u201cSince the JDA itself contains no definition of \u2018crime of violence,\u2019 the district court properly looked to the general definition provisions set out at the start of the Criminal Code.\u201d). Section 16 of Title 18 defines \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as \u201c(a) an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,\u201d or \u201c(b) any other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">In this case, at oral argument, the government conceded that neither the information nor the certification described the nature of the racketeering enterprise. Moreover, the government conceded that some racketeering enterprises can be crimes of violence while others are not. Given these concessions by the government, we conclude that the requirements of \u00a7 5032 were not met in this case. We simply cannot discern from either the information or the certification whether the alleged racketeering enterprise is a crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 16. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order granting the motion to transfer and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. On remand, the government can cure the jurisdictional defect by amending either the information or the certification to ensure that the alleged racketeering enterprise is a crime of violence.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number><footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b222-18\"> In view of our decision that the jurisdictional requirements of \u00a7 5032 were not met, we decline to address the remaining issues raised by C.A.M.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
