The rest of the Appellees had previously been dismissed as defendants by order entered by the district court on May 5, 2005. We will summarily affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-24\">Briggs filed his complaint under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated by cei\u2019tain police department officials, prosecutors, court officials, and his defense attorney when he was arrested in May 2003. While on patrol, Jordan observed the driver of a grey car ignore two traffic lights. He followed the car, but lost sight of it. Soon thereafter, another officer (not named in this suit) radioed that he was pursuing a subject by foot nearby. When Jordan arrived on the scene, he saw the same grey vehicle he had been pursuing and an individual, Briggs, on foot. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>officers ordered Briggs to stop but he refused, and he eventually had to be physically restrained. Briggs was handcuffed and taken to the police station. Two officers received medical attention at the hospital because of injuries sustained in apprehending Briggs.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">After Briggs was taken to the police station, Jordan returned to the car Briggs had been driving and learned that the registration was not only expired, but pertained to another car. Moore searched the vehicle for keys and found a plastic bag containing crack cocaine. Thereafter, police officials secured four warrants for Briggs\u2019 arrest: two counts of aggravated assault on a police officer, one count of resisting arrest, and one count of possession of a controlled substance. Briggs eventually pleaded guilty to one count of resisting arrest in July 2005, and the rest of the charges were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Briggs filed this lawsuit in April 2005, alleging that the police had lacked probable cause to arrest him, and that the police, court officials, prosecutors and his own attorney had conspired against him. The district court dismissed many of the defendants in May 2005, and granted summary judgment to the rest of the defendants in March 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Summary action is warranted when \u201cno substantial question\u201d is presented by the appeal. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4, I.O.P. 10.6; <em>Cradle v. U.S. ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 539 (3d Cir.2002). After reviewing the record, we conclude that there is no substantial question presented and will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal de novo. <em>See Santiago v. GMAC Mortgage Group, Inc., </em>417 F.3d 384, 386 (3d Cir.2005). We find that the district court correctly dismissed Briggs\u2019 claims against the group of defendants dismissed in 2005. The New Jersey Superior Court is not a \u201cperson\u201d capable of being sued under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Will v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 70-71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989). Prosecutors Brennan and Suppa and Judges Apostolou and Kreimann were absolutely immune from suit for damages. <em>See Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 430, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976); <em>Gallas v. Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, </em>211 F.3d 760, 768 (3d Cir.2000). With respect to Kinarney, Briggs\u2019 defense attorney, it is unclear whether he served as a public defender or a private attorney during his representation of Briggs. Regardless, he is not liable in a suit for damages under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Polk County v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 102 S.Ct. 445, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981) (public defenders not liable because they were not acting under color of state law). We also agree that the Asbury Park Police Department should have been dismissed as a defendant, but so find because the department would not be considered separate from the municipality such that it could be sued for the purposes of \u00a7 1983, and even if construed as a claim against the municipality itself, there were certainly no allegations that Briggs\u2019 arrest was made pursuant to a municipal custom or policy. <em>See Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). Similarly, the Monmouth County Prosecutor\u2019s Office is not a separate entity that can be sued under \u00a7 1983. See, <em>e.g., Reitz v. County of Bucks, </em>125 F.3d 139, 148 (3d Cir.1997) (county district attorney\u2019s office not entity for purposes of \u00a7 1983 liability). Even if it were, Briggs did not claim that his allegedly unconstitutional arrest was the result of a municipal custom or policy. <em>See Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">We review the district court\u2019s decision that Jordan, Moore and Green were entitled to qualified immunity under a plenary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>review standard. <em>See Schieber v. City of Phila., </em>320 F.3d 409, 415 (3d Cir.2003). The analysis involves a two-step inquiry: whether the officials\u2019 acts violated a constitutional or statutory right, and if they did, whether that right was clearly established at the time of the violation. <em>See Yarris v. County of Del., </em>465 F.3d 129, 140-41 (3d Cir.2006). Briggs contends that the warrants for his arrest lacked probable cause, but after a careful review of the record, we conclude that he is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The Fourth Amendment prohibits the arrest of a citizen unless it is supported by probable cause. <em>Orsatti v. N.J. State Police, </em>71 F.3d 480, 482 (3d Cir.1995). Of the four warrants sworn out for Briggs\u2019 arrest, all were supported by a statement of probable cause by officers who witnessed Briggs\u2019 unlawful behavior. Jordan personally observed Briggs commit the crimes with which he was charged, and Moore found the crack cocaine in Briggs\u2019 car. Green did not violate Briggs\u2019 rights when she signed the warrants, all containing statements of probable cause where the officers had personally witnessed the crimes. It is also worth noting that since the officers witnessed Briggs commit the offenses, they had the authority under New Jersey law to arrest Briggs before any arrest warrant was issued. See N.J.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2A169-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Briggs claims in his summary judgment opposition that Green\u2019s reference in an interrogatory answer to a \u201csummons\u201d rather than a \u201cwarrant\u201d betrays some violation of his rights. This claim is specious. Again, ample probable cause was presented \u2014 Green did not violate Briggs\u2019 rights by issuing the warrants. Without a violation of a clearly established right, we need inquire no further and the three appellees are entitled to qualified immunity. <em>See Wright v. City of Phila., </em>409 F.3d 595, 600 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">We will summarily affirm the judgment of the district court. The Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss the appeal is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
