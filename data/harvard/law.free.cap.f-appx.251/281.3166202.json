He alleged that he sustained injuries after falling down a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>flight of stairs and contended that the fall was the product of deliberate indifference on the part of the prison officials because they removed his ground floor housing restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">A timely notice of appeal in a civil case is mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 2363-66, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). Jackson did not file a timely notice of appeal from the dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 complaint. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a). Accordingly, Jackson\u2019s appeal of the judgment dismissing his \u00a7 1983 complaint is dismissed for want of jurisdiction. <em>See Bowles, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2366.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Jackson\u2019s notice of appeal was timely with regard to the denial of his Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion. This court reviews the district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>See Warfield v. Byron, </em>436 F.3d 551, 555 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">Jackson argues that the district court erred in denying his Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion which sought an extension of time to file a motion for a new trial. He avers that he was prevented from filing a timely motion for new trial under Fed.R.CivP. 59(e) due to his restricted access to the prison library and his lack of legal knowledge. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Jackson\u2019s Fed. R.CivP. 60(b) motion. A court may not extend the time for filing a FedR.CivP. 59(e) motion. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CivP. 6(b); <em>Hauben v. Harmon, </em>605 F.2d 920, 926 (5th Cir.1979). The judgment denying Jackson\u2019s Fed.R.CivP. 60(b) motion is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Jackson\u2019s complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Jackson is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be allowed to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b307-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
