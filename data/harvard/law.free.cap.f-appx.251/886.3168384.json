The district court granted summary judgment to the employer. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-18\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b913-19\">Plaintiff-Appellant Patricia Dur\u00f3se (\u201cDur\u00f3se\u201d) was hired by Defendant-Appellee Grand Casino of Mississippi, Inc. (\u201cGrand Casino\u201d) in 1992 and ultimately advanced to the position of slot supervisor. Around December 16, 2002, Dur\u00f3se became ill and took leave under the FMLA. She returned to work on February 7, 2003, after using fifty-three days of leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-20\">In early March 2003, Dur\u00f3se sustained an injury outside of work, and her doctor required her to be on leave for at least three weeks. Dur\u00f3se filled out a request for FMLA leave to begin on March 27 and turned the request in to Laura McCool (\u201cMcCool\u201d), a benefits administrator for Grand Casino. McCool created an FMLA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>checklist that indicated that Durose\u2019s maximum return date under the FMLA was April 29, 2003, but that Dur\u00f3se expected to be able to return to work on April 18, 2003. Dur\u00f3se admitted that she was told she had only thirty-two days of FMLA leave remaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">On April 9, 2003, Dur\u00f3se received a note from her physician restricting her from working through April 29, 2003, at which time she had another doctor\u2019s appointment. Dur\u00f3se discussed the matter with McCool and extended her FMLA leave until April 29, 2003. McCool sent a letter to Dur\u00f3se around April 11 or 12 that stated that Durose\u2019s FMLA leave would not expire until May 28, 2003, and that Dur\u00f3se must return to work on May 29, 2003. McCool states that this was a typographical error, as the correct dates were April 28 and April 29, respectively. McCool testified that she spoke with Dur\u00f3se about the letter and explained that the dates were incorrect. Dur\u00f3se did not mention this conversation in her deposition or affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">During the week of April 14, 2003, Du-rose filled out paperwork requesting a personal leave of absence to begin on April 29, 2003, and to last approximately three weeks. Pursuant to Grand Casino\u2019s policy, an employee may request personal leave when her FMLA leave expires, but the leave is granted at the discretion of Grand Casino. Dur\u00f3se testified that she filled out the request for personal leave because McCool told her that her FMLA leave would expire on April 28, 2003. Robert Williams (\u201cWilliams\u201d), Durose\u2019s supervisor, denied Durose\u2019s request for leave. Du-rose\u2019s doctor\u2019s appointment on April 29, 2003 resulted in another three weeks\u2019 restriction of her ability to work. On April 30, 2003, Grand Casino terminated Du-rose\u2019s employment because she \u201cfailed to return from FMLA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">Dur\u00f3se was not released to work by her doctor until June 5, 2003. Dur\u00f3se subsequently applied for Social Security disability benefits, and the Social Security Administration determined that Dur\u00f3se was unable to work as of March 27, 2003 to the present. Dur\u00f3se stated in her deposition in the instant case that she is currently unable to work in any capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">Dur\u00f3se filed suit against Grand Casino in federal district court on November 8, 2004, bringing claims of breach of contract, promissory estoppel, and failure to provide sufficient leave under the FMLA. Following a period of discovery, Grand Casino filed a motion for summary judgment. The district court granted the motion in its entirety and dismissed Durose\u2019s claims. Dur\u00f3se appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and now turn to the merits of our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">We review a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment de novo. <em>Morris v. Equifax Info. Servs., L.L.C., </em>457 F.3d 460, 464 (5th Cir.2006). Summary judgment is appropriate when, after considering the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions on file, and affidavits, \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Bulko v. Morgan Stanley DW, Inc., </em>450 F.3d 622, 624 (5th Cir.2006). A genuine issue of material fact exists when the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-movant. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). When considering a summary judgment motion, the court must take all facts and evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant. <em>United Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Hix</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number><em>son Bros., Inc., </em>453 F.3d 283, 285 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">A. FMLA Leave</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">On appeal, Dur\u00f3se contends that the district court erred when it determined that she had not raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding her claim that she was given insufficient FMLA leave. The FMLA requires an employer to give twelve workweeks of leave during any twelve-month period to an employee who has a serious health condition that prevents her from performing the functions of her job. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2612(a)(1)(D). Du-rose does not dispute on appeal that her twelve weeks of FMLA leave expired on April 28, 2003. The only question is whether McCool\u2019s letter indicating Du-rose\u2019s FMLA leave would not expire until May 28, 2003, somehow extended Durose\u2019s rights under the FMLA. We hold that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">The FMLA permits damages only to those employees whose FMLA rights have been violated. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2617. Here, Grand Casino gave Dur\u00f3se all twelve weeks of leave to which she was entitled under the FMLA. That Grand Casino inadvertently informed Dur\u00f3se that she had more leave under the FMLA does not create a statutory right to extra leave. Such a misstatement may give rise to a cause of action in state law, but it does not give rise to a cause of action under the FMLA. <em>See Kelso v. Corning Cable Sys. Int\u2019l Corp., </em>224 F.Supp.2d 1052, 1056 (W.D.N.C.2002) (\u201cAn overestimate of leave by an officer or agent of an employer covered by the FMLA does not provide the basis for a cause of action under the FMLA.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">This is in accordance with Supreme Court precedent. In <em>Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., </em>535 U.S. 81, 122 S.Ct. 1155, 152 L.Ed.2d 167 (2002), the Court considered a regulation that required an employer to give more than twelve weeks of leave to an employee if the employer failed to notify the employee that her leave was considered FMLA leave. The Court struck down the regulation as inconsistent with the FMLA\u2019s express provisions, because the regulation created a presumption of harm and \u201crelieve[d] employees of the burden of proving any real impairment of their rights and resulting prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90, 122 S.Ct. 1155. Similarly, in this case, extending Durose\u2019s leave under the FMLA solely because of the erroneous letter would relieve Dur\u00f3se of her burden to prove that she was prejudiced in any way by the letter. <em>See Farina v. Compuware Corp., </em>256 F.Supp.2d 1033, 1053-57 (D.Ariz.2003) (relying on <em>Ragsdale </em>and dismissing FMLA claim that arose from the employer\u2019s mistaken letter indicating the employee had more FMLA leave than she did).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">Here, Dur\u00f3se has not shown that she was prejudiced or harmed in any way by McCool\u2019s letter. Dur\u00f3se was able to timely apply for personal leave that would begin on April 29, 2003, after her FMLA leave actually expired. Indeed, Dur\u00f3se testified that she applied for personal leave because McCool told her that her FMLA leave would expire on April 28, 2003. Further, Dur\u00f3se has offered no testimony that she would have come back to work early and in violation of her doctor\u2019s orders had she known that her FMLA leave expired on April 28. Consequently, Dur\u00f3se has not shown that the incorrect letter harmed or prejudiced her in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">This failure to establish harm is what differentiates Durose\u2019s claim from the one considered by this court in <em>Minard v. ITC Deltacom Communications, Inc., </em>447 F.3d 352 (5th Cir.2006), a case on which Dur\u00f3se relies. In <em>Minard, </em>ITC informed Melissa Minard that she was eligible for twelve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>weeks of FMLA leave, which Minard then took. <em>Id. </em>at 354. ITC subsequently discovered that Minard was not an \u201celigible employee\u201d under the FMLA and terminated Minard at the expiration of her leave. <em>Id. </em>The Fifth Circuit considered the effect of ITC\u2019s prior representation concerning Minard\u2019s eligibility for leave under a theory of equitable estoppel. <em>Id. </em>at 358-59. The court held that Minard had created a fact issue regarding whether she detrimentally relied on ITC\u2019s statement because she testified that had she known she was not eligible for FMLA leave, she would have pursued other options for her medical condition that would not have required leave. <em>Id. </em>at 359. Here, again, Dur\u00f3se has offered no testimony that she would have cut her leave short and come back to work in violation of her doctor\u2019s orders had she known that her leave ended on April 28, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Consequently, Dur\u00f3se has failed to establish an FMLA violation because it is undisputed that she was given all the leave required by the FMLA and she has not presented any evidence that she detrimentally relied on MeCool\u2019s letter indicating that Dur\u00f3se had more leave available. Therefore, we affirm that portion of the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing Du-rose\u2019s FMLA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">B. Breach of Contract and Promissory Estoppel</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">Dur\u00f3se also argues that the district court erred by dismissing her breach of contract and promissory estoppel claims. To establish these claims, Dur\u00f3se again relies on the letter from McCool which erroneously stated her FMLA leave would not expire until May 28,2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">With respect to her breach of contract claim, the district court ruled that, even if McCool\u2019s letter created an enforceable promise, Dur\u00f3se did not show that she could have returned to work on May 29, 2003. Dur\u00f3se has not challenged this finding on appeal. Instead, the only evidence before the court is that Dur\u00f3se was not released by her doctor to work until June 5, 2003, and that the Social Security Administration subsequently found her disabled beginning on March 27, 2003. Although the Social Security Administration\u2019s finding is not necessarily binding on us, <em>see Cleveland v. Policy Management Systems Corp., </em>526 U.S. 795, 807, 119 S.Ct. 1597, 143 L.Ed.2d 966 (1999), Dur\u00f3se has presented no evidence to refute Grand Casino\u2019s evidence that Dur\u00f3se could not return to work in May and, in fact, has never been able to return to work. Therefore, Dur\u00f3se has not created a genuine issue of material fact that she could perform the alleged contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">The same holds true for Durose\u2019s promissory estoppel claim. Under Mississippi law, the doctrine of promissory estoppel provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-10\">an estoppel may arise from the making of a promise, even though without consideration, if it was intended that the promise should be relied upon and in fact it was relied upon, and if a refusal to enforce it would be virtually to sanction the perpetuation of fraud or would result in other injustice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-11\"><em>Serv. Elec. Supply Co. v. Hazlehurst Lumber Co., </em>932 So.2d 863, 870 (Miss.App.2006) (quoting <em>C.E. Frazier Constr. Co. v. Campbell Roofing &amp; Metal Works, Inc., </em>373 So.2d 1036, 1038 (Miss.1979)). Significantly, there must be reliance by the plaintiff on the defendant\u2019s alleged promise before a cause of action will arise. As noted above, there is no evidence that Dur\u00f3se \u201crelied\u201d on McCool\u2019s incorrect statement regarding Durose\u2019s FMLA leave. Dur\u00f3se timely applied for the appropriate personal leave and there is no evidence that Dur\u00f3se <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>was able to come back to work even after May 28, 2003. As a result, she has failed to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding an essential element of her promissory estoppel claim, and the district court correctly dismissed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Because the district court did not err in determining that Dur\u00f3se failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding her claims in this case, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b913-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
