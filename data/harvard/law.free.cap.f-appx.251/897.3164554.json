The Government seeks to enforce Pruett\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">Our review of the record shows that Pruett\u2019s appeal waiver was knowing and voluntary and that, under the plain language of the plea agreement, the waiver applies to the circumstances at hand. <em>See United States v. Burns, </em>433 F.3d 442, 445-46 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746 (5th Cir.2005). Pruett\u2019s argument that his claims should be reviewed for a manifest miscarriage of justice in spite of the appeal waiver lacks merit. Accordingly, Pruett\u2019s appeal waiver bars review of the issues he seeks to raise on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-16\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the Government\u2019s motions to dismiss and for an extension of time are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b924-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
