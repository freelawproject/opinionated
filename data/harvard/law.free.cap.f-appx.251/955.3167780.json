Ramirez argues that his sentence, which is within the applicable sentencing guideline range, is inherently unreasonable under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), due to the disparate sentences imposed under the United States Sentencing Guidelines for offenses involving cocaine base and powder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>cocaine. Ramirez concedes that his argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Leatch, </em>482 F.3d 790, 791-92 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(June 21, 2007) (No. 06-12046); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554-55 (5th Cir.2006). Although Ramirez does not otherwise challenge the advisory Guidelines applicable to his sentence, he argues that his sentence is not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. This issue is also foreclosed as the Supreme Court has affirmed that a sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-68, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b981-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
