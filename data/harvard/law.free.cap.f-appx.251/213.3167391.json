Upon Heard\u2019s untimely death as a result of being struck by a crane manufactured by National Crane, Kirby brought suit, asserting strict products liability and negligence claims. After losing at trial, Kirby moved for a new trial. The district court denied Kirby\u2019s motion, and that denial forms another basis for Kirby\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-27\">We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Kirby\u2019s arguments on appeal stem from her contention that the district court improperly permitted National Crane\u2019s expert toxicologist to present undisclosed expert testimony regarding the source of methamphetamine discovered in Heard\u2019s bloodstream. The challenged testimony, however, had no bearing on the jury\u2019s findings that there was no defect in National Crane\u2019s manufacture of the crane and that National Crane had not been negligent. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We also affirm the denial of Kirby\u2019s motion for a new trial for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Kirby v. National </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number><em>Crane Corp., </em>No. 1:04-cv-21943-MBS (D.S.C., Dec. 14, 2005 &amp; Sept. 12, 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
