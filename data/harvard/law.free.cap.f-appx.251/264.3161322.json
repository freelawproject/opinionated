Morales was sentenced by the district court to sixty-three months\u2019 imprisonment. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-12\">On appeal, Morales contends the district court erred in denying him a two-level decrease under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3E1.1 (2005). Morales asserts that he demonstrated his acceptance of responsibility by admitting his guilt \u201cat least four times\u201d and discussing relevant conduct beyond the charged offense. He maintains that the only testimony supporting the district court\u2019s determination was that of the probation officer, and argues that the \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d in his presentence interview was \u201cdue to a language barrier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-14\">When reviewing the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines, we review findings of fact for clear error and questions of law de novo. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). Section 3E1.1(a) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a two-level decrease to the offense level if a defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility. \u201cHowever, a defendant who falsely denies, or frivolously contests, relevant conduct that the court determines to be trae has acted in a manner inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.1(a)). Because \u201c[t] he sentencing judge is in a unique position to evaluate a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility,\u201d his determinations are \u201centitled to great deference on review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at comment, (n.5).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-17\">The probation officer testified that it is her practice to ask open-ended questions when interviewing defendants. Specifically, she asks defendants \u201cto tell [her] in their own words what occurred, what brought them to the place that they\u2019re in, to the indictment that they have in the current case.\u201d Morales\u2019s responses to these open-ended questions were inconsistent with the evidence proffered by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-18\">After hearing testimony from Morales, the probation officer, and the interpreter who was present during the presentence interview, the district court stated that it was \u201cpersuaded\u201d by the fact that the probation officer \u201cask[ed] very open-ended, non-leading questions as a part of her practice to give the defendant an opportunity to make a statement with regard to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>his role in the offense and acceptance of responsibility.\u201d The court determined that rather than truthfully discussing the offense, Morales responded with false or incomplete information that was intended to minimize his culpability. Though Morales attempts to explain his inaccurate answers by referencing his limited ability to speak and understand English, this explanation is belied by the fact that the questions were open-ended and thus did not require specific answers. Moreover, the probation officer testified that the interpreter\u2019s services were used when Morales appeared confused.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Under these circumstances, we conclude the district court\u2019s findings of fact were not clearly erroneous. To the extent Morales challenges the probation officer\u2019s testimony, witness credibility is solely within the province of the factfinder and will not be reassessed on appeal. <em>See United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1989). Thus, because the district court properly calculated and considered the advisory guideline range and weighed the relevant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000) factors, we conclude Morales\u2019s sixty-three month sentence, which was below the statutory maximum and no greater than the advisory guideline range, is reasonable. <em>See Green, </em>436 F.3d at 457; <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-65, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
