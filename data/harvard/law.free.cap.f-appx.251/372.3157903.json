Figueroa-Salas\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the district court erred in sentencing Figueroa-Salas to 73 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">We review a sentence for reasonableness, and a sentence within the correctly calculated Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Lincoln, </em>413 F.3d 716, 717-18 (8th Cir.2005); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (approving presumption). We conclude that Figueroa-Salas\u2019s sentence is not unreasonable, as nothing in the record suggests the district court based the sentence on an improper or irrelevant factor, failed to consider a relevant factor, or made a clear error of judgment in weighing appropriate factors. <em>See United States v. Haack, </em>403 F.3d 997, 1004 (8th Cir.2005) (reasonableness of sentence reviewed for abuse of discretion; defining ways in which abuse of discretion may occur).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Having reviewed the record under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw on condition that counsel inform appellant about the procedures for filing petitions for rehearing and for certiorari.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b398-18\">.
