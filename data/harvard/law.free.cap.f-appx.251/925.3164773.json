Cadenas contends that the district court erred in imposing a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) because his prior Texas conviction for aggravated assault is not a crime of violence under the Sentencing Guidelines. The Texas statute, Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 22.02, is substantially similar to the definition of \u201caggravated assault\u201d under the Model Penal Code and thus qualifies as the enumerated offense of \u201caggravated assault\u201d under the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Guillen-Alvarez, </em>489 F.3d 197, 199-201 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-23\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Cadenas challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This court has held that this issue is \u201cfully foreclosed from further debate.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Aug. 28, 2007)(No. 07-6202). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b951-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
