Olivarez is serving 35-year sentences on convictions for aggravated assault and burglary of a habitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-20\">After Olivarez had filed a notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 2254 petition, Olivarez filed a motion pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). The district court granted this motion and reinstated Olivarez\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-21\">The district court was without jurisdiction to grant Olivarez post judgnent relief because Olivarez\u2019s notice of appeal divested the district court of such jurisdiction. <em>See Shepherd v. Int\u2019l Paper Co., </em>372 F.3d 326, 329 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Winchester v. United States Atty. for S.D. of Tex., </em>68 F.3d 947, 950 (5th Cir.1995). Olivarez has thus demonstrated that reasonable jurists <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>would debate the correctness of the district court\u2019s procedural ruling. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Olivarez\u2019s district court pleadings and his COA motion demonstrate facially that reasonable jurists could debate whether Olivarez has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See Houser v. Dretke, </em>395 F.3d 560, 561-62 (5th Cir.2004). Accordingly, a COA is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The district court\u2019s grant of post judgment relief is construed as a request for leave from this court for a remand and to grant such relief. <em>See Shepherd, </em>372 F.3d at 329. Accordingly, the request is GRANTED; the case is REMANDED to the district court for re-entry of the judgment reinstating Olivarez\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition, and for further proceedings as are necessary. <em>See Willie v. Continental Oil Co., </em>746 F.2d 1041, 1046 (5th Cir.1984), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>784 F.2d 706 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b322-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
