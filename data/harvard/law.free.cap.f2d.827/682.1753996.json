On April 7, 1987, the Government filed a motion requesting that the court compel Lehder to sign a waiver, authorizing the Bahamas Office of the Bank of Nova Scotia to produce to the district court all documents described in an accompanying subpoena along with any relevant information. The proposed waiver included a statement that it had been executed pursuant to a court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">Lehder objected to the waiver, claiming that his execution of it would violate his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination, and that the Government had shown no need for the waiver. The magistrate, although sympathetic to Lehder\u2019s arguments, granted the Government\u2019s request under the authority of <em>United States v. Ghidoni, </em>732 F.2d 814 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 932, 105 S.Ct. 328, 83 L.Ed.2d 264 (1984). The magistrate modified the waiver by adding a statement that it was being signed over Lehder\u2019s objections and ordered him to sign it by May 5, 1987. Lehder refused, and has continued to refuse, to sign the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-12\">On May 27, 1987, the district court affirmed the magistrate\u2019s order. In a separate order issued on the same day, the court found Lehder in contempt of court for failing to execute the waiver. The court imposed a fine of five hundred dollars for each day that Lehder failed to comply with the order, beginning on May 28, 1987, the day after entry of the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-13\">Lehder now appeals the order of contempt, making the same arguments as he raised below. Because he appeals a final order of the district court, we have jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1982). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-14\">Lehder\u2019s primary argument is that this court erred in <em>Ghidoni </em>when it upheld a waiver order substantially the same as that at issue here. Lehder, however, has pointed to no case from the Supreme Court or this circuit that calls into doubt the continuing validity of <em>Ghidoni. </em>Thus, even if we were to disagree with <em>Ghidoni, </em>we would be bound by its holding. <em>See Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc). Nor are we swayed by any of the decisions of other circuits that Lehder cites. First, we adhere to our conclusion in <em>Ghidoni </em>that the waiver would not admit the existence of the described accounts or transactions, or Lehder\u2019s control over them, but merely would authorize the bank to release such information if it believes (wrongly, in Lehder\u2019s view) that Lehder\u2019s permission is necessary. Thus, we are unconvinced by the contrary conclusion reached by the First Circuit in <em>In re Grand Jury Proceedings (Ranauro), </em>814 F.2d 791, 795-96 (1st Cir.1987) (per curiam). As to Lehder\u2019s request that we reevaluate <em>Ghidoni </em>in light of <em>In re N.D.N. Y. Grand Jury Subpoena #86-0351-8, </em>811 F.2d 114 (2d Cir.1987), we must admit that we are mystified. In that case, the Second Circuit cited <em>Ghidoni </em>favorably, and decided against the defendant on his fifth amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-15\">Lehder\u2019s remaining arguments in opposition to the order of contempt also lack substance. First, the mere fact that the subpoena accompanying the waiver men<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>tions specific items does not distinguish this case from <em>Ghidoni. </em>Regardless whether the waiver and subpoena specify which records the bank must produce, Lehder would not be admitting that such records exist, but would rather be consenting to their production <em>if they </em>exist. Thus, Lehder\u2019s act would not be testimonial. Second, Lehder contends that the Government has failed to show that it needs the waiver. We find no support for Lehder\u2019s contention that a showing of sufficient need is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
