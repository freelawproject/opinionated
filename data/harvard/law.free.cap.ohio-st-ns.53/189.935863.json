The defendant denies the allegations and each thereof contained in paragraphs 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 of the petition and the defendant denies that the plaintiff on and prior to the 24th day of March, 1863, or at any time was, or is, the owner in fee of the real estate, or any part of the real estate mentioned in the petition; but, on the contrary, says that the plaintiff has not, and never had, any interest or estate therein, except the right to use and occupy a portion thereof for canal purposes; that no compensation was ever paid therefor by the plaintiff, and that no title in any of - said real estate was ever conveyed to the plaintiff, or otherwise acquired by it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-10\">\u00a3\u00a32. About the year 1833 the Miami and Erie Canal which had been constructed southwardly to a point at or near Broadway, in the city of Cincinnati, was extended to the Ohio river. But by reason of the great fall, said extension was found to be impracticable; it was used for navigation a short time only, and under great difficulties, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>was gradually abandoned and fell into decay. There were nine locks of eleven feet fall each, between Broadway and the river, making a total fall of ninety-nine feet. For ten years or more prior to the passage of the act of March 24, 1863, mentioned in the -petition, said canal between Broadway and the river had become, and was wholly abandoned for purposes of navigation, and was used only for supplying water for milling purposes and for the discharge and carriage of sewage from certain portions of the city of Cincinnati, largely from slaughter houses located along the side of the canal and Deer creek, which adjoined the canal. And said act of March 24, 1863, was passed for the purpose of securing an abatement of the public nuisance which had been so created and was existing, and of providing a trunk sewer' at the only available\u2019site therefor in the eastern part of the city of Cincinnati. And the defendant says that all the reservations and conditions in said grant in favor of the plaintiff have been carefully preserved and fulfilled, \u2022 that ample provision is made for the flow of the water of the' canal, and for the maintenance of the supply of water for milling purposes. ' At the time of the passage of the ordinance of the city of Cincinnati of December 1, 1871, mentioned in the petition, the city of Cincinnati had constructed a trunk sewer along the site of the canal from Broadway to the river; but had not filled in over such sewer south of Pearl street, and the top of said sewer lay at a distance about forty feet below the grade of Pearl street, leaving a gully about forty feet deep and seventy feet or more in width at the top. There was a wharf and landing at Butler street and immediately west of Butler street, but there was not, and never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>had been., any landing at or near the mouth of the canal, and that having become the mouth of said trunk sewer, any use of the river at that point, for a landing, was wholly impracticable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-6\">\u201c3. There was not and never had been any occasion for highway communication between Pearl street and the river along the course of said gully; the Newport and Cincinnati bridge, however, was then being constructed across the Ohio river so as to enter Cincinnati with its approach at Butler street, which street extended from the river northwardly to and across Pearl street, and lay \u2014 feet west of the line of Eggleston avenue. Said Butler street was of sufficient width to furnish proper and commodious access to said bridge; and said ordinance of December 1, 1871, was passed for the purpose of securing and providing highway facilities at. that point, where they were needed, in exchange for the gully along the site of Eggleston avenue south of Pearl street, where no highway facilities were required. The real estate for the widening of Butler street was provided by joint arrangement between the Bridge Company and the Railway Company, and at their joint expense and at great cost, it being then occupied by improvements consisting of factories and other buildings, which it became necessary for the Railway and Bridge Companies to acquire by purchase at heavy expense. And the value of the property \u2022 at that time, contributed by the Railroad and Bridge Companies to the widening- and improvement of Butler street was threefold the value of the premises given to them in exchange.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-7\">\u201c4. Thereupon the Railway Company and the Bridge Company having accepted said ordinance of December 1, 1871, as alleged in the petition, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>their own expense did widen and improve Butler street, as provided in said ordinance, and entered into possession of that portion of Eggleston avenue lying between Pearl street and Front street, and they have ever since continuously used and occupied the same for railroad iDurposes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-4\"><em>\u201c5. </em>Said arrangement and agreement with the said Railway and Bridge Companies was one which the city and the companies were authorized by law to make, and was for the great benefit and advantage of the city and the public, as well as of said Railway and Bridge Companies, as servants of the public.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-5\"><em>\u201c6. </em>The Railway Company on the faith of said ordinance and agreement with the city of Cincinnati, filled up said gully south of Pearl street, and at great expense acquired the real estate between Butler and Kilgour streets and Pearl and Front streets; and in good faith constructed thereon the railroad tracks, train sheds, passenger depot and f reig\u2019ht depot, mentioned in the petition, and other terminal facilities at a cost of four hundred thousand dollars, in addition to .the cost of the real estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-6\"><em>\u201c7. </em>In addition to the expenditures aforesaid, and relying upon their right to occupy and use said premises the Little Miami Railroad Company and its lessee purchased large quantities of real estate near said depot grounds and hav\u00e9 constructed at a great expense thereon, and connected with said depot buildings, terminal tracks and facilities. If the order asked for in the petition is granted and the defendant compelled to remove its freight and passenger depot buildings and tracks from said premises between Pearl street and Front street the result to the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>ants possessions and property will be the absolute destruction of the new freight depot and of the tracks and train sheds leading into the passenger depot, located at the corner of Butler and Pearl streets, and thus render the passenger depot practically inaccessible and the entire destruction of its whole terminal plant and the demolition and ruin of the structures, buildings and terminal arrangements upon which the defendant has expended such large sums of money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-6\">\u201c8.

As to that portion of Eggleston avenue between Pearl street and Broadway, the defendant says that the use by it of said portion is simply the maintaining a single track thereon, four feet nine inches in width, from rail to rail, with connecting tracks leading into the property of abutting owners \u2014 and that its occupation and use of said portion of said street is only the use provided for by the laws of the state \u2014 and such a use of a street as has been repeatedly sanctioned and upheld by the adjudications of this court and is wholly consistent with the purposes of the said act of March 24. 1863, and the deed made in pursuance thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-8\">\u201c10. The said Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and St. Louis Railway Company built said track under and pursuant to a grant by the city of Cincinnati, in good faith and relying upon the authority and power conferred by the statutes of the state upon municipal corporations in such matters; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>has expended in the purchase of grounds for its yards and upon its said tracks and its yards at the head of Eggleston avenue, the sum of over one hundred thousand dollars. Said grant by said city was within its municipal power and was duly and legally made, and was accepted and acted upon by said Railway Company in the belief that it conferred the right upon said company to occupy and use said street for said purpose, and in the same good faith, reliance and belief, a number of owners of property abutting on said portion of Eggleston avenue have built factories and warehouses on their premises, and the Railway Company has put in side tracks or switches connecting therewith, which have ever since been in use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-5\">\u201c11.

On November 7, 1884, the city council of Cincinnati, by joint resolution, ordered the city officers to remove said track in Eggleston avenue, from Pearl to Court street or Broadway. The said Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and St. Louis Railway Company duly brought an action in the Superior Court against the city of Cincinnati, on the 8th day of November, 1884, to enjoin the city from taking action for such removal, and the city filed a cross-petition, praying- that the Railway Company be perpetually enjoined from maintaining or using said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>tracks. The said court in general term held in said action that the city had by law, authority to consent to the laying of said railroad track by said company in Eggleston avenue, and branches-thereof to private property \u2014 that the city had duly consented thereto and entered a decree, which is in full force, in favor of said Railroad Company, forever enjoining said city from making said removal, and dismissing the cross petition, (16 Law Bull., 367). The city of Cincinnati prosecuted error to this court, and this court affirmed said decree November 18, 1890. A part of said factories and warehouses and tracks connecting with the same have been built since the entering of said decree by said Superior Court. Said Eggleston avenue, between Pearl street and Broadway, is ninety feet wide, and said railroad track is, from rail to rail, four feet and nine inches wide, and does not interfere with the free use of said avenue by the public, and said portion of Eggleston avenue is now being used, and ever since said track was laid has been used, strictly in conformity with the provisions-specified in said act of March 24, 1863, and said deed, to-wit: as a public highway and for sewerage purposes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-6\">\u201c13.

The state is still the owner in fee.of this land, subject to the easements granted the city by said act, and not abandoned by it. Section 8, of the act of February 4, 1825, 23 O. L., 56; <em>State ex rel. </em>v. <em>Railway Company, </em>37 Ohio St., 157; <em>Jones </em>v. Tatham, 20 Pa. St., 398; <em>State </em>v. <em>Garland, </em>7 Ired., 49; Delaware Railroad Tax Case, 18 Wall., 206. The act of March 24, 1863, grants to the city of Cincinnati \u201cauthority and permission to enter upon, improve and occupy forever \u00e1s a public highway, and for sewerage purposes,\u201d the part of the canal mentioned. The grant was to be made subject to all outstanding rights or claims with which it might conflict.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-12\">The revenues derived by the state from the water privileges in the canal were expressly reserved, and the city, in the use of the canal, was not to obstruct the flow of water, nor injure its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>supply for milling purposes. The city, by its council, having decided to use said canal as authorized by the act, notified the governor, who, on the 28th of April, 1863, executed a grant to the city of the part of the canal named, to enter upon, improve and occupy the same forever as a public highway, and for sewerage purposes. Plainly, this was not a grant of the fee in this canal property. It was a grant of an easement \u2014 a perpetual easement, if you please, in the land; a grant of the right to use the land for specific purposes, to wit: for a public highway, and for sewerage purposes. The ownership of the fee remained in the state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-5\">II. The city of Cincinnati having been g-ranted only a clearly defined easement in this land, could not, without the consent of the state, change or enlarge the public use, and thus confer additional privileges in and impose additional burdens on land owned by the state. While such change of use might not work an abandonment of the easement, it could only be made subject to the rights of the state, which rights the state might at any time assert. <em>Chagrin Falls, etc., Plank Road Company </em>v. <em>Cane, </em>2 Ohio St., 419; <em>Street Railway Company </em>v. <em>Cwmminsville, </em>14 Ohio St., 523; Hatch Case, 18 Ohio St., 92; <em>State </em>v. Laverick, 34 N. J. L., 202; <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Camden &amp; Atlantic Railroad, </em>4 Zab., 592; <em>Railway Company </em>v. <em>Hartley, </em>67 Ill., 439; <em>Railroad Company </em>v. <em>Schurmeir, </em>7 Wall., 272; <em>Hickok </em>v. <em>Hine, </em>23 Ohio St., 523.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-6\">III. As to the part of the canal from Pearl street to the river, the easement the city acquired to use this portion for a public highway, has been either vacated or abandoned, and in either event surrendered and extinguished, and, without consent to the state, the land of the state has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>devoted to uses inconsistent with and destructive of its use as a public highway. Subject to the right of the city to maintain its sewer, the state has now the same dominion over this land that it had before the grant of 1863.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-6\">Even without a formal vacation, a public easement of a city in a street may be lost by the city allowing a use of the ground inconsistent with its use as a street. Such was the situation in the case of <em>Barney </em>v. Keokuk, 94 U. S., 324; Grand Rapids Street Railway, 48 Mich., 433; <em>Detroit Street Railway </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>85Mich., 634; <em>Street Railway </em>v. <em>Cumminsville, </em>14 Ohio St., 548.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-7\">IV. <em>Quo warranto </em>is the proper remedy to vindicate the rights of the state in this land, and oust the Railroad company from its franchises, privileges and rights which it exercises, in controvention of law, in occupying and using this state land for railroad purposes, without authority from the state. The other side say: \u201cWhat you are really trying to do, is to recover possession of land from us; to do this, you must sue in ejectment.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-8\">What the state is really trying to do, is not to recover possession of land; it is trying to determine by what authority this Railroad company is occupying\u2019 and using-, in the manner described, land belonging to the state; and it is seeking to oust the Railroad company from franchises and privileges which it is exercising in, and on land of the state, in contravention of law.- It is not the land we are after, but the Railroad company. <em>State ex rel. </em>v. <em>Railroad </em>Company, 36 Ohio St., 434; <em>State ex rel. </em>v. <em>Railway </em>Company, 29 W. L. B., 290; <em>People ex rel. </em>v. <em>Turnpike </em>Company, 2 Johns., 190; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Turnpike </em>Company, 153 Pa. St., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>47; <em>Darley </em>v. <em>The Queen. </em>12; Clark and Finnelley, 520.</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-5\">V. No statute of limitations or estoppel <em>in pais </em>stands in the way of the maintenance of this action. <em>Ohio ex rel. </em>v. <em>Board of Public Works, </em>36 Ohio St., 409; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pawtucket Turnpike Company, </em>8 Rhode Island, 524; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Wardroper, </em>4 Burr., 1963; <em>Railroad Company </em>v. <em>Commissioners of Greene County, </em>31 Ohio St., 338.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-6\">One defense is that the defendant has been in actual, continuous, and adverse possession of the land, under a claim of title, for over forty years. It is a plea of the statute of limitations. There is no merit in this defense. There is no better settled rule than this, that the bar of the statute of limitations cannot defeat a claim in favor of the state, unless the state is introduced merely as a formal party, and the real remedy sought in its name is but the enforcement of a private right. <em>Booth </em>v. <em>U. S., </em>2 G. &amp; J., 273; <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Beebe, </em>127 U. S., 338; <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Insley, </em>130 U. S., 263; <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Des Moines, </em>142 U.

D., 314; 2 Pomeroy\u2019s Eq., section 917.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-8\">To constitute a defense it must have all the essential elements of an estoppel. Acquiescence which does not come up to this measure, cannot deprive a person of his legal rights. <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Watts, </em>25 Ch. D., <em>585; Menendez v. Holt, </em>128 U. S., 524; <em>Lamotte v. Wisner, </em>51 Md., 561. . The general rule is that a sovereign\u2019s claim cannot be defeated by estoppel. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>U.

S., 433.</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-9\">Another element of estoppel is either fraud or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>its equivalent, in culpable negligence. If it was negligence, it must have been the proximate cause of the loss, and the neglect must have been of some duty which was owing to the party misled, or to the public. <em>Leather Mfrs.

Foraker.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-7\">The court will observe that we do not complain alone of the placing of the tracks, and the operation of cars over them, between Broadway and Pearl street. If the whole property from Broadway to the Ohio river had been filled, graded, improved and opened for highway purposes, we should not probably have a right to complain of the use of the whole, or a part of it, for tracks, and the passing of cars over them, in view of the decisions in Hatch\u2019s Case, 18 Ohio St., 92; <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Toledo, </em>28 Ohio St., 643, and <em>Richards </em>v. <em>The </em>City, 31 Ohio St., 506; although these cases do not go further, in so far as they are applicable, than to hold that it is within the power of the legislature to authorize a change of the use of property acquired by the state for a public use, from one kind of public use to another of a like kind. ' It was the change of a canal to a railroad in Hatch\u2019s case, and the change of a [canal to a street in the Malone case, and the occupation of a street with railroad tracks in the Richards case. What we claim, therefore, is assuming the deed from the Governor to be valid, that the property was turned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>over to the city and accepted as an entirety; and that it was not competent for the city to vacate or abandon, and allow to be wholly obstructed and diverted to other purposes than those expressed in the deed, any portion of the same; and that because it did so, without authority and in violation of the limitations expressed, the alleged rights and privileges of the defendant, which it claims and has exercised, are in contravention of law as to the whole of the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-5\">When the state gave the whole property for an expressed use, the city was bound to devote the whole of it to that use. It could not give away a part of it to be used in a manner inconsistent with the use for which it took it, and estop the state to right the wrong as to that or any other portion of it. The city, by its violation of the trust, opened the way for the state to oust the defendant, who took the benefit of that violation, from all rights acquired from the city; especially when the defendant took with notice. <em>Barclay </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>6 Peters, 507; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Presbyterian </em>Society, 1 Ohio St., 497; Second Washburn on Real Property, page 17, Sec. 15, Chapter 14.</p>\n<p data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-6\">The state never parted with any interest of any kind in this property, and, therefore, has a fee simple proprietary interest in the premises in controversy. <em>The State ex rel. v. </em>City, 20 Ohio St., 18; <em>The State ex rel. </em>v.

B., 367.</p>\n<p data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-7\">We have a case, therefore, where the state is the owner, not simply of an interest in, but of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>the fee of real estate with respect to \u25a0 which the defendant, a corporation, created by the state, is holding' and claiming rights and privileges unauthorized by and in contravention of law. Can <em>quo warranto </em>be brought in such a case? <em>State ex rel. </em>v. <em>Shields et al., </em>56 Ind., 521; <em>People ex rel. </em>v. <em>Mutual Gas Light Company, </em>38 Mich., 154; West, 64 Pa.

The state has done nothing to estop it, except to allow time to run. It has taken no compensation. It has not misrepresented anything It has not induced any .expenditures of money by the defendant. It has not misled the defendant, nor caused any change of situation of any mind to the disadvantage of the defendant. It would seem an appropriate instance in which to apply the maxim <em>nullum tempus occurit regi.

The defendant invokes the application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel ag\u2019ainst the state. Our contention is, that the petition does hot show such facts as will justify the application of this principle against the sovereignty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-9\">Three propositions will be considered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-10\"><em>First </em>\u2014 There were no state officers whose duty it was to know that the railroad company was erecting its depots and laying its tracks on the lands of the state, and consequently estoppel could not apply.</p>\n<p data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>It is essential to the doctrine of estoppel, as applied to sovereignty, that some officer or agent of the government should have official knowledge of the misconduct complained of. In the present ease there was no such officer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-5\"><em>Second </em>\u2014 In order to estop the state, the defendant must show that its officers knew the railroad company was erecting its depots and laying its tracks, as averred in the petition, and that such officers acquiesced in such conduct in their official capacity. 94 U. S., 324.</p>\n<p data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-6\">The defendant could not, we insist, violate the condition of the grant from the state to the city,, and then seek to charge the state with notice of such violation. A party cannot knowingly commit a wrong and then plead estoppel against one who complains of his conduct. Conduct and knowledge are necessary and absolutely essential elements in the doctrine of equitable estoppel. Bigelow on Estoppel, 484; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, 437.</p>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-7\">The defendant must show that it was the statutory duty of some officer of the state to know that the company was constructing its depots, and laying its tracks so as to destroy said avenue for highway purposes, and that such officer actually had official knowledge to that effect, and that he permitted the laying of the tracks and the construction of its depots by the company without objection. Such, knowledge on the part of the state\u2019s officers cannot be presumed. It must be shown to have existed. The mere fact that they might have known but did not act on it is not sufficient. Negligence on the part of an official will not be presumed. <em>U. S. </em>v. Kilpatrick, 9 Wheaton, 735; 64 Ala., 287; Mechem on Public Officer, Sec. 579; <em>Sturgeon </em>v.

The question is not whether the defendant company is unlawfully exercising a franchise derived from the state, but by what right it has built its depots upon and holds possession of certain lands.

L. B., 293. The only authority we have been able to find that even appears to sustain the view that the title of real estate may be determined in a <em>quo wa/rranto </em>proceeding is the case of <em>The State </em>v. Shields, 56 Ind., 528. It is by virtue of express provision warranted by the constitution that in Indiana the state may recover es-cheated and forfeited lands by a proceeding\u2019 in <em>quo wa/rranto. </em>This cas\u00e9is, therefore, not an authority in point. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hannibal &amp; Ralls </em>Co., 37 Mo.

The railway company is empowered to hold land for its depot grounds. The inquiry here is by what right it holds certain premises.

Revised Statutes, section 6789.</p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-7\">There are three distinct situations disclosed by the petition:</p>\n<p data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-8\"><em>First </em>\u2014 The part of Eggleston avenue between Pearl street and Broadway.</p>\n<p data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-9\"><em>Second </em>\u2014 The part between Pearl and Front streets.</p>\n<p data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-10\"><em>Third, </em>\u2014 The part between Front street and the Ohio river.</p>\n<p data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-11\">We maintain that if any cause of action can be found in the petition it is in that part that relates, to the portion of the canal ground lying between Pearl and Front streets; that there is nothing whatever shown that will authorize the court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>call upon the defendant to show by what warrant it occupies with its track the street called Eggleston avenue between Broadway and Pearl and between Front street and the river. As to these (the first and third situations referred to above), the allegations are as follows, to wit: That the .legislature authorized the grant of that part of the canal to the city of Cincinnati \u201cto enter upon, improve and occupy forever as a public highway and for sewerage purposesthat the grant was accordingly made by the Governor, April 23, 1863; that the city accepted the grant, and in pursuance thereof, entered upon that part of the canal, established Eggleston avenue over it and improved and occupied it in the manner and to the extent set forth in paragraph 7; that on November 15, 1867, the city granted to the Little Miami Railroad Company the right to lay down and use \u2022 a railroad track on Eggleston avenue from Pearl street to Broadway, and in the year 1876 the Pittsburg, Cincinnati and St. Louis Railway Company, lessee of the Little Miami Railroad, built said track thereon, and it and the defendant company have ever since used the same for railroad purposes. These allegations cover the first situation above referred to, and as to the third, to-wit, that portion 'between Front street and the river the allegation of fact relating to it are found in the 12th paragraph of the petition \u2014 being- in substance that that part was taken possession of some years ago, and since then and for a longtime has been and is now occupied wholly by the yard tracks, side tracks and switches of the Pittsburg, Cincinnati and St. Louis Railway Company and the. defendant company, and for a long time has been and now is used exclusively by said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>companies for railroad purposes, the city having abandoned the use of the street as a highway (although the sewer still remains), and that by reason of such use and occupation it had become and is impossible to use the premises for a public highway.</p>\n<p data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-6\">For the purposes of this branch of the demurrer we may consider, therefore, only the allegations respecting the second portion or subdivision of Eggleston avenue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-7\">The state has no proprietary interest in the premises in controversy. The property has not reverted to the state, and the' averments show no right or interest in the state to or in the premises. A grant of these iands forever was duly made to the city of Cincinnati. No fact is stated that changes the legal status fixed by the deed. No revocation, no forfeiture is shown; no reversion is claimed. At most a misuser is alleged. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>The First Pres. </em>Society, 1 Ohio St., 496; <em>Barclay </em>v. <em>Howell's </em>Lessee, 6 Peters, 507; <em>Webb </em>v. Moler, 8 Ohio, 553.

There is not shown, therefore, in the petition any release, abandonment or forfeiture on the part of the city, and hence no ground of action. The state is es-topped. A state may be estopped by deed, by judgment, by pleading, by contract and there is no reason why it should not also be estopped by acquiescence. In other words, the doctrine of estoppel <em>in pais </em>is applicable to sovereignty under certain circumstances. Resolute good faith should characterize the conduct of states in their dealings with individuals and there is no reason, in morals or law, that will exempt them from the doctrine of estoppel. <em>State </em>v. <em>Milk, </em>11 Fed.

Every other right that the state ever had in the land once.occupied by this portion of the cana* it parted with forever by the deed to the city of Cincinnati. Although such deed stated that the transfer to the city was for a public highway and for sewerage purposes, yet so far as the state is concerned, the transfer was absolute, except as to the express limitations in the law making certain reservations in favor of the state. All else was parted with forever by the state to the city of Cincinnati. The state gave up once and forever all right, title and interest in and to all of the land and all rights therein, retaining only the water privileges, the water powers and the water flow to the river, and the incidental right of access to the flumes and raceway conducting this water, in case such access thereto should become necessary for any purpose. The preservation of the surface as a street was, by this legislative act, and by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>deed in pursuance thereof, devolved upon the city of Cincinnati. ' The state dismissed itself of all control over and future concern for the use of the ground as a street. So that any use or occupation of the street thereafter by a railroad company or other person in a manner inconsistent with its use as a public highway could by a civil action be taken advantage of, only by the city or abutting property owners.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"180\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b265-6\">Bradbury, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ag7\">The first, and principal, question to be determined in the case arose \u2022 upon the demurrer to the petition and respects the jurisdiction of this court over the subject of the' action. That the original jurisdiction of this court cannot be enlarged or diminished by legislative action, but is such, only, as the constitution confers, was settled at an early day after the present constitution was adopted. <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Mahaffy, </em>2 Ohio St., 498; <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>8 Ohio St., 393. The jurisdiction thus conferred is confined to proceedings in quo warranto, mandamus, habeas corpus and procedendo.\u201d Article IY, section 2. Therefore the subject matter of an original action in this court must fall within the scope of one or the other of those four specified proceedings, or its jurisdiction fails. True, Okey, J. in <em>Knapp </em>v. Thomas, 39 Ohio St., 377, expressed an opinion that the extent of the jurisdiction of this court \u2018 \u2018 in habeas corpus as well as the manner of its exercise, is undoubtedly, in some measure, within legislative control.\u201d If this opinion is not in direct conflict with <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Mahaffy, </em>2 Ohio St., 498, <em>supra, </em>and the other decisions of this court upon the question of its original jurisdiction, nevertheless it must be regarded as announcing a principle that can operate only within extremely limited boundaries, and if not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>confined to proceeding\u2019s in habeas corpus, yet can not be invoked to clothe this court with original jurisdiction over any substantially new subject matter on the assumption that \u2022 it falls within either of the other three heads of original jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The subject matter of the present inquiry, if within the jurisdiction of the court at all, falls properly within an action in quo warranto. It relates to a right or privilege claimed and exercised by the defendant, a body corporate under the laws of this state, in respect of lands that now constitute or formerly did, a part of the public canal system of this state, and calls upon the defendant to set forth the grounds upon which it claims such right or privilege. This isa proper office of a proceeding in quo warranto.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Quo warranto was anciently employed by the king to question the title of individual proprietors to lands of the crown, as well as to nearly every other privilege or franchise that emanated from or was held by the crown.\u201d However, no modern instance of its exercise in England for the former purpose has been shown. 2 Reeves\u2019 His. Eng. Law 211; <em>People </em>v. McKinch, <em>et </em>al., 23 Wend. (N. Y.), 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">By the statutes of this state in force when our existing constitution was framed and adopted, quo warranto would lie against a corporation \u201cwhenever it shall have misused any franchise or privilege conferred, or exercise any franchise or privilege not conferred upon it by law.\u201d 36 O. L., 69. Privilege is a comprehensive term; and to enter upon and occupy lands that form a part of the canal system of the state by anyone is exercising a privilege, in one sense of that term, and if this is done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>without authority from the state, it is \u201cexercising a privilege not conferred by law.\u201d The statute on the subject in force now is more specific. Its language authorizes an action in quo warranto to be brought against a corporation \u201cwhen it claims or holds, by contract or otherwise, * * * a franchise, privilege or right in contravention of law.\u201d This would seem to expressly declare that any specific contractual right asserted by a corporation to which it had no illegal right might be made the subject matter of an action in quo warranto, at least if it concerned the public. We have seen, however, that the legislature has no authority to enlarge the jurisdiction of this court in quo warranto. It has been suggested in this connection that the later act of the general assembly is merely a legislative construction of the earlier one \u2014 that in force at the time of the adoption of our present constitution. This suggestion, however, has little or no value in solving* the question under consideration, for where the general assembly is without authority to alter a statute directly, it cannot accomplish the same end indirectly by an attempt to construe its meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">This question of jurisdiction does not so much concern the ultimate rights of the parties as it does methods of procedure. The right of suitors respecting the subject matter in dispute will be determined by applying to the facts, when ascertained, the same principles and rules of law, whether the action was commenced in this court in <em>quo warranto </em>or in the court of common pleas by a real action. What the proper practice might be if the controversy was between the state and a private person we need not stop to discuss. The case before us being one where a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>corporation, a mere creature of the state, is occupying lands admitted to have formed a part of the canal system of the state, is required to set forth the grounds by which its occupation is justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The practice of bringing in this court, proceedings in <em>quo warranto </em>to determine controversies, similar in all essential respects to that involved in this action, originated nearly a score of years ago. In <em>State ex rel. </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>37 Ohio St., 157, a case like the one under consideration, the original jurisdiction of this court was successfully invoked. True, the jurisdiction of the court does not seem to have been challenged in that case, a circumstance doubtless weakening its force as an authority. Since that decision was rendered, however, and upon its authority the jurisdiction of this court, in cases involving the same question, has been exercised a number of times. And in the unreported ease of <em>The State ex rel. </em>v. <em>The Toledo and Walhonding Valley R. R. Co., </em>the jurisdiction being assailed was sustained after argument. The validity of a number of judgments rests solely upon this jurisdiction; if the jurisdiction did not subsist those judgments are absolutely void. In view of the serious consequences that would follow from overruling those cases, it should not be lightly done.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The statute in force when the constitution was adopted, as we have seen, authorized proceedings in <em>quo warranto </em>against a corporation whenever it exercised any \u201cfranchise or privilege\u201d not conferred upon it by law. The contention that the word \u201cprivilege\u201d was used advisedly by the legislature as more comprehensive than \u201cfranchise,\u201d and in a sense broad enough to comprehend a specific claim in respect of public property, is not without reason for its support. If the word \u201cpriv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>ilege\u201d was employed as synonymous with \u201cfranchise\u201d its use was superfluous. If not employed as synonymous with franchise, in what sense was it employed ?</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">In this connection it may prove profitable to refer to the difference between the language this statute used to authorize a proceeding in <em>quo warranto, </em>and that employed to limit the time within which to bring the proceedings, 36 O. <em>L., </em>69, and section 8 and section 26, p. 73. The action may be brought whenever a corporation exercises a \u201cfranchise or privilege not conferred upon it by law.\u201d The limitation of time is made to apply to the exercise of a \u201cpower or franchise\u201d under its charter. The phrase \u201cfranchise or privilege not conferred * * by law \u201d is more comprehensive than the words \u201c power or franchise * * under its charter.\u201d The' former phrase, according to the sense it ordinarily bears, doubtless includes many things not embraced by the latter. This marked difference of phraseology should not, needlessly, be attributed to accident. If the general assembly intended that where a corporation merely exercised a power or franchise under, that is by virtue of its charter, this power or franchise should not be challenged by the state after twenty years\u2019 user, and also intended that an action in <em>quo warranto </em>might be brought against a corporation, and that too without limitation of time, whenever it claimed or exercised an unwarranted right or privilege respecting the property of the state, it chose, in the language just quoted, an appropriate medium to express such intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">The former decisions of this court sustaining its jurisdiction in this class of cases must be based upon doctrines of the common law or upon the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>visions of the statute just referred to, which were in force when the present constitution was adopted. If we concede that the common law doctrine had become obsolete at the time the constitution was adopted, then the court, heretofore in entertaining-original jurisdiction in this class of controversies, must have held that it was authorized by the statute. The ancient rule of the common law authorizing proceedings in <em>quo warrcmto </em>by the crown against a subject asserting some right respecting lands claimed by the crown, together with the aptness of the proceeding to advance the inquiry, are not wholly immaterial upon this question of statutory construction. If it once existed and had become obsolete, that, together with its appropriateness as a remedy, may have been the cause of legislative action on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">In view of these considerations we adhere to the former decision^ of the court upon the question of its original jurisdiction in this class of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Having sustained the jurisdiction of the court, the other grounds urged in support of the demurrer to the petition present but little difficulty. True, the petition discloses that the defendant has occupied lands forming- a part of our public canal system under a claim of right, for more than twenty years ; but statutes of limitation do not run against the state unless the intention that they shall so run is obvious. The limitation of time within which an action in <em>quo warranto </em>is to be commenced is found in section 6789, Revised Statutes, which reads: \u201cNothing in this chapter contained shall authorize an action against a corporation for forfeiture of charter, unless the same be commenced within five years after the act complained of was done or committed; nor shall an action be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>brought against a corporation for exercising a power or franchise under its charter which it has used and exercised for a term of twenty years. \u2019 \u2019 * * * * As the present proceeding does not seek a forfeiture of the charter of defendant the five years\u2019limitation does not apply. Neither does the twenty years\u2019limitation apply, because the proceeding is not directed against the exercise of a ' \u2018power or franchise under \u2019 \u2019 the charter of the corporation. Its object is to oust the defendant from a right it was exercising in respect of the canal lands of the state, and no limitation is prescribed to the bringing of an action to secure that end.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">Whether the petition states a cause of action depends upon the title the state acquired in the lands in controversy when it appropriated them to canal purposes, and the construction that should be given to conveyance it made to the city of Cincinnati.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">That the title of the state to its canal lands is one in fee simple is a question of law. The only fact to be ascertained is whether the lands were in fact a portion of the canal system. How the acquisition was made is not material. The mere seizure and appropriation of a parcel of land for canal purposes, by force, of the statute under which our canals were constructed, was alone sufficient to vest in the state a fee simple title to them. Nor could any other title than one in fee simple be received by the state for lands to be devoted to a canal. A mere occupation of lands by the state for canal purposes, was a seizure and appropriation of it to that purpose, and to be devoted to that purpose was to give to the state a fee simple title thereto. No conveyance was necessary ; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>seizure and occupation transferred to the state the entire estate in the lands so seized and occupied, leaving to the former owner simply a claim for compensation. 23 O. L., 56 (section 8.) <em>Malone </em>v. Toledo, 28 Ohio St., 643; <em>Malone </em>v. Toledo, 34 Ohio St., 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">The lands, the occupation of which is the subject of controversy in this action, were a part of the canal lands of the state, to which, as before stated, the state had a fee simple title. The statute of 1863, 60 O. L., 44, did not authorize a conveyance in fee to the city of Cincinnati of the parcel of land in controversy, nor did the deed of the governor made pursuant thereto purport to convey such title. The statute, as well as the deed, expressly describes the interest conveyed. It was an \u201cauthority and permission to the city of Cincinnati to enter upon, improve and occupy forever as a public highway and for sewerage purposes,\u201d the land in controversy. No other estate, right or interest was granted or intended to be granted than that just recited. Grants made by the state are not to be extended by construction. The grant was of a right to occupy and improve this strip of land for two specified purposes \u2014 for sewerage and a public highway \u2014 the fee remaining in the state. No power of sale passed to the city nor any power to barter this strip of land for another strip or parcel lying elsewhere, although the latter should be used for street or sewerage purposes. The limits of the rights of the city under the conveyance was to improve and use the land conveyed for sewerage and street purposes; it could use or apply it to no other purpose itself, nor could it grant to another any right whatever in these lands. The city, by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>ordinance of December 1, 1871, vacated Eggleston avenue from the north line of Front street to the south line of Pearl street. That was a direct abandonment of the right which had been conveyed to the city by the state to improve and use for a street the portion thus vacated; and by the use to which it permitted the defendant to appropriate that portion of the strip which is situate south of Pearl street, it may be fairly inferred, that the city has abandoned that also. The city having abandoned this right it reverts to the state from which the right emanated. The state was the absolute owner in fee of the whole estate and interest in this strip of land; it conveyed to the city a right to use it for two specified purposes only; upon the abandonment by the city of either purpose' the interest, to that extent returns to the grantor. By the express terms of the deed made to the city, as well as by the terms of the statute authorizing it, the city was authorized to enter upon, improve and occupy * * *\u25a0 all or any part of the strip of land which is the subject of controversy, so the fact that the city has abandoned a part of the land for street purposes does not work an abandonment of the whole. Nor is the use to which the city has permitted the defendant to devote that part of the land which lies between Broadway and Pearl streets, inconsistent with its continued use by the city for street purposes, and therefore such use by the defendant does not work an abandonment of the city\u2019s rig\u2019hts. But as the right granted to the city only authorized a use by the city itself of the premises granted, the city could grant no right to the defendant to lay its track thereon, and there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>fore such, use of the premises by the defendant is without authority of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">These views require us to overrule the demurrer to the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">We now pass to a consideration of the answer which, as we have seen, is attacked by both a demurrer and a motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The first defense among other things denies the allegations of the thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth paragraphs of the petition. These paragraphs, excepting the thirteenth, state no facts upon which relief is predicated, but are in the nature of conclusions drawn by the pleader from material facts before averred in the petition, and their denial therefore raises no material issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">The thirteenth paragraph of the petition is in the following- words:</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">\u2018 \u2018 13. The plaintiff avers and charges that subject to the rights, privileges and easements therein, which were granted to the city of Cincinnati by the state under the act of March 24, 1863, excepting, however, such of the rights, privileges and easements thus granted as by reason of the facts hereinbefore stated have since then been released, abandoned or forfeited by said city, the state of Ohio has been since the said 24th day of March, 1863, and now is the owner in fee and entitled to the full use and possession of that part of the Miami and Erie canal extending from the east side of Broadway in the city of Cincinnati to the Ohio river, including the width thereof, as owned and held by the state on said date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">To deny the averments of this paragraph would seem to put in issue the title of the state to land occupied by the defendant. The first defense of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>the answer not only denies the averments of this paragraph, but proceeds as follows: \u201cAnd the defendant denies that the plaintiff on or prior to the 24th day of March, 1863, or at any other time was or is the owner in fee of the real estate, or any part of the real estate mentioned in the petition; but, on the contrary, says that the plaintiff has not and never had any interest or estate therein, except the right to use and occupy a portion thereof for canal purposes, that no compensation was ever paid therefor by the plaintiff and that no title in any of said real estate was ever conveyed to the plaintiff or otherwise acquired by it. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">We have already adverted to the method by which the state acquired its canal lands; no conveyances were required, nor was any legal or formal proceedings of any kind necessary; it simply occupied such as the canal commissioners desired \u2014 this occupancy by force of the statute, 23 O. L., 56, section 8, vested the legal title in the state. No direct averment of title was necessary; from the fact alone that a tract of land was occupied by the state for the purposes connected with its canal system, it followed as a matter of law, that the state owned it in fee simple. Under this state of the title, to simpty deny that the state had a title in fee was to deny a conclusion of law. To contest the state\u2019s title, the party must deny that the lands were part of the canal system of the state, and the answer falls short of doing so. In fact, when the whole answer is considered, the connection of the lands occupied by the defendant, with the canal system of the state as clearly appears, as it does on the face of the petition, the attempted denial of title therefore is not sufficient to raise a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>material issue and the demurrer to it should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The remainder of the answer contains no matter entitled to an extended discussion. The defendant knew, or had the means of knowing\u2019 the terms of the conveyance made by the state to the city of Cincinnati; they appear not only in the conveyance itself, but also in the act of the legislature by which the conveyance was authorized. It made the arrangement with the city by means of which it entered into occupancy of these lands, and expended its money in erecting structures, and placing railroad tracks thereon at its peril. If in any case the property of the state can be lost by an estoppel predicated upon the negligence, or bad faith of one of its officers or agents, the facts of this case do not create one. Neither was the state a party to any of the eases which are claimed to sustain the defendant in its contention that practically the whole interest and title of the state passed to the city by virtue of the deed made to it for these lands, and that the defendant acquired by its .contract with the city the same rights. Doubtless if the city had any rights in the premises which it could convey, they passed by the deed to the defendant; but as the city had no rights therein other than that of occupancy by itself for specified purposes, and such rights not being subject to a -conveyance, of necessity nothing passed by its deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The demurrer to the answer should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">This disposes of the answer; true, the larger part of it might be stricken out as immaterial, but we deem it unnecessary to consider it with a view to that end.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>The defendant, upon the day the cause was finally submitted, asked and obtained leave to file the following amendment to its answer: \u201cThe defendant, for amendment to its answer says, in addition to th\u00e9 allegations thereof, that this proceeding and the laws purporting to authorize the same ar\u00e9 in contravention of the constitution of the United States, and especially of the fifth and fourteenth articles of amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">As our attention has not been directed to any inconsistency between the proceeding under consideration, or the statute by which it authorized, and the constitution of the United States, and as we perceive none, we enter upon no discussion of the question. <em>Judgment for relator.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
