C. Howell, did not answer. The other defendants filed separate answers in substance, denying the averments of the petition generally, and specifically denying that they had contracted the obligation, and in one of the answers it is alleged that the Chamber of Commerce is a corporation organized for profit, having a capital stock of $50,000, divided into shares of $100 each, of which $10,000 had been subscribed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-7\">On the trial, evidence was offered by the plaintiff tending, as to some of the defendants at least, to show that they had participated in the meeting-to promote the \u201cCelebration of the Application of Natural Gas to the Mechanical Arts,\u201d at which the fireworks were used, and had otherwise promoted the celebration under the auspices of the Chamber of Commerce.

\u2018A corporation created for purposes other than profit may have a capital stock, and if you find from the evidence that the defendant corporation had a capital stock, that fact of itself will not

data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-8\">The court gave, with others of like tenor, the following propositions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-9\">\u201c <em>First </em>\u2014 \u2018The records of the Chamber of Commerce, produced and read in evidence, conclusively show that said corporation was organized with a capital stock with a long list of subscribers thereto, and a board of directors and other officers, and that it was, in fact, so organized for business purposes and for profits, either directly or indirectly, notwithstanding the defect in its name and the statement in its charter that it is a corporation not for profit. \u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-10\">\u201cTo which charge the plaintiffs' at

excepted.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-6\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of all the defendants except the corporation and Howell. A motion for a new trial was overruled and judgment entered upon the verdict. This was affirmed by the judgment of the Circuit Court, and the reversal of both judgments is sought here.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b35-7\"><em>Frank A. </em>Dams, <em>John F. Alforcl </em>and <em>J. M. </em>Platt, for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-8\">Corporations organized under the laws of Ohio are of two classes:</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-9\"><em>First </em>\u2014 Corporations organized for profit which must have a capital stock- owned by stockholders.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-10\"><em>Second </em>\u2014 Corporations organized for purposes other than profit consisting of members associated together for a lawful purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-11\">Corporations created for purposes other than profit may again be divided into two classes, to-wit: Those which have a capital stock and those that do not. It is apparent from the statutes themselves that corporations not. for profit may have a capital stock. A corporation not for profit, and having\u2019 a capital stock, was before this court in the case of <em>The Ohio College of Dental Surgery </em>v. Rosenthal, 45 Ohio St., 183.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-12\">The fact then that this corporation had a capital stock, in no way determines or assists in the determination of the question, whether the organization was or was not for profit. The proposition, that a private corporation can exercise no power but such as are expressly given to it by its charter, or such as are necessary to carry into execution the powers conferred by express provision, is so well settled in this state that it does not seem neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>sary to cite authorities in its support. <em>Straus et al. </em>v. <em>Eagle Insurance Co., </em>5 Ohio St., 59; <em>White's Bank of Buffalo </em>v. <em>Toledo Insurance Co., </em>12 Ohio St., 601; <em>Franklin Bank </em>v. <em>Commercial Bank, </em>36 Ohio St., 350; <em>Lessee of Overmyer </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>15 Ohio, 26; <em>Bonham </em>v. <em>Taylor et al., </em>10 Ohio, 108; <em>Bank of Chillicothe </em>v. <em>Swayne et al., </em>8 Ohio, 257 ; <em>Ehrman v. Insurance Co., </em>35 Ohio St., 324; <em>State v. Vanderbilt, </em>37 Ohio St., 590; <em>Railroad Co. v. Hinsdale, </em>45 Ohio St., 556; <em>Railway Co. v. Iron Co., </em>46 Ohio St., 44; <em>Niagara County Bank </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>15 Ohio St., 68; <em>Kilbreth v. Bates, </em>38 Ohio St., 187; Morawetz on Private Corporation, section 316; Waterman on Corporations, vol. 1, p. 113; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>101 U. S., 82; Dartmouth College Case, 4 Wheat., 518.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-5\">The individual defendants, therefore, of this corporation would be personally liable for all debts by them contracted either directly or indirectly, by the intervention of an agent. It may be contended that because this corporation claims to have had a capital stock that the liability is upon the stock and not upon the trustees individually. This will not do. The statute does not so read. If that construction was true, then the statute, would read, the trustees of a corporation created for purposes other than profit and not having a. capital stock shall be personally liable, etc. The section in its terms includes the trustees of all corporations not for profit, whether they have a. capital stock or not.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b36-6\"><em>A. Blackford, E. T. Dunn </em>and <em>II. F. Burket, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-7\">With powers in the charter the most ample for profit, with a capital stock ample in amount to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>make profit, divided into shares well calculated for profit, opening books for subscription to-capital stock, indicating- profit, subscribing for capital stock in amounts from one hundred to two thousand dollars, indicating an expectation of division of profits in proportion to amount of capital stock held 'by each, and electing- directors instead of trustees, can it be said that all these indications-of a corporation for profit are to be overcome by the single recital of the charter that the corporation desire to become incorporated under the laws of Ohio for purposes other than profit? If such was their desire they failed to carry that desire into effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-6\">If we are right in our confident claim that this is a corporation for profit, then there is no error in the record, and the judgments should be affirmed. If it was a corporation not for profit, then there is an utter failure of proof that the defendants were the trustees of the corporation. All. the record evidence clearly shows that these defendants in error were elected as directors and not as trustees. The difference between a director and a trustee, is wide and marked. Proof that a. man has been elected director does not prove that-he was elected a trustee; and proof that he accepted the office of director does not prove that he-accepted the office of trustee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-7\">Although the debt may have been contracted b}7-trustees of a corporation not for' profit, it would be the debt of the corporation, and the trustees-would only be collaterally liable for it. <em>Wright </em>v. McCormick, 17 Ohio St., 87; <em>Walbrecht </em>v. <em>Puckelat,, </em>9 Law Bull., 335; <em>Brown </em>v. Hitchcock, 36 Ohio St., 667.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-8\">The difference in the imposing liability upon the-trustees is because of the difference between the</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>two classes of corporations, those of this class having no capital stock, but the liability is in our opinion of the same nature, to be resorted to by creditors, only when the debt cannot be made ag'ainst the corporation itself. But it is not sufficient merely to show an act of insolvency or failure because notwithstanding a failure to meet an obligation, the property may remain.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b38-5\">Shacjcb:, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AB\">The claim of the plaintiffs is that the defendants are liable in this action under the provisions of section 3261 of the Revised Statutes : \u201cThe trustees of a corporation created for a purpose other' than profit, shall be personalty liable for all debts of the corporation by them contracted. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">The view of the trial court, as indicated by the instructions given and by its refusals to instruct as requested, was that although the articles of incorporation of the chamber of commerce declared that it was \u201cformed not for profit,\u201d that declaration is not entitled to controlling effect, because of the provision for capital stock and because \u2022of the declaration in the articles that the corporation was formed for the purposes of doing such things as would \u2018 \u2018 enhance the interests of the city and promote the convenience and welfare of all business men trading therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">Bjr the provisions of section 3S32, corporations of this character are authorized to acquire such real estate as may be for their interest, which would require, capital, and certificates' of stock would be convenient evidence of the interests of the several members therein. That the existence of capital stock does not conclusively indicate that the corporation is for profit is made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>clear by the provisions of section 3262: <em>\u201cA </em>corporation for profit, after its original capital stock is fully paid up, or a corporation not for profit, having- a capital stock, may increase its capital stock or the number of shares into which its capital stock is divided.\u201d This provision of the statute makes it clear that the proposition of law contained in the third request is sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">Nor was the view of the trial court justified by the fact that the corporation was intended to promote the growth and prosperity of the city, and-thus to confer incidental benefit upon its members and officers in common with others owning property in the city or doing business therein. The corporation, though authorized to own or lease real estate for its general purposes, was not authorized to deal therein, nor could it transact any business out of which profits payable as dividends could be realized. The ownership of stock was not necessary to membership in the corporation, nor to officjal participation in its management. Since those who, as directors or trustees, incur the debts that may be incident to the management of a corporation of this character do not necessarily bear the liability which the statute imposes upon stockholders, they are within the provisions of section 3261 of the statutes. Corporations for profit within the meaning of the statute are those which are formed for the prosecution of business enterprises with a view to realizing gains to be distributed as dividends among the shareholders in proportion to their contributions to the capital stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\"><em>For error in the instructions given and in refusing to instruct as </em>requested, <em>the judgments of the circuit court and court of common pleas are reversed.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b39-6\">B\u00fcrket, J., having- been of counsel, did not sit.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
