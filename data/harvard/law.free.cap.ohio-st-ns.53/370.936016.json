Stat.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b398-5\">1. It is not error for a reviewing court to refuse to treat as part of a bill of exceptions a deposition claimed to be the identical deposition given in evidence at the trial, where such deposition is attached to the bill only by being placed between the pasteboard back and the stenographer\u2019s report (although held with sufficient tenacity-to retain its place), and not marked as an exhibit, nor identified by either the trial judge, nor the stenographer, nor by any one.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b398-7\">2. Where a petition in an action against a railroad company for personal injuries charges that defendant negligently and unlawfully stopped a freight train across a public highway for a period of more than five minutes, and that while plaintiff, after the expiration of that period, was attempting to cross the street between the cars, defendant without warning, wrongfully and negligently backed the train, causing plaintiff\u2019s injuries, such two charges of negligence are not separable in the sense that one only would be the proximate cause \u2022 of the injury; taken together they constitute a sufficient allegation of negligence as against a general demurrer.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b398-9\">3. A child of nine years of age is not guilty of negligence if he exercises that degree of care which under like circumstances would reasonably be expected from one of his years and intelligence. Whether he used such care in a particular case is a question for the jury. And even though the petition might, if the plaintiff were an adult, be construed as disclosing contributory negligence; an averment that the plaintiff was at the time a child of nine years of age, and of immature experience and judgment, is sufficient to rebut the presumption of contributory negligence.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b398-11\">4. Where, in such case, the evidence at the trial tends to show that a freight train has been permitted to stand across a pub- ' lie street beyond the period of 'five minutes, to the hindrance or inconvenience of travel thereon, in violation of section 6980, Revised Statutes, and persons, rightfully on the street are passing between the cars of the train, it becomes a question for the jury whether or not it is negligence for the company\u2019s servants to move the train without giving timely warning of their intention to do so.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b399-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>5. Whether, under such circumstances, a child of nine years who attempts to cross and in doing so climbs upon the coupling of a car, is a trespasser or not, is a question for the jury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b399-7\">6. It is also a question for the jury whether or not the mere presence of the train is to be taken as notice to such child that the train is likely to be moved at any time.</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b399-9\">(Decided October 29, 1895.)</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-10\">Error to the Circuit Court of Mercer county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-11\">The action below was by the defendant in error, by next friend, against the plaintiff in error to recover damages for alleged negligence.

So that as the train was not approaching- a crossing the engineer- on starting the train from its position of rest, on the crossing was not required to sound a whistle or ring a bell, was not required to give signal, or any particular notice of his intention to start his train either forward or backward. If then the engineer was not required to give warning by bell or whistle what act of omission or commission on the part of the servants of the company were committed resulting in injury to the defendant in error ? <em>Faurot </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number><em>v.

The petition must show a legal duty or obligation imposed on the defendant towards the person injured, existing at the time and place of the injury, which the defendant failed to perform, by reason of which the injury was occasioned. <em>Thicle </em>v.

A preliminary question is made, with respect to the action of the circuit court in overruling a motion to reattach certain depositions to the bill of exceptions. It is recited in the bill that depositions of the witnesses named were given in evidence, and that they are attached, marked respectively Exhibits \u201cE\u201d and\u00a3 \u00a3F. \u2019 \u2019 Proof was heard for and against the claim that the depositions were ever part of the bill. Giving to the testimony a construction most favorable to the plaintiff in error the question, reduced to its last analysis, is whether a paper claimed to be the identical paper given in evidence at the trial, which was attached to the bill of exceptions only by being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>placed between the pasteboard back and the stenographer\u2019s report, in which position it was held with sufficient tenacity to retain its place, but which paper was not marked nor identified as an exhibit, either by the trial judge or the stenographer, or by any one, can be treated as a part of the bill. We think it cannot. The circuit court did not err in overruling the motion, nor in refusing to pass upon the weight of the evidence <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Persons, </em>19 Ohio, 426; <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>1 Ohio St., 386; <em>Busby </em>v. Finn, Id., 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">2. It is insisted that the petition fails to state a cause of action, and that the trial court therefore erred in overruling a general demurrer to that pleading. The criticisms are that there is no averment that the train was unnecessarily detained on the crossing; that the allegations of negligence are mere epithets, and not a statement of the omission of any duty, and that the presumption of contributory negligence arising from the facts stated is not overcome by proper averments.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Omitting formal parts, the petition alleges in substance that the plaintiff was a minor of the age of nine years; that defendant\u2019s track through the village of Coldwater intersects and crosses Main street at grade; that Main street is a common thoroughfare and highway, tlie principal street of said village, and the point of junction bothapublic highway and street crossing, necessarily much used and frequented by the public. On June 5, 1890, the defendant did negligentlyandunlawfully, and without due care on the part of the servants of said defendant in charge thereof, leave a long train of freight cars attached to a locomotive, standing upon and over, obstructing and blocking said crossing for a period of more than five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>minutes, without any attention to said crossing or the consequence to the convenience or life and limb of persons having occasion to pass such obstruction. That at the time aforesaid, during the hour of noon of said day, while said train was so unlawfully standing on said crossing, the plaintiff, a child of tender years and immature experience and judgment, was lawfully passing along said street going to a point beyond said crossing on Main street. When, arriving at said crossing and in full view of the engineer\u2019s position, and in full view of any servant being on the lookout or keeping watch over said train, he found said crossing so obstructed and blocked by said defendant\u2019s train; that after remaining at, said crossing for more than five minutes, and receiving no warning, plaintiff, in full view of the engineer\u2019s proper position, and within the knowledge of ordinary prudence of defendant\u2019s servants, attempted to pass over and cross such obstruction. While so passing over said cars defendant\u2019s servants, without any care or attention to said crossing, or the consequence to any one attempting to pass such unlawful obstruction, without due care, without signal, without notice, without warning, did then and there imprudently, carelessly, negligently and wrongfully start said ears suddenly and violently backward, whereby said plaintiff\u2019s right foot was caught between the couplings of two ears, and the injury followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">If the action were to recover the penalty prescribed by section 4748, Revised Statutes, or to recover damages arising to any person by reason alone of the obstruction, it would be necessary to aver that the obstruction was continued unnecessarily, for that condition is incorporated in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>statute. But section 6890, Revised Statutes, which provides that \u201cany person who permits any car or locomotive of which he has charge to remain upon or within thirty feet of the center or across any public road, street, or alley, for a period longer than five minutes * * * shall be fined, \u201d etc., does not impose the requirement of showing that the cars were so permitted to remain unnecessarily, and the language quoted clearly implies the duty to remove the obstruction after the lapse of five minutes. Notice of this statute being taken, the neglect of duty is implied from the statement of the fact of continued obstruction. So construed, the petition makes a case of violation of duty, and this, with the averment that the act was negligently done and the further allegation that the starting of the ears, by which the injury was immediately caused, was done negligently, without warning and wrongfully, we think is sufficient charge of negligence as against a general demurrer. The general rule is that allegations which adequately state the facts of negligence are sufficient to constitute a good pleading. An allegation specifying the act, the doing of which caused thq injury, and averring generally that it was negligently done, states a cause of action, although it be not apparent from the complaint how the injury resulted from the negligence alleged.\u201d Boone\u2019s Code Pleading, section 174; Bliss\u2019 Code Pleading, section 211a/ Maxwells\u2019s Code Pleading, <em>251) Gulf, etc., Railroad </em>v. Washington, 49 Fed. Rep., 347; <em>Rushville </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>107 Ind., 475. Nor are the two negligent acts independent of each other. Both concur in constituting an act of negligence, viz.: the negligent starting of a train, negligently and unlawfully obstructing a street crossing. <em>Burger </em>v. Railway, 112 Mo., 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Nor is the petition faulty in that it does not sufficiently negative the presumption of contributory negligence. It is well settled that a child is presumed to possess only such discretion as is common to children, and is, therefore, held only to the exercise of such care as is reasonably to be expected from children of his own age and capacity. <em>Rolling Mill Co. </em>v. Corrigan, 46 Ohio St., 283. The law as to personal responsibility of a child for his acts is declared by Bishop, in his work upon Criminal Law, section 368, in these words: \u201cSince, in reason criminal capability depends on the understanding rather than the age, there can be no fixed rule of \u25a0 age which will operate justly in .every possible case. But an imperfect rule is practically better than none. Therefore, at the common law, a child under seven years is conclusively presumed incapable of crime. Between seven and fourteen the law also deems the child incapable, but only <em>prima facie </em>so, and evidence may be received to show criminal capacity.\u201d The rule is sustained by many authorities, and may be regarded as an accepted rule of criminal law; and it would seem that the principle should have application to a case of negligence. Prof. Thompson, in his work on Negligence, at page 1181, comments as follows: \u201cTwo questions arise: 1. At what age or period of a child\u2019s development shall it be held to be <em>sui juris </em>for the purpose of cases of this kind; 2. Whether this is a question of law or a question of fact. When the age of the child admits of no doubt as to its capacity to avoid danger, the court will decide this question as a matter of law. * * If there is any doubt as to the child being of the age and capacity that in law constitutes one <em>sui juris, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>it should be submitted to the jury to say by their verdict whether he is so or not. \u201d The rule is tersely stated by Mr. Justice Hunt, in <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Glad</em>mon, 15 Wallace, at page 408, thus: \u201cThe caution required is according to the maturity and capacity of the child, and this is to be determined in each case by the circumstances of that case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Unless, therefore, it can be held as matter of law, that the injured person had the capacity to foresee and avoid danger, negligence will not be imputed to him. And inasmuch as this presumption will not be visited upon children under the age of fourteen, it follows that the averment that the plaintiff was a boy of nine years of age, and that he was of immature experience and judgment, is sufficient to rebut any legal presumption of contributory neglig-ence from other facts appearing in the petition. Sharswood\u2019s Blackstone, Vol. 1, 435, 464; Vol. 4, 20; <em>Rauch </em>v. <em>Lloyd </em>&amp; <em>Hill, </em>31 Pa. St., 358; <em>Nagle v. Railroad, </em>88 Pa. St., 35, <em>39; Rhodes </em>v. Railroad, 84 Ga., 320; <em>Thurber </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>60 N. Y., 326; <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>90 N. Y., 670.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">3. Defendant\u2019s counsel asked the court to charge the jury that \u201cIf you find in this case from the evidence, that defendant\u2019s train of cars occupied Main street crossing in Coldwater, Ohio, for a period exceeding five minutes, and more, than the statutory period, and you further find that plaintiff, while said train so occupied said crossing, climbed up between two of defendant\u2019s cars in said train, he, by so doing became and was a trespasser, and while so trespassing the defendant owed him no duty in moving the train from such crossing, unless you find from the evidence, that defendant .and its servants operating the train knew of his presence there,\u201d which was refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">This request implies that, under the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>stances stated, the plaintiff would, as matter of law, be a trespasser if he climbed up between two of the cars while attempting to cross over. We think this a question of mixed fact and law. The evidence tended to show that at the time the attempt to cross over was made the crossing had been obstructed for more than five minutes to the hindrance of travel thereon, which act of continued obstruction, if proven, was a violation of law and made the company itself a trespasser. Its cars were where they had no right to be, while, if the boy was rightfully upon the crossing, as the evidence tended to show he was, he was where he had a right to be, and his attempt to pass the obstruction by climbing upon the ears would not make him a trespasser. It was, we think, for the jury to say whether he was a trespasser or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Defendant\u2019s counsel also requested the court to charge \u201cThat if a public highway is completely blocked by a united freight train, attached to an engine, such possession of the highway by the train, even though such possession extends beyond the statutory time, is notice to all traveling public, children and adults alike, of the presence of such train at such place, and that it is likely to be moved at any time, and such train in that condition is not an invitation to any of the traveling public to pass over' the crossing by climbing upon, or over such train,\u201d which was refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">One objection to this request is that it ignores the difference between the responsibility of adults and children already adverted to. Whether or not the presence of a train upon a crossing should be treated as notice to a child of nine years of age that it is likely to be moved at any time depends upon the degree of intelligence and judgment possessed by the child, and that, as we have al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>ready found, is a question of fact for the jury. Besides this, it might he argued that the train would naturally furnish temptation to such a child, when desiring to pass, to take great risk in doing so, and that trainmen, as reasonable men, ought to anticipate that children would exercise only the discretion usual among\u2019 children, and, if circumstances indicated their presence at the crossing, to take reasonable precautions for their safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The charge as a whole was excepted to. We think it correctly presents the law, and is as favorable to the defendant below as its counsel could well ask.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Other questions were argued. They have all been considered, but we do not find anything in the record which would warrant a reversal of the judgment. <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
