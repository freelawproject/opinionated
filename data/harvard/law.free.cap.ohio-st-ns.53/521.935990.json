The portion of said lots in controversy is occupied in part by a basin of the canal, in part by a dike whereby the waters of Wolf Run are prevented from entering the basin at that point, as they naturally would, and in part by a substituted channel of said run through which its waters are carried alongside said basin to the second lock below where they are used to feed the waters of the canal for locking boats to and from the next lower level, the surplus being used for hydraulic purposes. The petition and answer joined issue on the title in fee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-5\">On the trial the plaintiff introduced a survey and plat of Akron, showing that these lots, among others, \u2018 \u2018as marked on the map, have not yet been surve3Ted or staked out on the ground, the survey of which is to be deferred until the canal is made, and may be enlarged or diminished in size as may be found convenient when the ground is prepared for their actual location.\u201d This plat was made in November, 1825.

Other facts material to the points decided are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-7\">The court gave, among others, the following instructions to the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-8\">\u201cNow, as to this Williams deed, I say to you that its effect was to convey to the state, lots 233 and 234, not for the purpose of constituting its canal, but in aid of the canal funds of said state; which implied that the lots might be converted into money by sale; and unless you shall find from the evidence that subsequent to accepting this deed the state altered the boundaries of the lots with respect to the basin front, I will limit it to the basin front now; they are to be considered by you as extending to the water of the basin as it existed, for lot 233 at the date of the Kirkum deed, and as to lot 234 at the date of the T. P. May deed, as you shall find it to have been from the evidence, so as to give said purchasers, their heirs and assigns, the privilege of building wharves and warehouses thereon- convenient for commerce, by extending the lines of said lots straight forward to the water where the same then was of sufficient depth for the purpose aforesaid. But, it being conceded by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>the plaintiff that this land does not extend beyond the piling, you need not go further west for the westerly line of said lots.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-5\">\u201cWhether _ the state appropriated any of the lands in contention, and if any, how much, by eminent domain, is a fact for you to find from the evidence; and this you must find, if you so find the fact to be, from other evidence than the simple fact of the occupancy of the lands for the purpose of constructing and maintaining the lower basin, or the ditch for passing the waters of Wolf Run. * * * * * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-8\">\u201cWhatever lands you find were embraced in lots 233 and 234, as conveyed by the state to T\u201e P.

We hold that it was then competent for the state to determine whether it owned the lands embraced in those lots for' canal purposes alone, or not, and that its determination in that respect cannot at this late day be questioned by the defendant Jackson, or the state.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-9\">The following instruction requested by the state was refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-10\">\u201cSeventh Request \u2014 If you find that prior to the construction Of the Ohio canal, Paul Williams deeded to the state of Ohio, lots 233 and 234 of the town plat of South Akroia, and that after receiving-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>said deed, the state constructed upon a portion of said lots a canal basin, embankment and race as a \u2022 permanent part of the said canal, and that after constructing- the same and filling the said basin with water in such a manner that the actual occupancy of the state with said canal basin, embankment and race was apparent and plainly visible, the state deeded the said lots to Kirkum and May, respectively, then in that case, Kirkum and May would not, by said deeds, obtain title to so much of said land as had been actually taken by the state for canal construction.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-6\">In the common pleas there was a verdict in favor of the plaintiff against both defendants for the possession of the premises and against Jackson for rents and profits.

The consideration named in the deed is, \u2018 \u2018 the benefits which will result to the community in g\u2019eneral and to myself in particular, from the construction of the Ohio canal, and from the foundation of a convenient basin in the village of Akron, in said township and county, which works are now in a state of progression.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-5\">The deed contains also the following language, upon which plaintiff below relies : \u201cThe water lots, or those laid out next to the contemplated basin, are in all cases to be considered as extending to the water in said basin, so as to give owners thereof the privilege of building\u2019 wharves or warehouses thereon convenient for commerce, by extending the lines of said lots straight forward to the water where the same is of sufficient depth for the purposes aforesaid, whether the water in the basin be raised to the level of the summit pond or be only raised to the level of the canal below the first lock.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-6\">Having received the said deed, the state constructed the canal, basin, embankment and race, as above stated, and thereafter, on January 10, 1834, the governor of the state deeded lot 234 to Thomas P. May, and on February 2, 1835, the governor of the state deeded lot 233 to George Kirkum.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-7\">But if the deeds were valid as to their execution, what passed by them ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-8\"><em>First </em>\u2014 Our construction of the language quoted from the deed by Williams to the state is that the lots only extend\u00e9d to the water in the basin, <em>i. e., </em>to the water\u2019s edge, with a recital that the reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>for their extending to the water\u2019s edge was that thereby the owners of the lots might in the usual way, the canal authorities consenting, build wharves out beyond the lot line and over the shallow water, for the loading and unloading of boats.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b555-4\"><em>Second </em>\u2014 It will be noticed that the deeds from the state by the governor omit the very language found in the deed from Williams to the state, upon which the plaintiff below predicated all her rights. The mission is significant. Between the time of the conveyance by Williams to the state and the conveyances from the state, the canal and basin, embankment and probably the race, had been constructed. It has been adjudicated by this court that all the land appropriated by the state for the canal and its appurtenances became the property of the state in fee simple. - Here we have a conveyance to the state in fee simple. <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Toledo, </em>34 Ohio St., 541.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b555-5\">Let it be conceded that the deed from Williams was a grant for the benefit of the canal fund. Still it can hardly be denied that the state was as much entitled to construct the canal upon lands so conveyed to it as upon the lands which it took by appropriation. It will be remembered that the appropriation made by the state in those early times was not an appropriation by legal proceedings, but simply an actual taking of the land. Does it not follow that, when the state constructed this basin, embankment and race, it owned the fee of all the land covered by the basin, embankment and race, not simply as a part of its canal fund, but as a part of the canal itself ? If so, the governor, was wholly without authority to convey away any portion of the basin, the embankment and the race, though included in these lots. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>authority of the governor to convey was only that which he received by virtue of section 2 of the act . of February 7, 1826. 24 Ohio Laws, 58,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b556-5\"><em>Charles Baird, B. L. Marvin </em>and <em>Tibbals &lt;&amp; Frank, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b556-6\">Courts have always been liberal in receiving- evidence with regard to boundaries which would not be strictly competent in the establishment of other facts. Old surveys, perambulation of boundaries, even reputation, are constantly received on a question of boundaries of large tracts of land. The declarations of surveyors made at the time of making- a survey have been admitted. In this country a liberal rule on the subject has been adopted in most of the states. The point was discussed by Mr. Justice Lamar in delivering the opinion of the court in <em>Clement </em>v. Packer, 125 U. S., 209; <em>Ayers </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>137 U. S., 584; <em>Coate </em>v. <em>Speer, </em>3 McCord, 227; <em>Kennedy, </em>v. <em>Lubold, </em>88 Pa. St., 246; <em>McCausland </em>v. <em>Flemming, </em>63 Pa.

Dec., 403.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b556-7\">From the necessity of the case we were required to rely upon the testimony of declarations of persons who were living at the time the canal was constructed. There was no person living at the time of the trial who had anything to do with the construction of the canal or the location of the basin or the western boundary of lots 233 and 234, and for this reason we were compelled,, as in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>case cited in the 88 Pa. St., to depend upon first principles and not try to attain perfection.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-6\">The state in all its contracts and dealings with individuals is governed by the same rules applicable in determining the rights of private citizens in contracting and dealing with each other. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>State, </em>104 Cal., 690; <em>Carr </em>v. <em>State, </em>127 Ind., 204; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stephens, </em>71 N.

In the view thus presented, the state could acquire lands for the purpose of such construction only by appropriation. This view of the law must have controlled the jury, and it led to the instruction given as to the effect of the deeds from the state to May and Kirkum. These instructions, considered together, resulted in the conclusion that by the later deeds the state was necessarily divested of all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>title' in the lots named which it had acquired by the deeds from Williams, notwithstanding that in the meantime it had constructed the canal, and the substituted channel for Wolf Run.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">This view is quite at variance with the provisions of the acts of February 4, 1825 (2 Chase, 1472), and February 7, 1826 ( 24 O. L.,-58). These acts coritemplated that \u201clands,\" waters and streams\u201d - would be acquired by the state' for the actual construction of its canals, including-\u201cfeeders, dikes, locks, dams- and such other works and devices as they (the canal commissioners) may .think proper for making said improvement's,\u201d and lots and' lands not needed for the construction and operation of the canals, but .acquired by donation or otherwise, to be sold or leased and the proceeds used in aid of such construction. The effect of the legislation looking to the establishment- Of the canal system of the state was that it acquired an unrestricted title in fee to all the lands of which it in any manner took possession for the purposes of such construction. <em>Malone </em>v. Toledo, 34 Ohio St., 541; <em>Ohio ex rel. </em>v. <em>The P., </em>C., <em>C. &amp; St. L. Ry. Co., ante, </em>189. It follows that if the state actually devoted the lands in' question to any of the numerous purposes of construction \u25a0 above quoted, they thereby became, in contemplation of the statute, a part of the canal system. The circumstances under which the Williams deed was executed would indicate that it was then contemplated that the lots would be used as they in fact were used; that is, partly for canal construction, and partly in aid of the canal fund. It was not a deed of gift, and it contained no such restrictions as would be effective to prevent its use by the state for either or both of the purposes'indicated. When inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>preted in connection with the provisions of the statute under which it was executed, it is entirely clear that it did not limit the power of the state to use the lands as indicated in the instructions given and in refusals to instruct as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The view that the deed from Williams to the state gave to the lots the unchangeable character of lands devoted to the aid of the canal fund, and incapable of being devoted to the purpose 'of canal construction, led to the effect given by the court to the subsequent deeds from the state to Ketchum and May, since it in effect determined that those deeds divested the state of all the title it had acquired from Williams unless there had been a distinct appropriation of a portion of the lots for the purpose of construction, and that appropriation was elsewhere defined to be the exercise by the state of its power of eminent domain. It is not thought by counsel for the defendant in error that the act of February, 7, 1826, authorized the canal commissioners to sell and the governor to convey any portion of the canals, and the statute would not admit of that view. The only purpose then prompting the general assembly was the establishment and maintenance of the system of canals. The lands in controversy are in and contiguous to the basin next below the portage summit level. Within the two miles of this basin and north of it are more than twenty locks, and the waters stored in the basin and those conducted through the substituted channel of Wolf Run are used in locking boats to and from the level of the Cuyahoga valley. If it were now an open question it would not seem difficult to demonstrate that the basin and the channel are necessary to the operation of the canal. But that they are, was conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>sively determined by the commisioners when they constructed them as a part of the canal.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">It is agreed by counsel that the waters of Wolf Run, at a level below that of the basin in dispute, are used for locking boats and the surplus for hydraulic purposes. The authority of the canal commissioners to sell was conferred and restricted by the second section of the act of February 7, 1826: \u2018\u2022That the canal commissioners are hereby authorized and empowered to sell all such lands and town lots as heretofore have been, or may hereafter be given, granted or ceded to the state for the benefit of the canal fund, other than those which \u25a0 are situated at points or places on or adjoining the line of the Ohio canals where the surplus water produced by said canals can be advantageously used for hydraulic purposes. \u2019 \u2019 The authority of the governor to grant did not exceed that of the commission to sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">It affirmatively appears from the plat of the former proprietors that the disputed boundary of these lots was not located when the plat was made. The plaintiff, not being in possession, was not entitled to recover until she had established her own title. It was incumbent upon her to show a subsequent location of such boundary inconsistent with the present claim of the state. Whether the voluminous bill of exceptions contains any evidence to establish such location is a question whose determination would serve no useful purpose in view of the conclusions already stated. The same observation may be made of the other questions presented by the record and argued by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\"><em>The judgments of the cwcuit court and the court of common pleas will be </em>reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
