See Mass. R. Civ. P. 50 (a), 365 Mass. 814 (1974) (judgment n.o.v.), and Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (b) (2), 365 Mass. 828 (1974) (postjudgment relief on ground of newly discovered evidence).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-13\">1. <em>Procedural background. </em>The plaintiffs in these consolidated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>actions contracted with the defendant Benistar Property Exchange Trust Company, Inc. (Benistar Trust) to hold their funds in escrow while they engaged in tax-advantaged \u201clike-kind\u201d property exchanges in accordance with Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1031 (2006) (\u00a7 1031).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather than safeguarding the plaintiffs\u2019 funds in escrow accounts \u2014 as its fiduciary and contractual duties to the plaintiffs required \u2014 Benistar Trust deposited the funds in margin accounts at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. (Merrill Lynch), and later at UBS PaineWebber Inc. (PaineWebber), and used the funds to engage in high-risk uncovered option trading. Benistar Trust ultimately lost more than $8 million of the plaintiffs\u2019 funds.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Beginning in January, 2001, the plaintiffs filed actions against Benistar Trust, Daniel Carpenter (its owner), Molly Carpenter (its managing director and treasurer; Daniel is her husband), Martin Paley (its president), a series of entities affiliated with Benistar Trust that were also controlled by Daniel and Molly Carpenter,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Merrill Lynch, and PaineWebber. The plaintiffs asserted claims against all of the defendants, including breach of contract, conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, intentional misrepresentation, and violation of G. L. c. 93A. In addition, the plaintiffs alleged that Merrill Lynch and PaineWebber aided and abetted Benistar Trust\u2019s conversion and breach of fiduciary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>duty and violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act and the New York Consumer Protection Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">In March, 2002, the trial judge, who presided over nearly the entirety of this litigation in the business litigation session of the Superior Court, allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on their claims against Benistar Trust for breach of contract and conversion. In July, 2002, the judge allowed Paine-Webber\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against it. See note 11, <em>infra. </em>After fourteen days of trial on the remaining claims, during November and December, 2002, and having heard testimony from more than a dozen witnesses, a jury found Benistar Trust, Carpenter, Molly Carpenter,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Paley liable on all of the plaintiffs\u2019 common-law claims. They found Merrill Lynch liable for aiding and abetting conversion, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, and for violating the New York and Connecticut consumer protection statutes.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">However, in February, 2003, the judge allowed Merrill Lynch\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v. on the ground that the plaintiffs had failed, as a matter of law, to present sufficient evidence that Merrill Lynch either had \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of the Benistar defendants\u2019 wrongful acts or provided \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d to Benistar\u2019s wrongdoing, as required under New York law, which controlled the claims.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>S &amp; K Sales Co. </em>v. <em>Nike, Inc., </em>816 F.2d 843, 847-848 (2d Cir. 1987) (defining ele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>ments of aiding and abetting claim under New York law). See also <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">In a posttrial motion, the plaintiffs brought forward evidence that they asserted was \u201cnewly discovered\u201d and would address the deficiencies the judge had identified in granting judgment n.o.v. to Merrill Lynch. The judge allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a new trial under rule 60 (b) (2), based on the new evidence. She reported her decision, along with her previous decision to grant judgment n.o.v. to Merrill Lynch, to the Appeals Court, under Mass. R. Civ. P. 64, as amended, 423 Mass. 1410 (1996), see <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>415 Mass. 258, 261 n.4 (1993). She also entered a final judgment against the Benistar defendants under Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 (b), 365 Mass. 820 (1974), from which the Benistar defendants appealed. The Appeals Court considered all issues together, and affirmed. <em>Cahaly </em>v. <em>Benistar Prop. Exch. Trust Co., </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 668 (2007). Merrill Lynch and the Benistar defendants each filed an application for further appellate review; the plaintiffs filed an opposition. We granted further appellate review.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">2. <em>Factual background..</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The jury could have found the following: Benistar Trust was a registered Delaware corporation with a principal place of business in Massachusetts. It was one of a number of business entities set up and controlled by Carpenter, a tax attorney and Connecticut resident. Carpenter was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>the chairman and sole shareholder of Benistar Trust. His wife, Molly Carpenter, was its managing director and treasurer, and Paley, a Massachusetts resident, was its president.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The plaintiffs are individuals and entities who in 2000 entered into written agreements with Benistar Trust in order to secure for themselves the tax benefits of \u00a7 1031 in connection with sales and purchases of real estate.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See note 4, <em>supra. </em>These agreements, in essence, obligated Benistar Trust (1) to hold the funds that each plaintiff derived from the sale of real property in a Merrill Lynch \u201cescrow custodial account\u201d in the form of either a six per cent \u201cinvestment account\u201d or a three per cent money market account, at each plaintiff\u2019s election; (2) to transfer a plaintiff\u2019s escrow funds to any seller of \u201creplacement property,\u201d designated by the plaintiff at such time and in such manner as the plaintiff specified, see note 4, supra; and (3) if the plaintiff failed to locate a suitable replacement property within the time permitted under \u00a7 1031, to return the escrow funds, with the applicable interest, to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">In October, 1998, Carpenter opened accounts at Merrill Lynch for various of his enterprises, including four accounts for Beni-star Trust. These were corporate working capital accounts, and not custodial, depository, or escrow accounts. His account advi-sors for all of the Benistar accounts were Gary Stem and Gerald Levine, financial advisors with Merrill Lynch\u2019s private client group. In setting up the accounts, Carpenter forwarded to Merrill Lynch Benistar Tmst\u2019s certificate and articles of incorporation, bylaws, and corporate resolutions authorizing the opening of the accounts. None of these documents identified the nature of Benistar Tmst\u2019s business as a \u00a7 1031 qualified intermediary.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Carpenter signed written representations that the money in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Benistar Trust accounts belonged to Benistar Trust. Additionally, Carpenter identified his investment objective as \u201cincome\u201d and his \u201caccount risk factor\u201d as \u201caggressive.\u201d He requested and received permission from Merrill Lynch to engage in uncovered option trading<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> in one of the Benistar Trust accounts, after signing a document acknowledging his understanding that uncovered options posed \u201cspecial risks . . . [for] potentially significant losses.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Carpenter was, as he stated on the account form, an \u201caggressive\u201d investor. As soon as the accounts were opened, he engaged in high-volume, high-risk uncovered trading in puts and calls, concentrating almost exclusively in the then-booming technology sector. Carpenter often spent one hour or more each day on the telephone with Levine or Stem discussing possible trades, consuming far more of their time than their other clients. However, Benistar\u2019s trades were \u201ctotally unsolicited,\u201d meaning that Carpenter himself controlled all investment decisions.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> He paid little heed to Stern\u2019s and Levine\u2019s repeated admonitions to temper his trading style by broadening his portfolio into other sectors and choosing some safer investments.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Carpenter\u2019s investment strategy at first yielded profitable returns, but by the spring of 2000, as the \u201cdot-com boom\u201d of the late 1990\u2019s began to flatten out, his accounts sustained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>heavy losses.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Merrill Lynch administrative manager Thomas Rasmussen, branch manager Hassan Tabbah, and members of Merrill Lynch\u2019s compliance department were concerned about these losses. On September 20, 2000, Rasmussen directed Levine to inform Carpenter that Merrill Lynch would no longer permit Carpenter to open uncovered positions in the Benistar Trust account. On Stern\u2019s recommendation, Carpenter moved his accounts to Paine Webber in October, 2000, where, in less than three weeks, Benistar Trust lost between $1.2 and $1.3 million. By the end of December, 2000, Paine Webber began closing out positions in the Benistar account.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">We turn now to the decision of the judge to grant Merrill Lynch\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">\u2022 3. <em>Judgment notwithstanding the verdict, </em>a. <em>Standard of review. </em>Because the jury are a pillar of our justice system, nullifying a jury verdict is a matter for the utmost judicial circumspection. The touchstone is reasonableness. We ask whether, construing the evidence most favorably to the plaintiff, and \u201cwithout weighing the credibility of the witnesses or otherwise considering the weight of the evidence, the jury reasonably could have returned a verdict for the plaintiff. ... To be reasonable, the inference [or conclusion] \u2018must be based on probabilities rather than possibilities and cannot be the result of mere speculation and conjecture.\u2019 \u201d <em>Phelan </em>v. <em>May Dep\u2019t Stores Co., </em>443 Mass. 52, 55 (2004), quoting <em>Tosti </em>v. <em>Ayik, </em>394 Mass. 482, 494 (1985), and <em>McEvoy Travel Bur., Inc. </em>v. <em>Norton Co., </em>408 Mass. 704, 706 n.3 (1990). See <em>Tennant </em>v. <em>Peoria &amp; P.U.

Supp. 240, 245 (S.D.N.Y. 1996), aff\u2019d, 152 F.3d 918 (2d Cir. 1998). See also Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 876 (b) (1977) (\u201cFor harm resulting to a third person from the tortious conduct of another, one is subject to liability if he . . . knows that the other\u2019s conduct constitutes a breach of duty and gives substantial assistance or encouragement to the other . . .\u201d). The plaintiffs have cleared the first hurdle of the evidentiary requirements: establishing that the Benistar defendants both breached their fiduciary duties to them and wrongfully converted their funds. The question is whether they provided evidence sufficient for the jury reasonably to conclude that Merrill Lynch had \u201cknowledge of\u201d and \u201csubstantially assisted\u201d the Benistar defendants. Ryan vs. Hunton &amp; Williams, <em>supra. </em>The plaintiffs concede that the lengthy trial did not yield direct evidence of knowledge or substantial assistance. They argue, however, that the \u201cindirect, circumstantial evidence\u201d of these two elements was \u201coverwhelming.\u201d No jury reasoning from the evidence, however, would have been overwhelmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">c. <em>Knowledge of a violation. </em>We first consider whether, viewing the evidence in its light most favorable to the plaintiffs, the jury reasonably could have inferred that Merrill Lynch \u201cknew\u201d of the primary wrongs committed by the Benistar defendants. The knowledge requirement of a New York aiding and abetting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>claim demands a showing of \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of the underlying wrongdoing. See <em>Kolbeck </em>v. <em>LIT Am., Inc., supra </em>at 246, and cases cited. That the aiding and abetting defendant has been proven to have had notice or \u201cconstructive knowledge\u201d of the underlying wrong will not suffice. See, e.g., Ryan <em>vs. </em>Hunton &amp; Williams, <em>supra </em>(on motion to dismiss, allegations that defendant suspected underlying fraud insufficient to aver \u201cactual knowledge\u201d). See also <em>Kolbeck </em>v. <em>LIT Am., Inc., supra </em>at 248 (absent fiduciary duty to plaintiff, defendants\u2019 knowledge of accusations of fraud against primary wrongdoer insufficient to impute requisite \u201cactual knowledge\u201d for purposes of aiding and abetting liability).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The plaintiffs are not required to produce a \u201csmoking gun,\u201d however. Actual knowledge \u201cmay be implied from a strong inference of fraudulent intent,\u201d <em>Mazzaro de Abreu </em>v. <em>Bank of Am. Corp., supra </em>at 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">On appeal the plaintiffs set out six \u201ccategories of evidence\u201d that they argue form the basis of a reasonable inference that Merrill Lynch had \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of the Benistar defendants\u2019 underlying wrongdoing. They also argue that the jury could reasonably have inferred actual knowledge from disbelief of the Merrill Lynch defendants\u2019 testimony. On both points, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">As to evidence, the plaintiffs rely strongly on a September 22, 2000, letter Carpenter wrote to Rasmussen, protesting Merrill Lynch\u2019s decision to prohibit opening new positions in the Benistar Trust account.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In the letter Carpenter stated, among other things: \u201cWe have chosen Merrill [Lynch] as our deposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>tory for our clients so we cannot move the funds elsewhere. If we cannot trade at Merrill [Lynch], we cannot trade anywhere, and you will have doomed us to our losses in a volatile market that we were perfectly positioned to profit from.\u201d To the plaintiffs, the words \u201cdepository\u201d and \u201cclients\u201d were sufficient to inform Merrill Lynch that the Benistar Trust account contained third-party funds <em>and </em>that Carpenter was appropriating those funds for his own use in violation of his fiduciary duty to the third parties.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The link posited by the plaintiffs requires many intermediate conclusions for which there was no evidence: for instance, that the funds in the Benistar Property account were third-party funds contractually required to be held in escrow and that Benistar Trust\u2019s agreements with the third parties did not permit using the funds for speculative trading. Even assuming, arguendo, that the letter signified that Benistar Trust had some unspecified fiduciary duty to third-party clients relevant to the corporate accounts, the \u201crelevant \u2018knowledge\u2019 for liability to attach in a fiduciary\u2019s breach of duty is knowledge as to the primary violator\u2019s status as a fiduciary <em>and </em>knowledge that the primary\u2019s conduct contravenes a fiduciary duty\u201d (emphasis added). A.I.A. Holdings, S.A. <em>vs. </em>Lehman Bros., <em>supra, </em>quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number><em>Diduck </em>v. <em>Kaszycki &amp; Sons Contrs., </em>974 F.2d 270, 282-283 (2d Cir. 1992). It takes a leap in speculation, an impermissible leap for a jury, to tie the September 22 letter to Merrill Lynch\u2019s \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of the underlying tortious behavior. See <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Goriansky, </em>317 Mass. 10, 17 (1944), quoting <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Ry., </em>222 Mass. 475, 479 (1916) (jury\u2019s conclusion must be \u201cthe result of logical reasoning from established facts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 second category of evidence is similarly unpersuasive. This category of evidence is comprised of Rule 405 of the Rules of the New York Stock Exchange, Rule 3210 of the Rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers, and Merrill Lynch compliance policies that, in summary, require a broker or financial adviser to use \u201cdue diligence\u201d to \u201cknow the client\u201d when opening and managing the client\u2019s investment accounts. The plaintiffs argue that, because Stem and Levine both testified that they complied with the \u201cknow your client\u201d roles, the jury reasonably could conclude that Stern and Levine, and thus Merrill Lynch, knew about the nature of Benistar Trust\u2019s business<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and also the nature of its wrongdoing.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The jury might have believed Stem\u2019s and Levine\u2019s testimony that they followed the \u201cknow your client\u201d roles, in which case the jury reasonably could infer that Stem and Levine knew the nature of Benistar Trust\u2019s services. Or the jury might have disbelieved the brokers, in which case they reasonably could infer that Stern and Levine failed to follow the \u201cknow your client\u201d rules. Neither alternative translates to affirmative evidence that Merrill Lynch had actual knowledge that the Benistar Trust account contained third-party funds, and that Carpenter\u2019s high-risk options trading in the Benistar Trust account was in breach of its fiduciary duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Third, the plaintiffs laid before the jury voluminous documentary evidence of wire transfer authorizations and wire transfer confirmations for the Benistar Trust account that indicated that substantial sums flowed constantly between Benistar Trust and various third-party bank accounts, attorney trust accounts, and other accounts of an evidently custodial nature.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> A jury may well have agreed with the plaintiffs that Merrill Lynch\u2019s apparent indifference to the large volume of wire transfers was in derogation of its own written policies for detecting \u201ccon games\u201d and \u201cscams\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> (although, as the judge noted, the heavy traffic in wire transfers in the Benistar Trust account was consistent with Carpenter\u2019s alleged representations to Merrill Lynch that Benistar Trust bought and sold real estate). At most, this conclusion leads reasonably to the inference that Merrill Lynch \u201cshould have been aware\u201d of possible wrongdoings in the account. However, constructive knowledge is not \u201cactual knowledge.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Mazzaro de Abreu </em>v. <em>Bank of Am. Corp., </em>525 F. Supp. 2d 381, 388 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (knowledge of nature of transfers from bank account and large sums of money in account do not imply \u201cactual knowledge of the underlying fraud\u201d); Ryan <em>vs. </em>Hunton &amp; Williams, U.S. Dist. Ct., No. 99-CV-5938 (JG) (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 20, 2000) (bank officer\u2019s authorization of large volume of transfers between primary defendant\u2019s account and subaccounts does \u201cnot create an inference of knowledge of\u201d fraudulent scheme). See also Nigerian Nat\u2019l Petroleum Corp. vs. Citibank, N.A., U.S. Dist. Ct., No. 98 Civ. 4960 (MBM) (S.D.N.Y. July 30, 1999) (allegations of knowing or reckless disregard of irregularities in wire transfers and other \u201cbadges of fraud\u201d do not give rise to inference, \u201clet alone a \u2018strong inference\u2019 \u201d of underlying fraud).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Fourth, the jury heard testimony concerning a telephone conference call on December 19, 2000, among Stem, PaineWebber <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>compliance manager Lori Enright, Mitchell Rock (Stern\u2019s close friend and Benistar\u2019s broker at Paine Webber),<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and Steven Feit (the PaineWebber branch manager) in response to Paine Web-ber\u2019s concern about losses in the Benistar account. Enright took notes of the conference. Both Feit\u2019s testimony (in deposition) and Enright\u2019s testimony and notes reflect that Stern told them that Benistar Trust acted \u201cas a third party liaison for real estate transactions.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> From what we have said above, it is clear that Stem\u2019s information is insufficient to prove actual knowledge of Benistar Tmst\u2019s fraudulent schemes.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">We need not discuss at length the plaintiffs\u2019 two remaining categories of evidence. Testimony from several Merrill Lynch employees that they viewed the Benistar Web site homepage (which did not contain a description of Benistar Trust\u2019s business) and a linked page that had nothing to do with \u00a7 1031 like-kind exchanges has no probative value in establishing Merrill Lynch\u2019s knowledge of the primary wrongdoing.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> That Levine and Stem chose to respond to a memorandum from their compliance department requesting more information about Ben-istar Tmst by ignoring the request and praising Carpenter as an individual cannot be converted into affirmative evidence of the underlying fraud, even if, as the plaintiffs maintain, Levine and Stem responded obliquely in order to continue reaping substantial commissions from Benistar. See <em>Mazzaro de Abreu </em>v. <em>Bank of Am. Corp., supra </em>at 388-389 (allegations of \u201cprofit motive\u201d \u2014 garnering of \u201csubstantial\u201d transaction fees \u2014 insufficient of itself to support inference of actual knowledge of underlying fraud generating fees).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The indirect, circumstantial evidence amassed at trial may suggest that Merrill Lynch knew the nature of Benistar Tmst\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>business. But it does not erase the evidentiary lacunae between Merrill Lynch\u2019s knowledge of Benistar Trust\u2019s services and knowledge that Benistar Trust was violating its fiduciary agreements to clients and converting client funds by trading in the Benistar Trust corporate account. Crucially, no evidence of Merrill Lynch\u2019s actual knowledge of Benistar\u2019s agreements with its clients was presented at trial. Cf. Cronin vs. Executive House Realty, U.S. Dist. Ct., No. 80 Civ. 7254 (S.D.N.Y. May 5, 1982) (judgment n.o.v. not appropriate on claim for aiding and abetting under New York law where bank official was informed by one business partner that offering memorandum on which \u201cloan write-up\u201d was based misrepresented another partner\u2019s financial status).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Because the six categories of evidence do not support a permissible inference of actual knowledge, the plaintiffs gain nothing by claiming that their evidence acquires \u201cindependent, confirmatory force\u201d when considered in light of the jury\u2019s presumed disbelief of the \u201cimplausible,\u201d \u201cself-serving\u201d and \u201cafter-the-fact\u201d testimony of Merrill Lynch witnesses on key points. Nor can a jury\u2019s disbelief of the Merrill Lynch testimony reasonably be viewed as independent affirmative evidence supporting a conclusion that Merrill Lynch had the requisite actual knowledge of the Benistar defendants\u2019 wrongful actions. None of the cases the plaintiffs rely on helps their cause.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">d. <em>Substantial assistance of the wrongful conduct. </em>The judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>also concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to prove the third prong of a New York aiding and abetting claim: that Merrill Lynch substantially assisted in furthering the Benistar defendants\u2019 wrongful conduct. See Ryan <em>vs. </em>Hunton &amp; Williams, <em>supra. </em>Our conclusion that the plaintiffs have not met their burden of showing that Merrill Lynch had actual knowledge of the Benistar defendants\u2019 underlying tortious conduct on the evidence adduced at trial, and our affirmance of the judge\u2019s order allowing a motion for a new trial on the claims against Merrill Lynch, make it unnecessary to address the issue of substantial assistance.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">We consider now whether the judge properly ordered a new trial on the claims against Merrill Lynch.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">4. <em>New trial under Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (b) (2). </em>In a posttrial motion, the plaintiffs brought forward evidence that they argued addressed the specific deficiencies in their case that led the judge to allow Merrill Lynch\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v. We conclude that the judge did not abuse her discretion in granting the plaintiffs a new trial based on this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">a. <em>Discovery. </em>The plaintiffs\u2019 request for posttrial relief must be situated in the context of the contentious discovery disputes which marred this litigation, and in which Merrill Lynch repeatedly and over a considerable period before, right up to and during the trial failed to meet its discovery obligations despite multiple and focused discovery requests of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Merrill Lynch produced a limited, initial set of documents in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>March, 2001, in response to two subpoenas duces tecum from the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> However, Merrill Lynch then refused to answer the plaintiffs\u2019 interrogatories and document requests for the six months from October, 2001, until a motion to compel was allowed in March, 2002, first arguing that it was not subject to interrogatories or document requests because it was not yet a party defendant, and later arguing that it was not subject to such requests because \u201cby the time Merrill Lynch was made a party ... the deadline for discovery had already clearly passed.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The judge allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to compel Merrill Lynch to respond to written discovery in March, 2002.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> This was not the end of the matter, however. Merrill Lynch\u2019s refusal to produce certain other documents, in particular its policy and procedure manuals, led to additional rounds of increasingly specific motions to compel production.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Numerous documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>responsive to the plaintiffs\u2019 requests for Merrill Lynch\u2019s records concerning the Benistar account were not produced by Merrill Lynch until much later \u2014 in some cases, until the middle of the trial. Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch fought a separate battle on the issue of depositions.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">On the eve of trial in late November, 2002, Merrill Lynch produced additional relevant documents concerning its internal review of the Benistar account.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> On the second day of trial, Merrill Lynch disclosed information about the expected testimony of one of its witnesses, Rasmussen, the Merrill Lynch employee who had made the decision to shut down the Benistar account, and whom the plaintiffs had unsuccessfully attempted to depose in advance of trial. This information led the plaintiffs to suspect that Rasmussen\u2019s files, which should have included documents concerning Merrill Lynch\u2019s supervision of the Benistar account, had not been produced to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs therefore moved for the immediate production of those documents, along with those of another witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">On Sunday, December 1, 2002, at around 8 p.m., after pretrial motions and the first five days of trial, and with testimony set to resume the next morning after a Thanksgiving hiatus, Merrill Lynch transmitted additional documents by facsimile to the plaintiffs. These documents, and more that Merrill Lynch produced the next morning as the trial resumed, included documents related to Merrill Lynch\u2019s supervision of the Benistar account that Merrill Lynch admitted it previously had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>produced.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The plaintiffs argued that these documents, which contained \u201cmany new names\u201d the plaintiffs previously had not seen, and some of which concerned Merrill Lynch\u2019s internal compliance review of the Benistar account, fell within not only the plaintiffs\u2019 discovery requests dating back to 2001, but also multiple motions to compel production that the judge had allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">It is undisputed that even after this additional extraordinarily late round of document production, Merrill Lynch at no time produced the documents described below, which became the subject of the plaintiffs\u2019 rule 60 (b) (2) motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">b. <em>Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (b) (2). </em>The purpose of rule 60, which governs posttrial relief, is \u201cto strike a proper balance between the conflicting principles that litigation must be brought to an end and that justice should be done.\u201d 11 C.A. Wright, A.R. Miller, &amp; M.K. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2851 (2d ed. 1995). A party seeking postjudgment relief on grounds of \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d invokes rule 60 (b) (2), and must satisfy four requirements: \u201c(1) the evidence has been discovered since the trial; (2) the evidence could not by due diligence have been discovered earlier by the movant; (3) the evidence is not merely cumulative or impeaching; and (4) the evidence is of such a nature that it would probably change the result were a new trial to be granted.\u201d <em>United States Steel </em>v. <em>M. DeMatteo Constr. Co., </em>315 F.3d 43, 52 (1st Cir. 2002), citing <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>United States, </em>141 F.3d 8, 18 (1st Cir. 1998).<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">The trial judge \u201ctypically has an intimate, first-hand know<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>ledge of the case, and, thus, is best positioned to determine whether the justification proffered in support of a [rjule 60 (b) motion should serve to override the opposing party\u2019s rights and the law\u2019s institutional interest in finality.\u201d <em>Karak </em>v. <em>Bursaw Oil Corp., </em>288 F.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir. 2002). \u201cConsequently, we defer broadly to the [judge\u2019s] informed discretion in granting or denying relief from judgment, and we review [the] ruling solely for abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This deferential standard is particularly appropriate where, as here, the judge who ruled on the rule 60 (b) (2) motion is not only the same judge who presided over the trial, but also the same judge who presided over the discovery phase of the litigation and so was intimately familiar with the parties\u2019 discovery conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">c. <em>Newly discovered evidence: Patterson. </em>The newly discovered evidence submitted by the plaintiffs was twofold: an affidavit and accompanying exhibits submitted by a Massachusetts attorney not affiliated with the litigation and an affidavit submitted by the defendant Paley. The more significant of these was the affidavit and accompanying exhibits provided by attorney David Patterson of Newton. In 1998, Patterson represented an individual who sought to effectuate a \u00a7 1031 transaction, and who retained Benistar as the qualified intermediary for the property exchange.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> According to findings of fact of the judge, between October 21 and 23, 1998, Patterson communicated several times by telephone and in writing with Merrill Lynch\u2019s Levine in order, in Patterson\u2019s words, to \u201cmake sure specifically that Merrill Lynch understood that these were escrow funds, and that [Merrill Lynch had] a general understanding of how this transaction was meant to work.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Levine was not a mere passive recipient of information from Patterson. He actively sought to respond to Patterson\u2019s concerns. On October 22, Le<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>vine responded to a request from Patterson by transmitting to him some account forms by facsimile. The next day, Patterson sent Levine, both by mail and by facsimile transmission, a copy of the escrow agreement that his client had signed with Benistar regarding the funds to be kept at Merrill Lynch, and a copy of the exchange agreement that his client had signed with Benistar and the seller of the property she was purchasing through the \u00a7 1031 transaction, along with a cover letter. The escrow agreement, which is titled \u201cEscrow Agreement\u201d in bold capital letters, explains in some detail that Patterson\u2019s client, in order to effectuate a \u00a7 1031 property exchange, \u201cwill be depositing with Benistar an amount of funds to be deposited in the Beni-star accounts at Merrill Lynch,\u201d and that these funds are to be held in an \u201cescrow custodial account\u201d at Merrill Lynch for the benefit of Patterson\u2019s client. The exchange agreement makes abundantly clear the nature of the \u00a7 1031 transaction and Beni-star\u2019s role as an intermediary.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Years after Patterson\u2019s client\u2019s transaction was completed, Patterson saw a newspaper article in the Boston Globe about the trial and subsequent proceedings in this case and, with his client\u2019s permission, contacted the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. In March, 2004, he provided an affidavit attesting to his communications with Levine, along with copies of the written communications and telephone and billing records indicating the relevant telephone calls and corroborating the dates of the facsimiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The import of this evidence is readily apparent. Far from being merely cumulative or impeaching, it cuts to the heart of Merrill Lynch\u2019s argument in its successful motion for judgment n.o.v. that Merrill Lynch had no \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of the nature of Benistar Trust\u2019s business or the nature of its misdeeds. In a May, 2002, pretrial affidavit in support of Merrill Lynch\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and again at trial, Levine denied knowing any of these facts about Benistar Trust\u2019s business during the relevant period; Levine also pointedly denied having any contact with any of Benistar Trust\u2019s clients in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Massachusetts.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Moreover, Levine testified at trial that, if he had been aware that the Benistar Trust account held third-party or client funds, Merrill Lynch would not have permitted Benistar Trust to open corporate accounts or to engage in option trading with the funds. In light of subsequent developments, it would be reasonable for a jury not to credit this testimony.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> In allowing Merrill Lynch\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v., the judge found that there was \u201cno dispute\u201d that \u201cno one at Merrill Lynch ever saw any of the written agreements\u201d that would have revealed that the funds were being held in escrow for the benefit of the plaintiffs, to whom Benistar Trust owed a fiduciary duty as an intermediary, a conclusion that cannot be sustained in the face of the Patterson evidence.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The Patterson evidence, if believed, shows what Merrill Lynch knew about Benistar Trust\u2019s business, its arrangements with its clients, and its misdeeds, allowing a jury to find, in the judge\u2019s words, that Merrill Lynch \u201cknew one or more of the other defendants was or were breaching fiduciary duties owed to clients, converting client funds, or both.\u201d The judge found the Patterson evidence credible and persuasive. In light of that, she made specific findings that Merrill Lynch was in direct com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>munication with the Massachusetts representative of at least one Benistar client, and that in the course of this communication, that representative (Patterson) sent Merrill Lynch multiple copies of the legal agreements specifying Benistar\u2019s role as an intermediary holding third-party funds in escrow in its account at Merrill Lynch. In addition, the judge found that, notwithstanding Levine\u2019s amended affidavit testimony to the contrary, see note 47, <em>supra, </em>in fact Patterson did explain to Levine, in a telephone conversation, both the nature of a \u00a7 1031 exchange and the fact that Patterson\u2019s client\u2019s funds would be held in escrow at Merrill Lynch in the Benistar account. She concluded that such evidence satisfied the requirements of rule 60 (b) (2). It \u201cis not merely cumulative or impeaching\u201d and \u201cis of such a nature that it would probably change the result were a new trial to be granted,\u201d satisfying the third and fourth requirements of the rule. <em>United States Steel </em>v. <em>M. DeMatteo Constr. Co., </em>315 F.3d 43, 52 (1st Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">We reject Merrill Lynch\u2019s contention that the Patterson evidence was not, in fact, \u201cdiscovered since the trial\u201d or, in the alternative, that it could \u201cby due diligence have been discovered earlier by the movant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The basis for both of these claims is the undisputed fact that the cover letter from Patterson to Levine was in the plaintiffs\u2019 possession before trial. It was not Merrill Lynch that produced this document, or any other record of Levine\u2019s communications with Patterson. A copy of the cover letter sent by Patterson to Levine was produced by Paley in response to the plaintiffs\u2019 pretrial document request.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> In any event, as the judge noted, the cover letter, by itself, would not establish \u201cactual knowledge\u201d on the part of Merrill Lynch.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> It is Patterson\u2019s affidavit, which details his oral and written communications with Merrill Lynch, that gives the document Paley <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>produced in discovery its meaning and force. It is undisputed that the Patterson affidavit itself, along with the escrow agreement, the \u00a7 1031 property exchange agreement, and the records of telephone conversations and facsimiles that together comprise the Patterson evidence, have all been discovered \u201csince the trial.\u201d Merrill Lynch\u2019s sweeping statement that \u201cthe \u2018newly\u2019 discovered Patterson documents had been produced to and were in possession of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u201d before trial is far from accurate.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">We also agree with the judge that the plaintiffs met their burden of showing that the Patterson evidence could not by due diligence have been discovered earlier by the movant. Parties to litigation are required to exercise due diligence in the search for relevant information, but the degree of diligence required to satisfy the strictures of rule 60 (b) (2) is not unlimited. See <em>Kettenbach </em>v. <em>Demoulas, </em>901 F. Supp. 486, 495 (D. Mass. 1995) (\u201cfailure to pursue discovery to the utmost limit does not preclude a successful Rule 60 [b] [2] motion\u201d), citing <em>Krock </em>v. <em>Electric Motor &amp; Repair Co., </em>339 F.2d 73, 74-75 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 934 (1964) (failing to make full use of discovery does not require finding of lack of due diligence).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">This is not a case where the movant under rule 60 (b) (2) failed to make the discovery requests of the nonmoving party that would have yielded the evidence before trial. See, e.g., <em>Zurich N. Am. </em>v. <em>Matrix Serv., Inc., </em>426 F.3d 1281, 1290 (10th Cir. 2005) (documents not newly discovered when plaintiff knew documentation was missing \u201calmost a year prior to the start of trial,\u201d made \u201cno attempt to explicitly include it\u201d in the discovery process, and abandoned its requests for the documents for over one year). This is not a case where the movant failed to exercise due diligence by failing to call an important witness of whom the moving party was aware before trial, see <em>Parilla-Lopez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>841 F.2d 16, 19 (1st Cir. 1988) (\u201cthe appellant himself admits that he was aware, before trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>of the policeman\u2019s identity and knowledge concerning the accident\u201d); or making a strategic choice not to pursue the evidence, see <em>Knott </em>v. <em>Racicot, </em>442 Mass. 314, 325 (2004), or failing to exercise \u201ceven minimal diligence.\u201d <em>Karak </em>v. <em>Bursaw Oil Corp., </em>288 F.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir. 2002) (moving party \u201cfails to explain why this evidence could not have been found, well before the entry of judgment, in the exercise of even minimal diligence\u201d). Here the plaintiffs\u2019 repeated efforts at increasingly tailored discovery were impeded at nearly every turn by Merrill Lynch.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">It is unnecessary to decide whether Merrill Lynch deliberately withheld or destroyed the key documents that it did not produce. However, as the judge found, \u201cit is at least fair to say that Merrill Lynch <em>should </em>have had these documents in its files, which would have led to their production\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> (emphasis in original). The plaintiffs made pretrial document requests that squarely covered the documents. A party \u201ctreads on thin ice when he argues that [the plaintiffs] could have uncovered [the evidence] had [the] [p]laintiffs been more persistent in pursuing depositions and document discovery when several [court] orders . . . were necessary to compel discovery to move forward.\u201d <em>Ketten-bach </em>v. Demoulas, 901 F. Supp. 486, 495 (D. Mass. 1995). It would reward obstruction of the orderly process of litigation effectively to penalize the plaintiffs for failing to discover what Merrill Lynch, for whatever reason, failed to produce in a timely manner, or failed to produce at all. The conduct of the nonmov-ing party is relevant to the question whether the moving party in a rule 60 (b) (2) motion exercised due diligence. See, e.g., <em>Alpern </em>v. <em>UtiliCorp United, Inc., </em>84 F.3d 1525, 1536 (8th Cir. 1996); <em>Kettenbach </em>v. <em>Demoulas, supra </em>(rule 60 [b] [2] motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>allowed as to newly discovered tape recording containing an incriminating conversation with person who was apparently coconspirator with defendant where plaintiff\u2019s failure to depose coconspirator, whose identity was unknown before trial but might have been discovered, was due in part to defendant\u2019s own discovery abuses). We conclude that the judge, who was, as we noted earlier, intimately familiar with both the plaintiffs\u2019 attempts to obtain discovery and Merrill Lynch\u2019s resistance to that discovery, did not abuse her discretion in finding no lack of due diligence on the part of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">d. <em>Newly discovered evidence: Paley. </em>The plaintiffs also offered as newly discovered evidence a separate affidavit from Paley. At trial, Paley invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and refused to answer any questions. See note 13, <em>supra. </em>In his posttrial affidavit, Paley averred that in October, 1998, he had at least one very specific conversation with Levine in which he explained Benistar Trust\u2019s business as an intermediary for \u00a7 1031 transactions, and explained that the funds in the Benistar Trust account at Merrill Lynch were third-party client funds. The judge found that the Paley evidence, if credible, would support the conclusion that Merrill Lynch had \u201cactual knowledge\u201d that the Benistar Trust account contained funds held in escrow for third-party clients, and provided \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d to Benistar in misusing those funds. On the other hand, she also concluded that Paley\u2019s credibility was \u201cextremely questionable\u201d because his sworn statement was given in return for the plaintiffs\u2019 agreement to release Paley from damages \u201cwell in excess of $16 million.\u201d Because the Patterson evidence alone was sufficient to warrant allowing the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for posttrial relief under rule 60 (b) (2), we need not reach the question whether the Paley evidence alone would justify a new trial.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> The plaintiffs are free to attempt to introduce the Paley evidence at the new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The plaintiffs argue that, rather than granting a new trial, the court should allow their motion to reinstate the jury verdict. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>are mindful of the burden on all parties that a new trial represents. But the judge was correct in concluding that the plaintiffs\u2019 preferred remedy would be inappropriate here. Even after the introduction of the newly discovered evidence, disputed issues of material fact remain; the credibility of the witnesses and documentary evidence must be weighed by the fact finder. As the plaintiffs would not be entitled to summary judgment, they are not entitled to reinstate the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">5. <em>Remaining claims. </em>The judge denied the motion of Carpenter, Molly Carpenter, and Benistar Ltd. to dismiss the claims against them for lack of personal jurisdiction. The Benistar defendants argue on appeal that the judge lacked personal jurisdiction over any of the Benistar defendants with the exception of Benistar Trust. We have carefully considered their arguments in light of the evidence on the question. For essentially the reasons articulated by the judge and by the Appeals Court, we affirm. See <em>Cahaly </em>v. <em>Benistar Prop. Exch. Trust Co., </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 668, 676-677 (2007). The Benistar defendants also appeal from the judge\u2019s denial of their motion for a new trial. Again, after careful consideration of the arguments, and for essentially the reasons articulated by the judge and by the Appeals Court, we affirm. See <em>id. </em>at 677-678. After careful consideration we likewise reject the remaining contentions of the Benistar defendants for essentially the reasons offered by the trial judge and the Appeals Court. See <em>id. </em>at 678-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">6. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the denial of the Benistar defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial and the entry of judgment against the Benistar defendants. We affirm the decision to grant judgment n.o.v. to Merrill Lynch. We affirm the decision granting the plaintiffs a new trial of their claims against Merrill Lynch.

The applications filed by the other defendants (Merrill Lynch and the Benistar defendants) did not seek relief against PaineWebber. See <em>Bradford </em>v. <em>Baystate Med.

At her deposition, Molly Carpenter invoked both the \u201cspousal privilege\u201d and \u201call other applicable privileges\u201d; the judge determined that only the Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination applied. At trial, Paley again responded to every question by invoking his Fifth Amendment rights. Carpenter and Molly Carpenter did not appear at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Benistar Trust charged the plaintiffs a flat fee for its services as a \u00a7 1031 qualified intermediary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b368-9\">The Merrill Lynch account opening documents, prepared by Gerald Le<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>vine and signed by Carpenter and (in some cases) Molly Carpenter, identified the business of Benistar Trust as \u201creal estate transactions\u201d and \u201creal estate,\u201d information that Levine testified came directly from Carpenter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b369-8\">An \u201cuncovered\u201d option strategy involves contracting to buy or sell a particular security, which one does not own, on a date in the future, for an agreed price. Because the actual price of the security on the date when the option expires may be much higher or lower than the agreed price, large gains or losses may result. For uncovered calls, in which one contracts to sell at an agreed price, the potential losses are unlimited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Although Merrill Lynch authorized Carpenter to engage in uncovered option trading in several Benistar Trust accounts, most of the option trading was done through one Benistar Trust account identified at trial as the \u201cB10 account.\u201d For the sake of convenience, we shall refer hereafter to the Benistar Trust \u201caccount,\u201d in the singular.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b369-10\">As the judge stated in her memorandum of decision and order on the plaintiffs\u2019 claims pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, the evidence showed that Carpenter \u201cwas unquestionably the person entirely or virtually entirely responsible for authorizing and directing the uncovered option trading with the plaintiffs\u2019 funds\u201d at Merrill Lynch.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b370-8\">A Merrill Lynch memorandum introduced in evidence notes that Carpenter \u201cwas up approximately $200,000 near the end of March 2000 and dropped about $1,000,000 over the option expiration period of April and May.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b372-7\">It is uncontested that Merrill Lynch did not owe a fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs. See <em>Morin </em>v. <em>Trupin, </em>823 F. Supp. 201, 207 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (broker of packaged real estate deals does not owe fiduciary duty to plaintiffs where he had \u201cno control\u201d over materials forming basis of primary tortfeasor\u2019s fraud).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b372-8\">In the September 22, 2000, letter, Carpenter stated that he was writing \u201cto lodge an official complaint\u201d about Merrill Lynch\u2019s prohibiting Benistar Trust from opening new positions. There was considerable testimony at trial about whether the letter constituted the type of complaint that was required to be reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Robert Lau, an expert testifying on behalf of Merrill Lynch, Rasmussen, and Duffy, and the Merrill Lynch attorney to whom he referred the letter all testified that the letter was not the type of complaint required to be reported to the SEC. The judge, correctly in our view, rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the Merrill Lynch defendants\u2019 testimony on this matter was false and therefore probative evidence of liability, see <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Santosuosso, </em>307 Mass. 302, 349 (1940), on the ground that testimony about whether the letter constituted a reportable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>complaint was \u201cconfusing\u201d and that, in any event, had Merrill Lynch reported the letter as a \u201ccomplaint,\u201d the form in which it was required to do so would not have triggered further investigation by any regulatory authority \u201cor anyone else.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b373-6\">In further support of this assertion, the plaintiffs point to evidence from a section of the Merrill Lynch \u201cCompliance Outline\u201d (an internal document distributed to brokers in its private client division) on \u201cMoney Laundering, Con Games and Trading Abuses\u201d that advises brokers to avoid schemes using \u201cintermediate\u201d or \u201cdepository\u201d accounts. The reference does not define \u201cdepository\u201d but does indicate that such accounts are held for the benefit of third parties. In any event, it is insufficiently revelatory of the tortious conduct at issue reasonably to lead to an inference that Merrill Lynch had \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of the Benistar defendants\u2019 wrongs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b373-7\">It is undisputed that, based on the <em>trial evidence, </em>no one at Benistar Trust directly informed anyone at Merrill Lynch that the funds in the Benistar Trust account belonged to third parties and that Carpenter was misusing those funds in violation of his agreements with those third parties. Levine, Rasmussen, Stern, and Duffy testified that Carpenter had told them that the money in the accounts was all his. Moreover, Rasmussen, Levine, and Merrill Lynch attorney Kevin Duffy all testified, without contradiction, that they considered the reference to \u201cclients\u201d to mean Carpenter\u2019s or Benistar\u2019s other companies. Stem and Levine also testified that they considered Benistar Tmst and Carpenter to be one and the same for purposes of the Merrill Lynch accounts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Several witnesses for Merrill Lynch testified that not only did they not know the actual nature of Benistar Trust\u2019s business as a \u201cqualified intermediary\u201d under \u00a7 1031, but they also had no understanding of \u00a7 1031 or its requirements until the first of the plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuits was filed in January, 2001.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The plaintiffs also argue that the words \u201cproperty exchange\u201d and \u201ctrust\u201d in Benistar Trust\u2019s corporate name was a loud, clear announcement to Merrill Lynch of the nature of Carpenter\u2019s business and of the underlying tortious conduct. The references in Benistar Trust\u2019s corporate name are insufficient under New York law to support the scienter requirement of an aiding and abetting claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The plaintiffs also introduced evidence that Merrill Lynch brokers were instructed that large volumes of wire transfer activity in an account may signal a fraudulent scheme and should be reported to the office of the general counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b375-7\">In addition, a jury may well have agreed that such indifference violated Merrill Lynch\u2019s obligations under Rule 405 of the Rules of the New York Stock Exchange to \u201c[u]se due diligence to learn the essential facts relative to every customer, every order, every cash or margin account accepted or carried....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Rock\u2019s participation in the conference call was confined to making introductions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Enright and Feit also testified that they did not ask Carpenter to elaborate on this description.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b376-9\">Referring to Benistar\u2019s Web site, Hassan Tabbah testified without elaboration that he \u201chit the website,\u201d perhaps in Stern\u2019s presence. Stem testified that he merely glanced at the Web site once when he was in Tabbah\u2019s office, and Levine testified that the only link on the Benistar Web site that he visited concerned an unrelated tax strategy. These witnesses denied seeing any information on the Web site concerning Benistar Trust\u2019s role as a qualified intermediary for \u00a7 1031 plans.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b377-7\">See <em>Janigan </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>344 F.2d 781, 784-785 (1st Cir. 1965) (evidence that, among other things, defendant was in charge of corporation and had detailed knowledge of its operations permitted jury to infer defendant\u2019s full knowledge of company\u2019s affairs from disbelief of his testimony of ignorance). See also <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Goriansky, 317 </em>Mass. 10, 16-17 (1944) (\u201cThe defendant urges that disbelief of testimony was not evidence to the contrary. . . .

But where a material fact is established by evidence <em>and </em>it is shown that a defendant\u2019s testimony as to that fact was wilfully untrue, this circumstance not only furnishes a ground for disbelieving other testimony of this defendant. . . but also tends to show consciousness of guilt or liability on his part and has probative force in connection with <em>other </em>evidence on the issue of such guilt or liability\u201d [emphases added]); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 268, 274 (1982), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>384 Mass. 647, 653 (1981) (jury could fairly infer evidence of guilt from disbelief of automobile accident defendant\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>where physical evidence such as location and condition of automobile, among other things, supported probable inference of liability; \u201c[w]hile proof of mere consciousness of guilt alone may be insufficient to convict of crime. . . evidence of such a state of mind when coupled with other probable inferences, may be sufficient to amass the quantum of proof necessary to prove guilt\u201d). See Cronin vs. Executive House Realty, U.S. Dist. Ct., No. 80 Civ. 7254 (S.D.N.Y. May 5, 1982) (evidence of direct communication to aiding and abetting defendant of concerns about primary defendant\u2019s solvency and authority leads to inference that aiding and abetting defendant\u2019s actions in failing to conduct normal credit checks and accepting certain promissory notes furthered wrongdoing). Here, as described above, the plaintiffs failed at trial to produce the affirmative evidence that would have allowed a reasonable inference of actual knowledge to be drawn.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b378-10\">Our decision on the aiding and abetting claim makes it unnecessary to address the plaintiffs\u2019 parenthetical argument that the jury\u2019s verdicts in favor of the plaintiffs on the New York Consumer Protection Act and the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act should be reinstated on the evidence presented concerning aiding and abetting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b379-6\">At the time of this initial document production, which Merrill Lynch\u2019s counsel later stated in an affidavit \u201cwas handled by a paralegal employed by Merrill Lynch,\u201d Merrill Lynch was not yet named as a defendant in the case. Merrill Lynch was initially a reach and apply defendant and a trustee process defendant in two of the consolidated actions. The plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint to add Merrill Lynch as a party defendant in September, 2001; the motion was allowed in January, 2002.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Merrill Lynch\u2019s position was that the plaintiffs should be afforded <em>no </em>opportunity to serve Merrill Lynch with interrogatories or document requests because Merrill Lynch was not named as a party until after the expiration of a deadline set by a scheduling order that predated Merrill Lynch\u2019s involvement as a party defendant in the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b379-8\">The judge required that the plaintiffs, if they in fact chose to seek written discovery from Merrill Lynch, submit to any written discovery requests by Merrill Lynch as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b379-9\">The plaintiffs filed an emergency motion to compel production of, inter alla, Merrill Lynch\u2019s policy and procedure manuals, in June, 2002; this motion was allowed in part over Merrill Lynch\u2019s opposition. Other parts of the order allowing this motion were modified after an emergency motion for reconsideration by Merrill Lynch was granted in part and denied in part, but Merrill Lynch specifically was required to produce \u201cany such manuals, or portions of manuals, that are responsive to [specifically numbered] requests.\u201d In October, 2002, the plaintiffs filed yet another motion to compel Merrill Lynch to produce its policy and procedure manuals for inspection and copying, which Merrill Lynch again opposed on the ground that it already had responded adequately by making available some portions of its manuals. This resulted in yet another order from the judge, less than one month before trial, specifically ordering that the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel be permitted to inspect, and copy relevant portions of, two particular manuals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Merrill Lynch allowed the plaintiffs to depose its employee Stern in October, 2001, but fought the plaintiffs\u2019 attempts to depose other witnesses whom the plaintiffs learned were involved in Merrill Lynch\u2019s supervision of the Benistar account. Merrill Lynch unsuccessfully opposed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to compel depositions from two key employees, Levine and Tabbah; this motion to compel was allowed and the depositions taken in February, 2002. The plaintiffs\u2019 motion to compel the deposition of an additional employee, Rasmussen, who proved to be an important witness at trial, was denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b380-8\">The plaintiffs characterized these documents as \u201cnew\u201d computer printouts showing Merrill Lynch\u2019s reviews of the Benistar account, naming new individuals at Merrill Lynch not previously known to the plaintiffs who were involved in those reviews. Merrill Lynch argued that these documents previously had been made available to the plaintiffs at a witness deposition. Resolving this dispute would require additional documents that are not part of the record on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b381-8\">An affidavit of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel avers that there were approximately 140 pages of documents not previously produced by Merrill Lynch.

In his opening argument, he stated that \u201c[n]o one ever called Merrill Lynch\u201d and no \u201cdocuments . . . were ever provided to Merrill Lynch\u201d that would have revealed that \u201cthis was third-party money.\u201d In his closing argument, he again emphasized that none of the plaintiffs ever had communicated with Merrill Lynch: \u201cAll it would have taken was one telephone call to Merrill Lynch by one of these plaintiffs to alert Merrill Lynch to what was going on . . . That call never came.\u201d Although Patterson\u2019s client was not a plaintiff, the judge found that his telephone call alerted Merrill Lynch in precisely this way to the fact that Benistar was trading with the funds of clients to whom it owed a fiduciary duty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b384-7\">See notes 47 and 51, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b384-8\">After the plaintiffs brought forward the Patterson evidence, Levine averred in an amended affidavit that \u201cit appears that I sent a facsimile in October 1998 to a David Patterson.\u201d Levine no longer denied all contact with Patterson.
