(Bell Atlantic Mobile), the successor in interest to Bell Atlantic Mobile of Massachusetts LLC, is a provider of what is popularly known as \u201ccell phone\u201d service. As currently organized, Bell Atlantic Mobile is a Bermuda corporation doing business in Massachusetts under the name \u201cVerizon Wireless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">For fiscal year 2004, the Commissioner of Revenue centrally valued Bell Atlantic Mobile\u2019s property, treating it as a \u201ctelephone company\u201d for purposes of G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 39; however, the commissioner determined that Bell Atlantic Mobile was not eligible for the property tax exemption granted to certain utility corporations<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because it was not incorporated as of January 1, 2003. Bell Atlantic Mobile appealed under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 39, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>to the Appellate Tax Board (board), naming as appellees both the commissioner and the boards of assessors of the 220 municipalities in which it owns property (\u201c\u00a7 39 appeals\u201d). In each of the \u00a7 39 appeals, Bell Atlantic Mobile argued that the commissioner\u2019s valuation of its property was too high, both because it included property that should have been subject to the corporate utility exemption, and because the commissioner\u2019s valuation methodology was improper. Each \u00a7 39 appeal also sought abatement of property taxes from the relevant board of assessors.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Seeking the same relief under other provisions, Bell Atlantic Mobile filed separate appeals pursuant to G. L. c. 59, \u00a7\u00a764 and 65, requesting abatement of property taxes paid to the 220 cities and towns in which its personal property was located (\u201c\u00a7 65 appeals\u201d). Meanwhile, the board of assessors of Newton filed its own \u00a7 39 appeal, arguing that Bell Atlantic Mobile was not a \u201ctelephone company\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 39, and that the commissioner had therefore erred in centrally valuing its property. The Newton assessors argued, additionally, that the commissioner had undervalued the taxable property.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The board consolidated the \u00a7 39 appeals and the \u00a7 65 appeals. It then bifurcated the issues for trial, holding hearings first on the issue of Bell Atlantic Mobile\u2019s eligibility for central valuation and the corporate utility exemption, and deferring all questions of the correct value of the taxable property.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The board decided the consolidated \u00a7 39 appeals on May 15, 2006, holding that neither Bell Atlantic Mobile nor its limited liability company predecessor was a \u201ctelephone company\u201d entitled to central valuation under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 39. The same day, the board also issued an order in the \u00a7 65 appeals, ruling that because Bell Atlantic Mobile was not a \u201ctelephone company\u201d at any time, it was not eligible either for central valuation under \u00a7 39 or for the corporate utility exemption under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Sixteenth (1) <em>(d). </em>The board stayed further action on the \u00a7 65 appeals to allow the parties to seek judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>review of its decision that Bell Atlantic Mobile is not entitled to central valuation under \u00a7 39.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Bell Atlantic Mobile appealed. We granted Bell Atlantic Mobile\u2019s application for direct appellate review, and we affirm the decision of the board.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><em>Discussion. </em>Our review of a board decision is limited to questions of law. <em>Towle </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>397 Mass. 599, 601 (1986). See G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13. We will not disturb the board\u2019s findings so long as they are supported by substantial evidence and a correct application of the law. <em>Koch </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>416 Mass. 540, 555 (1993). The proper interpretation of a statute is a question of law for us to resolve. See <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>422 Mass. 666, 675 n.12 (1996), quoting <em>Massachusetts Community College Council MTA/NEA </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>402 Mass. 352, 353 (1988) (\u201cthe duty ultimately to interpret the statute rests with the court\u201d). As the board is an agency charged with administration of the tax law, however, its interpretations of tax statutes \u201cmay be given weight by this court.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>McGraw-Hill, Inc., </em>383 Mass. 397, 401 (1981), quoting <em>Xtra, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>380 Mass. 277, 283 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The board made extensive findings of fact, based on substantial evidence, regarding the development and operation of wireless cellular telecommunications technology. Cellular \u201ctelephones\u201d use radio frequencies licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to transmit voice and data over a network of radio antennae mounted on towers and buildings. When a subscriber to \u201ccell phone\u201d service presses the \u201csend\u201d button on a handset, a radio signal is transmitted to a nearby cellular base station. The signal transmits information identifying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>the subscriber, the originating handset, and the number the subscriber is trying to reach. The handset must continually monitor and transmit its location so as to maintain a connection as the handset\u2019s location changes. The base station receiving the transmission sends the signal to a mobile telephone switching office (MTSO), which then transmits the call either to another cellular base station (if the recipient is also a \u201ccell phone\u201d subscriber) or to the copper or fiber-optic lines owned by the local telephone company or a long-distance carrier (if the recipient is a wired telephone, or \u201cland-line,\u201d user).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">The handset is powered by an internal battery; the electricity generated by the battery, however, does not leave the handset. The signal sent and received by the handset is radio frequency, not electricity. Therefore, Bell Atlantic Mobile\u2019s wireless cellular telecommunications network is classified as a commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) and regulated under G. L. c. 159, the common carrier statute. The board found that wireless cellular telecommunications technology and telephone technology developed on \u201cparallel but distinct tracks,\u201d and that the two technologies are both conceptually and historically separate.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Neither the relevant tax statutes \u2014 G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 39 (central valuation); G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Sixteenth (1) <em>(d) </em>(corporate utility exemption); and G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 52A (definition of \u201cutility\u201d) \u2014 nor G. L. c. 166, which regulates \u201ctelephone and telegraph companies,\u201d provides a specific definition of \u201ctelephone company.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Legislature has, however, created a comprehensive regulatory framework governing \u201ctelephone companies\u201d in G. L. c. 166. We therefore look to that chapter for guidance in determining whether a CMRS provider such as Bell Atlantic Mobile qualifies as a \u201ctelephone company.\u201d See <em>FMR Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>441 Mass. 810, 819 (2004), quoting <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513-514 (1975) (where \u201ctwo or more statutes relate to the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>subject matter, they should be construed together so as to constitute a harmonious whole consistent with the legislative purpose\u201d). As the board concluded, most of the provisions of G. L. c. 166 are simply inapplicable to CMRS providers. For example, G. L. c. 166, \u00a7\u00a7 1-10, concern various stock subscription and filing requirements that must be satisfied before a telephone company may \u201ccommence the construction of its line.\u201d G. L. c. 166, \u00a7 1. Section 15D concerns safety measures for telephone company employees working in areas where telephone cables are located in common trenches with energized electrical cables; \u00a7\u00a7 21 through 42B relate to poles and wires. Sections 16 through 20 govern telegraph companies. Bell Atlantic Mobile does not own or need poles, wires, pipes, or underground conduits; it has not argued that it is a telegraph company. Although in the past Bell Atlantic Mobile and other CMRS providers filed annual returns pursuant to G. L. c. 166, \u00a7 11, Bell Atlantic Mobile has apparently not filed such a return since 1993, and there is no evidence that the Department of Public Utilities or the Department of Telecommunications and Energy<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> has taken any enforcement action against Bell Atlantic Mobile, or any other CMRS, for failure to so file.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">In contrast, as a CMRS provider, Bell Atlantic Mobile is regulated under G. L. c. 159, which governs common carriers. Bell Atlantic Mobile notes, correctly, that land-line telephone companies are also considered common carriers and thus are regulated under both G. L. c. 159 and G. L. c. 166. We fail to see, however, why that fact requires a conclusion that CMRS providers are regulated under G. L. c. 166. The language and structure of the regulatory statutes support the conclusion that the Legislature does not consider CMRS providers such as Bell Atlantic Mobile to be \u201ctelephone companies.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The board found additional support for its conclusion in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>analysis of the corporate utility exemption granted by G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Sixteenth (1) <em>(d). </em>The board examined the list, set forth in G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 52A, of the kind of utility companies entitled to the exemption, and noted that the listed businesses (which include, in addition to telephone and telegraph companies, electric and gas companies, water and aqueduct companies, railroads and railroad terminal companies, street railways, electric railroads, trackless trolleys, and natural gas pipeline companies) all shared a common characteristic: an extensive, physically interconnected distribution infrastructure. The board noted also that all of the listed businesses have historically been considered \u201cnatural monopolies\u201d because the extensive capital investment required to create the infrastructure for such a business tends to discourage competition, so that these businesses have historically been allowed to operate as monopolies subject to more extensive government regulation of entry and rates. CMRS providers, in contrast, do not utilize the type of physically connected distribution infrastructure needed by the utilities listed in \u00a7 52A; moreover, CMRS providers are highly competitive, and they are not subject to the entry and rate regulation historically applied to \u00a7 52A utilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Finally, the board pointed out that reference to each utility listed in \u00a7 52A is accompanied by a reference to the statute under which it is regulated. Therefore, a telephone or telegraph company would qualify for the corporate utility exemption only if it were \u201csubject to [regulation under] chapter one hundred and sixty-six.\u201d G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 52A. The board reasoned that these specific references to the relevant regulatory authorities indicate that an entity that provides service similar to an included utility, but not regulated under the same statute, is not a \u00a7 52A utility and not entitled to the same favorable tax treatment. As we have already discussed <em>supra, </em>the majority of the provisions of G. L. c. 166 are simply inapplicable to a CMRS provider, and Bell Atlantic Mobile\u2019s assertion that it might hypothetically be \u201csubject to\u201d G. L. c. 166 in some way is too speculative to be convincing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Therefore, the language of the corporate utility exemption statutes reinforces the conclusion that Bell Atlantic Mobile is not a telephone company.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Turning to the central valuation statute itself, the board found that Bell Atlantic Mobile owns virtually none of the property that G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 39, makes eligible for central valuation. That statute was enacted in 1915 to address the problem of piecemeal assessment of a distribution infrastructure whose components were physically interconnected by a system of wires that crossed municipal boundaries. See <em>RCN-BecoCom, LLC </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>443 Mass. 198, 199 (2005). The commissioner at that time had urged the Legislature to adopt a central valuation system, describing the difficulties of the then-current system in language that focused specifically on the interconnectedness of telephone infrastructure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">\u201cIn almost no case is a line of wires situated wholly in a given municipality. Thus the duty imposed upon assessors is to value a part of an extensive property, \u2014 a part which <em>is not disconnected </em>and the correct valuation of which cannot be made except by knowledge of the whole property. ... It is necessary for a board of assessors, as it were, to cut off a line of poles and wires at one boundary of the town, to cut it off at the opposite boundary, and then to find a value for the severed property thus within the limits of the town.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Report of the Tax Commissioner for Year Ending November 30, 1914, Pub. Doc. No. 16, 28 (1915). We agree with the board that it is the interconnectedness of the land-line telephone system infrastructure, and not the mere fact that equipment may be found in several different municipalities, that distinguishes \u201ctelephone companies\u201d from other businesses for purposes of central valuation under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 39.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The board\u2019s interpretation is logical and consistent with the language and purpose of the regulatory and tax statutes. We defer to it not only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>because the board adopted it, see <em>Koch </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>416 Mass. 540, 555 (1993), but, more importantly, because it appears to be correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Bell Atlantic Mobile argues that our decision in <em>RCN-BecoCom, LLC </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra, </em>compels the conclusion that it is a telephone company for purposes of both central valuation and the corporate utility exemption. In that decision, however, a company that provided land-line telephone service (albeit with a differently designed infrastructure from that of a traditional telephone company) was engaged in the provision of cable television and Internet services as well. <em>Id. </em>at 200. The issue was whether the company\u2019s telephone service was a sufficiently substantial portion of its over-all business to qualify it as a \u201ctelephone company\u201d eligible for central valuation under \u00a7 39. <em>Id. </em>at 201-202. Therefore, when we found that the company was \u201cundeniably\u201d engaged in providing telephone services, <em>id. </em>at 201, that finding signified only that there was no dispute that some of the services that the company provided <em>over its land-line network </em>involved two-way voice communications, as opposed to television or Internet services. <em>Id. </em>at 200-201. We were not concerned in the <em>RCN-BecoCom </em>decision with whether a wireless cellular telecommunications service provider such as Bell Atlantic Mobile, which did not employ a physically interconnected infrastructure, might also be a telephone company; therefore, the logic of that case is inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">We acknowledge that our holding today may not reflect the common, indiscriminate references to cellular telephones and traditional, land-line telephones as similar instrumentalities. Ordinarily, words in a statute are to be given their \u201cusual and natural meaning,\u201d <em>Gillette Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>425 Mass. 670, 674 (1997), quoting <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>AMI Woodbroke, Inc., </em>418 Mass. 92, 94 (1994), and to some the usual and natural meaning of \u201ctelephone\u201d includes both land-line and wireless communication systems. Here, however, where a complex and technical system of regulation and taxation is concerned, the layperson\u2019s definition is not controlling. In this context, the common conception of \u201ctelephone\u201d as including cellular communication devices is misleading; from a technological and regulatory standpoint, a cellular \u201ctelephone\u201d is in fact a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>two-way radio. We therefore agree with the suggestion, implicit in the board\u2019s findings, that the more technical understanding of \u201ctelephone company\u201d \u2014 which excludes CMRS providers such as Bell Atlantic Mobile \u2014 applies in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Bell Atlantic Mobile maintains that our refusal to treat it as a telephone company for central valuation purposes will chill innovation in the wireless cellular telecommunications industry. That, however, is a policy matter for the Legislature. The board has correctly interpreted and applied the statutes as written.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">\n<em>Decision of the Appellate Tax Board affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b301-11\">Pursuant to G.

Some, however, refer to telephone and telegraph \u201cutilities.\u201d See G. L. c. 159, \u00a7 12D.

L. c. 59, \u00a7 39, disposed of the \u00a7 39 appeals. Because Bell Atlantic Mobile was not entitled to central valuation by the commissioner under \u00a7 39, the board ruled that the commissioner had no authority either to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>grant or to deny the corporate utility exemption, and therefore did not decide in the \u00a7 39 appeals whether Bell Atlantic Mobile was entitled to the exemption. The board did decide, in the context of the \u00a7 65 appeals, that Bell Atlantic Mobile was not entitled to the exemption. Those appeals, however, are not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Evidence before the board indicated that radio communication existed at the time G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 39, was originally enacted. The Legislature presumably was aware of this fact and, had it desired, could have provided for central valuation of wireless communication equipment as well as telephone and telegraph lines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Because we affirm the board\u2019s finding that Bell Atlantic Mobile was not a telephone company at any time, we do not reach the issue whether the commissioner was correct in finding that at the relevant time, it was not a corporation for purposes of the corporate utility exemption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b309-8\">During the course of these proceedings, the commissioner has changed his position on whether Bell Atlantic Mobile is a telephone company. In the hearings before the board, the commissioner acknowledged that, while the Department of Revenue (department) had treated Bell Atlantic Mobile as a telephone company for purposes of central valuation, there had been conflicting interpretations within the department regarding whether wireless cellular telecommunications providers such as Bell Atlantic Mobile should be so classified. After reviewing the board\u2019s findings of fact and report on its decision, the commissioner changed his position, adopting the board\u2019s conclusion that Bell Atlantic Mobile was not a telephone company. Bell Atlantic Mobile maintains that we should give greater weight to the commissioner\u2019s past practice than to his new position. We disagree. The board correctly gave no weight to the commissioner\u2019s prior position, concluding that it was inconsistent with the underlying statutes. See <em>Massachusetts Hosp.
