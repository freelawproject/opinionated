Furtado, a police officer in the town of Plymouth, had sexually abused two minor children. After investigation, the district attorney decided not to file criminal charges. Instead, the matter was referred to Robert Pomeroy, the town\u2019s police chief, for \u201cwhatever administrative action [he] deem[ed] appropriate.\u201d Pomeroy notified Furtado that the police department would be \u201cconducting an internal investigation into allegations that [he] engaged in criminal activity.\u201d He also directed Furtado \u201cto write a complete and full report responding to these allegations\u201d and, subsequently, to take a lie detector examination, on threat of discipline up to and including termination for refusal. Furtado\u2019s attorney responded to Pomeroy\u2019s order in a letter advising that under Massachusetts law, a public employee cannot be disciplined for refusing to answer questions properly objected to on the basis of the employee\u2019s right against compelled self-incrimination, without a grant of immunity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Consequently, until and unless a proper grant of transactional immunity was secured for him, Furtado would not be complying with Pomeroy\u2019s directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">After the district attorney and the Attorney General executed letters granting Furtado transactional immunity, Furtado prepared a report and, thereafter, took a lie detector test administered by a State police examiner. The results of the test are disputed but immaterial to our resolution of the issues in this case. Pomeroy subsequently advised Furtado that the evidence did not warrant taking any disciplinary action against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Furtado then brought this action in the Superior Court pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>ant to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B (4),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> claiming that his rights under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B (2), had been violated because he was ordered to take a lie detector test when there was no \u201congoing criminal investigation.\u201d General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 19B (2), reads, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-5\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any employer or his agent, with respect to any of his employees ... to subject such person to, or request such person to take a lie detector test within or without the commonwealth, or to discharge, not hire, demote or otherwise discriminate against such person for the assertion of rights arising hereunder. <em>This section shall not apply to lie detector tests administered by law enforcement agencies as may be otherwise permitted in criminal investigations'''1 </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">A judge granted summary judgment for the defendants, concluding that they were justified in ordering Furtado to take a lie detector test because their departmental investigation \u201cclearly concerned allegations of criminal conduct.\u201d The plaintiff appealed, and the Appeals Court affirmed. See <em>Furtado </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 319 (2007). We granted Furtado\u2019s application for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">This case requires us to decide the scope of the underscored \u201ccriminal investigations\u201d exception to the statute, particularly whether a law enforcement agency may order a police officer to submit to a lie detector test regarding alleged criminal conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>when the possibility of prosecution for that conduct has been foreclosed (in this case by the grant of transactional immunity).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We conclude, as did the Appeals Court, that the \u201cexception applies where the conduct complained of . . . would constitute a crime even though criminal prosecution was not possible at the time of the administration of the polygraph.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>We first addressed the scope of the \u201ccriminal investigations\u201d exception to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B, in <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>379 Mass. 322 (1979).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There, the plaintiffs (six police officers) sought an injunction prohibiting the administrative head of the police department of the city of Lawrence from ordering them to submit to polygraph examinations, under threat of job sanctions, regarding their role in an alleged break-in. <em>Id. </em>at 325. Their requested relief was denied. <em>Id. </em>at 325-326.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On appeal, the plaintiffs contended that the \u201ccriminal investigations\u201d exception should be limited to circumstances in which the test results would be admissible at trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In rejecting their argument, the court concluded that \u201cthe excepting sentence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>\u00a7 19B does not look to any part of the criminal trial process, but is rather addressed to <em>the investigation of possible criminal </em>activity\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 329. The plaintiffs also contended that the police department\u2019s investigation of the officers\u2019 role in the alleged break-in \u201cmust be characterized as departmental, not criminal,\u201d and that the statutory exception therefore did not apply. <em>Id. </em>The court again disagreed, holding that \u201c[i]t is enough to say that there must be an alleged crime in the picture (not, for example, mere violation of a departmental regulation),\u201d for the \u201ccriminal investigations\u201d exception to apply. <em>Id. </em>at 329-330. The court also dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 contention \u201cthat official investigations, particularly of police officers, may all be indifferently denominated criminal\u201d as \u201chyperbole,\u201d holding instead that \u201ca requirement of good faith on the [part] of the [police] department is surely . . . implied\u201d by the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 329, 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Essentially, the court concluded that the nature of the conduct giving rise to the investigation determines whether the \u201ccriminal investigations\u201d exception applies. We adhered to this interpretation of the \u201ccriminal investigations\u201d exception in <em>Local 346, Int\u2019l Bhd. of Police Officers </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>391 Mass. 429, 429 (1984), where we described our holding in <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Lawrence, supra, </em>as follows: \u201cwe held that G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B, permits a police department to require police officers <em>suspected of criminal activity </em>to submit to polygraph testing under threat of discipline\u201d (emphasis added). In the <em>Local 346 </em>case, the court addressed whether G. L. c. 150E (the collective bargaining statute) required a city to negotiate with the police union over the police department\u2019s decision to use lie detector tests in the investigation of suspected criminal activity by police officers. In deciding that the town\u2019s decision to order such tests was within the town\u2019s exclusive managerial prerogative, <em>Local 346, Int\u2019l Bhd. of Police Officers </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 442, we noted that \u201c[flew institutions depend as heavily on their integrity and credibility for the effective performance of their duties as do police departments. We have little hesitation in concluding that, when the functions of a police depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>ment are disrupted <em>by allegations of criminal conduct by police officers, </em>the police department\u2019s decision to subject officers <em>reasonably suspected of criminal activities </em>to lie detector tests furthers law enforcement objectives . . .\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 439-440. We further concluded that \u201c[t]he link between effective law enforcement and a police department\u2019s ability to subject its employees suspected of criminal activities to lie detector tests is acknowledged by [G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 441. See <em>Patch </em>v. <em>Mayor of Revere, </em>397 Mass. 454, 456-457 (1986) (imposing sanctions on officers accused of criminal wrongdoing for failing to submit to lie detector tests is consistent with G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B, and does not violate due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Furtado contends, however, that the \u201ccriminal investigations\u201d exception focuses not on the nature of the alleged behavior under investigation, but on the consequences that may follow if the allegations prove to be true. If the investigation is departmental and internal, potentially resulting only in administrative action, he reasons, there is no \u201congoing criminal investigation\u201d and the exception does not apply.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If, by contrast, the investigation is aimed at gathering facts for criminal prosecution, the exception does apply. Here, because he was granted immunity as a precondition for complying with the order to take a lie detector test, Furtado argues that the exception does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">This reading of the statute is, as noted above, inconsistent with our holding in <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Lawrence, supra </em>at 329-330, that \u201c[i]t is enough to say that there must be an alleged crime in the picture (not, for example, mere violation of a departmental regulation) . . . .\u201d It is also inconsistent with the statute\u2019s legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 19B, as originally inserted by St. 1959, c. 255, contained no \u201ccriminal investigations\u201d exception. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>It read, in relevant part: \u201cNo employer shall require or subject any employee to any lie detector tests as a condition of employment or continued employment.\u201d It was rewritten in 1963 to include a broader prohibition, but also to include a law enforcement agency exception: \u201cAny employer who subjects any person employed by him, or any person applying for employment, to a lie detector test, or causes, directly or indirectly, any such employee or applicant to take a lie detector test, shall be punished by a fine of not more than two hundred dollars. <em>This section shall not apply to lie detector tests administered by law enforcement agencies in the performance of their official </em>duties\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> St. 1963, c. 797. The exception was narrowed in 1973 to its current form: \u201cThis section shall not apply to lie detector tests administered by law enforcement agencies <em>as may be otherwise permitted in criminal </em>investigations\u2019\u2019 (emphasis added). St. 1973, c. 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The 1973 revision also clarified the first sentence of \u00a7 19B to ensure that its protections were extended to persons applying to become police officers. Specifically, that sentence was amended to read: \u201cAny employer who subjects . . . any person applying for employment, including <em>any person applying for employment as a police officer, </em>to a lie detector test . . . shall be punished by a fine ...\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. A </em>logical inference to be drawn from the 1973 revisions is that, under the broad wording of the 1963 amendment adding the exception, police departments, in the \u201cperformance of their official duties,\u201d were administering lie detector tests to applicants for employment. The 1973 amendment specifically made that practice unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Our understanding of the 1973 and subsequent revisions of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is furthered by considering the legislative process through which those revisions were adopted. See <em>School </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number><em>Comm. of Hudson </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>448 Mass. 565, 583 n.17 (2007) (comparing adopted language of statutory revision with language of rejected amendments to glean legislative intent). In 1973, 1973 Senate Doc. No. 673 would have entirely eliminated the exception established in 1963. Instead, as passed, the 1973 revisions to the statute retained the exception in amended form. We noted in <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Lawrence, supra </em>at 328 n.11, that the revision adopted in 1973, when contrasted with the rejected proposal, was \u201cevidence of a legislative desire to balance the privacy interests of employees against the legitimate needs of certain criminal investigations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Similarly, in 1985, the next time the Legislature revised G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B, see St. 1985, c. 587, and note 11, <em>supra, </em>a bill, 1985 House Doc. No. 5408, would have eliminated the \u201ccriminal investigations\u201d exception. Additionally, 1985 House Doc. No. 3241 would have amended the \u201ccriminal investigations\u201d exception by adding the following sentence: \u201cHowever, the results of lie detector tests administered by law enforcement agencies shall not be grounds for disciplinary action by any employer against any employee, including police officers.\u201d The House Committee on Commerce and Labor considered those bills, but ultimately recommended that 1985 Senate Doc. No. 1435, which retained the unaltered \u201ccriminal investigations\u201d exception, \u201cought to pass.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> And, with minor revisions, immaterial to this case, it was enacted by the Legislature.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">We have held that \u201c[t]he disappearance of a provision during a legislative journey to enactment does not establish the contrary to be the law, especially when it appears on fair analysis of the final text that the provision would have amounted to surplus-age,\u201d <em>Mercy Hosp. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, </em>381 Mass. 34, 42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>(1980), but that does not preclude our consideration of the rejected amendments here.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The rejected amendments were not surplusage, as they would have either eliminated the exception entirely or barred the use of lie detector test results in imposing departmental discipline (a topic on which the language, as adopted, is silent). The interpretation urged by Furtado \u2014 that the \u201ccriminal investigations\u201d exception precludes the use of lie detector tests by police departments during departmental investigations into allegations of criminal wrongdoing by police officers \u2014 is, as noted, contrary to our prior decisions interpreting the exception, and finds support only in proposed but unadopted legislation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Finally, as the Appeals Court accurately described, Furtado\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>proposed reading of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B, \u201cpresents a \u2018Catch-22\u2019 situation.\u201d <em>Furtado </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 319, 322 (2007). \u201cFurtado\u2019s urged interpretation of the statutory exception would result in the situation where a law enforcement agency would not be permitted to request its employee-police officer to take a polygraph test once the officer received immunity from criminal prosecution, as there would be no \u2018ongoing criminal investigation.\u2019 However, without a grant of immunity from future criminal prosecution, a law enforcement agency would not be allowed lawfully to administer to its employee a polygraph test within the exception of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B (2).\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 322-323. That would deprive police departments of their ability to order the he detector tests of officers accused of serious misconduct violating the criminal laws of the Commonwealth, a tool that the Legislature has expressly granted them.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The \u201ccriminal investigations\u201d exception applies where the conduct under investigation would constitute a crime even though criminal prosecution was not possible at the time of the administration of the lie detector test. Consequently, the decision granting summary judgment to the defendants is affirmed.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b550-7\">In <em>Carney </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>403 Mass. 604, 608-609 (1988), we noted that \u201c[i]t is well settled that public employees cannot be discharged simply because they invoke their privilege ... not to incriminate themselves in refusing to respond to questions propounded by their employers,\u201d and held that \u201cart. 12 of the Declaration of Rights requires transactional immunity to supplant the privilege against self-incrimination, even in the context of public employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Transactional immunity is \u201cimmunity from prosecution for offenses to which [the] compelled testimony relates.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 610 n.8, quoting <em>Kastigar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>406 U.S. 441, 443 (1972). See <em>Baglioni </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Salem, </em>421 Mass. 229, 233-234 (1995) (discussing requirements of proper grant of transactional immunity).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b551-8\">General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 19B (4), allows \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved by a violation of subsection (2) [to] institute . . . and prosecute in his own name ... a civil action for injunctive relief and any damages thereby incurred, including treble damages for any loss of wages or other benefits. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ake\">Furtado did not waive the protections of G.

Co., </em>371 Mass. 186, 194 (1976), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Price, </em>361 U.S. 304, 313 (1960), the contemporaneous decision of the Legislature to adopt one form of a proposed bill and not another may highlight the intended meaning of the adopted language. See <em>Suffolk Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Division of Capital Asset Mgt., </em>449 Mass. 444, 454 (2007), quoting <em>EMC Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>433 Mass. 568, 570 (2001) (\u201cIn construing the Legislature\u2019s intent, we may also enlist the aid of other reliable guideposts, such as the statute\u2019s \u2018progression through the legislative body, the history of the times, prior legislation, contemporary customs and conditions and the system of positive law of which they are part\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b557-7\">We also note that bills proposing to amend G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B, in the same fashion as 1985 House Doc. No. 3241, by prohibiting the use of lie detector test results in determining administrative punishment of police officers, were introduced each year, at least once, from 1987 to 1990. See 1990 House Doc. No. 1071; 1989 House Doc. No. 1262; 1989 House Doc. No. 4312; 1988 House Doc. No. 1574; 1988 House Doc. No. 3513; 1987 House Doc. No. 1215. None of the proposed amendments passed. See <em>Simon </em>v. <em>State Examiners of Electricians, </em>395 Mass. 238, 247 (1985) (noting that, in rare circumstances, postenactment legislative history may be relevant). But see <em>Massachusetts Wholesalers of Malt Beverages, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>409 Mass. 336, 344 (1991), quoting <em>Coca Cola Bottling Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>393 Mass. 726, 729-730 n.3 (1985) (\u201cWhat the . . . legislation involved in this case means cannot rationally be influenced by [subsequent] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>legislation\u201d); <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut.
