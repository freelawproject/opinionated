On appeal he asserts error in the admission in evidence of details of a private conversation between him and his wife, the exclusion of a declaration against penal interest made by the codefendant, and the failure to charge the jury on involuntary manslaughter. We affirm the conviction and decline to grant relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">1. <em>Background. </em>Rachelle Pelletier was born May 30, 1983. She was pronounced dead shortly after 3 p.m. on March 7, 1985, at Brockton Hospital after efforts to resuscitate her in the emergency room had failed. The Commonwealth\u2019s pathologist determined that the cause of death was peritonitis secondary to a traumatically severed small bowel. He opined that the bowel was severed when it was pressed and rotated or twisted against the spinal column, which must have been supported by a hard object, such as a floor. He explained that, based on the amount of bleeding at the level of the kidneys and rectum, the object that struck the child had to be much larger than a fist. He testified that the injury was consistent with an adult stomping on the child\u2019s stomach while she was lying on the floor, then twisting the foot while it was pressing on her abdomen. The pathologist opined that the injury was inflicted the night before she died.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">The child had further injuries, including recent bruises on her left forehead, her right cheek, and her chin; an abrasion of her upper lip; and bruises on her left shoulder, her abdomen, and her right thigh. She also had two recently broken ribs on the left side of her back. Her stomach was distended and rigid to the touch when she arrived at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Rachelle had last lived with her mother (Margaret Earle), the defendant (Earle\u2019s boy friend), and Raymond Gaffney (Earle\u2019s cousin) in an apartment her mother had rented at 89 Highland Street in Brockton. On March 6, 1985, at 5:30 p.m., the night before Rachelle died, the defendant, Earle, and Rachelle were eating dinner, and Rachelle appeared fine and unbruised. Gaff-ney left while they had dinner. At about 9 p.m. that evening, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Earle visited an upstairs neighbor, Susan Lewis, to celebrate Earle\u2019s twenty-first birthday. The defendant babysat Rachelle. Shortly after Earle\u2019s arrival, Lewis\u2019s thirteen year old daughter, Colleen, went downstairs to Earle\u2019s apartment to get a drinking glass. The defendant was holding Rachelle in his arms but her., face was turned away from Colleen\u2019s view. Rachelle was crying hysterically.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Gaffney returned to the apartment at about 9:30 p.m. The defendant was babysitting alone for Rachelle, an unusual arrangement. He was upset that Earle was upstairs celebrating and that he had to babysit. The defendant was holding Rachelle, who usually went to bed at 8 p.m., but was fully dressed and \u201cout cold.\u201d Gaffney could not see her face. The next morning, at about 5:30 or 6 a.m., Gaffney heard Rachelle crying louder than he had ever heard. She was standing in her crib. He laid her down, changed her diaper, and gave her a bottle. He noticed that her color was \u201cbluish green.\u201d The light was otherwise too dim for him to see if she had any bruises. Gaffney woke the defendant, and within fifteen minutes they left for work.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">At about 11 a.m., Colleen Lewis briefly visited Earle\u2019s apartment. Rachelle lay on the sofa, moaning. Her color was yellowish and she had a bruise on one side of her face. Colleen returned to the apartment at about 2 p.m. to babysit. Earle left shortly thereafter. Rachelle was still on the sofa, moaning. She had spit up a mucous-like substance. Colleen checked on Rachelle a few minutes later and found she was not breathing. Colleen rolled her over, and a yellowish-green substance oozed from her mouth. Colleen screamed for her mother, who came downstairs and started cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The police were called, and they arrived in minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The investigation remained open for approximately seventeen years. Earle, Gaffney, and the defendant all were suspects. There was evidence that all three had physically and emotionally abused Rachelle. Each had been alone with the child during the approximate range of time that her small bowel had been severed. No one made any admissions. Earle and the defendant maintained their relationship for several years thereafter and had a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">On December 24, 1993, the defendant met Ruth Harvey in a bar in Brockton. They were married on July 5, 1994, and moved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>to Virginia the following year. On December 30, 1995, after drinking all day, they argued and the defendant hit her. She tried to telephone police. The defendant threatened that if she telephoned the police he would kill her. He said he had killed someone else. He told her he was babysitting Rachelle while Earle was out celebrating her twenty-first birthday. Angry about babysitting, Rachelle\u2019s crying made him more angry. He picked her up, threw her on the floor, then stomped on her stomach first with one foot, then the other. Each time he twisted his foot into her stomach. He threatened to kill his wife if she told anyone. She was terrified.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The defendant and his wife moved to Attleboro around January, 1996. They continued their excessive drinking, which frequently led to violence and threats by the defendant. He repeatedly threatened to kill her, as he had killed Rachelle. While the defendant and his wife lived together, she tried unsuccessfully several times to contact the officer investigating Rachelle\u2019s death. Their relationship eventually ended around August, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">On November 19, 2001, the defendant dialed 911 from a public telephone in Brockton and admitted committing a murder at 89 Highland Street. The tape recording of the telephone call was played to the jury. He then told a stranger he wanted to turn himself in for murder. In early 2002, the defendant made various inculpatory statements in the context of a batterers\u2019 group. He also made an inculpatory statement to a probation officer in April, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">An arrest warrant naming the defendant for the murder of Rachelle issued May 3, 2002. Following an extensive manhunt he was found July 22, 2002, hiding in a crawl space in a house in Holbrook.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">2. <em>Spousal disqualification. </em>The defendant timely moved, pursuant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20, First, to disqualify his former wife from testifying against him. The judge denied his motion on the ground that the marital disqualification does not apply to proceedings involving child abuse. The defendant argues this was error because the exception in \u00a7 20, First, for proceedings involving child abuse is limited to civil proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">General Laws c. 233, \u00a7 20, First, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-10\">\u201cAny <em>person </em>of sufficient understanding, although a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>party, <em>may testify in any proceeding, civil or criminal, </em>in court or before a person who has authority to receive evidence, <em>except as </em>follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">\u201cFirst, Except in a proceeding arising out of or involving a contract made by a married woman with her husband, a proceeding under [G. L. c. 209D] and in a prosecution begun under [\u00a7\u00a7 1-10], inclusive, of [G. L. c. 273], any criminal proceeding in which one spouse is a defendant alleged to have committed a crime against the other spouse or to have violated a temporary or permanent vacate, restraining, or no-contact order or judgment issued pursuant to [\u00a7 18, 34B, or 34C] of [G. L. c. 208], [\u00a7 32] of [G. L. c. 209], [\u00a7 3, 3B, 3C, 4, or 5] of [G. L. c. 209A], or [\u00a7 15 or 20] of [G. L. c. 209C], or a similar protection order issued by another jurisdiction, obtained by the other spouse, <em>and except in a proceeding involving abuse of a person under the age of eighteen, including incest, neither husband nor wife shall testify as to private conversations with the </em>other\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The general principle articulated at the beginning of \u00a7 20 is that any person may testify in any proceeding. It expressly treats civil and criminal proceedings alike. The exceptions to the general principle are set forth in four numbered paragraphs that constitute the bulk of \u00a7 20. The thrust of the defendant\u2019s argument is that the Legislature created distinctions between civil and criminal proceedings in the exceptions to the general principle that determine the manner in which the statute as a whole must be read. It did so, he contends, by specifying criminal proceedings as such, and by referring to civil proceedings simply as \u201cproceedings.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">The import of the specific language of the general principle is that a \u201cproceeding\u201d means either a civil or a criminal proceeding. Applying the canon of statutory construction that words used in one part of a statute to connote a particular meaning should be given the same meaning in another part of the same statute, <em>Beeler </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>387 Mass. 609, 617 (1982), the word \u201cproceeding,\u201d when used without limitation in the body of exceptions to the general principle, means either a civil or criminal proceeding. The defendant\u2019s argument to the contrary is based on a misunderstanding of three exceptions set forth in the first clause of \u00a7 20. We turn to those exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>First, the defendant argues that the exception for \u201ca proceeding arising out of or involving a contract made [between spouses]\u201d refers to a civil proceeding. This is not necessarily so. Any number of criminal proceedings that \u201cinvolve\u201d a contract between spouses come to mind. For example, a crime may be committed during the performance of a contract between spouses who own separate businesses. \u201cProceeding,\u201d unmodified in this exception, refers to both civil and criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Second, the exception for a \u201cproceeding under [G. L. c. 209D]\u201d is not necessarily civil, as the defendant contends. General Laws c. 209D, \u00a7 3-305 <em>(b) </em>(5), authorizes enforcement of orders \u201cby civil or <em>criminal </em>contempt,\u201d and criminal contempt is a criminal proceeding (emphasis added). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallarelli, </em>372 Mass. 573, 579 (1977). See also <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 194, 201 (1968) (defendant entitled to jury trial on charge of criminal contempt depending on length of sentence sought); Mass. R. Crim. P. 44, 378 Mass. 920 (1979). The Legislature also contemplated criminal sanctions for violations of G. L. c. 209D when it added \u201cfail[ure] to comply with an order or judgment for support\u201d under G. L. c. 209D to the list of felonies punishable under G. L. c. 273, \u00a7\u00a7 15 and 15A, in the same legislation that first introduced G. L. c. 209D. See St. 1995, c. 5, \u00a7\u00a7 87, 99-102. The Legislature further contemplated the criminal aspects of G. L. c. 209D by authorizing certain entries in \u201ccomputer systems for criminal warrants,\u201d G. L. c. 209D, \u00a7 3-305 <em>(b) </em>(9), and by authorizing rendition proceedings for individuals \u201ccharged criminally in the commonwealth with having failed to provide for the support of an obligee.\u201d G. L. c. 209D, \u00a7 8-801 <em>(b) </em>(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Third, and finally, the exception under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20, First, for proceedings \u201cinvolving abuse of a person under the age of eighteen, including incest,\u201d contemplates both civil and criminal proceedings. This is true if only because incest is a crime. G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">We conclude that the word \u201cproceeding,\u201d when appearing without limitation in G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20, connotes both civil and criminal proceedings. Whenever the Legislature chose to limit the meaning of \u201cproceeding\u201d in \u00a7 20, it did so with a modifier, such as the word \u201ccriminal,\u201d or by identifying specific types of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>proceedings, including, for example, a \u201cprosecution begun under [G. L. c. 273, \u00a7\u00a7 1-10]\u201d; a violation of G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 18; and a \u201cgrand jury\u201d proceeding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The judge also was correct to deny the defendant\u2019s motion to disqualify his former wife from testifying where the conversations in question were not \u201cprivate conversations.\u201d Private conversations between spouses under the common-law rule governing spousal disqualification as well as under \u00a7 20<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> do not include abusive or threatening words, which are involved here. Abusive or threatening words directed at one\u2019s spouse do nothing to promote marital harmony, the purpose behind the protection. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gillis, </em>358 Mass. 215, 217-218 (1970); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cronin, </em>185 Mass. 96, 97 (1904), citing <em>French </em>v. <em>French, </em>14 Gray 186 (1860). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">3. <em>Statements against penal interest. </em>The defendant asserts error in the exclusion of Earle\u2019s statement to a detective that on the morning of March 7,1985, the day Rachelle died, she changed Rachelle\u2019s diaper and did not see any bruises on her. Also excluded was a similar statement Earle made to a friend, with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>request not to talk to police. The judge excluded the statements as hearsay, confusing, and lacking substantial probative value. The defendant had argued below that the statements should be admitted not for the truth of the matter asserted, but because the statements were made and, he added, because they were false. He now argues for the first time on appeal that the statements were admissible as statements against penal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Hearsay is admissible if it is a statement against penal interest. A statement is against penal interest if (1) the declarant is unavailable to testify, (2) the statement so far tends to subject the declarant to criminal prosecution that a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would not have made the statement unless he believed it to be true, and (3) if offered to exculpate the accused, it is corroborated by circumstances clearly indicating its trustworthiness. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>373 Mass. 617, 623 n.9 (1977). All three requirements must be met.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The Commonwealth contends the defendant never called Earle to testify at his trial, and we should not presume that she would have invoked her privilege against self-incrimination, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopera, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 133, 137 n.3 (1997), and thereby establish her unavailability. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galloway, </em>404 Mass. 204, 208 (1989). The defendant contends Earle was unavailable to testify at his trial because she exercised her privilege against self-incrimination before the grand jury; she was indicted with the defendant for Rachelle\u2019s murder; her trial was severed from that of the defendant and she was tried first; she did not testify at her trial; she was convicted of murder in the second degree; and she appealed from her conviction. In these circumstances, it is likely Earle would have invoked her privilege under the Fifth Amendment to the United States constitution, and it is appropriate to conclude that the unavailability requirement has been satisfied. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>428 Mass. 672, 679 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Earle\u2019s statements do not satisfy the second test for admissibility as a statement against penal interest. That is, they did not clearly tend to subject her to criminal liability such that a reasonable person in her position would not have made the statements unless she believed they were true. Such statements must \u201cbe truly against the declarant\u2019s penal interest.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carr, supra </em>at 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Although the statements could be construed as Earle\u2019s consciousness of guilt, they are equally suggestive both of Earle\u2019s belief that the defendant harmed Rachelle and Earle\u2019s intention to provide cover for him so she could continue a relationship with him. Their relationship did continue several years after Rachelle\u2019s death. In addition, the judge reasonably could have concluded that Earle\u2019s statements were intended to cast blame on her thirteen year old upstairs neighbor, Colleen, who was babysitting Rachelle and was present when she stopped breathing. A statement against penal interest need not contain a direct admission of guilt, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Drew, 397 Mass. 65, 74 (1986), but Earle\u2019s statements make no assertion of criminal activity whatsoever, and they contain no details that are clearly inculpatory. Whatever value they may have as statements against penal interest derive from their brimming ambiguity. The defendant even argues that she was either lying or telling the truth. As such, the statements are not \u201ctruly against the declar-ant\u2019s penal interest.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carr, supra. </em>In the context of this case, where the defendant contends that Earle\u2019s statements were admissible on the question whether she, and not the defendant, inflicted the injuries that caused Rachelle\u2019s death, we conclude that the statements lack sufficient probity and therefore do not so far tend to subject Earle to criminal liability as is necessary to be admissible under this exception to the hearsay rule. <em>Id. </em>at 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Under the third element of proof, because Earle\u2019s statements were offered to exculpate the defendant, they must be corroborated by circumstances clearly indicating their trustworthiness. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carr, supra. </em>In making this determination a judge should consider certain factors \u201c \u2018in light of the other evidence already adduced or to be adduced,\u2019 including the credibility and reliability of the declarant and the credibility and probative value of the statement; the timing of the declaration; the relationship between the witness and the declarant; whether the statement was heard by others; whether the statement was made spontaneously; whether and in what circumstances the statement was repeated; and whether there was a motive for the declarant to misrepresent the matter.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>449 Mass. 343, 355 (2007), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number><em>supra </em>at 75-76. Applying these factors, we conclude that the judge would have been warranted in deciding that the circumstances did not clearly support a finding of trustworthiness. One statement was elicited in response to police questioning; it was not spontaneous. Both statements were ambiguous and therefore do not necessarily serve their intended purpose of exculpating the defendant. As stated, Earle had a strong motive to hide the truth to protect her relationship with the defendant, and her interests were intertwined firmly with his, especially where their relationship lasted several years.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Because the defendant has failed to satisfy the second and third elements to establish that Earle\u2019s statements were made against her penal interest, the judge would have been warranted in excluding Earle\u2019s statements if they had been offered as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The defendant combines this argument with a claim that the judge\u2019s ruling denied him the right to present a defense, in particular, evidence that Earle had inflicted on Rachelle the injury that caused her death. The defendant was not prevented from presenting a defense that Rachelle was killed by Earle. He was allowed to present considerable evidence of Earle\u2019s abuse of Rachelle. The judge correctly excluded the two hearsay statements in question. A defendant has no \u201cconstitutional right to the admission of unreliable hearsay.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>438 Mass. 142, 156 (2002), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 966 (2003). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McAfee, </em>430 Mass. 483, 489-492 &amp; n.3 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">4. <em>Manslaughter instruction. </em>The defendant contends that the evidence taken in the light most favorable to him, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schnopps, </em>383 Mass. 178, 179 (1981), <em>S.C., </em>390 Mass. 722 (1984), required the judge to instruct the jury on involuntary manslaughter based on an unintentional killing resulting from \u201ca battery not amounting to a felony, when the defendant knew or should have known that the battery he was committing endangered human life.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, </em>413 Mass. 292, 302 n.10 (1992). The evidence on which he relies includes the following. The medical examiner testified that the severed bowel injury was not fatal, and had Rachelle been taken to the hospital within eight hours, or even more, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>probably would not have died. In addition, according to the pathologist a \u201cmoderate degree of energy\u201d was all that was required to sever Rachelle\u2019s bowel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The defendant argues that this case is controlled by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vizcarrondo, </em>427 Mass. 392, 393, 397 (1998), <em>S.C., </em>431 Mass. 360 (2000), where we said that evidence of at least four blows to the body of a ten month old child resulting in injuries that included fractured ribs and a lacerated and crushed liver \u201ccould be viewed either as tending to prove a strong and plain likelihood of death or as tending to prove conduct that involved a high degree of likelihood that substantial harm will happen to another.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>427 Mass. 659, 670 (1998) (\u201cAlthough evidence of a single blow to a child of tender years may be sufficient to support a jury finding of malice . . . such an inference is not <em>necessarily </em>required by evidence even of repeated blows to a young child\u201d [emphasis in original]). Only \u201c[w]hen it is obvious that the risk of physical harm to the victim creates a \u2018plain and strong likelihood that death would follow\u2019 . . . [is] an instruction on involuntary manslaughter . . . not warranted.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitz-meyer, </em>414 Mass. 540, 547 (1993), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, supra </em>at 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Although the Commonwealth\u2019s pathologist testified that a moderate amount of force was all that was required to sever the bowel, he did not testify that moderate force was all that was used here. The medical examiner testified that the type of internal injuries he witnessed at the autopsy indicated \u201ca tremendous, tremendous force\u201d was applied to the child\u2019s abdomen, comparable to \u201ca Mike Tyson type of power.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">To the extent that the defendant was the person who inflicted these injuries on Rachelle, the only evidence descriptive of the batteries he inflicted was that he threw her on the floor and stomped on her stomach twice, each time twisting his weight onto her abdomen.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Based on the pathologist\u2019s testimony con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>ceming the mechanics of how the bowel was tom, the fact that Rachelle was thirty-two inches tall and weighed only twenty-two pounds, and the fact that her musculature was not well developed, the jury could have inferred the defendant must have felt the child\u2019s spine under his feet as he stomped and twisted, and it should have been obvious to him that the application of this type of force against the unprotected viscera of this twenty-two month old child necessarily would cause internal injuries that created a plain and strong likelihood that death would follow. Unlike the blows inflicted in the <em>Vizcarrondo </em>case, which were directed at the child\u2019s rib cage, the stomping and twisting blows inflicted here were directed at the child\u2019s abdomen (which had little muscle mass) and her unprotected internal organs. The manner of the attack would have informed a reasonable person that the stomping and twisting likely would cause only death. The massive assault on this fragile<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and vulnerable child did not warrant an involuntary manslaughter instruction. It only warranted a finding of malice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzmeyer, supra </em>at 548 (extensive beating of elderly man did hot warrant manslaughter instruction).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The fact that the child did not receive timely medical attention does not ameliorate the defendant\u2019s responsibility for inflicting lethal force. <em>Id. </em>at 548 n.3. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Medina, </em>380 Mass. 565, 573 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">5. <em>G.

He opined that she was struck by a fist, not stomped on by shod feet. He had not been aware that her small bowel had been severed. This was offered in support of the theory that Earle caused Rachelle\u2019s death. The only type of blow admitted by the defendant was the stomping and twisting, and for purposes of our analysis we must determine what a reasonable person inflicting that type of force should have known.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b548-13\">There was evidence Rachelle had become sickly after the defendant moved into the apartment, relegating her to an unheated pantry.
