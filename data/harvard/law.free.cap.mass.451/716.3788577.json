On December 17, 1999 (midway through the 2000 fiscal year), WB&amp;T Mortgage Company, Inc. (WB&amp;T or taxpayer), purchased two parcels of land in Boston, adjacent to property it already owned, from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston (Archdiocese) for a total sales price of $4,500,000.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Archdiocese, a religious organization, was not subject to real estate tax on the parcels.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">For purposes of taxation, valuation of most nonexempt real and personal property is established as of the January 1 preceding the applicable fiscal year. G. L. c. 59, \u00a7\u00a7 2A, 18. Sixteen months after WB&amp;T\u2019s purchase of the property, in April, 2001, the board of assessors of Boston (city) issued tax bills to WB&amp;T for fiscal year 2001 (July 1, 2000, to June 30, 2001), reflecting that it had assigned a \u201ctotal full valuation\u201d of $3,281,600 to the property as of January 1, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Thereafter, on November 21, 2001, the city issued a tax bill for fiscal year 2000 (July 1, 1999, to June 30, 2000) to WB&amp;T pursuant to G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 2C, in the amount of $82,861.11. That amount was based on the sales price of $4,500,000, a tax rate of $34.21 per thousand and, according to the \u201cpro forma\u201d tax bill, a total of 197 days during fiscal year 2000 (i.e., December 17, 1999, to June 30, 2000) that WB&amp;T owned the property.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>WB&amp;T paid the tax on December 20, 2001, without interest, and applied for an abatement the following day. The application was deemed denied (by operation of statute, due to the assessors\u2019 inaction) on March 21, 2002, G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 63, and the taxpayer filed its appeal within ninety days, on June 21, 2002. See G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Preliminary considerations. </em>Although not disputed by the parties on appeal, a threshold issue is whether G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 2C, imposes a tax, rather than an excise or other governmental exaction, and must therefore satisfy the constitutional requirement of proportionality. Part II, c. 1, \u00a7 1, art. 4, of the Constitution of the Commonwealth. See <em>Thomson Elec. Welding Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>275 Mass. 426, 429 (1931); <em>Portland Bank </em>v. <em>Apthorp, </em>12 Mass. 252, 255-256 (1815). While \u00a7 2C uses the phrases \u201ca pro rata amount ... in lieu of taxes\u201d and \u201cpro forma tax\u201d to describe the obligation, we determine the nature of such an assessment \u201cby its operation rather than its specially descriptive phrase,\u201d <em>Emerson College </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>391 Mass. 415, 424 (1984), quoting <em>Thomson Elec. Welding Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 429, respecting the Legislature\u2019s intent in drafting the statute. <em>Associated Indus. of Mass, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>378 Mass. 657, 667-668 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The board concluded, and we agree, that the statute exacts a tax. Among other things, G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 2C, provides that \u201c[s]ums received under this section . . . shall be credited to the general fund of the city or town.\u201d That the revenue obtained by operation of \u00a7 2C is destined for the \u201cgeneral fund\u201d rather than for a particular purpose \u201cwhile not decisive, is of weight in indicating that the charge is a tax.\u201d <em>Emerson College </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>at 427, quoting P. Nichols, Taxation in Massachusetts 7 (3d ed. 1938). Further, the \u00a7 2C rubric approximates the property tax that would have been due if the property had been transferred by a nonexempt grantor, and is specifically referred to as \u201cin lieu of taxes that would have been due\u201d if the property had been owned by a nonexempt purchaser on January 1. Finally, unlike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>contractually-agreed payments \u201cin lieu of taxes,\u201d <em>Anderson St. Assocs. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>442 Mass. 812, 817-818 (2004), there is no \u201cvoluntary act\u201d or \u201cprivilege\u201d for which the \u00a7 2C amount is levied. <em>Emerson College </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>at 428. See <em>German </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>410 Mass. 445, 448 (1991), quoting <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>393 Mass. 1209, 1216 (1984) (tax is \u201crevenue-raising exaction imposed through generally applicable rates to defray public expense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">2. <em>Constitutionality of G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 2C. </em>The preeminent issue before us is whether, by authorizing a \u201cpro forma tax\u201d based on purchase price and date rather than fair cash valuation as of January 1, G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 2C, imposes an unconstitutional disproportionate or discriminatory tax on purchasers of real property from tax-exempt entities. We start from the premise that \u201c[a] tax measure is presumed valid and is entitled to the benefit of any constitutional doubt, and the burden of proving its invalidity falls on those who challenge the measure.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>425 Mass. 1201, 1203-1204 (1997), citing <em>Daley </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>376 Mass. 861, 865 (1978). See <em>Sylvester </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>445 Mass. 304, 308 (2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1147 <em>(2006); Andover Sav. Bank v. Commissioner of Revenue, </em>387 Mass. 229, 235 (1982). A statute survives such scrutiny if it \u201cmay reasonably be applied in ways that do not violate constitutional safeguards.\u201d <em>Route One Liquors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Secretary of Admin. &amp; Fin., </em>439 Mass. 111, 117 (2003), quoting <em>Opinion of the Justices, supra </em>at 1218.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The board ruled that G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 2C, is not facially unconstitutional, but that it would be unconstitutional as applied if the purchase price on which the \u00a7 2C calculation was based exceeded the \u201cfair cash valuation,\u201d G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 38, the standard applied to taxation of other real property. Giving deference to the board\u2019s expertise in interpretation of the tax laws of the Commonwealth, <em>Northeast Petroleum Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>395 Mass. 207, 213 (1985), citing <em>French </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>383 Mass. 481, 482 (1981) (we defer to \u201cexpertise of the board in tax matters involving interpretation of the laws of the Commonwealth\u201d), but applying our independent judgment as to both law and facts on the constitutional issues, <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>328 Mass. 679, 686-687 (1952), we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>that the statute is constitutional, both on its face and as applied to this taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">a. <em>Facial challenge. </em>Under the Constitution of the Commonwealth, the Legislature may \u201cimpose and levy proportional and reasonable assessments, rates, and taxes, upon all the inhabitants of, and persons resident, and estates lying, within the . . . Commonwealth.\u201d Part II, c. 1, \u00a7 1, art. 4, of the Constitution of the Commonwealth. By addressing the absence of any tax assessment on property transferred from a tax-exempt entity for the period before the established proportionate system of taxation begins, G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 2C <em>(a), </em>is a proper exercise of that power of proportional taxation, ensuring that nonexempt properties do not benefit from an unintended tax exemption, and that disproportionate taxation is reduced generally. <em>C &amp; S Wholesale Growers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westfield, </em>436 Mass. 459, 463 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Among the fundamental rights afforded by the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights is the right to enjoyment of \u201cproperty.\u201d Art. 10 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. That right, however, is not unfettered and comes with an attendant obligation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">\u201cEach individual of the society has a right to be protected by it in the enjoyment of his life, liberty and property, according to standing laws. He is obliged, consequently, to contribute his share to the expense of this protection. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-8\"><em>Id. </em>Building on that principle, our cases long have recognized that, just as the Commonwealth assumes the protection of the property within its borders, so too must that property be \u201cheld subject to the reciprocal obligation of meeting, in its due proportion, the expenses incident to such protection.\u201d <em>Boston Soc\u2019y of Redemptorist Fathers </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>129 Mass. 178, 180 (1880). See <em>Portland Bank </em>v. <em>Apthorp, </em>12 Mass. 252, 256 (1815) (reasonable and proportional taxation historically \u201cseems to be intended as a contribution of the individual citizens, in proportion to the property, whether real or personal, which they are respectively worth\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">Lest proportionality become mechanistic, however, the constitutional charge of proportionality is mitigated by the Legislature\u2019s discretionary power to establish reasonable exemptions from taxation. Part II, c. 1, \u00a7 1, art. 4, of the Constitution of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>Commonwealth. <em>Assessors of Boston </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>320 Mass. 559, 562 (1947) (statutory excise tax on corporation not violative of constitutional requirement of proportionality, given that Constitution does not preclude reasonable exemptions). <em>Assessors of Quincy </em>v. <em>Cunningham Found.., </em>305 Mass. 411, 416-418 (1940). <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>211 Mass. 624, 625 (1912). While the Constitution requires property taxes to be \u201cproportional and reasonable,\u201d Part II, c. 1, \u00a7 1, art. 4, of the Constitution of the Commonwealth, \u201cneither this constitutional provision nor the more general provisions of art. 10 . . . precludes reasonable exemptions.\u201d <em>Assessors of Quincy </em>v. <em>Cunningham Found., supra </em>at 416. See <em>Associated Indus. of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>378 Mass. 657, 668-669 (1979); <em>Daley </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>376 Mass. 861, 866 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The Legislature long has authorized an exemption from taxation for property \u201cactually devoted to a public use,\u201d primarily because such property, \u201cheld and used for the benefit of the public[,] ought not to be made to share the burden of paying the public expenses.\u201d <em>Assessors of Quincy </em>v. <em>Cunningham Found., supra </em>at 417.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Opinion of the Justices, 220 </em>Mass. 613, 619 (1915); <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>Washington Mills, </em>11 Allen 268, 275 (1865). General Laws c. 59, \u00a7 5, for example, limits tax-exempt status to real estate actually devoted to public or quasi public purposes, consistent with the concept that tax exemptions are a form of government assistance properly available for the \u201cpromotion of public interests and not the furtherance of the advantage of individuals.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>211 Mass. 624, 625 (1912). Such exemptions also have been authorized on the basis that charitable entities contribute to the public good in ways other than by providing financial support. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>324 Mass. 724, 731-732 (1949); <em>Assessors of Quincy </em>v <em>Cunningham Found., supra </em>at 419; <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp. </em>v. <em>Belmont, </em>233 Mass. 190, 203 (1919) (exemption for charitable entities justified by view that State\u2019s obligation to minister to human and social needs discharged by private charity).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">When the basis on which an exemption is founded no longer exists, the exemption ceases to be reasonable, and consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>with its constitutional obligation to levy proportional taxation, the Legislature has the power to limit or terminate the exemption. <em>Opinions of the Justices, </em>365 Mass. 665, 668 (1974), citing <em>Assessors of Newton </em>v. <em>Pickwick Ltd., </em>351 Mass. 621, 623 (1967) (\u201cLegislature may repeal previously granted tax exemptions. Tax exemptions are a matter of legislative grace\u201d). <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp. </em>v. <em>Belmont, supra </em>at 200. Put another way, the constitutional power to create an exemption includes the power to change or destroy that exemption, consistent also with the constitutional principle of proportionality. We construe G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 2C, as a reasonable method of effectuating the withdrawal, removal, or termination of an exemption when the subject property is no longer owned by a tax-exempt entity or used for a tax-exempt purpose. See <em>Assessors of Quincy </em>v. <em>Cunningham Found., supra </em>at 414-415. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>324 Mass. 724, 733 (1949) (exemptions valid where they do not \u201cmaterially . . . impair the constitutional principle of proportional taxation of property\u201d). <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>261 Mass. 523, 546-547 (1927) (Legislature has broad power to grant exemptions for <em>proper </em>purposes). See <em>Milton Hosp. &amp; Convalescent Home </em>v. <em>Assessors of Milton, </em>360 Mass. 63, 67 (1971) (rule of proportional exemption applies where there is ascertainable nonexempt use). See also <em>Lynn Hosp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Lynn, </em>383 Mass. 14 (1981). Indeed, as was noted in <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>Washington Mills, supra </em>at 275, the essential principle of proportionality permits the Legislature to require valuation of property \u201coftener\u201d than the Constitution requires, to \u201crender it certain\u201d that taxation is equal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">\u201cThis rule of proportion was based on the obvious and just principle that the benefit which each person derives from the government has direct relation to the amount of property which he possesses and enjoys under its sanction and protection. It was to prevent this essential principle from being violated or disregarded, and to render it certain that taxation for general purposes of government should be made equal, that it was expressly provided in the constitution that a valuation of estates within the Commonwealth should be taken anew decennially at least, and oftener if the legislature should order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>See <em>C &amp; S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westfield, </em>436 Mass. 459, 463 (2002) (inclusion of value of mid-year property improvements reduces incidents of owners\u2019 \u201cuse of more municipal services without contributing their share of municipal expenses\u201d). Albeit on a somewhat different basis from that adopted by the board, <em>Ng Bros. Constr. </em>v. <em>Cranney, </em>436 Mass. 638, 639 (2002), we therefore conclude G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 2C (a), is facially valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">b. <em>Validity of valuation method. </em>We turn now to the question whether, if the Legislature may authorize taxation when property is transferred from a tax-exempt entity or tax-exempt purpose, G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 2C, that tax may be calculated, on a temporary basis, on the basis of the property\u2019s purchase price and date of sale rather than the fair cash valuation of the property as of January 1. The taxpayer argues that the different method of calculating the tax results in unconstitutionally disproportionate taxation and, therefore, that it is entitled to full abatement of the tax assessment pursuant to \u00a7 2C. We conclude, in the circumstances of this case, that the valuation method of \u00a7 2C (a) is neither unreasonable, disproportionate, nor unconstitutional. See <em>Springfield </em>v. <em>Assessors of Granville, </em>378 Mass. 159, 163-164 (1979) (with respect to constitutionality of statute fixing valuation of power plant, \u201cno showing either that the scheme of fixed valuation and exemption was unreasonable when enacted, or that circumstances have since rendered it unfair\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">By authorizing assessors to use the purchase price to measure the fair cash value of property purchased mid-year from a tax-exempt entity, G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 2C, provides a reasonable method for assessing taxes on property that, prior to the sale, was exempt from real estate tax. Such property is not part of the triennial revaluation process, G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 56, and is not subject to pre-assessment information requests pursuant to G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 38D.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Using the purchase price is a reasonable method for ascertaining the \u201cfair cash value\u201d of property owned, in the first part of a fiscal year, by tax-exempt entities. See <em>Northwest Assocs. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Burlington, 392 </em>Mass. 593, 594 (1984) (fair market value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>may be estimated in several ways); <em>Keniston </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>380 Mass. 888, 894-895 (1980) (temporary nature of tax statute \u201cmitigates any residual discrimination\u201d); <em>First Nat\u2019l Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Somerville, </em>358 Mass. 554, 560 (1971) (\u201cActual sales are, of course, very strong evidence of fair market value, for they represent what a buyer has been willing to pay a seller for a particular property\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Tax assessors are obliged, both statutorily and constitutionally, to assess all real property at its full and fair cash value. See <em>Assessors of Weymouth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>375 Mass. 493, 498-499 (1978); <em>Coomey </em>v. <em>Assessors of Sandwich, </em>367 Mass. 836, 837 (1975); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>344 Mass. 766, 768 (1962); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>332 Mass. 769 (1955). Nonetheless, that determination is inherently inexact. See <em>Sudbury </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>366 Mass. 558 (1974); <em>First Nat\u2019l Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Somerville, supra. </em>See also <em>Ramacorti </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Auth., </em>341 Mass. 377 (1960); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>195 Mass. 607, 609 (1908). Given that mathematical precision is not required, <em>Bettigole </em>v. <em>Assessors of Springfield, </em>343 Mass. 223 (1961), and that fair market value sometimes is equated with fair cash value, <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp. </em>v. <em>Belmont, </em>233 Mass. 190, 206 (1919), quoting <em>National Bank of Commerce </em>v. <em>New Bedford, </em>175 Mass. 257, 262 (1900) (\u201c \u2018fair cash value\u2019 . . . means the highest price that a normal purchaser, not under peculiar compulsion, will pay at that time to get that thing\u201d), we conclude that the Legislature could permissibly determine that the actual sales price is a reasonable approximation of a property\u2019s fair cash valuation for G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 2C, purposes, at least in an arm\u2019s-length transaction, and absent contrary evidence. <em>Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Agawam, </em>428 Mass. 261, 263 (1998) (purchase price is best evidence of fair cash value). <em>Assessors of Quincy </em>v. <em>Boston Gas Co., </em>309 Mass. 60, 63 (1941). See <em>Ramacorti </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Auth., supra. </em>That value may substitute, until assessments are made in the ordinary course, for the assessors\u2019 determination of fair cash value. <em>C &amp; S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westfield, </em>436 Mass. 459, 463 (2002) (assessing improvements reduces disproportion). <em>Keniston </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, supra.

Assuming the taxpayer has grounds to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 2C as applied in this case, see note 11, <em>supra, </em>that choice does not reduce a taxpayer\u2019s burden of proving that a statute \u201cas applied\u201d is unconstitutional. <em>Shoppers\u2019 World, Inc. </em>v. <em>Framingham, </em>348 Mass. 366, 377 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">In this case, there is no dispute that, for purposes of the 2001 real estate tax, the assessors valued the property as of January 1, 2000, at $3,281,600. The taxpayer argues that, given that it had purchased the properties only two weeks before that valuation date (on December 17, 1999) for $4,500,000, the purchase price is \u201cpresumably likewise substantially higher than the fair cash value on the preceding January 1, 1999.\u201d As the board noted, however, the taxpayer offered no evidence of the fair cash value as of January 1, 1999, for purposes of a fiscal year 2000 assessment. See <em>Coomey </em>v. <em>Assessors of Sandwich, </em>367 Mass. 836, 838 (1975) (taxpayer bears burden of establishing existence of scheme of disproportionate assessment). Nor did it offer any other substantial evidence on which the board could make a determination of fair cash value as of January 1, 1999 (for fiscal year 2000 purposes). Indeed, the taxpayer did not provide a description of the properties, other than the bare legal description contained in the deeds, and did not offer evidence of market conditions from which the board could determine that the fiscal year 2001 assessed value (as of January 1, 2000) or the purchase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>price could or should be adjusted. Finally, the taxpayer did not offer evidence concerning the sale of the properties that would suggest there were unique circumstances or some relationship between the parties that would make the purchase price weak evidence of fair cash value. See, e.g., <em>Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>397 Mass. 447, 449-450 (1986); <em>Foxboro Assocs. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Foxborough, </em>385 Mass. 679, 682-683 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">In short, there was no basis before the board on which it could be determined that the purchase price was not an appropriate barometer of the properties\u2019 fair cash value: the taxpayer failed to make the requisite showing that the fair cash value on January 1, 1999, was different from the assessors\u2019 levy. On the record before it, the board properly concluded that the taxpayer failed to demonstrate that the tax imposed under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 2C, was disproportionate. See <em>General Mills, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>440 Mass. 154, 161 (2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 973 (2004) (board\u2019s findings are final); <em>Stilson </em>v. <em>Assessors of Gloucester, </em>385 Mass. 724, 729 (1982) (same). Without evidence to the contrary, it is unnecessary and illogical to infer that sophisticated parties would pay more than the fair cash value at the time of the transaction, and the board properly rejected that notion.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>A taxpayer has no constitutional right to avoid paying taxes on property it purchases during the middle of a fiscal year from a tax-exempt organization. General Laws c. 59, \u00a7 2C <em>{a), </em>is a constitutionally valid exercise of the Legislature\u2019s power, for the affected fiscal year, to require the taxpayer to pay a proportionate tax on newly taxable property.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">\n<em>Decision of the Appellate Tax Board affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The 1691 Charter of the Province of the Massachusetts Bay, sometimes referred to as the Province Charter, authorized assessment of proportional taxation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-7\">\u201c[A]nd to impose and levy proportionable and reasonable assessments, rates and taxes, upon the estates and persons of all and every the proprietors and inhabitants of our said province or territory, to be issued and disposed of by warrant under the hand of the governor of our said province for the time being, with the advice and consent of the council, for our service in the necessary defence and support of our government of our said province or territory, and the protection and preservation of the inhabitants there, according to such acts as are or shall be in force within our said province; and to dispose of matters and things whereby our subjects, inhabitants of our said province, may be religiously, peaceably and civilly governed, protected and defended . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">The Charters and General Laws of the Colony and Province of Massachusetts Bay 18, 33 (T.B.

L. c. 59, \u00a7 2C, requires that a \u201cpro forma tax\u201d be based on the purchase price of the real property, while G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 2A, requires assessment based on the property\u2019s \u201cfair cash valuation.\u201d In addition, the relevant assessment date under \u00a7 2C is the date of sale, rather than the January 1 preceding the relevant fiscal year, as \u00a7 2A provides. Section 2C additionally calculates the \u201cpro forma tax\u201d differently, depending on the timing of the real estate transaction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b738-15\">A majority of the Appellate Tax Board (board) ruled that G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 2C <em>(a), </em>imposes a property tax and, therefore, that it must be proportional. Part n, c. 1, \u00a7 1, art. 4, of the Constitution of the Commonwealth. While noting that purchase price may not always be determinative of fair cash value, see, e.g., <em>Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>397 Mass. 447, 449-450 (1986), it held that the purchase price is, in general, \u201cthe most persuasive evidence of value,\u201d and that the board has latitude in determining whether purchase price is the best evidence as of the relevant valuation date. The board concluded that the \u201cpractical operation\u201d of \u00a7 2C does not \u201cdirectly and neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>sarily . . . produce disproportion,\u201d <em>Cheshire </em>v. <em>County Comm\u2019rs of Berkshire, </em>118 Mass. 386, 389 (1875), and that \u00a7 2C is facially constitutional. Further, the board concluded that \u00a7 2C is not unconstitutional as applied because the taxpayer did not establish that the \u00a7 2C tax imposed on it was disproportionate, that is, that the purchase price on which the tax was calculated exceeded the fair cash value as of January 1, 1999.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b739-13\">We acknowledge the amicus brief filed on behalf of the Commonwealth by the Attorney General in support of the board of assessors of Boston.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b739-14\">The property deed lists the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Boston, a corporation sole, as the grantor.
