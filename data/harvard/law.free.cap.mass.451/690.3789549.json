L. c. 38, \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4. The hospital returned the child\u2019s body to his parents, the plaintiffs, but, unbeknownst to them, retained his organs. When the plaintiffs learned that the organs had been retained, they commenced this action in Superior Court against the hospital and the doctors. The plaintiffs claimed that the retention of the organs exceeded the OCME\u2019s authority and sought damages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A jury found in favor of the defendants. The plaintiffs timely appealed, and we transferred the case here on our own motion. We affirm the judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\"><em>Statutory framework. </em>The governing statute in this case is G. L. c. 38, entitled \u201cMedical Examiners and Inquests.\u201d General Laws c. 38, \u00a7 2, explains that the office of the chief medical examiner is within the Executive Office of Public Safety and is charged with conducting \u201cmedicolegal\u201d investigations to determine the cause of death in certain situations. The office is headed by the chief medical examiner, who appoints district or area medical examiners or designates other qualified individuals to conduct medicolegal investigations within their jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">General Laws c. 38, \u00a7 3, provides that \u201cany person having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>knowledge of a death\u201d occurring in any of the nineteen enumerated circumstances must immediately notify the OCME or the medical examiner designated in the location where the death occurred. The variety of circumstances include where criminal violence appears to have taken place, where the death is suspicious or unusual, sudden death where the decedent was in apparent good health, and where children under the age of eighteen<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> years have died from any cause.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">General Laws c. 38, \u00a7 4, states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">\u201cUpon notification of a death in the circumstances enumerated in section three, the chief medical examiner or his designee shall carefully inquire into the cause and circumstances of the death. If, as a result of such inquiry, the chief medical examiner or such designee is of the opinion that the death was due to violence or other unnatural means or to natural causes that require further investigation, he shall take jurisdiction ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\">\u201cEither the medical examiner or the district attorney in the jurisdiction where the death occurred may order an autopsy. Cases requiring autopsy shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the [OCME] for such purpose. As part of his investigation, the chief medical examiner or his designee may, in his discretion, notwithstanding any other provision of law, cause the body to be tested by the department of public health for the presence of any virus, disease, infection, or syndrome which might pose a public health risk.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">General Laws c. 38, \u00a7 5, states, in relevant part, that \u201c[a]ll law enforcement officers, district medical examiners, hospitals and other medical facilities . . . shall cooperate with the office of chief medical examiner in the investigation of medicolegal cases.\u201d General Laws c. 38, \u00a7 13, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-9\">\u201cAfter investigation or examination by the [OCME], the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>body shall be released to the person with the proper legal authority to receive it, including the surviving spouse, the next of kin, or any friend of the deceased, who shall have priority in the order named. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-5\"><em>Facts and proceedings. </em>The plaintiffs\u2019 son, David Macrelli, died on September 11, 1996, shortly after receiving a diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DPT) vaccination. The OCME \u201ctook jurisdiction\u201d of the body pursuant to G. L. c. 38, \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4. Because of a potential public health risk to other children who received a DPT vaccination from the same lot, the OCME ordered an autopsy at Children\u2019s. That hospital was selected because its facilities enabled a more extensive autopsy to be performed than was possible at the medical examiner\u2019s office. The chief medical examiner requested that Hannah Kinney, an expert in sudden infant death syndrome at Children\u2019s, act as neuropathologist. Two other Children\u2019s physicians, Antonio Perez-Atayde and Tina Hali-otis, were assigned to the autopsy as general pathologists. Two staff physicians from the OCME, Jennifer Lipman and George Kury, attended the initial portions of the autopsy; they concluded their investigation and left the autopsy room before the body was closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Within one week after the child\u2019s death, his body was released to the family for burial. The OCME was still awaiting culture results and toxicology work from the autopsy, but issued a temporary death certificate indicating that the cause of death was pending so that the family could bury the child in a timely manner. In January, 1997, four months after the death, the plaintiffs learned for the first time that their son\u2019s organs had been retained by the hospital. They requested the organs back, and the organs were returned the next day. On September 9, 1997, one year after the child had died, the OCME issued the final death certificate, identifying the cause of death as \u201csudden unexplained death in the setting of a recent diphtheria pertussis tetanus vaccination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Before trial, the plaintiffs moved in limine for a ruling whether G. L. c. 38, \u00a7 4, authorizes the OCME to retain organs after an autopsy. At a hearing on the motion, the parties agreed that the OCME was authorized to conduct the autopsy in the first place and that Children\u2019s was required by G. L. c. 38, \u00a7 5, to cooper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>ate with the OCME; the only issue concerned the authority to retain the organs. The judge concluded that unclear factual issues regarding the normal autopsy process prevented him from ruling in limine, and denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">At the conclusion of the trial, the judge, over the plaintiffs\u2019 objection, instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-6\">\u201cThe medical examiner[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] has authority under the statute to do whatever he . . . reasonably believes is medically necessary to determine the cause of the decedent\u2019s death. So the Children\u2019s Hospital, which was the designee of the medical examiner, and its doctors had authority under the statute to do whatever the medical examiner was authorized to do, and that is that the Children\u2019s Hospital had authority under the statute to do whatever [its physicians] reasonably believed was medically necessary to determine the cause of the decedent\u2019s death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-7\">\u201cDuring argument there was a question about. . . what does that include? Can you do this and do that? The law is the medical examiner can do whatever is reasonably necessary to determine the cause of the decedent\u2019s death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">In returning a verdict in favor of the defendants, the jury answered special questions to the effect that none of the defendants had acted negligently or with the intent to inflict emotional distress.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> According to instructions on the special questions form, the jury should have left the remaining questions after the eleventh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>special question blank given their \u201cNo\u201d answers to the prior questions. However, the judge orally instructed the jury to answer the last special question, no. 15. That question asked whether \u201cKinney, Haliotis and Perez-Atayde [were] acting as public employees at the time each performed her or his part of the autopsy.\u201d The judge informed the jury that that question was a \u201cseparate independent question\u201d that was advisory in nature, and that they should answer \u201cYes\u201d to that question if they found that the OCME had the right to direct and control the manner and means by which the defendants conducted their work, and that the acts complained of, including the retention of organs, were within the scope of the defendants\u2019 office and employment. The jury answered \u201cYes\u201d to that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Motion in limine and jury instruction. </em>The plaintiffs argue that the judge erred in denying their pretrial motion in limine that sought a determination that G. L. c. 38, \u00a7 4, did not authorize the OCME to retain organs after an autopsy \u201cwithout the consent of the parents based upon the facts as set forth in this case.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> They challenge also the judge\u2019s instruction to the jury regarding the scope of the OCME\u2019s authority, maintaining that G. L. c. 38 gives less authority to OCME than the instruction implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The judge correctly denied the motion in limine. The plaintiffs requested a pretrial determination that, as a matter of law, G. L. c. 38 precluded the retention of organs, thereby essentially seeking a judgment of liability in their favor. The judge could not have made such a determination, however, as it involved reaching both legal and factual conclusions. The judge could determine the legal proposition that the statute permitted the OCME to do those acts that were reasonably necessary in conducting medi-colegal inquiries. The question then is whether retention of organs was reasonably necessary and appropriate in order to achieve the statutory objectives in this case. That created a question of fact for the jury to decide after hearing the admission of evidence regarding autopsy procedure in general and the specific facts of the case, and the judge properly declined to preempt the jury with respect to the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>The judge also properly instructed that the statute permits the chief medical examiner or his or her designee to do anything that is reasonably medically necessary to determine the cause of death. Although the statute does not address organ retention expressly, it permits the OCME to conduct autopsies, and gives the office authority to \u201ccarefully inquire into the cause and circumstances of. . . death.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> G. L. c. 38, \u00a7 4. When the Legislature delegates authority to an agency or office to accomplish a particular objective, that delegation confers all powers reasonably necessary and appropriate to carry out that objective. See, e.g., <em>Greater Boston Real Estate Bd. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>397 Mass. 870, 877 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">2. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence of negligence. </em>The plaintiffs claim that the defendants should not have retained their son\u2019s organs without their consent. This argument challenges both the judge\u2019s interpretation of the statute in the jury instruction as well as the jury\u2019s determination that the defendants did not act negligently in their performance of the autopsy. We have already addressed the plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the judge\u2019s interpretation of the statute. See part 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">To the extent the plaintiffs challenge the jury\u2019s verdict on factual grounds, the evidence at trial was sufficient to permit the jury to conclude that the defendants did not act negligently in performing the autopsy. Each of the individual defendants testified that the child\u2019s organs were not kept for teaching or research, but to determine the cause of death. There was testimony that because the child died shortly after the DPT vaccination, the organs may have been particularly necessary for investigating the potential public health dangers associated with the vaccine. There was also testimony that the child may have died from sudden infant death syndrome. Haliotis, for instance, testified that it may have been significant that the child\u2019s organs were different sizes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>and weights from the norm, and that the pathologists would have been remiss in not retaining organs when the cause of death was still undetermined. This evidence supported the jury\u2019s determination that none of the defendants was negligent in conducting the autopsy and retaining the organs.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b711-10\">The plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint contained the following specific counts against the individual defendants: (1) tortious interference with a dead body; (2) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (3) negligent infliction of emotional distress; (4) misrepresentation; (5) violation of G. L. c. 93A; and (6) loss of consortium with respect to Cathleen Macrelli. The plaintiffs sought to hold Children\u2019s Hospital liable on a theory of respondeat superior. Although the amended complaint alleged the intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress with respect to both plaintiffs, by agreement, these counts were submitted to the jury only with respect to Donald Macrelli, and the jury were instructed accordingly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b711-11\">We acknowledge the amicus briefs submitted by the Office of the Attorney General, the Professional Liability Foundation, and the National Association of Medical Examiners.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b712-10\">Prior to 2000, a person was required to notify the OCME in the event of the death of a child under two years of age.

On appeal, the plaintiffs do not allege that any of the defendants intentionally inflicted emotional distress on Donald Macreili.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b715-7\">As the plaintiffs stated in their motion in limine, the motion was essentially a request that the judge revisit their motion for summary judgment, which had previously been denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Although Massachusetts has long recognized the right of the next of kin to the possession of a corpse \u201cin the same condition it was in when death supervened,\u201d <em>Burney </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Hosp., </em>169 Mass. 57, 60 (1897), this right is subordinate to the statutorily granted authority of the chief medical examiner or his or her designee to conduct an autopsy in the circumstances set forth in G. L. c. 38, \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4.
