L. c. 265, \u00a7 19 <em>(b), </em>and also convicted the defendant of assault and battery against Mario, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A. The defendant appealed, arguing that the trial judge erred when she admitted the victim\u2019s prior recorded statement and a police officer\u2019s testimony recounting the victim\u2019s out-of-court statement identifying the defendant. The Appeals Court reversed the convictions and remanded the matter for a new trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, 69 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 576, 582 (2007). The sole basis for the Appeals Court\u2019s decision was its conclusion that the prior recorded testimony should not have been admitted because the Commonwealth made an \u201cinsufficient showing of a good faith effort to locate Mario and [thus] Mario\u2019s unavailability was not established.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for further appellate review. Because we conclude that the prior recorded testimony and the out-of-court statement were properly admitted in evidence, we affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\"><em>Background. </em>The facts in this case are set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, supra </em>at 576-577; thus, we present the relevant facts in summary form in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, reserving certain details for discussion in conjunction with the issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">On April 11, 2004, shortly after Mario had left a bar in New Bedford, he was beaten and robbed by two men. His brother, Francisco Perez (Francisco), came to his aid and they chased the two attackers.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The attackers ran into a dwelling and locked the door behind them. Mario and Francisco stayed outside, telephoned the police, and waited. Two police officers arrived and went inside the building, where they found the defendant and Angel Marcial. The defendant and Marcial were arrested, and a search revealed that Marcial had Mario\u2019s wallet in his pocket. As the officers escorted the defendant and Marcial out of the building, Mario and Francisco recognized them as the two men who had beaten and robbed Mario. Mario ran toward the officers, pointed to the defendant and Marcial, and stated, \u201cThat\u2019s the two guys.\u201d The statement was not in response to any question by the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Mario testified at a probable cause hearing held in July, 2004. At that time he lived on Washburn Street in New Bedford. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>October, 2004, the defendant was arraigned in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">On June 8, 2005, twelve days before trial, the Commonwealth filed a motion in limine seeking to introduce Mario\u2019s testimony from the probable cause hearing, asserting his unavailability and claiming that the prior recorded testimony exception to the hearsay rule applied. In support of the motion, the Commonwealth submitted affidavits from a State trooper and an assistant district attorney attesting to their efforts to locate Mario. On the first day of trial, the judge granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">After the jury returned guilty verdicts on both charges,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the judge sentenced the defendant to State prison for a term of from three to three and one-half years.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Admission of prior recorded testimony. </em>In criminal cases, the admission of prior recorded testimony from an unavailable witness implicates the right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Salim, </em>399 Mass. 227, 234 (1987). Prior recorded testimony may be admitted in evidence where the witness is unavailable, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohannon, </em>385 Mass. 733, 741 (1982), if the prior testimony was given under oath in a proceeding where the issues are substantially the same as the current proceeding, and the party against whom it is being offered had a reasonable opportunity and similar motivation to cross-examine the witness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trigones, </em>397 Mass. 633, 638 (1986). \u201cBefore allowing the Commonwealth to introduce prior recorded testimony [of an alleged unavailable witness], the judge must be satisfied that the Commonwealth has made a good faith effort to locate and produce the witness at trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sena, </em>441 Mass. 822, 832 (2004), and cases cited. Whether the Commonwealth has been sufficiently diligent in attempting to obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>the witness\u2019s attendance \u201cdepends upon what is a reasonable effort in light of the peculiar facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopera, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 133, 136 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The defendant argues that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was \u201cinsufficient to support the finding that a good faith effort was made to produce the witness at trial.\u201d However, he does not contest the Commonwealth\u2019s factual assertions about the efforts taken to secure Mario\u2019s attendance at trial, which we summarize.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">In early 2005, the Commonwealth asked the State police to help locate Mario for purposes of testifying at the defendant\u2019s trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A trooper obtained a photograph of Mario from the New Bedford police department and on several occasions visited his last known address on Washburn Street. On more than one occasion, he noticed that a sport utility vehicle with a Rhode Island registration plate was parked outside. The trooper checked the registration of the vehicle and discovered that it was registered to Francisco at an address in Providence, Rhode Island. The trooper then made several attempts to locate Mario at the Providence address but there was no response when he knocked on the door.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, during one such attempt, he could hear music playing inside. He also spoke with neighbors and members of the property\u2019s management company, showing Mario\u2019s photograph, but no one could recall having seen him. During his investigation, the trooper learned that Mario had two outstanding warrants for his arrest out of the New Bedford Division of the District Court Department. In addition, the Commonwealth tried to contact Mario by mailing summonses and letters to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>Washburn Street address that were returned with the notation \u201cnot known at this address.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The Commonwealth eventually found Francisco by tracking a pending case against him in the New Bedford District Court. On the Wednesday before the defendant\u2019s trial, Francisco was served in hand with a summons when he appeared in court for his own case. He appeared for the defendant\u2019s trial. At that time, Francisco explained that Mario had moved to New Jersey, but he did not know the address. Francisco also stated that Mario did not have a telephone but would occasionally call him on a friend\u2019s telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Given these facts, we are unpersuaded by the defendant\u2019s arguments that the \u201cCommonwealth paid scant attention to Francisco\u201d and that, if earlier efforts had been made to locate Francisco, the search activity for Mario would have included data sources and law enforcement in New Jersey. Moreover, even though the Commonwealth was unable to find Francisco until the Wednesday before trial, the search for Mario began a couple of months before trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sena, supra </em>at 833 (Commonwealth showed diligent good faith effort to locate witness where search began one week before trial); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 291, 294 n.3 (1995) (\u201cCommonwealth has no duty to commence its efforts to locate a witness until shortly before trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">The defendant also argues that, after the Commonwealth learned from Francisco that Mario was in New Jersey, the fact that the Commonwealth did not search for him there shows a lack of good faith effort to locate him. It is true that \u201c[m]ere proof of Mario\u2019s absence from the Commonwealth at the time of trial\u201d is insufficient proof of unavailability. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>426 Mass. 555, 558 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiPietro, </em>373 Mass. 369, 381 (1997).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, the Commonwealth does not have to exhaust every lead to meet its burden; it must only exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>reasonable due diligence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ross, supra </em>at 557-558; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Childs, </em>413 Mass. 252, 262 (1992). As discussed <em>supra, </em>this reasonable due diligence requirement is fact driven.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Here, the Commonwealth had reason to believe that further efforts to locate Mario in New Jersey would be unsuccessful because he had outstanding arrest warrants in New Bed-ford and, thus, was unlikely to return to the Commonwealth voluntarily. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>428 Mass. 672, 678 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Therefore, considering the measures taken by the Commonwealth in conjunction with the limited information available about Mario\u2019s location and his outstanding warrants, the judge was warranted in concluding that the Commonwealth\u2019s efforts were reasonable and that it satisfied its due diligence requirement. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberio, </em>440 Mass. 245, 248 (2003) (sufficient where Commonwealth enlisted State troopers, who contacted witness\u2019s probation officer and girlfriend, and executed \u201cstake out\u201d of bar in Florida); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sieg-friedt, </em>402 Mass. 424, 426-428 (1988) (where second trial began within week of mistrial, not error to rely on unavailability finding by same trial judge in first trial and on testimony that police had made additional attempts to locate witness); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Salim, </em>399 Mass. 227, 233-235 &amp; n.3 (1987) (sufficient where local police enlisted aid of Dallas police after learning from witness\u2019s relatives that witness might have moved to that city); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>363 Mass. 467, 470-471 (1973) (suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>ficient where relatives were contacted and several police departments joined in search for witness).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">2. <em>Prior out-of-court statement identifying the defendant. </em>a. <em>Confrontation clause. </em>The defendant contends that when the police officer \u201cwas permitted to testify that, without prompting, Mario said, \u2018That\u2019s the two guys,\u2019 \u201d it violated his right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment. In particular, the defendant claims that Mario\u2019s out-of-court statement was \u201ctestimonial in fact\u201d and, therefore, inadmissible under <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 53-54 (2004) <em>(Crawford), </em>where the Commonwealth has failed to establish Mario\u2019s unavailability. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">In <em>Crawford, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that testimonial out-of-court statements are inadmissible under the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment \u201cunless [the witness] was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 59. The Court declined to provide a \u201ccomprehensive definition of \u2018testimonial,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 68, but instead discussed various formulations of the \u201ccore class\u201d of testimonial statements.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 51. In <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 822 (2006), the Court again declined to produce an exhaustive classification of testimonial and non-testimonial statements. However, the Court did state that \u201c[statements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assist-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>anee to meet an ongoing emergency. [The statements] are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, the Court provided four indicia that help determine whether the primary purpose of a statement is testimonial; pertinent here is whether the declarant was \u201cspeaking about events <em>as they were actually </em>happening, rather than \u2018describing] past events.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 827, quoting <em>Lilly </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>527 U.S. 116, 137 (1999). The Court also declared that \u201cstatements made in the absence of any interrogation are [not] necessarily nontestimonial.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington, supra </em>at 822 n.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>445 Mass. 1 (2005), cert. denied, 548 U.S. 926 (2006), this court articulated a framework for determining whether an out-of-court statement is testimonial. We held that \u201cstatements made in response to questioning by law enforcement agents are per se testimonial, except when the questioning is meant to secure a volatile scene or to establish the need for or provide medical care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. Out-of-court statements offered spontaneously, without prompting, are not per se testimonial. <em>Id. </em>at 11. However, \u201cout-of-court statements that are not testimonial per se must be examined to determine if they are nonetheless testimonial in fact by evaluating whether a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would anticipate his statement being used against the accused in investigating and prosecuting a crime.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>423 F. 3d 355, 360-361 (3d Cir. 2005), and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pugh, </em>405 F.3d 390, 399 (6th Cir. 2005), to support his assertion that the out-of-court statement was testimonial in fact because Mario would have reasonably anticipated that his statement to the police would be used in the investigation, is misplaced. In <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>v. <em>Hinton, supra </em>at 361, the witness identified his assailant while riding in a police cruiser in pursuit of the suspect. Unlike that case, here Mario was describing events as they were unfolding rather than identifying the defendant to create a record that could be used at trial. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington, supra </em>at 827. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pugh, supra, </em>during a <em>police interrogation </em>the witness identified the defendants in a photograph, whereas here Mario\u2019s identification was offered spontaneously without prompting from the officers. A reasonable person in Mario\u2019s position would not have anticipated that his statement would be used against the defendant in prosecuting the crime. Therefore, we conclude that the out-of-court statement is not testimonial and its admissibility is governed by the Commonwealth\u2019s rules of evidence. <em>Crawford, supra </em>at 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">b. <em>Spontaneous utterance. </em>The judge properly admitted Mario\u2019s out-of-court statement as a spontaneous utterance. \u201cA spontaneous utterance will be admitted in evidence if (1) there is an occurrence or event \u2018sufficiently startling to render inoperative the normal reflective thought processes of the observer,\u2019 and (2) if the declarant\u2019s statement was \u2018a spontaneous reaction to the occurrence or event and not the result of reflective thought.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>437 Mass. 620, 623 (2002), quoting 2 McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 272, at 204 (5th ed. 1999). \u201cA judge has broad discretion in determining whether a statement qualifies as a spontaneous utterance, and that determination will only be disturbed [for] an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>442 Mass. 826, 832 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">The judge\u2019s ruling had sufficient support. Without being prompted, Mario made the identifying statement a short distance from where he had been beaten and robbed, after he had chased the defendant and Marcial to the house where they were arrested. Furthermore, the fact that the record is silent as to how much time elapsed between the assault and the statement does not disqualify the statement as a spontaneous utterance as long as the excitement or stress of the startling event has not dissipated. <em>Id. </em>at 833 (\u201cThere is no requirement that the statements be made contemporaneously with the exciting cause\u201d). The circumstances here indicate that Mario was still under the sway of the exciting event when he made the identifying statement, and thus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>statement was properly admitted.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Furthermore, even if we assume that the out-of-court statement identifying the defendant was erroneously admitted, any error was nonprejudicial because the evidence was cumulative; Francisco identified the defendant as Mario\u2019s attacker in court.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>429 Mass. 146, 158 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-8\">The grand jury returned indictments charging the defendant with unarmed robbery and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. However, at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty with respect to the dangerous weapon portion of the latter indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b694-9\">At trial and on appeal the defendant does not contend that the prior recorded testimony would be inadmissible for any reason other than the Commonwealth\u2019s purported failure to demonstrate Mario\u2019s unavailability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The affidavit from the State trooper does not provide the precise date the Commonwealth first requested aid from the State police. The defendant does not dispute the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that \u201cearly 2005\u201d should be interpreted as no later than April because the Commonwealth would not have known when to summon Mario for trial until after the final pretrial conference, which was held on March 14, 2005. The Commonwealth\u2019s claim that it did not know the trial date until after that final pretrial conference comports with Mass. R. Crim. R 11, as appearing in 442 Mass. 1509 (2004), and Superior Court Standing Order 2-86, Parts VI and VII. Therefore, we may assume, as the Commonwealth asserts, that the search for Mario began no later than April.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b695-8\">The trooper\u2019s affidavit does not provide precise dates, nor does it specify the number of visits that were made to the New Bedford and Providence addresses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b696-8\">The affidavits from the assistant district attorney do not specify the dates or the number of summonses mailed to the New Bedford address.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b696-10\">The cases on which the defendant relies are easily distinguished.

App. Ct. 414, 415-416 (2000) (insufficient where witness\u2019s mother gave prosecutor witness\u2019s address and Commonwealth merely sent summons and letter to address but never involved police). Unlike these cases, here the Commonwealth searched for Mario by enlisting the aid of the State trooper and mailing summonses. The Commonwealth\u2019s efforts did not produce an address, but merely revealed that Mario might be living somewhere in New Jersey.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b697-12\">We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument that the \u201cCommonwealth did not pursue reasonable and available leads\u201d because it failed to take advantage of technological advances such as asking Francisco to trace the location of Mario\u2019s last telephone call.
