L. c. 231 A) and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>writ of mandamus (G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 5) against the defendant, the Department of Housing and Community Development (department). The town challenged the department\u2019s conclusion that only twenty-five per cent of the units in a residential building project the board approved would be counted toward the town\u2019s subsidized housing inventory (SHI). The department filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. R 12 (b) (1), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. After a hearing, a Superior Court judge issued a memorandum of decision and order allowing the department\u2019s motion to dismiss. The town appealed, claiming that the judge erred in concluding that no controversy existed between the town and the department; in determining that there was no final act by the department and that the town had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies; and in not giving effect to the \u201cstreamlining\u201d requirement of G. L. c. 40B.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We granted the town\u2019s application for direct appellate review. Because we conclude that no final administrative action has been taken by the department, and that the town has failed to exhaust its administrative remedies, we affirm the Superior Court\u2019s judgment of dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\"><em>Statutory and regulatory scheme. </em>The Comprehensive Permit Act, G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23 (Act), was designed to facilitate the construction of low or moderate income housing<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by removing local exclusionary zoning practices that would thwart their development. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Ardemore Apartments Ltd. Partnership, </em>436 Mass. 811, 814 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">A key aspect of the Act\u2019s framework is the requirement that each municipality devote ten per cent of its housing units to low or moderate income housing. See G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20; <em>Taylor </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number><em>Housing Appeals Comm., ante </em>149, 151 (2008). In order to encourage and expedite the construction of such housing, the Act \u201cstreamlines\u201d the permitting process by allowing a developer who wants to construct low or moderate income housing to file a single application for a comprehensive permit with the local zoning board of appeals rather than seeking separate approval from each local board having jurisdiction over the project. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Ardemore Apartments Ltd. Partnership, supra </em>at 815. See <em>Standerwick </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Andover, </em>447 Mass. 20, 29 (2006). Municipalities may grant or deny such permits in light of their obligations under the Act to achieve the ten per cent statutory minimum. Although it is not clear in the record, statute, or regulations, it appears that the department is informed when a permit is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The SHI, which is maintained by the department, is a tally of the number of low and moderate income housing in a locality of the Commonwealth. 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 31.04(1) (2004). It is updated biennially and is presumed to be accurate. <em>Id. </em>The department has promulgated standards to determine how low and moderate income units are counted in the SHI.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Important to this case is the fact that there are no statutory or regulatory provisions that allow a town separately to appeal to the Superior Court the department\u2019s calculation of the number of units that are included in a town\u2019s SHI. The Act does, however, allow a party whose permit was denied the opportunity to appeal from the local zoning board\u2019s decision to the department\u2019s housing appeals committee (HAC). G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 22. A town may participate in that appeal. See 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 31.04(l)(a), 31.06(5) (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Once a municipality has achieved the ten per cent statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>minimum, the local zoning board of appeals may \u201cdeny comprehensive permits with impunity\u201d and the HAC has no authority to order a local zoning board of appeal to issue a comprehensive permit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra </em>at 151. See <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Ardemore Apartments Ltd. Partnership, supra </em>at 815. \u201cHowever, the municipality\u2019s failure to meet its minimum housing obligations . . . will provide compelling evidence that the regional need for housing does in fact outweigh the objections to the proposal.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>363 Mass. 339, 367 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\"><em>Facts. </em>We summarize the facts set forth in the complaint.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In November, 2000, a developer, Hingham Campus, LLC, applied to the zoning board of appeals (board) for a comprehensive permit, in accordance with G. L. c. 40B, to build a continuing care retirement community called Linden Ponds. Linden Ponds is a phased project that will contain 1,750 rental apartments, 192 assisted living units, and a 324-bed skilled nursing facility. All residents will have to pay a refundable entrance deposit and monthly fee. Entrance deposits range from $195,000 to $435,000 and monthly fees range from $1,252 to $2,230 depending on the size of the unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">After public hearings held over several months, the board unanimously voted to grant the comprehensive permit. The com-. prehensive permit became final on September 18, 2001, when the written decision granting it was filed with the Hingham <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>town clerk. 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 31.08(4) (2004). Despite the board\u2019s belief that all 1,750 of the Linden Ponds rental units should count toward the town\u2019s SHI, the town received a letter dated November 16, 2005, in which the department informed the town that it would only count twenty-five per cent of the units toward the town\u2019s SHI.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As a result of the department\u2019s refusal to count all the units, the town has not fulfilled its ten per cent minimum affordable housing obligation and will be subject to additional G. L. c. 40B projects. The town requests a declaration that it is entitled to have all the units counted toward its SHI.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. The purpose of declaratory judgment is \u201cto afford relief from uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, duties, status and other legal relations.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Ass\u2019n of Indep. Ins. Agents &amp; Brokers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>373 Mass. 290, 291 (1977), quoting G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 9. However, in order for a court to provide declaratory relief, an actual controversy \u2014 that is, a controversy appropriate for judicial resolution \u2014 must exist. In the context of a dispute between an administrative agency and a party, there is no actual controversy in the absence of final agency action. See <em>Samuels Pharmacy, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Pharmacy, </em>390 Mass. 583, 592 (1983). See also <em>East Chop Tennis Club </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>364 Mass. 444, 450 (1973) (\u201cproceeding for declaratory relief in itself does not operate to suspend the ordinary requirement that a plaintiff exhaust his administrative remedies before seeking judicial relief\u201d). Similarly, a general prerequisite for obtaining mandamus relief is that all available administrative remedies have been exhausted. See <em>Karl V. Wolsey Co. </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Bedford, </em>324 Mass. 419, 422 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Here, the town is challenging a nonfinal administrative ruling. The department\u2019s letter dated November 16, 2005, informing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>the town that it would only count twenty-five per cent of the Linden Ponds units toward the town\u2019s SHI, is not formally binding on the HAC. As discussed <em>infra, </em>the SHI calculation can be reviewed by the HAC in a later proceeding, when an applicant appeals from the denial of a comprehensive permit.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, the HAC regulations explicitly state that the SHI merely carries a presumption of correctness and that a party, including a town, may introduce evidence to rebut the presumption at the later proceeding. 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 31.04(l)(a). If a party rebuts the SHI calculation, the HAC \u201cshall on a case by case basis determine what housing or units of housing are low or moderate income housing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, because there was no final or formal action by the department, the town\u2019s declaratory action is premature.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Samuels Pharmacy, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Pharmacy, supra </em>at 589-591 (no declaratory judgment where defendant sent plaintiffs informal notice of anticipated ruling in letter and plaintiffs had opportunity to object to ruling in subsequent formal proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The town also claims that because an application for another comprehensive permit was pending before the board that called into question the board\u2019s affordable housing status, the judge erred when she held that no controversy existed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As has been stated, there is no actual controversy between a party and an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>administrative agency until the agency issues a final decision. See <em>Samuels Pharmacy, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Pharmacy, supra </em>at 592. See also <em>Alliance, AFSCME/SEIU, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>427 Mass. 546, 549 (1998) (mandamus relief only where controversy concrete rather than remote or abstract). Thus, even with another G. L. c. 40B application pending, the town still is not entitled to a declaratory judgment or mandamus relief precisely because the application is still pending; it has not resulted in final action either by the town or by the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">2. The town next contends that the judge erred in concluding that the town had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. The town argues that it cannot exhaust its administrative remedies where none is provided independently to challenge an improper SHI calculation. It claims it has \u201cno right to appeal the [SHI] calculations nor is there any hearing process established to hear disagreements\u201d about the SHI. We disagree. The town has an administrative remedy that entails waiting until a decision by the board to deny a comprehensive permit is appealed by the applicant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 22. Then the town may present any objections concerning the accuracy of the SHE at the HAC hearing. If the HAC rules against the town, it may appeal from that decision to the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 30A. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The town claims that it is unable to make important decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>about its affordable housing options because municipalities lack an independent avenue to appeal, that \u201csubstantively affects [its] rights regarding its ability to deny comprehensive permits\u201d and \u201c[i]n the event a developer fails to appeal a denial of a comprehensive permit ... the [municipality] cannot challenge the SHI.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We disagree. A municipality is free to deny a comprehensive permit even if it has failed to meet its minimum low or moderate housing obligation as long as \u201cthe community\u2019s need for the low or moderate income housing is outweighed by valid planning objections . . . such as health, site, [and] design.\u201d <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Greenfield </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 553, 557 (1983). Moreover, if a developer chooses not to contest the permit denial, then the municipality would have no need to challenge the SHI because it would not be harmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">There are sound policy reasons for requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies. The HAC should be given the opportunity to address the issues raised by the town so as to \u201cavoid the occurrence of untimely and piecemeal litigation.\u201d <em>Gill </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Psychologists, </em>399 Mass. 724, 727 (1987). \u201cTo permit judicial interference with the orderly administration by the [HAC] of matters entrusted to it by the Legislature before it has . . . [made] a final decision, would in effect transfer to the courts the determination of questions which the Legislature has left ... to the [HAC], and would result in the substitution of the judgment of the court for that of the [HAC].\u201d <em>Saint Luke\u2019s Hosp. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>320 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Mass. 467, 470 (1946). Moreover, \u201callowing the administrative process to run its course . . . gives the administrative agency in question a full and fair opportunity to apply its expertise to the statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Gill </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Psychologists, supra </em>at 727, quoting <em>Assuncao\u2019s Case, </em>372 Mass. 6, 8 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">3. Exceptions to the exhaustion requirement have been made when the administrative remedy is inadequate, \u201cwhen important novel, or recurrent issues are at stake, when the decision has public significance, or when the case reduces to a question of law.\u201d <em>Luchini </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>436 Mass. 403, 405 (2002), quoting <em>Space Bldg. Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>413 Mass. 445, 448 (1992). See <em>I.S.K. Con of New England </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 327, 330 (1985). The town contends that the circumstances of this case warrant an exception to the exhaustion requirement because challenging the SHI presents a \u201cnovel and unique case\u201d that is a matter of \u201cparticular public interest.\u201d The town\u2019s reliance on <em>Kelleher </em>v. <em>Personnel Adm\u2019r of the Dep\u2019t of Personnel Admin., </em>421 Mass. 382, 385 (1995), and <em>Norfolk Elec., Inc. </em>v. <em>Fall River Hous. Auth., </em>417 Mass. 207, 210 (1994), is misplaced. Both of these cases granted an exception based on the fact that the case dealt with \u201cpurely legal questions,\u201d <em>Kelleher </em>v. <em>Personnel Adm\u2019r of the Dep\u2019t of Personnel Admin., supra, </em>or had no \u201cfact-finding function for the agency to perform.\u201d <em>Norfolk Elec., Inc. </em>v. <em>Fall River Hous. Auth., supra. </em>Here, the underlying issue is whether the department properly calculated the town\u2019s SHI, which is a factual question rather than a purely legal question that does not present a novel issue. This case is not one of the rare cases that warrants an exception to the exhaustion requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The town further claims that the \u201cunique hardship\u201d placed on it due to the administrative agency\u2019s disregard for its guidelines as well as the \u201c[tjown\u2019s inability to independently appeal augers in favor of not requiring exhaustion.\u201d The town\u2019s reliance on <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Beacon Hill Architectural Comm\u2019n, </em>421 Mass. 570, 588 (1996), does not help its argument. In that case, the court stated that \u201c[l]itigants may challenge <em>agency action </em>as insufficient at law or unwarranted by the evidence in part based on agency deviance from the policies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>stated in its rules\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>As discussed <em>supra, </em>there has been no final or formal action taken by the department regarding the town\u2019s SHI calculation. Thus, we decline to extend this exhaustion exception to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">4. The town argues that the judge\u2019s decision failed to give effect to the streamlining mandate of G. L. c. 40B. It further asserts that the department\u2019s action will \u201cseverely chill\u201d future applications pursuant to G. L. c. 40B because the only mechanism for a town to challenge a SHI calculation would be by denying permits and the developers would end up factoring these litigation costs into their projects. This, they argue, could make it uneconomic for the developer to build in the town. We disagree. If we adopt the town\u2019s position, the lengthy delays inherent in permitting independent litigation of the SHI calculations would itself chill G. L. c. 40B projects and impede the construction of low or moderate income housing, thus thwarting the purpose of G. L. c.'40B, which is \u201cto promote affordable housing by minimizing lengthy and expensive delays.\u201d <em>Standerwick </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Andover, </em>447 Mass. 20, 29 (2006). Moreover, there would be no limit on how often or when a town could file a complaint for a declaratory judgment or judicial review of a its SHI calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons stated above, the judgment allowing the motion to dismiss is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The town also argues that \u201cdeclaratory judgment is appropriate because there is an actual controversy between [the town] and [the department] regarding [the department\u2019s] failure to adhere to its guidelines.\u201d Given the procedural posture of this case, we need not address this claim because it hinges on the merits of the town\u2019s assertion that the SHI calculation is incorrect, which is not before this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b522-8\">General Laws c. 40B, \u00a7 20, defines the term \u201c[l]ow or moderate income housing\u201d as \u201cany housing subsidized by the federal or state government under any program to assist the construction of low or moderate income housing as defined in the applicable federal or state statute, whether built or operated by any public agency or any nonprofit or limited dividend organization.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b523-7\">A housing development is eligible to be included on the SHI if \u201c(1) the . . .

(2) 25% or more of the units in the development are subject to long-term use restriction to be occupied by an income eligible household.

In this letter, the chairman of the HAC informed the town that 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 31.04 (2004), which establishes the process for calculating a town\u2019s SHI, does not grant the town an independent right to appeal from the SHI calculation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b526-6\"><em>A </em>decision of a zoning board of appeals to grant a comprehensive permit also may be appealed by \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved by the issuance\u201d to the Land Court or Superior Court under the appeals procedure established in G.

See <em>Planning Bd. of Hingham </em>v. <em>Hingham Campus, LLC, </em>438 Mass. 364, 368 (2003) (planning board not aggrieved person).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The town contends that the judge erred in determining that there was no final administrative action because she based her conclusion on a letter that is not the administrative action that is the subject of the complaint. The town is correct that it is the November 16, 2005, letter from the department and not the December 19, 2001, letter from the HAC that formed the basis of the complaint. Even though the judge used the 2001 letter, rather than the 2005 letter, the town was not harmed because this does not change the legal analysis regarding whether a nonfinal administrative act creates an actual controversy. Moreover, this error has no bearing on this appeal because we review this jurisdictional issue de nova. See <em>Chenard </em>v. <em>Commerce Ins. Co., </em>440 Mass. 444, 445 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b526-8\">The judge determined that the town\u2019s uncertainty as to the percentage of affordable housing units in its SHI was \u201cwholly speculative and not appropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>ate for declaratory relief\u201d because there were no pending G. L. c. 40B applications. The town\u2019s unopposed motion to supplement its opposition to the motion to dismiss contained an affidavit from a board member that stated that there was an application for a G. L. c. 40B project pending before the board. We will consider this motion because the department, at oral argument, stated that it did not object to this court\u2019s deciding the case in light of the pending G. L. c. 40B application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Depending on what action the board takes on the pending application for a comprehensive permit that it has before it, as discussed <em>supra, </em>such an appeal may result. Cf. <em>Wrentham </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., post </em>511, 514 (2008) (where board denied comprehensive permit and developer appealed to HAC but where court held that HAC\u2019s remand order was not final decision subject to judicial review or declaratory judgment).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b527-9\">Because the town\u2019s administrative remedies are not available in the proceeding that gave rise to its claim of having met its ten per cent statutory minimum of affordable housing, this case does not present the usual factual basis for application of the exhaustion requirement. Compare, e.g., <em>East Chop Tennis Club </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>364 Mass. 444, 445-446, 448 (1973) (plaintiff was party to ongoing administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>proceeding before defendant agency when it initiated court action for declaratory relief). Nonetheless, the principles and policy reasons underlying the exhaustion doctrine, discussed in the text <em>infra, </em>apply with equal force to this case, because these principles and reasons focus on the expertise and role of the HAC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b528-7\">The town also contends that the \u201conly mechanism to obtain review of the SHI requires . . . manipulation of the comprehensive permitting process to obtain an appeal.\u201d Its reliance on <em>Planning Bd. of Hingham </em>v. <em>Hingham Campus, LLC, </em>438 Mass. 364, 370 (2003), to support this claim is misplaced. That case did not deal directly with the issue presented in this case. The planning board sought a mechanism by which it could appeal the granting of a comprehensive permit in an effort to thwart the construction of low and moderate income housing. <em>Id. </em>Here, the town seeks to create a route of appeal that would permit independent challenges to the department\u2019s calculation of the town\u2019s SHI.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
