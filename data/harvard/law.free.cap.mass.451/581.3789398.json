We conclude that the plain language of the comprehensive permit act, G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23 (act), precludes such authority.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-13\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>The Massachusetts comprehensive permit act. </em>The material facts are not in dispute. In order to place them in context, we describe briefly the relevant portions of the act, inserted by St. 1969, c. 774, \u201cwhich [have] been thoroughly canvassed in earlier opinions.\u201d <em>Middleborough </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>449 Mass. 514, 516 (2007), citing <em>Dennis Hous. Corp. </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Dennis, </em>439 Mass. 71, 76-78 (2003), and <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>363 Mass. 339, 347-354 (1973). The primary purpose of the act is \u201cto provide relief from exclusionary zoning practices which prevent[] the construction of badly needed low and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>moderate income housing.\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm.., ante </em>149, 151 (2008), quoting <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra </em>at 354. The act allows a \u201climited dividend organization interested in constructing low or moderate income housing to circumvent the often arduous process of applying to multiple local boards for individual permits and, instead, to apply to the local board of appeals for issuance of a single comprehensive permit.\u201d <em>Middleborough </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra </em>at 516. See G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21. \u201cIn addition to streamlining the permitting process itself, the clear intent of the Legislature was to promote affordable housing by minimizing lengthy and expensive delays occasioned by court battles commenced by those seeking to exclude affordable housing from their own neighborhoods.\u201d <em>Standerwick </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Andover, </em>447 Mass. 20, 29 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Consistent with these \u201coft-repeated objectives,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 30, the act establishes a straightforward appeals process for the applicant. G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 22-23. \u201cWhenever an application ... is denied, or is granted with such conditions and requirements as to make the building or operation of such housing uneconomic, the applicant shall have the right to appeal to the housing appeals committee . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 22.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When a denial is reviewed by the committee, the local board of appeals has \u201cthe burden of proving, first, that there is a valid . . . local concern which supports such denial, and then, that such concern outweighs the regional housing need.\u201d 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 31.06(6) (2001).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That burden is consistent with the statutory language: \u201cIf the committee finds, in the case of a denial, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>the decision of the board of appeals was unreasonable and not consistent with local needs, it shall vacate such decision and shall direct the board to issue a comprehensive permit or approval to the applicant.\u201d G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 23. By contrast, when the developer appeals from an approval with conditions, \u201cthe applicant shall have the burden of proving that the conditions make the building or operation of the housing uneconomic.\u201d 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 31.06(3). If the applicant presents evidence sufficient to meet this burden, \u201cthe Board shall [then] have the burden of proving, first, that there is a valid . . . local concern which supports such conditions, and then, that such concern outweighs the regional housing need.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 31.06(7). The shifting burdens are likewise consistent with the statutory language. Section 22 of the act allows for review of an approval only when it \u201cis granted with such conditions and requirements as to make the building or operation of such housing uneconomic.\u201d G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 22. Section 23 empowers the committee to \u201corder [the] board to modify or remove any such condition or requirement\u201d only when the board\u2019s approval with conditions \u201cmakes the building or operation of such housing uneconomic <em>and </em>is not consistent with local needs\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The structure of the act \u201creflects the Legislature\u2019s careful balance between leaving to local authorities their well-recognized autonomy generally to establish local zoning requirements . . . while foreclosing municipalities from obstructing the building of a minimum level of housing affordable to persons of low income\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Ardemore Apartments Ltd. Partnership, </em>436 Mass. 811, 822-823 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">b. <em>Facts and procedural history. </em>Against this backdrop, we consider the undisputed facts. The developer, Archstone-Smith Operative Trust, is a Maryland limited dividend corporation, eligible to seek a comprehensive permit under G. L. c. 40B, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>\u00a7 21. On September 28, 2000, the developer applied to the board of appeals of Woburn (board) for a comprehensive permit to build 640 units of housing, of which twenty-five per cent would be affordable, on a 74.46 acre parcel of land owned by Northeastern University on Cambridge Road in Woburn.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The proposed project was to consist of thirty-two twenty-unit buildings, and a 5,500 square foot recreation center. The proposal envisioned two types of residential buildings: twenty-two two-story garden apartment buildings with twelve one-bedroom units and eight two-bedroom units per building; and ten three-story split garden apartments that would include ten one-bedroom units and ten two-bedroom units per building. The proposed total \u201cimpervious\u201d areas of the development (including the apartment building footprints, community center building, drives and parking, but excluding walkways) comprised 28.4 per cent of the site, or 21.2 acres. Proposed open space area constituted 71.6 per cent of the development, or 53.3 acres, including preserved natural wetland areas, preserved natural upland areas, and landscaped areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The board held nine days of public hearings on the developer\u2019s proposal, beginning on October 18, 2000, and concluding on July 25, 2001. On August 22, 2001, the board voted to grant a comprehensive permit with conditions, and issued its written decision on September 10, 2001, delineating each condition. The comprehensive permit set forth fifty conditions in total, most significantly limiting the development to 300 units instead of the 640 units proposed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">On September 11, 2001, the developer appealed from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>board\u2019s decision to the committee. The committee specially designated a hearing officer to hear evidence and recommend a decision for the committee\u2019s review. The hearing officer conducted a site visit and held twenty-seven days of evidentiary hearings, during the course of which 170 exhibits were admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">On June 11, 2003, the committee issued its decision.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 22 and 23 of the act, and 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 31.06(3) (2001), the committee first reviewed the conditions imposed by the board to determine whether they rendered the development uneconomic, and found that the developer had \u201cnot proven that the conditions make the building or operation of the housing uneconomic.\u201d Despite reaching this conclusion, the committee opined that neither the act nor its prior decisions \u201cpreclude!] further analysis of the [b]card\u2019s conditions in every case in which conditions have not been proven to be uneconomic,\u201d and ruled that \u201cwhen the board has not articulated a reasonable factual or legal justification for a condition, we will modify or eliminate it.\u201d Using this standard, the committee inquired whether the board\u2019s conditions were supported by legitimate local concerns that outweighed the regional need for low or moderate income housing, and concluded that several were not. The committee then removed or modified the offending conditions. Most prominently, the committee altered the board\u2019s condition limiting the development to 300 units.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>In determining what the proper size of the development should be, the committee found \u201cthat ample evidence exists in the record to support the [b]card\u2019s position that the 640-unit proposed development is too large [and] impos[es] significant burdens on the surrounding community.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It then noted that it is \u201crarely wise for us to sift through the evidence to attempt to identify an acceptable size ourselves,\u201d but it proceeded to do exactly that. Ultimately, the committee determined that the purchase and sale agreement for the land, entered into by the developer and Northeastern University, reflected the \u201cdeveloper\u2019s neutral evaluation of the carrying capacity of the site.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The agreement was based on development approval for the construction of 420 units, and the committee adopted that number as the \u201cacceptable number of units for this proposal.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Both the board and the developer filed complaints for judicial review in the Superior Court. The cases were consolidated, and the parties filed cross motions for judgment on the pleadings. On April 25, 2005, a judge entered an order upholding the committee\u2019s decision in part and reversing it in part. In his ruling, the judge found that while the committee expressly regarded the board\u2019s issuance of a comprehensive permit to be an approval with conditions, the committee\u2019s review was more consistent with the review given to a denial. However, the judge concluded that the committee\u2019s review was appropriate, because the condition substantially reducing the number of units was the \u201cfunctional equivalent of a denial,\u201d rather than an approval with conditions.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Consequently, the committee could consider whether the conditions themselves were \u201creasonable and consistent with local needs,\u201d even though it found that those conditions did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>make the project uneconomic, a finding that the judge specifically determined was supported by the evidence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The judge then reviewed the committee\u2019s decision to determine whether substantial evidence existed in the record to support the committee\u2019s alteration of the size of the project. Stated otherwise, the judge reviewed the committee\u2019s revisions to determine whether the record supported its conclusion that they were more consistent with the local need for affordable housing (when balanced against Woburn\u2019s other local concerns) than the conditions originally set by the board. The judge determined that the committee\u2019s \u201cselection of 420 units as the appropriate number of units . . . was unsupported by sufficient evidence in the record,\u201d and remanded the case to the committee to determine \u201can appropriate number of units given the need for affordable housing and local needs concerns.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">On remand to the committee, the developer contended that a 540-unit development, rather than the 640-unit development it had originally proposed, was consistent with local needs, and submitted three affidavits in support of such a development. The affidavits set out two alternative design plans for the development.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> On July 21, 2005, the committee held a hearing, which it limited to the cross-examination of witnesses whose testimony had been prefiled.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> On September 20, 2005, the committee is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>sued its decision, concluding that a 540-unit development would be consistent with local needs and ordering the board to issue a comprehensive permit for a 540-unit complex. The committee\u2019s decision did not designate which of the two design plans the board should permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The board again appealed from the committee\u2019s decision by filing a new complaint in the Superior Court, contending, in pertinent part, that the committee exceeded its statutory power in approving a 540-unit plan on remand, because the developer\u2019s revised plan constituted a substantial change from the original proposal. See 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 31.03 (2001).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The board argued that the committee should have remanded the new proposal for its consideration. The judge found otherwise, declining to hold that the \u201c540-unit plans constituted a \u2018substantial change\u2019 \u201d as a matter of law. Additionally, the judge concluded that the committee\u2019s decision that a 540-unit development was reasonable and consistent with local needs was supported by substantial evidence, and that, when issuing the comprehensive permit, the board would be entitled to choose between the two 540-unit plans proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The board\u2019s second complaint was consolidated with the other cases, and final judgment entered on December 28, 2006, affirming the committee\u2019s September 20, 2005, decision that ordered the board to issue a comprehensive permit for a 540-unit development. The board filed its notice of appeal, and we granted the board\u2019s and the developer\u2019s respective applications for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>2. <em>Discussion. </em>The board\u2019s principal contention on appeal is that the committee exceeded it statutory authority when it revised the conditions imposed by the board, increasing the approved project size from 300 units to 540 units, after finding that the board\u2019s conditions did not make the project uneconomic. We agree.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">In reviewing a committee decision, we give \u201cdue weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency, as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u201d G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 14 (7). See <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>363 Mass. 339, 376 (1973). Yet, judicial deference to agency decisions is not without limits. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., ante </em>149, 154-155 (2008). See <em>Leopoldstadt, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Health Care Fin. &amp; Policy, </em>436 Mass. 80, 91 (2002), quoting <em>Protective Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>425 Mass. 615, 618 (1997) (principle \u201cone of deference, not abdication\u201d). Here, the committee brushed aside the language of the governing statute and the regulations of the department and, in so doing, exceeded its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">General Laws c. 40B, \u00a7 22, provides that whenever a developer\u2019s comprehensive permit application \u201cis denied, or is granted with such conditions and requirements as to make the building or operation of such housing uneconomic, the applicant shall have the right to appeal to the housing appeals committee.\u201d In other words, the committee may review an approval with conditions <em>only </em>if those conditions render the project uneconomic. Consistent with this statutory requirement, the department\u2019s regulations provide that the developer must demonstrate that the conditions are uneconomic before the committee considers whether they are \u201cconsistent with local needs,\u201d G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 23. 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 31.06(3) (2001). Demonstrating that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>conditions render a project uneconomic is, therefore, a necessary element of the developer\u2019s prima facie case for relief. G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 22, 23. 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 31.06(3) (2001). Cf. <em>Middleborough </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>449 Mass. 514, 520-521 (2007) (though department denominates \u201cfundability\u201d as \u201ca \u2018jurisdictional requirement\u2019 [it] is more properly viewed as a substantive aspect of the successful applicant\u2019s prima facie case for ... a comprehensive permit\u201d). Absent such a showing, the board is not required either under the act or the department\u2019s regulations to demonstrate that its conditions are consistent with local needs. Here, the committee determined that the developer failed to show that the conditions imposed by the board rendered \u201cthe building or operation of [the project] uneconomic,\u201d and its inquiry should have ended there.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Instead, the committee evaluated whether each condition was \u201csupported by a local concern that outweighs the regional need for low or moderate income housing,\u201d see 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 31.06(7), essentially reviewing the board\u2019s approval with conditions as though it were a denial.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The committee now claims that this review was proper, because the board\u2019s conditions were so onerous as to be a \u201cfunctional\u201d or \u201cde facto\u201d denial, and points to several of its former decisions to support its contention that it has an established method of determining when the imposition of conditions should properly be considered to be a denial. In particular, it relies on Settlers Landing Realty Trust <em>vs. </em>Barnstable Bd. of Appeals, Housing Appeals Committee, No. 01-08, at 3-4 (Sept. 22, 2003) (Settlers Landing), in which the committee stated that \u201can arbitrary reduction in the number of units may constitute the denial of a permit,\u201d and that \u201cwhen a developer challenges a board decision that significantly reduces the number of units in the development, the appropriate course is to review the decision to determine whether it manifests a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>able basis for the reduction.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The committee argues that the Settlers Landing decision standard has the same effect as a properly promulgated regulation, and is therefore entitled to this court\u2019s deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">There is no question that the committee\u2019s decisions, like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>department regulations, are entitled to deferential review. \u201c \u2018It is a recognized principle of administrative law that an agency may adopt policies through adjudication as well as through rulemaking,\u2019 . . . and \u2018the choice made between proceeding by general rule or by individual, <em>ad hoc </em>litigation is one that lies primarily in the informed discretion of the administrative agency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hastings </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>424 Mass. 46, 49 (1997), quoting <em>Arthurs </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>383 Mass. 299, 312-313 (1981). However, the committee\u2019s assertions are otherwise unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">When determining the validity of an agency\u2019s decision, we first determine \u201cwhether the Legislature has spoken with certainty on the topic in question, and if we conclude that the statute is unambiguous, we give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Granby, </em>444 Mass. 627, 632-633 (2005), citing <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transitional Assistance, </em>431 Mass. 638, 646 (2000). \u201cSecond, if the Legislature has not addressed directly the pertinent issue, we determine whether the agency\u2019s resolution of that issue may \u2018be reconciled with the governing legislation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Granby, supra </em>at 633, quoting <em>Nuclear Metals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Low-Level Radioactive Waste Mgt. Bd., </em>421 Mass. 196, 211 (1995). The second part of our analysis requires \u201csubstantial deference\u201d to the expertise and statutory \u201c \u2018interpretation of [the] agency charged with primary responsibility\u2019 for administering a statute.\u201d <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Granby supra, </em>citing <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>429 Mass. 241, 253 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Although we have noted that the act\u2019s text \u201cis not without its ambiguities,\u201d <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>363 Mass. 339, 354 (1973), the standards to be applied by the committee in reviewing board decisions are clear from the express language of the act. The committee is empowered to \u201corder [the] board to modify or remove ... [a] condition or requirement\u201d <em>only </em>when the board\u2019s decision \u201cmakes the building or operation of such housing uneconomic <em>and </em>is not consistent with local needs\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 23. The committee\u2019s authority to alter or set aside conditions imposed by a local board is, therefore, expressly delineated by the act, and it may not be expanded by recasting an approval with condi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>tians as a denial. The Settlers Landing decision affords the committee almost unbridled discretion to consider any condition limiting the size of a proposal as the functional equivalent of a denial and, accordingly, to subject the board\u2019s decision to a more exacting review. See Settlers Landing, <em>supra </em>at 3 (\u201can arbitrary reduction in the number of units may constitute the denial of a permit\u201d). Such exceptionally broad discretion is inconsistent with both the language of the act and the \u201cLegislature\u2019s careful balance between leaving to local authorities their well-recognized autonomy generally to establish local zoning requirements . . . while foreclosing municipalities from obstructing the building of a minimum level of housing affordable to persons of low income.\u201d <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Ardemore Apartments Ltd.

See also CMA, Inc. <em>vs. </em>Westborough Zoning Bd. of Appeals, Housing Appeals Committee, No. 89-25, at 24 (June 25, 1992) (\u201cWith regard to the proposed number of units in particular, the board should usually simply grant or deny the permit\u201d); Georgetown Hous.

Thus, if the condition does not make the project uneconomic, it should be upheld even if the town cannot prove that it is consistent with local needs.\u201d The committee did not make a distinction for particularly onerous conditions or conditions that reduce the proposed number of units. <em>Id. </em>The committee also has not uniformly applied the Settlers Landing standard in cases involving unit reductions. For example, in Bay Watch Realty Trust <em>vs. </em>Marion Bd. of Appeals, Housing Appeals Committee, No. 02-28 (Dec. 5, 2005), the local board granted a comprehensive permit, but limited the proposed 192-unit development to ninety-six units. <em>Id. </em>at 1. The committee, in accordance with the act and the governing regulations, reviewed the conditions imposed by the board to determine whether they caused the project to be uneconomic, and concluded that they did. <em>Id. </em>at 22.

See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., ante </em>at 149, 151 (2008), quoting <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>363 Mass. 339, 354 (1973) (\u201cThe primary purpose of the act is \u2018to provide relief from exclusionary zoning practices which prevent[] the construction of badly needed low and moderate income housing\u2019 \u201d). We also acknowledge that the reality of the development of affordable housing projects has changed significantly in the nearly forty years since the enactment of G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23. That municipalities, through their local zoning boards, might effectively prevent the construction of needed affordable housing through the use of conditions drastically reducing the size of such projects (making them \u201cbarely\u201d economic), likely did not occur to the Legislature in 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Yet, consistent with G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23, the remedy to the practice highlighted by the committee cannot be to treat a reduction in unit numbers as a \u201cde facto\u201d denial, thereby eliminating the uneconomic element of the prima facie case for relief. The department is, of course, not precluded from promulgating regulations that would more fully address the meaning of the term \u201cuneconomic\u201d in the context of the construction of affordable housing. For example, the committee itself has recently suggested the usefulness of more guidance on what standards to use in assessing whether conditions permit a \u201creasonable return\u201d to the developer. See Farmview Affordable Homes, LLC v. Sandwich Board of Appeals, Housing Appeals Committee, No. 02-32, at 3 n.5 (May 21, 2004) (\u201c[I]t might be useful to us in making our assessment of reasonable return to have an understanding of the standards used by Mass-Housing, the Department of Housing and Community Development, or other subsidizing agencies in making [their] financial feasibility findings. Where guidance on issues relating to reasonable return is offered to us by such agencies, we will avail ourselves of it, but we will rely on industry standards where it is not\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b615-8\">In a footnote in its brief, the committee asserts that \u00a7 21 of the act precludes a local board from limiting the number of units in a proposed development as a condition of approval. That assertion is an insufficient appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>argument. See Mass. R. A. R 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975); Mass. R. A.

It also appears to be plainly incorrect. General Laws c. 40B, \u00a7 21, states, in relevant part, that \u201c[t]he board . . . shall have the same power to issue permits or approvals as any local board or official who would otherwise act with respect to such application, <em>including but not limited to </em>the power to attach to said permit or approval conditions and requirements with respect to height, site plan, <em>size </em>or shape, or building materials as are consistent with the terms of this section\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b616-7\">Marshall, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXm\">(concurring). The decision of the Housing Appeals Committee (HAC) and the affirming decision of the judge in the Superior Court are entirely consistent with the legislative goal of promoting the construction of badly needed affordable housing in this Commonwealth. I concur in the result that the court reaches today reversing those decisions only because the Department of Housing and Community Development (department), of which the HAC is a part, G. L. c. 23B, \u00a7 5A, has not promulgated regulations to address the issue presented in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>case. See G. L. c. 23B, \u00a7 6 (\u201cThe director shall make, and from time to time revise, regulations for the conduct of the business of the department, and such other regulations as may be required by law\u201d). While the issue is not before us, I conclude that regulations, promulgated after notice and comment, further defining \u201cuneconomic,\u201d as that term is used in G. L. c. 40B, would fall within the department\u2019s broad authority and would provide clear standards to enable consistent decision-making by the HAC. In the absence of any such governing regulations, the language of G. L. c. 40B, compels the result reached here.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">It is clear that the reality of the development of affordable housing projects has changed significantly in the nearly forty years since the enactment of G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23, inserted by St. 1969, c. 774. Exclusionary zoning practices, which the statute is intended to overcome, <em>ante </em>at 582-583, have taken a new and apparently unforeseen form. That a local zoning board would, as the Woburn board is charged with doing here, drastically cut the size of a proposed project or would impose other onerous conditions that fall short of rendering the entire project \u201cuneconomic,\u201d even where a far larger project is entirely consistent with local needs, likely did not occur to the Legislature in 1969. Our decision thus allows a local board unfettered discretion to stymie the construction of an affordable housing project without actually denying it or rendering it uneconomic, and insulates such a board\u2019s decision from review by the HAC. The Legislature\u2019s goal of overcoming exclusionary local practices is thus thwarted. See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., ante </em>149, 151 (2008), quoting <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>363 Mass. 339, 354 (1973) (\u201cThe primary purpose of the act is \u2018to provide relief from exclusionary zoning practices which prevent[] the construction of badly needed low and moderate income housing\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The HAC and the Superior Court judge, relying on HAC decisions, attempted to solve this problem by treating the board\u2019s action as a \u201cde facto,\u201d or constructive, denial. The principle that a party might be found to have constructively taken some action \u2014 particularly by imposing intolerable conditions that force another party\u2019s hand \u2014 is well established in our law. See, e.g., <em>GTE Prods. Corp. </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>421 Mass. 22, 33-35 (1995) (discussing constructive discharge, in which employee\u2019s resignation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>due to employer\u2019s conduct is regarded as termination by employer). The difficulty is that at present, the only form of constructive denial provided by G. L. c. 40B and its implementing regulations is an approval that renders an entire project uneconomic. <em>Ante </em>at 594. Nothing in G. L. c. 40B or in any of the implementing regulations promulgated by the department provides any guidance as to when a dramatic reduction in the size of a project might be deemed uneconomic.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">If a local board conditions the issuance of a comprehensive permit on drastically reducing the size of a project, and the HAC concludes that the reduction is unjustified and that a project of a larger size than allowed by the board would be consistent with local needs, the HAC should have the authority to consider whether the project is effectively uneconomic under appropriately promulgated regulations. The department possesses extensive authority to promulgate appropriate regulations, G. L. c. 23B, \u00a7 6, and to do so would provide much-needed guidance for the HAC, as well as for developers and municipalities. See, e.g., <em>Middleborough </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>449 Mass. 514, 524-525 (2007) (department did not exceed authority by promulgating regulation with expansive definition of \u201csubsidy\u201d); <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>385 Mass. 651, 654-656 (1982) (upholding regulation providing that projects financed by Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency were within definition of \u201clow or moderate income housing\u201d). Regulations defining \u201cuneconomic\u201d might, for example, assist the HAC in determining when a reduction in the number of units renders a project uneconomic, defining \u201creasonable return,\u201d or perhaps providing that a reduction over a certain percentage should be presumed uneconomic. In the absence of appropriate regulations, a local board remains free to impede the pace at which affordable housing units \u2014 so urgently needed \u2014 are constructed in the Commonwealth, even if a larger project would be entirely consistent with local needs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
