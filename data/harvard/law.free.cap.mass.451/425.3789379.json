Finally, we conclude that the evidence proffered by the defendant fell short of what is necessary to overcome the presumption that a law enforcement officer making a traffic stop, based on probable cause, has acted in good faith and without intent to discriminate. Consequently, the evidence seized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>in this case should not have been suppressed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>Traffic stop.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>On the evening of December 20, 2001, State Trooper Brendhan Shugrue was patrolling Interstate Route 290 in Auburn (Route 290).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At approximately 9:10 p.m., he approached a motor vehicle traveling ahead of him in the left lane. At the time, there was no traffic in the center lane or the right lane. The vehicle traveled within the speed limit, did not swerve, and made no erratic movements. It did not pass any vehicles because there was no traffic at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Shugrue followed the vehicle for three-quarters mile to an area within several hundred yards of the border between Auburn and Worcester. He observed that the two occupants of the vehicle were dark skinned (the defendant, Andres Lora, is Hispanic). He activated the cruiser\u2019s blue lights and stopped the vehicle for traveling in the left lane while the center and right lanes were unoccupied.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Shugrue approached the vehicle from the passenger\u2019s side and asked the driver for his license and registration. The driver explained that his license had been suspended and that the vehicle belonged to the passenger, Lora. Lora then produced his license and the vehicle\u2019s registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Shugrue asked the driver to step out of the vehicle, and instructed him to sit in the back of his cruiser. Lora remained in the vehicle. Shugrue then checked the status of the driver\u2019s license, as well as the status of Lora\u2019s license and registration. He confirmed that the driver\u2019s license was, in fact, suspended, but that Lora\u2019s license and registration were both valid. As Shugrue was retrieving this information, he observed Lora get<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>ting out of his vehicle while talking on his cellular telephone. Shugrue got out of the cruiser intending to instruct Lora to get back into his vehicle; as Shugrue approached, Lora got back into the vehicle and shut the door. Shugrue then directed his flashlight inside the vehicle, where he observed a small glossine bag on the driver\u2019s side floor containing white powder.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Shugrue immediately asked Lora to step out of the vehicle and frisked him. He then retrieved the glossine bag, which appeared to contain cocaine, and radioed the State police barracks to request assistance. Trooper William Pinkes arrived at the scene ten to fifteen minutes later. The troopers then proceeded to search the vehicle.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Shugrue discovered substantially more cocaine in the trunk.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Pinkes then placed Lora and the driver under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">A grand jury subsequently returned an indictment charging Lora with trafficking in cocaine in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E <em>(b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">b. <em>Motion to suppress. </em>On March 27, 2003, Lora filed a motion to suppress the cocaine as the fruit of an unconstitutional search.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He contended that Shugrue initiated the traffic stop because the occupants of the vehicle were dark skinned, and not solely because the operator of the vehicle committed a traffic violation by driving in the left lane. In other words, he claimed that Shugrue impermissibly engaged in the practice of racial profiling. Thus, Lora asserted, the stop violated his right to equal protection under the law, as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and arts. 1 and 10 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. He further asserted that a traffic stop predicated solely on the race of the passengers of a vehicle was inherently unreasonable and constitutionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>infirm under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Lora sought to prove that the stop of the vehicle in which he was traveling was the product of racial profiling by establishing that Shugrue had a history of disproportionately stopping and citing nonwhite motorists for motor vehicle violations. To that end, defense counsel filed an affidavit stating that he had reviewed 256<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> citations issued by Trooper Shugrue between August 22, 2001, and February 18, 2002.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The affidavit pointed out that during this time period, Shugrue cited the operators of fifty-one vehicles driving on the stretch of Route 290 that passes through Auburn. Sixteen of the operators cited (or 31.37 per cent) were identified as Hispanic, and six (or 11.76 per cent) as African-American.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Defense counsel then compared the percentage of citations issued to each racial group with the racial composition of the town of Auburn, as tabulated by the 2000 United States census (census). White residents accounted for 97.5 per cent of the population of Auburn; Hispanic residents, one per cent; and African-American residents, .6 per cent. Implicitly assuming that the demographics of the town of Auburn mirror the demographics of those driving on Route 290 through Auburn, defense counsel argued that Shugrue cited minority drivers at a rate wildly disproportionate to their representation in the local Auburn population. This type of comparison is known as census benchmarking. Using this analytical framework, defense counsel contended that a Hispanic driver would be 31.37 times more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>likely to be cited than an average motorist<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>; and an African-American driver would be 19.60 times more likely to be cited than an average motorist. By contrast, white drivers were only .5631 times as likely to be pulled over as an average motorist (or, in other words, about one-half as likely).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Defense counsel\u2019s affidavit also included information regarding traffic citations issued by Shugrue along the stretch of Route 290 passing through the city of Worcester. In that same period, i.e., between August 22, 2001, and February 18, 2002, Shugrue cited eighty-nine motorists. Seventy-four, or 83.15 per cent, of the motorists cited were white; seven, or 7.87 per cent, were Hispanic; and six, or 6.74 per cent, were African-American. According to the census, white residents account for 77.1 per cent of the population of Worcester; Hispanic residents, 15.1 per cent; and African-American residents, 8.0 per cent. Defense counsel again used census benchmarking to compare the racial composition of the citations to the racial composition of the inhabitants of Worcester. Using the same implicit assumption that the demographics of Worcester accurately reflected the demographics of motorists driving on Route 290 in Worcester, defense counsel calculated that white motorists were 1.08 times more likely to be cited than an average motorist (that is, slightly <em>more </em>likely). Hispanic motorists were .52 times as likely to be cited as an average motorist (that is, about <em>one-half </em>as likely), while African-American drivers were .84 times as likely to be cited (that is, slightly <em>less </em>likely).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>At the hearing on the motion to suppress, Lora introduced Shugrue\u2019s citation history, which was admitted de bene by the motion judge.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Troopers Shugrue and Pinkes testified on behalf of the Commonwealth, contending that the traffic stop was motivated solely by the operator\u2019s failure to keep to the right, and that the subsequent search was justified by the cocaine-filled glossine bag within the passenger compartment of the vehicle.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> After taking the matter under advisement, the judge allowed Lora\u2019s motion to suppress. In his decision, the judge found that although \u201c[a] strict reading of Massachusetts law supports that Shugrue was authorized to stop the [vehicle] for traveling in the left-hand lane,\u201d the record left \u201cno reasonable conclusion but that Shugrue stopped the motor vehicle in which the Defendant was a passenger because of the race of the operator and the race of the Defendant.\u201d Therefore, the trooper \u201cviolated the Defendant\u2019s rights pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment . . . and Articles 1 and 10 . . . when he stopped and searched his vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">In reaching his conclusions, the judge noted that \u201cMas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>sachusetts appellate courts have yet to resolve the conflict that arises when a well-substantiated allegation of racial profiling is made within the context of a <em>legitimate </em>traffic stop\u201d (emphasis in original). He ruled that the authorization approach to motor vehicle stops, under which a stop is deemed to be constitutionally valid as long as it is one that police are \u201clegally permitted and objectively authorized\u201d to make, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santana, </em>420 Mass. 205, 209 (1995), is inapplicable when a defendant is able to present objective evidence that the police officer who effectuated the stop has engaged in racial profiling. In this respect, the judge found that the evidence introduced by Lora, including Shugrue\u2019s past citations and the statistical evidence derived therefrom, was \u201cboth credible and relevant to the case at bar,\u201d creating an \u201cinference of purposeful discrimination, which [was] not . . . rebutted by the Commonwealth\u201d either with \u201ca race-neutral explanation for the statistical disparities or [by] explaining] a compelling government interest in treating members of one race differently from another.\u201d The judge found that Lora had sustained his burden of proof of discrimination \u201cboth by a preponderance of the evidence as well as clear and convincing proof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">c. <em>Motion for rehearing and the joint motion to vacate. </em>Following the judge\u2019s decision, the Commonwealth filed a motion for reconsideration.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In its motion, the Commonwealth contended that the judge based his decision on documents (the citations of Shugrue and accompanying statistical analysis) that had not in fact been admitted in evidence; the judge wrongly admitted the documents in any event; and the judge\u2019s findings as to racial profiling were based on mathematical and analytical errors. The motion for reconsideration was allowed, and the judge ordered the scheduling of another evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Before the evidentiary hearing took place, the Commonwealth shared with defense counsel the evidence that it anticipated presenting at the hearing, most prominently an affidavit by Donna M. Bishop of Northeastern University\u2019s College of Criminal Justice, who holds a doctorate in criminal justice. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>that affidavit, Bishop stated that she would testify that the \u201cdefendant\u2019s data collection methodology [did] not satisfy any accepted scientific standard,\u201d and that the \u201cstatistics [the defendant introduced] failed to measure the demographics of the motorists traveling on the interstate highway.\u201d She further averred that \u201c[t]he driving population, rather than population demographics for the cities through which roads pass, is a more appropriate benchmark in evaluating police stop data.\u201d After defense counsel had the opportunity to review Bishop\u2019s affidavit and discuss its contents with Lora, he joined the Commonwealth in filing a motion to vacate the suppression order, expressing the parties\u2019 \u201cagreement that the suppression order should not have entered,\u201d that \u201cthe statistics relied upon in the suppression order do not show that Trooper Shugrue\u2019s decision to stop the defendant\u2019s car was motivated by the race of the occupants,\u201d and that \u201cany further litigation [on the issue] is unnecessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The judge held a hearing on the joint motion to vacate the suppression order, during which he suggested that both parties were \u201clooking to duck the issue\u201d; that the Commonwealth was looking to avoid \u201can adverse judgment against it\u201d; and that the defendant was using the Commonwealth\u2019s reluctance to litigate the issue to \u201cbargain\u201d for a \u201cgood deal.\u201d Consequently, the judge declined to rule on the joint motion and directed both parties to present expert testimony at the rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">At the rehearing, the defense called Scott Evans, a research scientist in the department of biostatistics at Harvard School of Public Health. In preparing for his testimony, Evans reviewed only the data regarding the citations issued by Shugrue in Auburn, and compared that information to the population demographics of that town. On the basis of that data, he concluded that the chance that race was not a factor in the disparate stop rates in Auburn was \u201cvery, very minute.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> On cross-examination by the Commonwealth, Evans admitted that the assumption underlying his conclusion was that the demographics of the town of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Auburn reflected the demographics of motorists on Interstate Route 290, and admitted that he had not considered the stops that occurred in Worcester.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The Commonwealth called Bishop, who testified that the census benchmarking technique used by Lora is \u201coutmoded and no longer accepted within the scientific community because ... it is highly likely to yield misleading and erroneous conclusions.\u201d She testified that census benchmarking assumes that the \u201cdemographic profile of the community [is] nearly identical to the demographic profile of drivers on the road where the officer was patrolling,\u201d an assumption that is \u201cnot accurate.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Bishop further testified that Shugrue\u2019s citations themselves demonstrate the flaw in census benchmarking: \u201cI examined each of the citations that were given by Trooper Shugrue of [sic] motorists in Auburn . . . ninety per cent of those motorists were not from Auburn, which is conclusive evidence that a residential or a census benchmark coming from Auburn is totally inappropriate [as a point of comparison].\u201d She went on to explain that an appropriate benchmark must include \u201ca profile of the people who should be legitimately at more risk of being stopped and then compare that to the profile of who is actually stopped,\u201d and ideally \u201croadside observers [would be used to] develop a demographic profile of people who violate traffic laws in a particular location where police are patrolling and stops are being made. In that instance, the benchmark would represent fairly well the group of people who should be at risk for being stopped if no bias exists.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>The Commonwealth also called Joseph Petruccelli, a professor of mathematical sciences at Worcester Polytechnic Institute with a Ph.D. in statistics. Petruccelli testified that while the methodology used by Lora\u2019s expert is an established tool of statistical analysis, its results are valid only when the appropriate data are fed into it. The census data used here made the statistical study scientifically unacceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">On December 2, 2005, the judge issued his decision affirming the earlier suppression order and reiterating his conclusion that Lora \u201cmet his burden by offering evidence of an inference of selective law enforcement and that the Commonwealth has not sufficiently rebutted [that] evidence with a neutral explanation.\u201d The Commonwealth filed a notice of appeal, as well as a supplemental application for an interlocutory appeal. The single justice allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>On appeal, the Commonwealth first argues that even assuming Lora could prove that Shugrue stopped the vehicle in which Lora was riding because of the race of its occupants, his subjective intent is irrelevant to the legality of the stop and the subsequent search. In support of its position, the Commonwealth points to our holding that \u201cit is irrelevant whether a reasonable police officer would have made the stop but for [an] unlawful motive; the stop is valid \u2018so long as the police are doing no more than they are legally permitted and objectively authorized to do.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santana, </em>420 Mass. 205, 209 (1995), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Trigg, </em>878 F.2d 1037, 1041 (7th Cir. 1989), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Cummins </em>v. <em>United States, </em>502 U.S. 962 (1991). The Commonwealth also argues that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Whren </em>v. <em>United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 813 (1996), \u201cforeclose^] any argument that the constitutional reasonableness of traffic stops depends on the actual motivations of the individual officers involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">The Commonwealth reads too much into these cases. Both involved traffic stops that were objectively valid but motivated by an interest in investigating more serious crimes for which the officers had insufficient suspicion to justify an investigative stop. The defendants contended that if the traffic stops would not have been made by a reasonable police officer motivated to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>make the stop solely by a desire to enforce the traffic laws, they were \u201cunreasonable\u201d and therefore in violation of the Fourth Amendment right to be secure from unreasonable searches and seizures. Both courts rejected this argument, concluding essentially that the decision to stop an automobile is reasonable for Fourth Amendment purposes \u201cwhere the police have probable cause to believe that a traffic violation has occurred.\u201d <em>Whren </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 810. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santana, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Neither case involved a challenge to the traffic stops based on equal protection grounds. Indeed, in <em>Whren </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 813, the Court specifically noted, \u201cWe of course agree with petitioners that the Constitution prohibits selective enforcement of the law based on considerations such as race. But the constitutional basis for objecting to intentionally discriminatory application of laws is the Equal Protection Clause, not the Fourth Amendment. Subjective intentions play no role in ordinary, probable cause Fourth Amendment analysis.\u201d Our holding in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santana, supra, </em>is not to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">a. <em>Selective enforcement. </em>Although Lora contends that the issue of racial profiling is novel, it is at base a claim that Shugrue selectively enforced the laws in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment and arts. 1 and 10, a claim that we have considered in other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">It is well established that \u201c[tjhe equal protection principles of the Fourteenth Amendment. . . and arts. 1 and 10 . . . prohibit discriminatory application of impartial laws.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin Fruit Co., </em>388 Mass. 228, 229-230 (1983). See <em>Cote-Whitacre </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>446 Mass. 350, 376 (2006). See also <em>Yick Wo </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>118 U.S. 356, 373-374 (1886).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> \u201cIt is equally well established, however, that prosecutors and other law enforcement officers enjoy considerable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>discretion in exercising some selectivity for purposes consistent with the public interest.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>376 Mass. 885, 894 (1978). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>374 Mass. 5, 22 (1977) (law enforcement officials necessarily have wide discretion in determining whether to prosecute under prostitution statutes). The \u201c \u2018conscious exercise of some selectivity\u2019 in criminal law enforcement\u201d is permitted \u201cas long as the selectivity is not based on \u2018an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion or other arbitrary classification.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20, quoting <em>Oyler </em>v. <em>Boles, </em>368 U.S. 448, 456 (1962). \u201cFollowing these principles, courts have reversed criminal convictions and dismissed criminal complaints as violative of equal protection principles when they found selectivity in prosecution based on impermissible standards.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, supra </em>at 20. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin, supra </em>at 906-907 (cases remanded for hearing on defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss based on allegation that only blacks and not whites were prosecuted for violence in housing project).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">An arrest or prosecution based on probable cause is ordinarily cloaked with a presumption of regularity. \u201cBecause we presume that criminal prosecutions are undertaken in good faith, without intent to discriminate, the defendant bears the initial burden of demonstrating selective enforcement.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin, supra </em>at 894. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, supra </em>at 22. In order to meet this burden, the defendant must first \u201cpresent evidence which raises at least a reasonable inference of impermissible discrimination,\u201d including evidence that \u201ca broader class of persons than those prosecuted has violated the law, . . . that failure to prosecute was either consistent or deliberate, . . . and that the decision not to prosecute was based on an impermissible classification such as race, religion, or sex\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin, supra </em>at 894. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin Fruit Co., </em>388 Mass. 228, 230-231 (1983) (adopting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>same \u201ctripartite burden\u201d in selective enforcement case involving national origin). Once a defendant has raised a reasonable inference of selective prosecution by presenting credible evidence that persons similarly situated to himself have been deliberately or consistently not prosecuted because of their race, \u201cthe Commonwealth must rebut that inference or suffer dismissal of the underlying complaint.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin, supra </em>at 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">b. <em>Suppression as remedy. </em>The Commonwealth objects to the use of the <em>Franklin </em>\u201ctripartite burden\u201d in this case, contending that claims of selective enforcement must be raised in a motion to dismiss. We disagree. Lora does not contend that he was charged with trafficking cocaine because of his race, and consequently has not moved to dismiss that charge on the ground of selective enforcement. Rather, his contention is that the traffic stop that led to the discovery of the cocaine was unconstitutional because it was racially motivated. Thus, he argues, the evidence should be suppressed as the product of an unconstitutional stop. In these circumstances, the contention is properly brought in Lora\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The suppression of evidence under the exclusionary rule is a \u201cjudicially created remedy,\u201d whose \u201cprime purpose is to deter future unlawful police conduct.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 347, 348 (1974). See <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 486 (1976) (\u201cprimary justification for the exclusionary role\u201d is deterrence of unconstitutional police conduct). \u201cThe rule is calculated to prevent, not to repair. Its purpose is to deter \u2014 to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available way \u2014 by removing the incentive to disregard it.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Calandra, supra </em>at 347, quoting <em>Elkins </em>v. <em>United States, </em>364 U.S. 206, 217 (1960).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The exclusionary role is typically used in cases involving violations of the Fourth, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Fifth, and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and their counterparts in the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> See generally <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>196 F.3d 1034, 1040 (9th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1028 (2000) (\u201cexclusionary rule is an exceptional remedy typically reserved for violations of constitutional rights\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">We conclude that the application of the exclusionary rule to evidence obtained in violation of the constitutional right to the equal protection of the laws is entirely consistent with the policy underlying the exclusionary rule, is properly gouged to deter intentional unconstitutional behavior, and furthers the protections guaranteed by the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Segars, </em>172 N.J. 481, 493 (2002) (rationales that support suppression of evidence, \u201cnamely, deterrence of impermissible investigatory behavior and maintenance of the integrity of the judicial system, apply equally, if not more so, to cases of racial targeting\u201d). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Navarro-Camacho, </em>186 F.3d 701, 711 (6th Cir. 1999) (Moore, J., concurring) (remedy of suppression may be available to defendant who demonstrates that investigators engaged in selective enforcement).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> See generally Holland, Safeguarding Equal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Protection Rights: The Search for an Exclusionary Rule Under the Equal Protection Clause, 37 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 1107, 1123 (2000). Consequently, if a defendant can establish that a traffic stop is the product of selective enforcement predicated on race, evidence seized in the course of the stop should be suppressed unless the connection between the unconstitutional stop by the police and the discovery of the challenged evidence has \u201cbecome so attenuated as to dissipate the taint.\u201d <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 487-488 (1963), quoting <em>Nardone </em>v. <em>United States, </em>308 U.S. 338, 341 (1939).

The data from these surveys demonstrated that the racial makeup of the motorists traveling the road was 13.5 per cent black, and that the observed violators were approximately fifteen per cent black. <em>Id. </em>at 70-71. This data were used as the benchmark for comparison with the number of \u201crace identified\u201d traffic stops made by the State police along the same stretch of highway. <em>Id. </em>at 70-71.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The stop data showed that 46.2 per cent of the stops were of black motorists. <em>Id. </em>This disparity was calculated to be more than sixteen standard deviations over the expected norm. <em>Id. </em>at 70. Further expert testimony presented by the defendants established that the surveys were well designed and performed, and statistically reliable for the analysis, and that a similarly situated black motorist was 4.85 times as likely as a white motorist to be stopped on the roadway. <em>Id. </em>at 71-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Ultimately, the judge concluded that the statistical data were sufficient to support the finding of a \u201cde facto policy\u201d on the part of certain State troopers of targeting black motorists, which was not adequately rebutted by the State. <em>Id. </em>at 84. In reaching this conclusion, the judge found that the stark patterns revealed in the data established a prima facie case of selective enforcement, that is, that similarly situated motorists were intentionally treated differently because of their race. Accordingly, the judge granted the defendants\u2019 motions to suppress the evidence garnered as a result of their traffic stops. <em>Id. </em>at 84-85.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">In contrast, in <em>Chavez </em>v. <em>Illinois State Police, supra, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>that the statistical data presented by the defendants against the Illinois State police failed to establish the elements of a \u201cprima facie\u201d case of selective enforcement of traffic laws based on race. <em>Id. </em>at 641. The data in that case, which were drawn largely from field reports of traffic stops, were problematic for a number of reasons, but most importantly, the court found that the benchmark data used for comparison with the traffic stop data were census data for the entire State, which \u201ccan tell us very little about the numbers of Hispanics and African-Americans driving on [the] Illinois interstate highways [at issue], which is crucial to determining the population of motorists encountered by the . . . officers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">We are of the view that statistical evidence may be used to meet a defendant\u2019s initial burden of producing sufficient evidence to raise a reasonable inference of impermissible discrimination. Cf. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>444 Mass. 34, 55-56 (2005) (statistical evidence may be used to raise inference of intentional discrimination in employment discrimination claim); <em>Smith College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>376 Mass. 221, 228 &amp; n.9 (1978) (same). Cf. <em>Lipchitz </em>v. <em>Raytheon Co., </em>434 Mass. 493, 508-509 (2001) (statistical evidence may support inference that employment decision was tainted by unlawful bias). At a minimum, that evidence must establish that the racial composition of motorists stopped for motor vehicle violations varied significantly from the racial composition of the population of motorists making use of the relevant roadways, and who therefore could have encountered the officer or officers whose actions have been called into question.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>d. <em>Lora\u2019s evidence.</em><footnotemark><em>31</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Having concluded that properly gathered, analyzed, and relevant statistical data may be used to meet a defendant\u2019s burden, we turn to Lora\u2019s evidence. For the reasons set out below, Lora has failed to present credible evidence establishing a reasonable inference of impermissible discrimination sufficient to rebut the presumption that the stop of his motor vehicle was \u201cundertaken in good faith, without intent to discriminate.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin, 316 </em>Mass. 885, 894 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">An assessment of the evidence admitted at the rehearing on Lora\u2019s motion to suppress leads us to the inescapable conclusion that the use of census benchmarking to compare the demographics of a small community with citation ratios on a major interstate highway, which happens to pass through it, is unreliable and not accepted in the scientific community. Such benchmarking data do not provide an adequate basis for assessing the racial composition of the drivers encountered by Shugrue on Route 290 and is inadequate to establish that similarly situated drivers of different races were treated differently. Indeed, Lora\u2019s own evidence disproves his premise of comparability: of the fifty-two motorists that Shugrue ticketed on Route 290 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Auburn, ninety per cent were not residents of Auburn. Lora therefore failed to present sufficient credible evidence of discriminatory effect. The judge\u2019s determination to the contrary was clearly erroneous, and the motion to suppress should not have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Even were we to consider census benchmarking data as providing some evidence of selective enforcement, the use of the population demographics of the inhabitants of the town of Auburn was too limited. The population of Auburn is 15,901; the population of Worcester is 172,648. Lora introduced evidence of Shugrue\u2019s citation history in both Worcester and Auburn, but compiled the data in isolation, comparing only the stops effectuated on Route 290 in Auburn with the demographics of Auburn, and the stops effectuated on Route 290 in Worcester with the demographics of Worcester. Logically, as Bishop testified, the combined census demographics of Worcester and Auburn are more likely to reflect the demographics of motorists on Route 290 near the border of Worcester and Auburn than the demographics of Auburn only. When the citations issued by Shugrue in Worcester and Auburn are compared to their combined demographics, a more balanced picture emerges. Shugrue cited 140 motorists in Worcester and Auburn during the relevant eight-month period, 102 of whom were white (72.9 per cent), twenty-three Hispanic (16.4 per cent), and twelve African-American (8.6 per cent). The combined demographics of the area reflect a population that is 77.2 per cent white, 13.7 per cent Hispanic, and 6.2 per cent African-American. Thus, when viewed through an appropriately broad lens, even the questionable census benchmarking methodology used by Lora fails to establish any significant disparity of treatment based on race.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>Justices of this court have expressed considerable concern about the practice of racial profiling in prior decisions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feyenord, </em>445 Mass. 72, 88 (2005) (Greaney, J., concurring), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1187 (2006) (\u201cA motorist must <em>never </em>be stopped based on his or her race or ethnicity without legally sufficient cause. Getting a traffic ticket is never a happy experience. Getting a traffic ticket if you are a black or Hispanic person who has committed a minor traffic violation and then been questioned in public view by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>armed police officer determined to find a basis ... to bring in a police dog, is humiliating, painful, and unlawful\u201d [emphasis in original]); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>429 Mass. 658, 670 (1999) (Ireland, J., concurring) (\u201cThe widespread public concerns about police profiling, commonly referred to as \u2018DWB \u2014 driving while black,\u2019 has been the subject of much discussion and debate both across the country and within the Commonwealth\u201d). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Montero-Camargo, </em>208 F.3d 1122, 1135 (9th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Sanchez-Guillen </em>v. <em>United States, </em>531 U.S. 889 (2000) (\u201cStops based on race or ethnic appearance send the underlying message to all our citizens that those who are not white are judged by the color of their skin alone\u201d). These concerns would not be alleviated by a standard that nominally allows a defendant to make claim of selective enforcement of traffic laws, but forecloses such a claim in practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">On the other hand, the standard must be sufficiently rigorous that its imposition does not unnecessarily intrude on the exercise of powers constitutionally delegated to other branches of government. Balance is therefore important. While racial profiling evidence is relevant to assessing the constitutionality of a traffic stop, and evidence seized during a traffic stop that violates the equal protection guarantees of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights may be suppressed, the initial burden rests on the defendant to produce evidence that similarly situated persons were treated differently because of their race. The practical weight of this burden is admittedly daunting in some cases, but not impossible. It was done, and done well, in New Jersey.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Data now being collected in Massachusetts,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and the work of academic and other institutions to develop more sophisticated analytic tools with which to identify and measure the use of race in the context of traffic stops<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> may be of assistance in meeting this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Of necessity, the important responsibility of eliminating racial considerations in the day-to-day enforcement of our laws lies principally with the executive branch of government, and no evidence was presented in this case to suggest that this is a responsibility that is being ignored.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> While the judicial branch shares the responsibility of ensuring that the protections of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Constitution are afforded to all residents, it can only exercise that responsibility when proper and sufficient evidence has been presented to it.

The motion judge apparently found these resulting statistics to be persuasive, as he cited them in his decision. However, there is no question that Shugrue initiated the traffic stop on his own, and had decided to search the vehicle before Pinkes arrived.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b449-10\">The records denote only the race of the operator of the vehicle, not the race of any other occupants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b449-11\">One citation was given to an operator identified as Asian.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The average motorist refers to a random motorist whose race cannot be ascertained by a patrolling officer.

For example, Hispanics accounted for 31.37 per cent of Shugrue\u2019s citations on Route 290 in Auburn, but only one per cent of the town\u2019s population. Thus, Hispanics are pulled over at a rate 31.37 times greater than their one per cent representation in Auburn\u2019s population would suggest</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">In his affidavit, defense counsel cast these numbers as percentage increases, labeled \u201cdifferentials\u201d rather than multiples. The discrepancy between the proportion of Hispanics living in Auburn and the proportion of the Hispanics stopped by Shugrue was not, therefore, described as 31.37 times greater than expected, but rather was described as resulting in a 3,137 percent \u201cdifferential.\u201d The motion judge included these \u201cdifferentials\u201d in his decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b450-9\">In granting Lora\u2019s motion to suppress, the judge misunderstood the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>significance of portions of the Worcester data. Most prominently, the judge concluded that \u201c[t]he percentage of Hispanics that Shugrue stopped in Worcester [was] 53% higher than the general population of the city [suggests should have been stopped].\u201d In actuality, Hispanic motorists were fifty-three per cent as likely to be stopped as an average motorist; that is substantially <em>less </em>likely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The judge also admitted testimony from Aaron Jones, a motorist who was stopped by Shugrue on February 2, 2002, at a similar area on Route 290, and cited, inter alia, for operating a motor vehicle with a suspended license, operating an unregistered motor vehicle, and having an inoperative registration plate light. Defense counsel suggested, but did not establish, that Jones was stopped (and subsequently searched) not because of his failure to follow the relevant traffic laws, but because he was a nonwhite motorist. In response, Shugrue testified that the stop and subsequent citation of Jones was consistent with police practice. The motion judge did not reference Jones\u2019s testimony in his decision granting Lora\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b451-8\">Defense counsel also contended that Shugrue conducted noninventory searches of vehicles more frequently when the operator cited was Hispanic or African-American than when the operator was white. To that end, he tabulated the number of Shugrue\u2019s citations that later led to motor vehicle searches, and argued that the vehicles of nonwhite drivers were searched disproportionately. Lora\u2019s motion to suppress, however, was centered on his claim that the traffic stop leading to the search was improperly influenced by racial considerations, and the motion judge focused his analysis on that issue. The matter of the disparity in conducting searches has not been argued on appeal and is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The Commonwealth also filed an application for an interlocutory appeal and a notice of appeal.

The Commonwealth reasserts both grounds on appeal. The objections are without merit. The evidence was relevant to the issue of selective enforcement. Additionally, St. 2000, c. 228, \u00a7 9, is irrelevant to the issue of admissibility. Section 9 states that \u201cdata acquired [by the registry of motor vehicles] shall be used only for statistical purposes and may not contain information that may reveal the identity of any . . . law enforcement officer.\u201d See <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Police Dep\u2019t of Boston, </em>446 Mass. 46, 51 (2006) (limiting language in \u00a7 9 applies only to registry of motor vehicle\u2019s collection of data and subsequent statistical analysis). That provision cannot be read to preclude the introduction of Shugrue\u2019s citations, particularly where the defendant\u2019s evidence did not include any of the registry of motor vehicle\u2019s data or subsequent statistical analysis. Instead, Shugrue made copies of his own past citations pursuant to a pretrial discovery order. That order was not challenged at the time, and the issue is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b465-6\">In addition to the survey approach used in New Jersey, Bishop testified to the use of other forms of benchmarks, such as \u201cinternal benchmarking,\u201d which compares the traffic stop rates among officers within the same geographic area, time, and assignment. If one officer has a demonstrable history of pulling over minority drivers at a higher rate, that is relevant to a showing of selective enforcement because the officer involved is compared to other officers patrolling the same portion of highway, with logically consistent demographics and traffic violation rates. See Smith, Depoliticizing Racial Profiling: Suggestions for the Limited Use and Management of Race in Police Decision-Making, 15 Geo. Mason U. Civ. Rts. LJ. 219, 247-256 (2005). There is, of course, one crucial limitation in the ability of internal benchmarking to detect racial profiling: \u201cIf racial profiling discrimination is a department-wide problem, then this method will only pick up the exceptionally horrific offender because one will be comparing a bad apple to other bad apples.\u201d Note, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>The Statistical Evidence of Racial Profiling in Traffic Stops and Searches: Rethinking the Use of Statistics to Prove Discriminatory Intent, 49 B.C.

Section 8 of the Act requires the registry to collect data from any issued Massachusetts uniform citation regarding the race and gender of the motorist, the traffic infraction, whether a search was initiated, and whether the stop resulted in a warning, citation, or arrest. The registry is then required to report the statistical information it collects every month to the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Pursuant to \u00a7 10 of the Act, the Secretary shall transmit the collected data to a \u201cuniversity in the commonwealth with experience in the analysis of such data, for annual preparation of an analysis and report of its findings.\u201d If the analysis suggests that a State police barracks or a municipal police department \u201cappears to have engaged in racial or gender profiling,\u201d that department or barracks is thereafter required to \u201ccollect information on all traffic stops, including those not resulting in a warning, citation, or arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Individual police departments may mandate that police officers disclose additional information, including their identification, in order to allow those departments to \u201cview data at the officer level\u201d and \u201cmanage officers\u201d accordingly.

I join in the opinion of the court and fully agree with its conclusions that racial profiling evidence may be used to assess whether a traffic stop is constitutional, and that evidence seized where a stop was made in violation of the equal protection clause of the State Constitution may be suppressed. I also agree that, in this case, the methodology the defendant used in an attempt to introduce evidence that raised at least a reasonable inference of impermissible discrimination was flawed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>376 Mass. 885, 894 (1978). Indeed, as the court notes, the parties jointly filed a motion to vacate the suppression order. <em>Ante </em>at 432-433. I write separately to stress the court\u2019s point that, in practical terms, the capacity of individual defendants to meet the burden required of them is \u201cadmittedly daunting.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">The court discusses the history of concern with racial profiling in traffic stops. <em>Ante </em>at 444-445, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>429 Mass. 658, 670 (1999) (Ireland, J., concurring) (widespread public concern about racial profiling of drivers has been subject of discussion and concern), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feyenord, </em>445 Mass. 72, 88 (2005) (Greaney, J., concurring), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1187 (2006) (motorist must never be stopped based on race or ethnicity). I repeat the observation of Justice Greaney that poorer citizens, who likely would include minorities, are more likely to be \u201cdriving vehicles with defective equipment,\u201d thus providing police with a legitimate reason to exercise discretion to stop them. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feyenord, supra </em>at 87 (Greaney, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Soto, </em>324 N.J.

In establishing a prima facie case of selective enforcement, both sides were able to produce a database of all stops and arrests by State police patrolling a certain area of the New Jersey Turnpike between April, 1988, and May, 1991.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>To establish a standard against which to compare this data, the defendants conducted a traffic survey and a violator survey. <em>Id. </em>The traffic survey was conducted by teams supervised by an attorney of the office of the public defender. The team conducted twenty-one randomly selected, two and one-half hour sessions, between June 11 and 24, 1993. <em>Id. </em>at 69-70. The violator survey was conducted over four days in July, 1993, in ten sessions. <em>Id. </em>at 70. This involved, inter alla, the attorney from the public defender\u2019s office actually traveling the portion of the highway at issue, \u201cobserving and recording the number of vehicles that passed him [he was traveling at sixty miles an hour], the number of vehicles he passed and how many had a black occupant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Statisticians analyzed the data collected and testified, in essence, that profiling existed. <em>Id. </em>at 70-71. The decision led to many changes in New Jersey, including, as the court notes, see <em>ante </em>at 441 n.29, a full review of law enforcement practices and the assignment of one judge to hear all the motions for discovery related to racial profiling.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Here in the Commonwealth, even if a defendant could conduct such a survey, it is not clear whether the kind of database of stops and arrests the defendants were able to obtain in New Jersey is available yet. In response to concerns over racial (and gender) profiling in traffic stops, the Legislature enacted St. 2000, c. 228, so that data could be collected and later analyzed for evidence of such profiling. See <em>ante </em>at 446 n.33. An analysis of some twenty-seven months of data collected was analyzed by experts at Northeastern University and a report was issued in May, 2004. The report found that of the 366 Massachusetts law enforcement agencies reporting data for analysis, 249 of them had substantial disparities in at least one of four measurements used.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The statute states that the Secretary of the Executive Of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>fice of Public Safety (Secretary), in consultation with the Attorney General, shall require those agencies that appear to have engaged in racial or gender profiling to collect information on all traffic stops for one year. St. 2000, c. 228, \u00a7 10.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Secretary mandated the additional data collection to determine whether such profiling existed. See <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Police Dep\u2019t of Boston, </em>446 Mass. 46, 48-49 (2006). However, it appears as though the statute does not provide expressly for the reporting or analysis of the additional data. St. 2000, c. 228, \u00a7 10.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, nearly one-half of the targeted police departments did not follow recommended guidelines and the State did not receive or review any data. Boston Globe, Study of Traffic Stops Is Derailed, Sept. 9, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Nine years ago, I first expressed my concern about profiling. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>429 Mass. 658, 669 (1999) (Ireland, J., concurring). Today the court has made it possible for defendants to challenge evidence seized if a traffic stop has been made in violation of the equal protection clause. Because the ability of defendants to establish a prima facie case is fraught with such great difficulty, my concern is the degree to which the right to challenge seized evidence could seemingly be elusive in practice. See, e.g., Reporting and Analysis, Racial Profiling Data Collection Resource Center at Northeastern University, at http://www.racialprofilinganalysis.neu.edu/reporting/ (last viewed May 19, 2008) (asserting that \u201c [construction of an ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>propriate benchmark against which to compare traffic citations or warnings is quite challenging. Because research on racial and gender disparities in traffic stops is relatively new, little consensus exists about the most statistically sound population against which to compare traffic stop or citation information\u201d). Time will tell how the issues concerning data reporting and analysis will be resolved.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-6\">It is not clear why the traffic survey had been conducted. <em>State </em>v. <em>Soto, </em>324 N.J.
