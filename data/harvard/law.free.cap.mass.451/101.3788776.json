L. c. 152, \u00a7 26.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Chernick\u2019s Case, </em>286 Mass. 168, 172 (1934), this court held that compensation for an injury arising out of and in the course of employment \u201cdoes not extend to cover employees going to and coming from their work,\u201d col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>loquially referred to as the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule. See <em>Wormstead </em>v. <em>Town Manager of Saugus, </em>366 Mass. 659, 666 (1975). In this case, an administrative judge of the Department of Industrial Accidents concluded that, while the accident occurred during the employee\u2019s commute home, the employee\u2019s injuries were compensable because the employee\u2019s \u201cutter exhaustion due to work-caused sleep deprivation\u201d resulted in the accident. A divided reviewing board affirmed. The insurer, National Union Fire Insurance Company (insurer), appealed. We conclude that the employee\u2019s injuries are not compensable because the employer did not require the employee to work beyond his regular, far shorter, shift. We reverse the decision of the reviewing board.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the pertinent evidence. See <em>Papanastassiou\u2019s Case, </em>362 Mass. 91, 92 (1972). The employee began working at 5 a.m. on August 3, 2001, the day before the accident. He was a foreman who supervised a crew of carpenters building forms for road supports for the \u201cBig Dig\u201d central artery project in Boston.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That day the project was delayed for various reasons, and the pouring of concrete into the forms did not begin until 1 a.m., twenty hours after the employee had begun his shift. The employee testified that the day shift, for which he had been scheduled, ended at 3:30 p.m., and that he was not scheduled to work overnight. He remained on the job, he said, because \u201ca carpenter has to be there while the concrete\u2019s being poured, to the finish. ... I had to be there. There was nobody else there to finish what I was doing until about 8 [a.m.]\u201d As a result, he said, \u201cI sucked it up and drove on because if I didn\u2019t finish it I probably wouldn\u2019t have had a job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The construction crew supervisor on duty that night, David Arruda, \u201ccorroborated\u201d the employee, in the administrative judge\u2019s words, that a carpenter was required to be present during concrete pours. The supervisor testified, however, that if he was told that \u201csomebody was tired, you know, there\u2019s a slew of people ... a few different people from the carpenters\u2019 end if there is a problem that [the supervisors] can fall back on, so I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>could make the phone calls to get more personnel out there.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Arruda testified that the employee did not ask for assistance during the night. When the employee was asked at the hearing, \u201c[D]id anybody tell you had to stay that length of time?\u201d he answered unequivocally, \u201cNo.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The administrative judge found that, under the employee\u2019s union\u2019s contract with his employer, the employee could not be required to work overtime.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">It is undisputed that, before he headed home on August 4, the employee had worked for approximately twenty-seven hours without sleep.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When he left the worksite at 8:15 a.m., he felt, in his words, \u201ctotally exhausted.\u201d He fell asleep after driving for thirty minutes, crashed into a utility pole, and was injured.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">On October 16, 2001, the employee filed a claim for benefits for a compensable injury. On January 14, 2002, the claim went before an administrative judge for a conference pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A (l).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The administrative judge ruled that the injury was compensable and issued an order requiring the insurer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>to pay benefits to the employee, including temporary total incapacity benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34, partial incapacity benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35, and medical benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 30. Both parties sought a hearing pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A (3).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At the hearing on September 24, 2002, before the same administrative judge, the employee challenged the amount and scope of the award.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The insurer challenged the rulings as to liability, incapacity, entitlement to medical benefits, causal relationship, and average weekly wage, and sought recoupment of monies paid pursuant to the conference order.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">In his decision of March 8, 2004, the administrative judge concluded that the employee\u2019s injuries were compensable<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> because \u201cthe physical state that caused the accident arose directly out of and had presented itself while [the employee] was still on the job,\u201d and that his \u201cutter exhaustion, due to work-caused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>sleep deprivation, clearly arose out of and in the course of his employment.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In his subsidiary findings of fact, he found that the employee continued working because, in the administrative judge\u2019s words, the employee \u201cwanted to get out of the overtime,\u201d but was \u201csucking it up\u201d because \u201cthe job had to be done and because he felt there would be repercussions up to the possible loss of his job if the work was not completed on schedule.\u201d The administrative judge made no subsidiary (or other) findings concerning the supervisor\u2019s testimony that he could have brought other employees onto the night shift, and that the employee did not ask for assistance.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See note 3, <em>supra. </em>He made no express finding whether the employee was compelled to work beyond his regular shift.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The insurer appealed from the decision to the reviewing board pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11C.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A divided panel of the reviewing board affirmed the decision.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Two administrative law judges agreed, for different reasons, that the employee\u2019s injuries were compensable. One concluded that the employee\u2019s exhaustion arose out of and in the course of his employment because the employee was \u201c \u2018impelled by his employment\u2019 to continue working until the concrete pour was finished, 27 hours after his shift began.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> She noted that the employee was \u201cnot ordered to work overtime,\u201d but reasoned that his injuries were compen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>sable because \u201cthe employee felt obligated to stay until the [concrete] pour was completed.\u201d Citing <em>Hicks\u2019s Case, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 755, 764 (2005), she concluded that the supervisor had \u201cimpliedly authorized\u201d the employee\u2019s overtime by allowing him to continue to work, by paying him for the overtime, and by \u201cnot providing any relief\u201d to the employee. See note 20, <em>infra. A </em>second member of the reviewing board, citing <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, </em>385 Mass. 590, 594 (1982), concluded that the injuries arose out of and in the course of employment because there was a \u201cdirect cause between the employee\u2019s work, his diminished capacity to safely operate his automobile, and his resulting injuries and disability.\u201d The dissenting member of the reviewing board reasoned that the injuries were not compensable because they did not arise out of and in the course of employment where there was no evidence that the employee was \u201crequired or requested\u201d to remain at work beyond the usual end of his shift and because \u201cwork-related fatigue is not the kind of \u2018harm\u2019 which our courts have construed as either constituting, or giving rise to, a compensable injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">2. <em>Standard of review. </em>Pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12 (2), we review a decision of the reviewing board under the standards of the Administrative Procedure Act, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) <em>(a)-(d), (f), </em>and <em>(g). </em>We may set aside or modify the decision of the reviewing board if the decision is, among other things, \u201c[b]ased on an error of law,\u201d \u201c[m]ode upon unlawful procedure,\u201d or \u201c[arbitrary or capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) (c), <em>(d), </em>(g). See <em>Robinson\u2019s Case, </em>416 Mass. 454, 455-457 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">3. <em>Fatigue \u201carising out of and in the course of\u201d employment. </em>The employee does not take issue with the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule, see L.Y. Nason, C.W. Koziol, &amp; R.A. Wall, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 12.4 (3d ed. 2003) (Nason, Koziol, &amp; Wall), but argues that where the medical evidence established \u201ca clear causal link between the employment activity and the injury,\u201d the employee\u2019s injuries were \u201cdirectly attributable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>workplace and arose out of the employment\u201d and the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule does not apply in his case. Uncontradicted evidence before the administrative judge supported his finding that the employee fell asleep at the wheel as a result of working for twenty-seven hours without sleep. The insurer does not challenge that finding,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> but argues that the employee\u2019s injuries are nevertheless not compensable because, among other reasons, the employee, injured while traveling home from work, was not required to stay beyond his scheduled shift: in the words of the insurer, the overtime \u201cwas not compelled, overtime was not mandatory, and [the employee] testified that he could have left at anytime.\u201d See 1 A. Larson, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 13.01 [1] (2007) (workers\u2019 compensation not intended to protect against all perils of worker\u2019s journey between home and place of employment). We agree with the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The employee points to cases from other jurisdictions where injuries sustained during travel from work have been deemed \u201cemployment-related,\u201d and therefore compensable because the travel home was made more hazardous by an employer\u2019s \u201cextraordinary demands\u201d for overtime work by the employee.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Van Devander </em>v. <em>Heller Elec. Co., </em>405 F.2d 1108, 1110 (D.C. Cir. 1968) (compensating employee pursuant to Federal Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Act, 44 Stat. 1424 [1927], as amended, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-950 [1957], for injuries sustained when he fell asleep while driving home after being required to work twenty-six hours without sleep because hazard of journey arose out of and in course of \u201cextraordinary demands of employment\u201d). See <em>Hed </em>v. <em>Brockway Glass Co., </em>309 Minn. 73, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>76 (1976) (affirming compensation award to worker who fell asleep while driving home after being required to work longer hours as bricklayer than generally required); <em>Snowbarger </em>v. <em>Tri-County Elec. Coop., </em>793 S.W.2d 348, 350 (Mo. 1990) (affirming award of compensation to worker who fell asleep while driving home after being required to work \u201cunusually long overtime hours\u201d of manual labor, eighty-six hours in one hundred hour period). See also <em>Deland </em>v. <em>Hutchings Psychiatric Ctr., </em>203 A.D. 2d 776, 778 (N.Y. 1994) (recognizing \u201csubstantial body of authority from other States and the Federal courts\u201d holding that fatigue-related injuries can be compensable in some circumstances, but remanding case for explanation why contrary precedent within jurisdiction was not followed). In all such cases, however, the employer had exposed its worker to the hazards of travel by requiring the employee to work unusually long hours. See, e.g., <em>Van Devander </em>v. <em>Heller Elec. Co., supra; Hed </em>v. <em>Brockway Glass Co., supra </em>at 76; <em>Snowbarger </em>v. <em>Tri-County Elec. Coop., supra </em>at 349; <em>Deland </em>v. <em>Hutchings Psychiatric Ctr., supra. </em>We need not decide in this case whether a requirement by an employer that an employee work overtime to such an extent that the employee\u2019s trip home is made substantially more hazardous can give rise to a compensable injury because here the employee has not met his burden to show that he was required by his employer to work beyond his usual shift. See <em>Sponatski\u2019s Case, 220 </em>Mass. 526, 527-528 (1915) (employee bears \u201cburden of proving the essential facts necessary to establish a case warranting the payment of compensation\u201d under act); <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 586, 592 (2000) (\u201cthe employee has the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, all the elements of her claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits\u201d). In the words of the reviewing board, the employee was \u201cnot ordered to work overtime.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>In fact, he was protected from such a requirement by his union contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">As noted earlier, the employee testified that he stayed on the job beyond his regular shift because he \u201cprobably wouldn\u2019t have had a job\u201d if he had left. Accepting the employee\u2019s testimony, the administrative judge made subsidiary findings that in essence found that it was the employee\u2019s subjective belief that kept him on the job beyond his scheduled shift. The employee testified that no one had ordered him to stay on the job. He also testified that four carpenters left at the end of their day shift on the day before the accident and had suffered no job repercussions. His supervisor, Arruda, testified that he (Arruda) could have called other carpenters to relieve the employee if the employee had asked for assistance. The employee\u2019s subjective belief of negative consequences that he anticipated would follow had he left at the end of his shift is not enough. To the extent the administrative judge reached his conclusion based on the employee\u2019s subjective perceptions or beliefs, he erred.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Bengtson\u2019s Case, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 239, 243-244 (1993) (denying compensation for worker\u2019s injury sustained during participation in employer-organized softball game, concluding \u201cnature of an employee\u2019s participation in a recreational activity . . . must be weighed by an objective standard\u201d).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We are not aware of any decision in which a fatigue-caused injury while an employee was traveling home has been held compensable where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>the employee was not required to work the extra hours. It is the \u201cextraordinary demands of the claimant\u2019s employment\u201d that may foreseeably expose the claimant to the risk of injury. 1 A. Larson, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 14.05[4], at 14-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">There may be cases where fatigue gives rise to a compensable injury because an employer makes \u201cextraordinary demands\u201d on an employee and the employee is compelled to remain on the job. See, e.g., <em>Van Devander </em>v. <em>Heller Elec. Co., supra </em>at 1110. The dissenting member of the reviewing board panel commented that recognizing an exception to the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule in such circumstances would consign administrative judges \u201cto the daunting task of drawing a bright line as to how many extra hours of work would be sufficient\u201d to render fatigue-related injuries compensable. Necessarily administrative judges will have to determine whether an employer made an \u201cextraordinary demand\u201d based on the facts of each case, including but not limited to the worker\u2019s duties, the amount of overtime, the length of the worker\u2019s typical shift, and whether such facts warrant a conclusion that the overtime was so great \u201cas to increase markedly the factor of fatigue\u201d and that the fatigue from the overtime caused the accident. 1 A. Larson, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 14.05 [4], at 14-14.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> But this task is no more \u201cdaunting\u201d for judges than the task of applying other exceptions to the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule. See <em>Caron\u2019s Case, </em>351 Mass. 406, 409 (1966) (noting, with regard to special errand exception, that \u201ceach case must be decided on its own facts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>4. <em>Exceptions to the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule. </em>The employee argues that, even if the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule applies to him, his injuries are compensable because they fall within a recognized exception to that rule. See Nason, Koziol, &amp; Wall, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 12.4, at 379 (discussing exceptions to \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule for off-premises injuries and noting that this court \u201chas established a number of special circumstances that warrant compensation\u201d). He points in particular to the \u201cspecial errand\u201d exception to the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule, which compensates an injury sustained while on a \u201cmission which [was] necessitated by . . . employment.\u201d <em>Caron\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 409 (affirming compensation award to worker injured while driving home from evening business meeting at hotel he was required to attend).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">When an employee makes a special trip, distinct from his regular commute to and from work, the employment relationship is not suspended and injuries sustained during the trip might be compensable. <em>Id. </em>at 408. See 1 A. Larson, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 14.05[1], at 14-5 (journey by employee \u201cmay be brought within the course of employment by the fact that the trouble and time of making the journey, or the special inconvenience, hazard, or urgency of making it in the particular circumstances, is <em>itself </em>sufficiently substantial to be viewed as an integral part of the service itself\u201d [emphasis added]). In this case, however, when the employee was injured he was not engaged in any mission for his employer, but was driving home from work, an activity at the heart of the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The Massachusetts cases on which the employee relies are distinguishable. For example, in <em>Rouse </em>v. <em>Greater Lynn Mental Health, </em>16 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 7, 8 (2002), aff\u2019d, Appeals Court No. 2002-J-0048 (Mar. 3, 2004), a home health aide was compensated for an injury she sustained while walking to a patient\u2019s house to provide care during a snowstorm, when she was not scheduled to work. The reviewing board concluded the worker was on a \u201cspecial trip,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 12, because she was traveling to work to \u201cfulfill [the] employer\u2019s obligations to its clients,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 11, and was not \u201cmerely going to work as [she] normally and usually went to work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12, quoting <em>Gwalt-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number><em>ney\u2019s Case, </em>355 Mass. 333, 335 (1969). Similarly, in <em>Papanas-tassiou\u2019s Case, </em>362 Mass. 91, 94 (1972), the dependents of a research scientist were compensated for injuries he sustained in a car accident while returning to work, outside of his usual hours, to complete an experiment. This court concluded the worker\u2019s injuries were compensable because his trip was implicitly authorized by his employer and was \u201cin fulfilment of the [worker\u2019s] obligations to his employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94. Here, in contrast, while driving home, the employee was not fulfilling any obligation to or on behalf of his employer. He was not driving from a location that his employer required him to visit. Cf. <em>Caron\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 409.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> He was driving home from his fixed place of work as he usually did. None of the exceptions to the going and coming rule applies to the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">5. <em>Insurer\u2019s additional claims. </em>Because we conclude that the employee\u2019s injuries are not compensable, we need not address the insurer\u2019s additional arguments that the amended decision of the administrative judge was issued prior to any hearing or ruling on a pending motion filed by the insurer in violation of the insurer\u2019s rights to due process; that the administrative judge, without authority, retained jurisdiction over the prevailing wage issue; and that the administrative judge improperly reserved for the employee the right to raise a new claim as to his average weekly wage. See note 10, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\"><em>6. Conclusion. </em>For the reasons stated above, the decision of the reviewing board is reversed. The case is remanded to the reviewing board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b121-14\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 26, provides, in relevant part: \u201c[A]n employee who . . . receives a personal injury arising out of and in the course of his employment, or arising out of an ordinary risk of the street while actually engaged, with his employer\u2019s authorization, in the business affairs or undertakings of his employer, and whether within or without the commonwealth, . . . shall be paid compensation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b122-7\">There was evidence, pointed to by the reviewing board, that the employee\u2019s duties required him to \u201cget[] down in the hole\u201d with his crew, and included crawling and heavy lifting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b123-7\">This testimony of the supervisor, David Arruda, was referred to in the opinion by the dissenting administrative law judge of the reviewing board.

L. c. 152, \u00a7 35, thereafter, as well as the inclusion of certain fringe benefits in the calculation of his average weekly wage, asserting that he was entitled to \u201cprevailing\u201d wages pursuant to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 26 and 27. Those statutes require the Commissioner of Labor and Industries to issue prevailing wage schedules for certain categories of employees working on, inter alla, construction and other types of public projects.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b124-9\">The administrative judge ordered the insurer to pay benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 34 and 35, to the employee for the period requested by the employee, see note 9, supra, based on an average weekly wage of $1,399.50. The average weekly wage did not include fringe benefits because, the administrative judge concluded, the employee failed to meet his burden to prove the promulgation of a prevailing wage applicable to his position. The administrative judge retained jurisdiction of the case for sixty days to allow the employee \u201cto introduce additional evidence as to whether a prevailing wage was formally set for the position in which he worked at the time of his injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">On April 9, 2004, the administrative judge filed an amendment to his decision and ordered the insurer to pay benefits as ordered in his March 8 decision; he did not retain further jurisdiction of the case, but in the interests of \u201cjustice\u201d and \u201ceconomy\u201d reserved for the employee the right to raise a new claim as to the amount of the average weekly wage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The administrative judge found that \u201c[wjith such extreme circumstances as these, and with such a clear, direct connection between the extreme circumstances and the ultimate accident, this incident is different and distinct from those situations appropriately within the going and coming rule.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b125-7\">In his subsidiary findings the administrative judge found that \u201c[the employee] indicated that it was required that at least a rudimentary carpentry crew, including a foreman, be there through the pour. <em>Though he allowed that overtime was not compulsory, </em>the night crew had been laid off and there was no relief\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Notably, the employee, in the words of the dissenting administrative law judge, \u201cworked copious amounts of overtime in most of the ten weeks preceding his injury.

The employee\u2019s medical expert opined that, in the words of the administrative judge, \u201cthe employee\u2019s falling asleep at the wheel, and the resulting August 4, 2001, motor vehicle accident, were caused by an extended period of sleep deprivation related to [the employee\u2019s] extended work shift immediately prior to the accident.\u201d The insurer did not proffer any expert opinion on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b127-7\">These circumstances are sometimes considered as falling within the special errand exception to the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule, discussed <em>infra. </em>See 1 A.

Larson, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 14.05[4], at 14-13 (\u201cthe special errand rule is ordinarily held inapplicable when the only special component is the fact that the employee began work earlier or quit work later than usual\u201d). The issue arises only \u201c[w]hen the amount of overtime work becomes so great as to increase markedly the factor of fatigue, and when this factor contributes to the accident. . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 14.0514], at 14-14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b129-6\">That the employer may have benefited from the employee\u2019s work does not establish that the employer required the employee to remain on the job. The reviewing board relied on <em>Hicks\u2019s </em>Case, 62 Mass. App. Ct. 755, 762-768 (2005), where the Appeals Court affirmed an award to a medical technician injured by an influenza vaccination she received without charge from her employer, a hospital. The issue in that case was whether receipt of the vaccine was an incident of her employment. <em>Id. </em>at 763. The Appeals Court concluded that it was because the employer encouraged its workers to receive the vaccine, offered it on the premises, and received a benefit from the vaccination of its workers. <em>Id. </em>at 766-767. The question whether the employer \u201crequired\u201d the worker to receive the vaccine was not addressed. <em>Id. </em>at 762-768.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b129-7\">In <em>Bengtson\u2019s Case, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 239, 243-244 (1993), the injured worker was not told that playing on the softball team was required, or that playing on the team would enhance his job opportunities. <em>Id. </em>at 243. No other worker was disciplined or disadvantaged for failing to play or rewarded for playing. <em>Id. </em>The Appeals Court, concluding that the worker\u2019s participation was voluntary when weighed by an objective standard, held that the administrative judge erred in giving weight to the worker\u2019s subjective perceptions. <em>Id. </em>at 244.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b130-6\">For example, some employees regularly work twenty-four hour shifts.

App. Ct. 502, 505 (2006), <em>S.C., </em>450 Mass. 1011 (2007) (discussing testimony before joint labor-management committee in support of twenty-four hour shifts for fire fighters). A requirement that these workers remain for twenty-seven hours might not be \u201cextraordinary.\u201d Compare <em>Hed. </em>v. <em>Brockway Glass Co., </em>309 Minn. 73, 76-77 (1976) (affirming compensation award to bricklayer who fell asleep while driving home after being required to work nine-hour, fifteen-minute shift, which was longer than usual eight-hour shift, in unusually grueling conditions), with <em>Pappas </em>v. <em>Sports Servs., Inc., </em>68 Mich. App. 423, 432 (1976) (concluding that injuries sustained when cook fell asleep while driving after being required to work thirteen hours, which was five hours longer than his normal working day, and after attending work-sponsored party for two hours, were not compensable because \u201camount of overtime work was [not] so great as to increase substantially plaintiff\u2019s fatigue\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Cases from other jurisdictions on which the employee relies similarly hold that the special errand exception applies when an employee makes a trip in order to fulfil a special task for his employer.
