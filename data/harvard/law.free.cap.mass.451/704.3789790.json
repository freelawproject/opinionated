One answer to this question can be found in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7A (\u00a7 7A), which establishes prima facie evidence of various elements of a workers\u2019 compensation claim when an employee has been rendered unable to testify by reason of injury or death occurring at the workplace. In this case, we examine the interaction between \u00a7 7A and G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 28 (\u00a7 28), which provides for double compensation when an employee\u2019s injury results from the \u201cserious and wilful misconduct\u201d of an employer or supervisor. We agree with the conclusion of the administrative judge of the Department of Industrial Accidents (department) that \u00a7 7A does not establish prima facie evidence of a violation of \u00a7 28. Based on that conclusion and on our review of the evidence presented at the hearing before the administrative judge, we affirm the decision of the department\u2019s reviewing board (board) upholding her denial of the \u00a7 28 double compensation claim at issue in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">1. <em>Background. </em>Wayne Moss (employee) was killed in a motor vehicle accident on March 26, 1999, while traveling from one job site to another in connection with his duties as an employee of M&amp;M Movers (company). The employee was seated on the far right passenger side of the bench seat of a 1987 Ford F700 straight track (Ford) owned by his employer. The driver, Ronald Clement, and the middle passenger, Paul Avila, were also employees of the company. Three other employees, Kenneth Robi-taille, Albert Crapeau, and Tony DeJesus, were following the Ford in a separate vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">The Ford was traveling in the left-hand, or inner, lane of a two-way road in Rhode Island when it was struck in the middle of its left side by a van pulling out of a driveway on the opposite side of the road. The front of the van went under the box of the Ford, causing the Ford to fall over onto its right side; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>Ford slid along the road on its side for some distance before coming to a stop. When the Ford tipped over, the driver, Clement, held onto the steering wheel to avoid moving to the right, and he grabbed onto Avila, the middle passenger, whose arm was rubbing on the pavement through the open passenger door window. The employee, Moss, was ejected from the vehicle and trapped beneath it as it slid on its side; he died at the accident scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Following the accident, the employee\u2019s widow, Arlene Moss (claimant), applied for and has been collecting dependent death benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 31; this appeal relates to her claim for double compensation under \u00a7 28.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The claimant contended that the latch mechanism on the Ford\u2019s passenger side door was not operating properly, causing the door to open during the accident and allowing Moss to fall out. She alleged that Clement, the driver, or David Mello, the owner of the company, knew or should have known of the problem with the latch and that their failure to repair it constituted \u201cserious and wilful misconduct\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 28. The administrative judge found that the employee\u2019s death was not caused by employer misconduct. She also concluded that \u00a7 7A did not apply to establish prima facie evidence that the accident was caused by the serious and wilful misconduct of an employer or supervisor. The board summarily affirmed the administrative judge\u2019s decision. The claimant appealed, and we transferred the case here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">2. <em>Applicability of \u00a7 7A to \u00a7 28. </em>As has been indicated, \u00a7 7A establishes prima facie evidence of aspects of a workers\u2019 compensation claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Invoking the substance of the board\u2019s decision in <em>Petit </em>v. <em>Westvaco Corp., </em>8 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 228, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>231 (1994), in which the board concluded that \u00a7 7A creates prima facie evidence that where an employee dies on the job, the death was caused by the serious and wilful misconduct of the employer, the claimant contends that the administrative judge erred in failing to interpret \u00a7 7A to create prima facie evidence that this case falls within the provisions of \u00a7 28.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is not entirely clear whether the board continues to adhere to the broad language of its <em>Petit </em>decision, in light of the fact that in the instant case, the board summarily affirmed the administrative judge\u2019s decision without registering any disagreement with her conclusion that \u00a7 7A did not apply to \u00a7 28. Nevertheless, we address the line of board decisions of which <em>Petit </em>is a part because those decisions may indeed continue to represent the board\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 7A, and in any event, they form the basis for the claimant\u2019s argument. We begin, however, with a review of \u00a7 7A and this court\u2019s discussion of the section in <em>Anderson\u2019s Case, </em>373 Mass. 813 (1977), because that case lies at the heart of the board\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Section 7A is designed \u201c[t]o aid the victim[] of an unwit-nessed accident\u201d who is unable to testify and therefore has difficulty meeting the burden of proving entitlement to compensation under G. L. c. 152. L.Y. Nason, C.W. Koziol, &amp; R.A. Wall, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 17.4 (3d ed. 2003). See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 10.11. The section by its terms establishes prima facie evidence of four separate aspects of a workers\u2019 compensation claim: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>(1) \u201cthat the employee was performing his regular duties on the day of injury or death\u201d; (2) \u201cthat the claim comes within the provisions of [c. 152]\u201d; (3) \u201cthat sufficient notice of the injury has been given\u201d; and (4) \u201cthat the injury or death was not occasioned by the willful intention of the employee to injure or kill himself or another.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7A. In <em>Anderson\u2019s Case, supra, </em>this court held that particularly the second of these, \u201cthe claim comes within the provisions of [c. 152],\u201d reflected a legislative intent that where an employee was found dead at his job, this fact should establish prima facie evidence that the employee\u2019s death was causally related to his employment. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">\u201cFor a claim to be compensable it must arise out of and in the course of the employment. Clearly a causal relationship is required between the employment duties and the injury or death. In a case such as this one, where the employee was found dead at his place of employment, we construe the statute, \u00a7 7A, as establishing, inter alla, prima facie evidence of causal relationship between the employment and the injury or fatality. We believe that was the meaning intended by the Legislature, particularly in its use of the words, \u2018and that the claim comes within the provisions of this chapter.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-6\"><em>Anderson\u2019s Case, </em>373 Mass. at 816-817.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">In a number of decisions before this case, the board has relied on the quoted passage from <em>Anderson\u2019s Case, supra, </em>to interpret \u00a7 7A as establishing, whenever \u00a7 7A has been called into play by testimonial incapacity resulting from an employee\u2019s injury or death on the job, prima facie evidence of the specific requirements of the section of c. 152 under which the claim was brought. Thus, in <em>Zavalia </em>v. <em>Salem, </em>6 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 276 (1992), a case in which the compensation claim was brought under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 36 and 36A,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the employee had died following his injury, the board held that \u00a7 7A applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>to create prima facie evidence that the employee\u2019s death was other than instantaneous and that he had suffered a loss of function, two elements of a claim for recovery under \u00a7\u00a7 36 and 36A. The board reasoned that the use of the term \u201cinter alla\u201d in <em>Anderson\u2019s Case, </em>373 Mass. at 816, suggested that \u201c\u00a7 7A transcends the issue of causation\u201d and that \u201c[h]ad the Legislature intended to limit the application of \u00a7 7A to a single section of chapter 152 or to only one element of compensability it presumably would have accomplished that purpose by use of a reference more narrow than \u2018this chapter.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zavalia </em>v. <em>Salem, supra </em>at 279. See <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>7 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 232, 235-236 (1993) (same). In <em>Petit </em>v. <em>Westvaco Corp., </em>8 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 228, 231 (1994), the board relied on the <em>Zavalia </em>and <em>Hayes </em>cases to conclude that \u201c\u00a7 7A applies to all sections of chapter 152 pertaining to liability,\u201d including \u00a7 28: \u201cthe effect of \u00a7 7A . . . statutorily mandates the finding that \u00a7 28 applies to the injury . . . and that [the] injury was caused by the serious and willful [mis]conduct of the employer, unless the [employer or insurer] produces evidence sufficient to warrant a contrary conclusion which is found by the judge to rebut the prima facie evidence of serious and willful misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Although \u201c[t]he interpretation of a statute by the agency charged with primary responsibility for administering it is entitled to substantial deference,\u201d <em>Gateley\u2019s Case, </em>415 Mass. 397, 399 (1993), ultimately the \u201cduty of statutory interpretation is for the courts.\u201d <em>Slater\u2019s Case, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 326, 330 (2002), quoting <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston </em>v. <em>Cecil, </em>431 Mass. 410, 413 (2000). See <em>Walker\u2019s Case, </em>443 Mass. 157, 160-170 (2004). In this case, we conclude that the board\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 7A, as articulated in the <em>Zavalia, Hayes, </em>and <em>Petit </em>cases, is not supported by either the plain language of the statute or this court\u2019s decision in <em>Anderson\u2019s Case, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">We interpret \u00a7 7A\u2019s establishment of prima facie evidence that a claim \u201ccomes within the provisions of\u201d c. 152 as reflecting a legislative intent that employees who have been injured or killed while at work and who have thereby been rendered unable to testify should qualify for workers\u2019 compensation benefits unless persuasive contrary evidence indicates otherwise. That is, as suggested above, the section addresses a concern that victims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>of unwitnessed accidents might be deprived of all compensation under G. L. c. 152 because they are unable to meet their burden of proof on the essential elements of a claim for compensation. See L.Y. Nason, C.W. Koziol, &amp; R.A. Wall, Workers\u2019 Compensation, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 10.11. The other facts established by \u00a7 7A \u2014 \u201cthat the employee was performing his regular duties on the day of injury or death . . . , that sufficient notice of the injury has been given and that the injury or death was not occasioned by the willful intention of the employee to injure or kill himself or another\u201d \u2014 support this interpretation, as they are either necessary elements of an entitlement to basic compensation or negations of an employer\u2019s potential affirmative defenses to any liability under c. 152. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26 (injury must \u201caris[e] out of and in the course of . . . employment\u201d); G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 41 (requiring notice to employer or insurer \u201cas soon as practicable after the happening [of the accident]\u201d). See also G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 26A, 27 (limiting employer\u2019s liability in cases of suicide or employee\u2019s wilful misconduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\"><em>Anderson\u2019s Case, supra, </em>is wholly consistent with this view. As the previously quoted passage of the decision in that case indicates, the court interpreted the portion of \u00a7 7A creating prima facie evidence \u201cthat the claim comes within the provisions of this chapter\u201d to include the causal link between employment and injury or death, because causation is a necessary element of any claim for compensation under c. 152. <em>Anderson\u2019s Case, </em>373 Mass. at 816-817.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">We therefore disagree with the claimant\u2019s contention that where it applies, \u00a7 <em>7A </em>establishes prima facie evidence not only of the facts set out in that section, but also of every fact necessary to establish entitlement to compensation under every section of c. 152 that deals with compensation, including the double compensation provided under \u00a7 28.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To the extent that the board has held otherwise, its interpretation is inconsistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>plain language of the statute and with appellate precedents.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The administrative judge appropriately evaluated the evidence in this case with an eye toward whether the claimant had met her burden of proving an entitlement to double compensation under \u00a7 28, without the benefit of any prima facie evidence from the operation of \u00a7 7A.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">3. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>The claimant also complains that the board\u2019s affirmance of the administrative judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary or capricious because the record does not support the administrative judge\u2019s findings that the passenger door was securely latched and did not open; that the employee was ejected through the open window; that the driver, Clement, was not negligent; and that Clement was not a supervisor within the meaning of \u00a7 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">In order to recover double compensation under \u00a7 28, the claimant had the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence, <em>Sponatski\u2019s </em>Case, 220 Mass. 526, 527-528 (1915), that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>(1) an employer or supervisor (2) committed serious and wilful misconduct that (3) caused the employee\u2019s injury. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 28. We review the board\u2019s decision under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12 (2), in accordance with the standards expressed in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) <em>(a)-(d), (f), </em>and (g), to determine whether the board properly affirmed the judge\u2019s findings. See <em>Scheffler\u2019s Case, </em>419 Mass. 251, 257-258 &amp; n.4 (1994). Thus, we consider \u201cwhether the decision is factually warranted and not \u2018 [arbitrary or capricious,\u2019 in the sense of having adequate evidentiary and factual support and disclosing reasoned decision making.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258. See <em>Robinson\u2019s Case, </em>416 Mass. 454, 457 (1993) (standards identified in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12 [2], \u201cmay overlap with the substantial evidence standard\u201d). Under this standard, we conclude that the board\u2019s decision was not arbitrary or capricious as there was sufficient evidence to support the administrative judge\u2019s decision that \u00a7 28 did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">A variety of witnesses presented evidence at the hearing regarding the condition of the latch mechanism and whether the door opened during the accident. The driver, Clement, had given a statement to the Rhode Island State police on the day of the accident in which he described seeing the door open and the employee fall out. At the hearing before the administrative judge, however, Clement testified (on direct examination by the claimant\u2019s counsel) that he did not actually see the door come open but assumed it must have opened for the employee to have fallen out as he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Clement also testified that he had inspected the latch plate on the Ford\u2019s passenger door the night before the accident and noticed that, of the three screws that secured the plate to the door, one was missing, one was loose, and impliedly one was secure. He tightened the loose screw. The claimant\u2019s metallurgy expert, Marc Richman, testified that the latch would close even if there were only one or two screws in place and that, once closed, it would remain securely latched unless someone pulled on the handle, even if any remaining screws fell out during the accident.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Clement told the police on the day of the accident that the employee told him the door was \u201ca pain in the ass\u201d but that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>\u201che got it closed. He said he was all set.\u201d Robitaille, the driver of the other company vehicle, testified that he closed the Ford\u2019s passenger door as the vehicle was leaving on the trip that ended in the accident; that although he had to slam it, the door latched securely; and that it had felt the same as when he closed an exemplar door at the hearing. The insurer\u2019s accident reconstruction expert, Gordon Johnson, testified that it was reasonable and common for an unrestrained passenger to be ejected through a vehicle window and that, given the lack of evidence of drag marks on the trailing edge of the door, and Clement\u2019s statement at the hearing that he did not see the door actually come open, the employee may have been ejected through the open window. He also testified that if the door did open, it was \u201creasonably probable\u201d that the employee had opened it himself by grabbing the handle in an attempt to hold himself in place against the forces of inertia during the accident.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Based on this evidence, the administrative judge found that the latch mechanism was not defective, that the door had remained closed during the accident, that the employee was ejected through the open window, and that employer misconduct was not the proximate cause of his death. While there certainly was some evidence to support the claimant\u2019s contention that the employee was ejected through the door as a result of a faulty latch mechanism, sufficient evidence existed to support the administrative judge\u2019s findings that the latch was securely fastened at the time of the accident and that the door did not open during the accident as a result of any problem with the latch.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Moreover, the evidence at the hearing supported the judge\u2019s conclusion that the claimant had failed to establish that either Clement or Mello, the owner of the company, \u201ckn[e]w or ha[d] reason to know of facts \u2018which would lead a reasonable man to realize that [his] conduct not only creates an unreasonable risk of bodily harm to [an]other but also involves a high degree of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>probability that substantial harm will result to him.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Scaia\u2019s Case, </em>320 Mass. 432, 434 (1946), quoting Restatement of Torts \u00a7 500 comment a.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Finally, there was evidence to support the judge\u2019s finding that Clement was not \u201cintrusted with\u201d or \u201cexercis[ing] powers of superintendence\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 28. The claimant bases her argument for supervisor status on the fact that Clement was the only employee in the Ford who possessed a commercial driver\u2019s license (CDL) and therefore was obliged to comply with certain regulatory safety provisions. However, Mello testified that all of the employees had equal responsibility with regard to job duties in general and safety in particular, and that although Clement was the designated driver, he was not a supervisor. Clement\u2019s status as a CDL licensee was not sufficient to bring him within the scope of \u00a7 28 as \u201ca person who is officially designated by the employer as the person in charge of a particular facet of the employer\u2019s business.\u201d <em>O\u2019Leary\u2019s Case, </em>367 Mass. 108, 114 (1975).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">4. <em>Prehearing rulings and evidentiary rulings. </em>Finally, the claimant argues that the board erred in affirming various rulings made by the administrative judge before and during the hearing. Her claims fall primarily into two categories. First, she complains of the defendants\u2019 alleged failure to give proper notice of the factual basis for their defenses, the content of their expert\u2019s expected testimony, and the content of Clement\u2019s testimony at the hearing. Second, she argues that the administrative judge erred in allowing both the insurer\u2019s expert, Johnson, and her expert, Richman, to testify to opinions not based on their relevant expertise or not disclosed in the prehearing conference materials. While some of Johnson\u2019s testimony was admittedly unorthodox, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>the administrative judge\u2019s rulings on all these issues were within her sound discretion under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11, and the board did not err in affirming them.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Moreover, we have determined that the administrative judge properly found no serious and wilful misconduct on the part of the employer or a supervisor, and we have noted that her conclusion that the door did not open as a result of a faulty latch is supportable based on Robitaille\u2019s and Richman\u2019s testimony alone. Therefore, any error in these rulings \u2014 most of which relate to Johnson\u2019s testimony and nearly all of which relate to the judge\u2019s conclusion that the employee was ejected through the window \u2014 would be harmless. See <em>In-drisano\u2019s Case, </em>307 Mass. 520, 523 (1940) (\u201ca decree in a workmen\u2019s compensation case will not be reversed for error in the admission or exclusion of evidence, unless substantial justice requires reversal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>The board properly affirmed the administrative judge\u2019s decision concluding that \u00a7 7A does not create prima facie evidence of the requirements for a claim for double compensation under \u00a7 28, and that the claimant failed to establish an entitlement to \u00a7 28 benefits in this case. We therefore affirm the decision of the reviewing board.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b725-9\">We acknowledge the amicus brief filed by the Massachusetts Academy of Trial Attorneys in support of the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b726-7\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 28 (\u00a7 28), provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-8\">\u201cIf the employee is injured by reason of the serious and wilful misconduct of an employer or of any person regularly intrusted with and exercising the powers of superintendence, the amounts of compensation hereinafter provided shall be doubled. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b726-9\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 7A (\u00a7 7A), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-10\">\u201cIn any claim for compensation where the employee has been killed or found dead at his place of employment or, in the absence of death, is physically or mentally unable to testify, and such testimonial incapacity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>is causally related to the injury, it shall be prima facie evidence that the employee was performing his regular duties on the day of injury or death and that the claim comes within the provisions of this chapter, that sufficient notice of the injury has been given and that the injury or death was not occasioned by the willful intention of the employee to injure or kill himself or another.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b727-9\">The claimant appears to assume that if \u00a7 7A is interpreted to establish prima facie evidence that the employee\u2019s death in this case was covered by \u00a7 28, she would have prevailed before the administrative judge and the board on her claim for double compensation. The correctness of this assumption is far from established by the administrative record: it is not clear what effect, if any, application of \u00a7 7A might have had on the ultimate findings and conclusions of the administrative judge. However, the question whether \u00a7 7A establishes prima facie evidence of serious and wilful misconduct on the part of an employer within the scope of \u00a7 28 has been fully briefed and argued, has arisen, and does arise in other cases, and we address it. See <em>Wellesley College </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>313 Mass. 722, 731 (1943).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b728-8\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7\u00a736 and 36A, provide for extra compensation to be awarded where an employee\u2019s work-related injury has caused certain types of loss of function or brain damage, and the employee has not died within a specified period of time following the injury. At the time of the injury at issue in <em>Zavalia </em>v. <em>Salem, </em>6 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 276 (1992), \u00a7 36A required that the employee\u2019s death not be \u201cinstantaneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 277 &amp; nn.2 &amp; 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b730-7\">The plain language of \u00a7 7A cannot reasonably be stretched to accommodate the broad general reach that the board and the claimant in this case have attributed to it. Focusing on \u00a7 28 in particular, this court has interpreted the \u201cserious and wilful misconduct\u201d described in the section to require \u201cmuch more than mere negligence, or even than gross or culpable negligence. It involves conduct of a quasi criminal nature, the intentional doing of something either with the knowledge that it is likely to result in serious injury or with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>wanton and reckless disregard of its probable consequences.\u201d <em>O\u2019Leary\u2019s Case, 367 </em>Mass. 108, 115 (1975), quoting <em>Scaia\u2019s Case, </em>320 Mass. 432, 433-434 (1946). It is exceedingly difficult to conclude that without any mention of \u00a7 28, and simply by inserting the phrase, \u201cthat the claim comes within the provisions of this chapter\u201d in \u00a7 7A, the Legislature intended to establish, for every employee entitled to the benefit of \u00a7 7A, prima facie evidence that his or her employer is guilty of quasi criminal conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b731-13\">In addition to <em>Anderson\u2019s Case, </em>the board in both <em>Zavalia </em>v. <em>Salem, 6 </em>Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. at 279, and <em>Petit </em>v. <em>Westvaco Corp., </em>8 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 228, 231 &amp; n.4 (1994), drew support for its expansive interpretation of \u00a7 7A from a footnote in <em>Thayer\u2019s Case, </em>345 Mass. 36, 43 n.5 (1962). We think the board has misread the import of the footnote. <em>Thayer\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 41-43, (in relevant part) addressed the question whether an employee\u2019s claim for double compensation under \u00a7 28 was governed by the time limits set out in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 41, for filing claims for \u201ccompensation\u201d; it was agreed that claims for basic or \u201cordinary\u201d compensation brought under c. 152, \u00a7 26, were subject to the \u00a7 41 limits. The court concluded that \u201ccompensation\u201d as used in \u00a7 41 was used genetically to apply to \u00a7 28 as well as \u00a7 26 proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 42-43. Considered in this context, the court\u2019s reference to \u00a7 7A in the footnote is best understood as stating that in a case of an unexplained death or injury occurring at an employee\u2019s place of work, a claimant bringing a claim for double compensation under \u00a7 28, like a claimant filing under \u00a7 26, could seek the application of \u00a7 7A to his or her case. Contrary to the board\u2019s reading, however, the <em>Thayer\u2019s Case </em>footnote does not address what the application of \u00a7 7A would mean \u2014 that is, the footnote does not identify the particular issues arising in a \u00a7 28 claim on which \u00a7 7A establishes prima facie evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b732-8\">A photograph of the latch plate taken at the accident scene shortly after the accident shows no screws in the plate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b733-7\">The claimant\u2019s counsel raised numerous objections to Johnson\u2019s testimony during the hearing. We address those objections in part 4, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b733-8\">In particular, Robitaille\u2019s testimony that he closed the passenger door for the last time just before the accident and that it latched securely, and the expert witness Richman\u2019s testimony that once the latch was engaged, it would not disengage unless someone pulled the handle, regardless of the number of screws in place, were together sufficient to support those findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b734-7\">MeIlo testified that although he had had to replace the screws in the driver\u2019s side latch in the past, he had looked at the passenger door one month prior to the accident and was not aware of any problems with the latch mechanism. Although Clement knew that the latch plate was missing one of its three screws the night before the accident, he testified that it was capable of latching securely in that condition, a conclusion supported by the claimant\u2019s expert.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b734-8\">Given the administrative judge\u2019s well-founded findings of lack of culpable knowledge on the part of Clement and Mello, and lack of supervisory status on the part of Clement, her finding that the employee was ejected through the window is not essential to her denial of \u00a7 28 benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b735-7\">The unifying theme underlying most of these objections appears to be the claimant\u2019s counsel\u2019s impression that he was unfairly \u201cambushed\u201d at the hearing by a change or clarification in Clement\u2019s description of the accident to the effect that he did not see the door actually come open, which prompted Johnson to advance the theory that the employee was ejected through the window. However, the claimant\u2019s counsel brought out in his direct examination of Clement that Clement was not represented by either the insurer\u2019s or the employer\u2019s counsel. Moreover, the claimant\u2019s counsel did not request a continuance when confronted with Clement\u2019s testimony, and in fact had six months between Clement\u2019s testimony on the first day of the hearing and the close of evidence on the fourth day, in which to revise his trial strategy if necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
