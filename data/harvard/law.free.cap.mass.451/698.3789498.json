We conclude that the ambiguous record does not permit us to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>answer that question, but we also conclude that a remand of the case for clarification of the record is not possible, and that in the particular circumstances presented, a remand for a new arbitration proceeding would be inappropriate. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court confirming the arbitrator\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\"><em>Background. </em>This case has a long and tortuous procedural history. On December 29, 1999, the sheriff terminated Officer Joseph Upton from his position as a jail officer at the Nashua Street jail in Boston (jail). His discharge occurred after a disciplinary hearing within the sheriff\u2019s department, and was based on the disciplinary hearing officer\u2019s determination that Upton, while assigned to the medical unit of the jail on October 16, 1999, had witnessed an assault of an inmate \u2014 a nineteen year old man being held in custody awaiting trial \u2014 by two other jail officers; had filed untimely and then false reports concerning the October 16 assault incident; had also provided false information to the sheriff\u2019s investigative division during its investigation of that assault incident; and had failed properly to maintain the log book in the medical unit. Upton, represented by the union of which he is a member (union), grieved his termination under the provisions of the applicable collective bargaining agreement, and ultimately sought an arbitrator\u2019s review. After two days of hearings in November and December of 2000, the arbitrator issued his award on March 26, 2001. He found, inter alla, that the inmate housed in the medical unit where Upton was assigned had indeed been assaulted by other jail officers on October 16, 1999; that Upton had failed to maintain a proper log and to file an appropriate incident report about the October 16 assault; that he did not cooperate with the sheriff\u2019s investigation of the incident; and that he filed \u201cincomplete, misleading or false reports.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The arbitrator concluded that \u201cjust cause\u201d existed for Upton to be disciplined, but further ruled that Upton\u2019s discharge was revoked, and that Upton was to be suspended for a period of six months (without pay) and then reinstated with back pay and full benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The sheriff filed an appeal in the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>c. 150C, \u00a7 11, seeking to vacate the award on the ground that the order to reinstate Upton exceeded the arbitrator\u2019s authority because it was contrary to \u201cwell-defined public policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">On cross motions for summary judgment, a judge in the Superior Court granted the union\u2019s motion and confirmed the award. The sheriff appealed the confirmation to the Appeals Court, which affirmed the Superior Court judgment. <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County </em>v. <em>Jail Officers &amp; Employees of Suffolk County, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 915 (2004). Thereafter, we denied the sheriff\u2019s application for further appellate review without prejudice, and remanded the case to the Appeals Court for reconsideration in light of our decision in <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, </em>443 Mass. 813 (2005) <em>(Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n). </em>On remand, the Appeals Court again affirmed the Superior Court judgment confirming the arbitrator\u2019s award. <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County </em>v. <em>Jail Officers &amp; Employees of Suffolk County, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 903 (2007). We granted the sheriff\u2019s application for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>In accordance with the strong public policy favoring the arbitration of disputes, particularly in the context of collective bargaining agreements, this court (and courts generally) follows the rule that the arbitrator\u2019s decision should be upheld. <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, </em>443 Mass. at 818, and cases cited. At the same time, \u201c[w]e do not permit an arbitrator to order a party to engage in an action that offends strong public policy,\u201d <em>id., </em>and \u201c \u2018the question of public policy is ultimately one for resolution by the courts\u2019 and not by arbitrators.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Bureau of Special Investigations </em>v. <em>Coalition of Pub. Safety, </em>430 Mass. 601, 603 (2000). There is a three-pronged test we apply to determine whether public policy requires the court to vacate an arbitrator\u2019s award that has ordered the reinstatement of a public employee: (1) the public policy at issue \u201cmust be well defined and dominant,\u201d and determined from laws and legal precedents, not general considerations of the public interest, <em>Massachusetts Highway Dep\u2019t </em>v. <em>American Fed\u2019n of State, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number><em>County &amp; Mun. Employees, Council 93, </em>420 Mass. 13, 16 (1995) <em>(Mass. Highway), </em>quoting <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Local Union 759, Int\u2019l Union of United Rubber, Cork, Linoleum &amp; Plastic Workers, </em>461 U.S. 757, 766 (1983); (2) the \u201cdisfavored conduct\u201d under scrutiny must be \u201cintegral to the performance of employment duties,\u201d <em>Mass. Highway, supra </em>at 17, quoting <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n, Int\u2019l, </em>861 F.2d 665, 671 (11th Or. 1988), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 871 (1989); and (3) the employee\u2019s conduct, as found by the arbitrator, would have required dismissal, and \u201ca lesser sanction would frustrate public policy.\u201d <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 819. See <em>id. </em>at 818-819. See also <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>435 Mass. 54, 62-63 (2001), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1131 (2002); <em>Bureau of Special Investigations </em>v. <em>Coalition of Pub. Safety, supra </em>at 604-605.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">In <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>we vacated an arbitrator\u2019s award that had required the city of Boston to rescind its discharge of a police officer and to suspend the officer for one year. Our decision to vacate was based on our conclusion that in light of the specific factual findings of the arbitrator concerning the officer\u2019s misconduct, dismissal of the officer was required, as any lesser sanction would \u201cfrustrate strong public policy against the kind of egregious dishonesty and abuse of official position in which [the officer] was proved to have engaged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 814. The difficulty in this case is that the arbitrator\u2019s decision and the factual findings he makes are far from a model of clarity, and he omits to make specific findings on at least two significant points. In particular, while the arbitrator finds that two jail officers, one of whom was a lieutenant and therefore a superior officer, entered a detainee\u2019s cell and assaulted the detainee, causing him injury, and that Officer Upton, under the order of the lieutenant \u2014 an order that the arbitrator concludes Upton was required to obey \u2014 opened the detainee\u2019s cell door to let the two other jail officers in, the arbitrator does not make a finding about whether Upton actually witnessed the other officers\u2019 assault.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, the arbitrator concluded that Upton filed reports with the sheriff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>internal investigation officers that were incomplete <em>or </em>false <em>or </em>misleading, but does not attempt to distinguish among these three possibilities.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">In a situation where a jail officer actually witnesses fellow officers assault an individual who is held in the sheriff\u2019s custody, and then lies about this fact and files false reports that memorialize the falsity, we have little doubt that established public policy would condemn such conduct and would require the discharge of such an officer. As the Superior Court judge observed, \u201cIf the public policy of Massachusetts proscribes assaults by guards on the detainees committed to their custody \u2014 as it surely does[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] \u2014 then it must also proscribe the \u2018code of silence\u2019 whereby those committing such assaults are protected.\u201d This is so particularly where \u2014 as the sheriff argues occurred in this case \u2014 a false \u201chear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil\u201d approach taken by an officer materially impedes an official investigation of the incident and prevents the sheriff from implementing just discipline on the officers who committed the attack.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, in this case, we believe the arbitrator\u2019s findings are not sufficiently clear on what Officer Upton witnessed, or on the character of his reports and participation in the sheriff\u2019s investigation \u2014 that is, did he supply false information, or was he simply less than complete? In light of the other strong public policy at issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>here, the policy that favors arbitration, it would not be appropriate to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award based on possibly incorrect factual inferences we might draw from his ambiguous findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">It is obviously necessary to resolve this case. The events at issue here occurred almost nine years ago. We are not able to obtain supplemental findings from the arbitrator in this case (see note 5, <em>supra), </em>and we have been informed by the sheriff that if the court were to remand the matter for rehearing before a different arbitrator, the sheriff would be extremely hampered by the current unavailability of several critical witnesses.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In these particular circumstances, we conclude that in order to bring the matter to a final result, the judgment of the Superior Court confirming the original arbitrator\u2019s decision should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The arbitrator\u2019s findings are discussed in more detail <em>infra. </em>The lacunae in those findings are key to our disposition in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Upton was terminated in December, 1999. By the time of the arbitrator\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>award in March, 2001, more than six months had passed since Upton had been employed as a jail officer at the jail. The effect of the award, therefore, was to provide for Upton\u2019s immediate reinstatement and the receipt of back pay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The arbitrator states that two witnesses \u2014 the assaulted detainee Leonard Gibson, and another inmate of the jail \u2014 \u201cstated they observed Upton in the [medical unit\u2019s] Control Booth immediately after the two officers left Gibson\u2019s cell and that he was in a position to observe what occurred there.\u201d Reciting witness testimony is not the equivalent of a finding on the arbitrator\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>part, at least in the absence of an explicit indication that the arbitrator credited or accepted this testimony. See <em>Pizzino </em>v. Miller, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865, 868-869 n.7 (2004). See also <em>School Committee of Leominster </em>v. <em>Gallagher, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 195, 200 n.6 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b722-10\">Because we were not able to tell exactly what the arbitrator found, in an unpublished order issued after oral argument in this case we directed that the matter be remanded to the arbitrator for specific findings on the two points described here. Unfortunately, in the long interval between the arbitrator\u2019s award and our hearing this case \u2014 a period of seven years \u2014 the arbitrator has died, and therefore the order of remand cannot be carried out.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b722-11\">Cf. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Hartman, </em>413 Mass. 398, 403 (1992), quoting <em>DeShaney </em>v. <em>Winnebago County Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>489 U.S. 189, 199-200 (1989) (\u201cwhen the State takes a person into its custody and holds him there against his will, the Constitution imposes upon it a corresponding duty to assume some responsibility for his safety and general well-being,\u201d including adequate medical care).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b722-12\">To the extent the Appeals Court suggests that the coverup of a fellow officer\u2019s misconduct, as opposed to a coverup of one\u2019s own, would not call for severe discipline, see <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County </em>v. <em>Jail Officers &amp; Employees of Suffolk County, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 903, 905-906 (2007), we disagree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b723-7\">The sheriff suggests that we remand the case to be heard by a new arbitrator, but that we require that arbitrator to accept the original arbitrator\u2019s identifiable findings, and limit the new arbitrator to making findings on the two issues about which we are not clear, viz., whether Officer Upton actually witnessed the assault on the detainee (or was clearly in a position to do so), and whether he filed affirmatively false reports. This type of limitation on a new arbitrator seems unworkable and potentially unfair. We decline to accept the sheriff\u2019s suggestion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
