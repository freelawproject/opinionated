L. c. 123, \u00a7 12 <em>(b), </em>in connection with the temporary involuntary commitment of a person with mental illness. Robert Magrini, who has a schizoaffective disorder, was involuntarily restrained and temporarily committed, pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 12 (a) and <em>(b), </em>to a psychiatric unit of Newton-Wellesley Hospital (hospital) despite an order discharging him from that unit. Magrini previously had been restrained and temporarily committed to a psychiatric unit of the hospital, and had obtained a court order directing his discharge because the hospital did not, with respect to his initial temporary commitment, timely file a petition for his continued involuntary commitment pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8. Faced essentially with a recommitment and continued restraint on his liberty, Magrini requested an emergency hearing under G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 12 <em>(b). </em>The request was denied by a District Court judge. Pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 9 (a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mag-rini appealed to the Appellate Division of the District Court Department (Appellate Division), where a divided panel entered a decision and order dismissing his appeal. We granted Magri-ni\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We vacate the orders of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">1. <em>Statutory overview. </em>General Laws c. 123 pertains, as is relevant here, to the involuntary civil commitment of persons with mental illness. Section 12 of G. L. c. 123 addresses the emergency restraint and temporary commitment of persons with mental illness. Section \u00a7 12 (a) provides, in pertinent part, \u201c[a]ny physician who is licensed pursuant to [G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 2,] or qualified psychiatric nurse mental health clinical specialist authorized to practice as such under regulations promulgated pursuant to [G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 80S,] or a qualified psychologist licensed pursuant to [G. L. c. 112, \u00a7\u00a7 118-129], who after examining a person has reason to believe that failure to hospitalize such person would create a likelihood of serious harm by reason of mental illness may restrain or authorize the restraint of such person . . . .\u201d Once the person has been restrained, the licensed or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>qualified provider under \u00a7 12 <em>(a) </em>may \u201capply for the hospitalization of such person for a three day period at a public facility or at a private facility authorized for such purposes by the department [of mental health].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 12 (a). \u201cAn application for hospitalization shall state the reasons for the restraint of such person and any other relevant information which may assist the admitting physician or physicians.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Section \u00a7 12 <em>(b) </em>pertains to hospital admissions. It authorizes a \u201cdesignated\u201d physician temporarily to commit a person by admitting him \u201cimmediately after his reception\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to a facility \u201c[i]f the physician determines that failure to hospitalize such person would create[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] a likelihood of serious harm by reason of mental illness . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 12 (\u00bf), first par. The statute defines the term \u201c[l]ikelihood of serious harm\u201d as including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-6\">\u201c(1) a substantial risk of physical harm to the person himself as manifested by evidence of, threats of, or attempts at, suicide or serious bodily harm; (2) a substantial risk of physical harm to other persons as manifested by evidence of homicidal or other violent behavior or evidence that others are placed in reasonable fear of violent behavior and serious physical harm to them; or (3) a very substantial risk of physical impairment or injury to the person himself as manifested by evidence that such person\u2019s judgment is so affected that he is unable to protect himself in the community and that reasonable provision for his protection is not available in the community.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-7\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>The commitment authorized under \u00a7 12 <em>(b) </em>is temporary and may last only three days.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 12 <em>(d). </em>By the end of the three days, the statute requires the hospital to (1) discharge the person who had been involuntarily committed; (2) accept the person\u2019s application for a conditional voluntary admission<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>; or (3) file a petition for a continued commitment under \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8, which would be valid for a period of either six or twelve months.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8, 12 <em>(d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">In 2000, the Legislature amended \u00a7 12 <em>(b) </em>by adding the second and third paragraphs. See St. 2000, c. 249, \u00a7 6. These paragraphs afford certain protections to persons temporarily committed. On a person\u2019s admission, the hospital must inform the person that, on the person\u2019s request, it will notify the Committee for Public Counsel Services (CPCS) of the name and location of the person. G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 12 <em>(b), </em>second par. Unless the person waives the right to counsel, or has or desires private counsel, CPCS is then obligated to appoint an attorney for the person. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>The appointed attorney is required to \u201cmeet with the person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, the statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-5\">\u201cAny person admitted under the provisions of this subsection, who has reason to believe that such admission is the result of an abuse or misuse of the provisions of this subsection, may request, or request through counsel an emergency hearing in the district court in whose jurisdiction the facility is located, and unless a delay is requested by the person or through counsel, the district court shall hold such hearing on the day the request is filed with the court or not later than the next business day.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-6\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 12 <em>(b), </em>third par.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">2. <em>Background. </em>Magrini was first temporarily committed to the hospital under G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 12 <em>(b), </em>on Friday, June 9, 2006.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On Thursday, June 15, 2006, the hospital filed a petition, under G. L. c. 123, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8, for Magrini\u2019s continued involuntary commitment for a six-month period. A hearing on the petition was set for Tuesday, June 20, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">On Monday, June 19, Magrini moved to dismiss the petition on the ground that it had not been filed within three business days after his admission, as required by the statute, which would have been on or before Wednesday, June 14. A District Court judge allowed the motion and ordered Magrini discharged.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">On Monday, June 19, on receiving the order of discharge, the hospital proceeded to restrain and admit Magrini a second time pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 12 <em>(a) </em>and <em>(b). </em>The paperwork on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>this commitment was signed by the attending psychiatrist,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> fifteen minutes <em>before </em>the attending psychiatrist\u2019s note of discharge. During this time, Magrini remained in a locked psychiatric unit. Through his counsel, Magrini filed a request for an emergency hearing pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 12 <em>(b). </em>The request alleged unlawful detention, specifically citing a \u201cmisuse of \u00a7 12 (o) and \u00a7 12 <em>(b) </em>to effectively countermand a court order [of] discharge.\u201d On Tuesday, June 20, the judge who had acted on the plaintiff\u2019s motion to dismiss summarily denied Magrini\u2019s request. On Wednesday, June 21, Magrini agreed to a conditional voluntary admission pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 10. On Wednesday, June 28, Magrini filed an appeal from the judge\u2019s denial of his request for an emergency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">By a divided panel, the Appellate Division dismissed the appeal. Relying on a memorandum, dated February 23, 2007, and designated Transmittal No. 945, from the Chief Justice of the District Court Department to District Court judges and clerk-magistrates (transmittal 945), the Appellate Division concluded that the judge had discretion to permit an emergency hearing or to decline the request for a hearing based solely on the papers submitted. Although the Appellate Division stated that the \u201cbetter practice\u201d would be to hold an emergency hearing on request, it found that the hospital had acted in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Magrini appealed from the decision of the Appellate Division. As has been noted, we granted his application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">3. <em>Mootness. </em>Before Magrini filed his appeal from the order denying his request for an emergency hearing, he agreed to a conditional voluntary admission. In view of Magrini\u2019s conditional voluntary status, the order appealed from no longer has effect, and the appeal is moot. See <em>Acting Supt. of Bournewood Hosp. </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>431 Mass. 101, 103 (2000). However, \u201c[i]ssues involving the commitment and treatment of mentally ill persons are generally considered matters of public importance\u201d and present \u201cclassic examples\u201d of issues that are capable of repetition, yet evading review. <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Guardianship of Doe, </em>391 Mass. 614, 618 (1984). We note that, even if Magrini had not agreed to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>conditional voluntary admission, appellate review of the denial of his request for an emergency hearing would not have occurred prior to the expiration of his temporary commitment or prior to the filing of a petition by the hospital for his continued commitment under G. L. c. 123, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8. We therefore exercise our discretion and address the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">4. <em>Emergency hearing. </em>We are called in this appeal to interpret various aspects of the emergency hearing provision in G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 12 <em>(b), </em>third par., and, thus, are faced with questions of law. We first address the hospital\u2019s contention that the judge correctly denied Magrini\u2019s request for an emergency hearing because the basis Magrini cited to obtain an emergency hearing was outside the scope of G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 12 <em>(b). </em>The hospital relies on the following italicized language in the emergency hearing provision: \u201cAny person admitted under the provisions of this subsection, who has reason to believe that such admission is the result of an abuse or misuse <em>of the provisions of this subsection, </em>may request ... an emergency hearing\u201d (emphasis supplied). G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 12 <em>(b), </em>third par. Under the hospital\u2019s interpretation, a person is entitled to an emergency hearing only when the person alleges an abuse or misuse of one of the specifically enumerated rights set forth in \u00a7 12 <em>(b), </em>such as: the person\u2019s examination was not conducted by a designated physician, \u00a7 12 <em>(b), </em>first par.; the person\u2019s examination was not conducted in a timely manner, <em>id.; </em>the designated physician failed to apply the correct standard to admit the person, <em>id.; </em>the hospital did not inform the person of its obligation to notify CPCS, \u00a7 12 <em>(b), </em>second par.; the hospital did not notify CPCS of the person\u2019s admission, <em>id.; </em>CPCS failed to appoint an attorney for the person, <em>id.; </em>or the appointed attorney failed to meet with the person.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The hospital\u2019s reading of the emergency hearing provision is too narrow. That provision states that \u201c[a]ny person admitted\u201d has the right to request an emergency hearing in the appropriate District Court where he or she \u201chas reason to believe\u201d that the admission has occurred because of \u201can abuse or misuse\u201d of a \u00a7 12 <em>(b) </em>admission. That the emergency hearing provision provides any person admitted with the opportunity to be heard, and heard promptly, if the admission resulted from any abuse or misuse of a \u00a7 12 <em>(b) </em>admission is consistent with the obvious intent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>Legislature. While there are abuses or misuses that may occur based on the denial of one or more of the specifically enumerated rights provided in the first and second paragraphs of \u00a7 12 <em>(b), </em>the broad language serves as a catch-all provision to include other circumstances that have resulted in a wrongful \u00a7 12 <em>(b) </em>admission.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Our interpretation is consistent with the intent of the Legislature to extend further procedural protections to persons who, by virtue of their temporary involuntary commitment, are experiencing a \u201cmassive curtailment\u201d of their liberty. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nassar, </em>380 Mass. 908, 917 (1980), quoting <em>Lessard </em>v. <em>Schmidt, </em>349 F. Supp. 1078, 1093 (E.D. Wis. 1972). See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>435 Mass. 353, 360 (2001) (\u201cstatutory language should be given effect consistent with its plain meaning and in light of the aim of the Legislature unless to do so would achieve an illogical result\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Magrini\u2019s request for an emergency hearing unquestionably demonstrated a proper basis of a misuse or abuse contemplated under \u00a7 12 <em>(b), </em>third par., to warrant an emergency hearing. The hospital\u2019s conduct of effectuating a second \u00a7 12 <em>(b) </em>commitment rendered the order directing Magrini\u2019s discharge illusory.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The hospital never complied with the court order, and instead continued to confine Magrini against his will in a locked psychiatric unit. This caused Magrini to be involuntarily confined for eleven days without a hearing. Where Magrini was not afforded his statutory rights and was not permitted to be discharged in accordance with a court order, he clearly satisfied the minimal showing that his second \u00a7 12 <em>(b) </em>commitment resulted from a misuse or abuse under the \u00a7 12 <em>(b) </em>process.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>The hospital argues that, under the emergency hearing provision, when a person has sufficiently demonstrated a basis for a hearing, such hearing is directory and not mandatory. The operative language provides that \u201cunless a delay is requested by the person [who has been temporarily admitted] or through counsel, the district court <em>shall </em>hold such hearing on the day the request is filed with the court or not later than the next business day\u201d (emphasis supplied). G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 12 <em>(b), </em>third par. In view of the significant liberty interests at stake and our previous interpretations that the use of the term \u201cshall\u201d imports a mandatory or imperative obligation, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gross, </em>447 Mass. 691, 694 (2006), and cases cited, we conclude that, unless a request for an emergency hearing on its face is patently frivolous,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the obligation to hold an emergency hearing is mandatory. To ensure meaningful review and due process to a person whose liberty is then at stake, we further conclude that the person temporarily committed has the right to be present at the hearing and may be heard. The hearing, however, does not necessarily have to be an evidentiary one. The judge conducting the hearing will have the discretion to decide whether evidence should be required in light of the abuse or misuse alleged.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>The decision and order of the Appellate Division dismissing the appeal is vacated. The order of the District Court denying Magrini\u2019s request for an emergency hearing is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b798-6\">General Laws c. 123, \u00a7 9 (a), provides that \u201c[m]alters of law arising in commitment hearings . . . in a district court may be reviewed by the appellate division of the district courts in the same manner as the civil cases generally.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b799-8\">It is not disputed that the hospital is a \u201cfacility\u201d under G.
