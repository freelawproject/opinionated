L. c. 266, \u00a7 67 (\u00a7 67)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; fraud in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>procurement, in violation of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 67A; and conspiracy to commit larceny over $250, in violation of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 30. A Superior Court judge, in part, allowed the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, concluding that Massport, the entity in whose books the defendant is alleged to have made a false entry, does not constitute a \u201ccorporation\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 <em>67.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 34, as amended, 442 Mass. 1501 (2004), the judge reported the correctness of her order and the following question: \u201cMay the Commonwealth prosecute a defendant under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 67, for his falsification of Mass-port records?\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We answer the question in the affirmative and vacate the judge\u2019s order insofar as it allowed the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment charging him with violating \u00a7 <em>67.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The Commonwealth alleges the following facts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant is a long-time employee of Massport. At the time of his indictment, he was the assistant terminal manager at the Conley Container Terminal in the South Boston section of Boston. In that position, the defendant was responsible for preparing the weekly payroll records of the longshoreworkers who worked at the terminal. These records were then forwarded to Columbia Coastal, LLC, the company that directly paid the longshore-workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>The longshoreworkers were union members and were not employees of Massport or employees of the Commonwealth. Under their collective bargaining agreement, the longshore-workers received benefits based on the number of hours worked during the previous year. A greater number of hours worked, up to a maximum of 1,500 hours, would result in more comprehensive benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The defendant, as a Massport employee, altered a longshore-worker\u2019s payroll record so that it would be considered as the payroll record of the longshoreworker\u2019s son. Specifically, the defendant altered the payroll record by changing the last four digits of the longshoreworker\u2019s Social Security number to reflect the Social Security number of his son, who also was a longshoreworker. The alteration allowed the son to receive a higher level of benefits than he was entitled to receive based on the actual hours the son had worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">In allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment charging a violation of \u00a7 67, the judge decided that the reference in \u00a7 67 to the term \u201ccorporation\u201d was ambiguous because it did not specify whether it applied only to private corporations or to all entities defined as corporations. The judge concluded, based on the perceived ambiguity, that the rule of lenity required her to construe \u00a7 67 in the defendant\u2019s favor, making the term applicable only to private corporations. The indictment charging the defendant with a violation of \u00a7 67 was then dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">1. In a prosecution under \u00a7 67, the Commonwealth must prove that the defendant made, with intent to defraud, a false entry in the books of a \u201ccorporation.\u201d The statute does not define the term \u201ccorporation.\u201d Massport is a \u201cbody politic and corporate.\u201d See St. 1956, c. 465, \u00a7 2 (establishing \u201ca body politic and corporate to be known as the Massachusetts Port Authority\u201d). We conclude that the term \u201ccorporation\u201d in \u00a7 67 encompasses the entity Massport.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">We reach this conclusion for the following reasons. \u201cWhere the language of a statute is plain, it must be interpreted in accordance with the usual and natural meaning of the words.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rahim, </em>441 Mass. 273, 274 (2004), quoting <em>Gurley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 595, 598 (1973). \u201cIn particular, absent clear indication to the contrary, statutory language is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>to be given its \u2018ordinary lexical meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rahim, supra </em>at 275, quoting <em>Surrey </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., </em>384 Mass. 171, 176 (1981). We appropriately are not guided by a definition of the term \u201ccorporation\u201d contained in a law dictionary cited by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The plain and ordinary meaning of the term \u201ccorporation\u201d refers to \u201c[a] body that is granted a charter legally recognizing it as a separate legal entity having its own rights, privileges, and liabilities distinct from those of its members.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary 421 (3d ed. 1996) (primary definition). See Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 510 (1993) (primary definition of \u201ccorporation\u201d is \u201ca body of persons associated for some purpose\u201d); Webster\u2019s II New Riverside University Dictionary 313 (1984) (primary definition of \u201ccorporation\u201d is \u201c[a] body of persons granted a charter legally recognizing it as a separate entity having its own rights, privileges, and liabilities distinct from those of its members\u201d); American Heritage Dictionary 298 (1970) (defining \u201ccorporation\u201d principally as \u201c[a] body of persons granted a charter legally recognizing them as a separate entity having its own rights, privileges, and liabilities distinct from those of its members\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Common usage of the term is not restrictive and encompasses all types of corporations, without regard to the corporation\u2019s status as a private or public, profit or nonprofit, or business or charitable entity. See 1 W.M. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of Corporations \u00a7 49 (rev. ed. 2006) (\u201cCorporations may be classified in different ways. They may be classified with respect to their purposes into nonprofit corporations, public or private corporations, professional corporations, municipal corporations, religious corporations, educational corporations, charitable, beneficial or eleemosynary corporations, business corporations, stock and nonstock corporations . . . and others. Corporations also may be . . . foreign or domestic corporations, publicly-held or privately-held corporations, or close corporations.\u201d [Footnotes omitted]). The defendant\u2019s contention that the term \u201ccorporation\u201d is limited to private corporations<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> requires the addition of a qualification to the term that does not appear in \u00a7 67. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>not our function to rewrite a statute. See <em>Bulger </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>447 Mass. 651, 661 (2006), quoting <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Cargill, Inc., </em>429 Mass. 79, 82 (1999) (\u201cWhere, as here, the language of the statute is clear, it is the function of the judiciary to apply it, not amend it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">A reading of \u00a7 67 as a whole, see note 1, <em>supra, </em>supports our construction. See <em>Selectmen of Topsfield </em>v. <em>State Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>324 Mass. 309, 312-313 (1949) (explaining rule of statutory construction that one clause in statute is \u201cto be construed with reference to every other clause . . . without giving undue emphasis to any one group of words, so that, if reasonably possible, all parts shall be construed as consistent with each other so as to form a harmonious enactment\u201d). Section 67 first prohibits the fraudulent entry or omission in \u201cany book of [a] person, firm or corporation.\u201d The statute goes on to prohibit \u201cany person whose duty it is to make a record or entry of the transfer of stock, or of the issuing or cancelling of certificates thereof, or of the amount of stock issued by a corporation\u201d from fraudulently \u201comit[ting] to make a trac record or entry thereof\u201d in the corporation\u2019s books. This second clause makes criminal a discrete type of conduct committed by a specific category of persons against stock corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The reference to stock corporations in the second clause of \u00a7 67 could not have been intended to restrict application of the first clause to apply only to stock corporations. This interpretation would distort the plain meaning of the statute as a whole by placing undue emphasis on the second clause in derogation of the first clause and would tend to nullify the terms \u201cperson\u201d and \u201cfirm\u201d in the first clause because persons and firms, who keep books, do not issue stock. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>444 Mass. 324, 339 (2005). Further, such a narrow interpretation essentially would render superfluous the reference to \u201ccorporation\u201d in the first clause because many different types of corporations, such as nonprofit and charitable corporations, do not issue stock to their members. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dodge, </em>428 Mass. 860, 865 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">The defendant does not argue otherwise, but takes the reference to \u201cstock issued by a corporation\u201d in the second clause as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>an indication that \u00a7 67 has used the word \u201ccorporation\u201d throughout to refer only to private corporations. His contention is that, because only private corporations issue stock, consistency requires that every other reference to the word \u201ccorporation\u201d in \u00a7 67 be read to refer only to private corporations. The defendant\u2019s argument is not persuasive. As just discussed, it is evident that the word \u201ccorporation\u201d in the first clause of \u00a7 67 is not properly read as restricted to private stock corporations. Because the word \u201ccorporation\u201d was intended to have different meanings in these different clauses, there is nothing about the words of \u00a7 67 read as a whole or its structure that persuasively or logically leads to the conclusion that \u201ccorporation\u201d as used in the first clause could only be intended to signify a private corporation. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilaire, </em>437 Mass. 809, 815-816 (2002) (statute read as whole, and in its clear meaning, used word \u201ccourt\u201d to refer to \u201cjudge\u201d; use of \u201ccourt\u201d in portion of statute at issue therefore should be read to mean \u201cjudge,\u201d and not other court personnel).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Our conclusion gives the statute a sensible meaning by, in the first clause, protecting all types of corporations, as well as those dealing with corporations, from corporate insiders who make fraudulent entries on corporate books. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dodge, supra. </em>Experience demonstrates that public, charitable, and nonstock corporations are no less in danger of being victims of crimes under \u00a7 67 than private corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The defendant points out that Massport did not come into existence until one hundred years after \u00a7 67 was enacted, and nowhere in Massport\u2019s enabling statute, St. 1956, c. 465, does the word \u201ccorporation\u201d appear. Rather, as has been mentioned, Massport is referred to as a \u201cbody politic and corporate,\u201d a term generally used to describe municipal corporations, and, the defendant\u2019s argument continues, this court has usually construed the word \u201ccorporation\u201d in statutes as not including municipalities. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Woburn, </em>322 Mass. 634, 637 (1948); <em>Donohue </em>v. <em>Newburyport, </em>211 Mass. 561, 568 (1912). The argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The Legislature enacted \u00a7 67 in 1856. St. 1856, c. 123, \u00a7 3. In various editions of a contemporary Nineteenth Century dictionary, the term \u201ccorporation\u201d was primarily defined as \u201c[a] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>body politic or corporate, formed and authorized by law to act as a single person . . . .\u201d N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language 231 (1847). See also N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language 296 (1871) (defining \u201ccorporation\u201d as \u201c[a] body politic or corporate, formed and authorized by law to act as a single person, and endowed by law with the capacity of perpetual succession . . .\u201d); N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language 296 (1867) (same). As has been stated, the defendant does not dispute that Massport is a \u201cbody politic and corporate.\u201d See St. 1956, c. 465, \u00a7 2. See also <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>334 Mass. 721, 734, 735 (1956) (in substance, Massport as proposed \u201chas many important attributes of a corporation, and nothing other than a corporation would seem to satisfy the requirements of its being,\u201d but it is a public corporation). It is of no legal consequence that, in 1856, the Legislature could not have had Massport specifically in mind when enacting \u00a7 67, because Massport was not established until 1956. The meaning of the term \u201ccorporation\u201d was not cast in stone as encompassing only those corporate entities, including bodies politic and corporate, in existence in 1856. See <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>438 Mass. 282, 285 (2002). Such an interpretation would border on the nonsensical and overlook the principle that statutes prospectively cover entities and events that fairly fall within the scope of their language.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">There also is no merit to the defendant\u2019s contention that our construction would mean necessarily that \u00a7 67 applies to municipalities. That issue is not before us, but a few observations are helpful to the larger picture. While we have stated from time to time that Massport, as a body politic and corporate, is \u201canalogous\u201d to a municipal corporation, see <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>334 Mass. 713, 724, 735 (1953), material differences exist between entities such as Massport and municipal corporations. See <em>Kargman </em>v. <em>Boston Water &amp; Sewer Comm\u2019n, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 51, 56-57 (1984).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Entities such as Massport are \u201c \u2018hybrid[s],\u2019 possessing attributes of both <em>private corpora-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number><em>tians </em>and governmental entities,\u201d requiring courts to resolve \u201con a case by case basis whether a particular body politic and corporate should be treated as \u2018more public than private\u2019 \u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Id. </em>at 55, quoting <em>Department of Community Affairs </em>v. <em>Massachusetts State College Bldg. Auth., </em>378 Mass. 418, 425 (1979). Municipal corporations lack hybrid characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The defendant further argues that the Legislature has manifested its understanding that \u00a7 67 does not apply to a public corporation such as Massport by enacting G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 67A, a statute that specifically punishes the making of false or fraudulent statements and writings by anyone engaged in the procurement of services, supplies, and construction \u201cwithin the jurisdiction of\u201d a public agency or \u201cpublic instrumentality of the Commonwealth.\u2019\u2019<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the defendant\u2019s view, \u00a7\u00a7 67 and 67A substantially overlap in the acts they prohibit, and the Legislature would not have enacted \u00a7 67A if it understood \u00a7 67 to apply to public instrumentalities such as Massport. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, however, fraud in the procurement of supplies and services connected with public agencies represents a very different wrong from the making of false entries in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>corporate entity\u2019s books or records; the statutes do not target the same misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The defendant\u2019s remaining arguments lack merit and need not be specifically addressed. We conclude that the term \u201ccorporation\u201d as used in \u00a7 67 includes a public or quasi public corporation such as Massport, and because \u00a7 67 is sufficiently unambiguous, the rule of lenity has no application. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roucoulet, </em>413 Mass. 647, 652-653 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">2. The reported question is answered in the affirmative. That part of the judge\u2019s order dismissing the indictment against the defendant alleging a violation of \u00a7 67 is vacated. A new order, denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment alleging a violation of \u00a7 67, shall enter consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b619-15\">General Laws c. 266, \u00a7 67 (\u00a7 67), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-16\">\u201cAn officer of a corporation or an agent, clerk or servant of a person, firm or corporation who makes a false entry or omits to make a true entry in any book of such person, firm or corporation, with intent to defraud, and any person whose duty it is to make a record or entry of the transfer of stock, or of the issuing or cancelling of certificates thereof, or of the amount of stock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>issued by a corporation, in any book thereof, who, with intent to defraud, omits to make a true record or entry thereof, shall be punished by imprisonment in the [S]tote prison for not more than ten years or in the house of correction for not more than one year.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictments charging violations of G.
