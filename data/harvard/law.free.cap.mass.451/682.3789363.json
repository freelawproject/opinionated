L. c. 215, \u00a7 13, and Mass. R. Civ. P. 64, as amended, 423 Mass. 1410 (1996), a judge in the Probate and Family Court reserved and reported the question whether a judge of that court has authority under G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 9,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to enter an initial award of child support, for the benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>of a nonmarital<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> child, after the death of the obligor, the child\u2019s father. We transferred the report here on our own motion, and answer the question in the affirmative with the qualifications noted herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The background of the case is as follows. J.M.M. and L.M. had a nonmarital relationship prior to 1992, ending in July, 1998. During this relationship, on October, 17, 1992, a child whom we shall call Jaclyn was born. J.M.M. is named as Jaclyn\u2019s father on her birth certificate. In 1993, J.M.M. and L.M. executed a voluntary acknowledgment of parentage that they filed with the registry of vital statistics pursuant to G. L. c. 46. See G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Although J.M.M. eventually married someone other than L.M. and had two daughters from that marriage, he maintained a good relationship with Jaclyn. Jaclyn had a positive relationship with her two half-sisters and J.M.M.\u2019s wife. After his marriage, J.M.M. continued to support Jaclyn financially. He volun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>tarily paid fifty dollars a week to L.M. in child support and yearly tuition for her private school, as well as all associated expenses such as uniforms, supplies, and fees. J.M.M. paid the costs of Jaclyn\u2019s extracurricular activities, which included guitar, ice skating, and horseback riding lessons. J.M.M. maintained Jaclyn on his health insurance policy, paid the copayments for medical appointments, and paid for her optical and dental care. In 2005, J.M.M.\u2019s support-related payments for Jaclyn totaled approximately $19,795.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">In 2003, J.M.M. executed a will in which he named Jaclyn as one of his children. In his will, J.M.M. bequeathed all of his assets to his wife. J.M.M., however, named Jaclyn as a residual legatee along with his other children, with distributions to be made to them in equal shares. J.M.M. named the defendant, his father-in-law, as his executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">On April 1, 2006, J.M.M. died in an automobile accident. L.M. has not received any support payments for Jaclyn since J.M.M.\u2019s death.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> No complaint for child support under G. L. c. 209C was ever filed prior to J.MM.\u2019s death due to his voluntary support of Jaclyn.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">After being appointed Jaclyn\u2019s guardian, L.M. timely filed a complaint in the Probate and Family Court against the defendant under G. L. c. 209C, seeking orders establishing paternity and providing for the payment of child support. See G. L. c. 190, \u00a7 7<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>; G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 9.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant moved to dismiss the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>complaint, arguing that, where there had never been an order of child support entered against J.M.M. during his lifetime under G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 9, the judge lacked authority to enter an initial award of child support after J.M.M.\u2019s death (which would then be enforceable against JMJM.\u2019s estate). The judge disagreed and denied the motion. The judge then entered an order deferring action on pending motions made by L.M., and entered her reservation and report.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">1. We have previously held that an order of child support, for the benefit of a nonmarital child, <em>made during the obligor\u2019s life </em>may survive the obligor\u2019s death and be enforced against his estate. <em>L.W.K. </em>v. <em>E.R.C., </em>432 Mass. 438, 443-448 (2000).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We have not decided, however, whether an <em>initial </em>order of child support for a nonmarital child may enter <em>after </em>the death of the obligor and be enforceable against his estate. We conclude that, where paternity is not disputed (as is the case here), the policy mandates of the Legislature concerning support and protection of nonmarital children permit the entry and enforcement of such order.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The considerations comprehensively discussed in <em>L.W.K. </em>v. <em>E.R.C., supra </em>at 442-448, including exceptions to testamentary freedom, legislative changes increasing protection for children, explicit legislative mandates concerning child support, public policy concerns, and prevailing contemporary legal authority, apply equally here. Of paramount importance to our conclusion is the existence of the continuing obligation of parents to support their children. The law has long imposed \u201ca duty on parents \u2018to support, provide for and protect the children they bring forth\u2019 (at least those children brought forth in a traditional family context).\u201d <em>T.F. </em>v. <em>B.L., </em>442 Mass. 522, 538 n.2 (2004) (Greaney, J., concur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>ring in part and dissenting in part), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brasher, </em>359 Mass. 550, 556 (1971). See <em>Taverna </em>v. <em>Pizzi, </em>430 Mass. 882, 884 (2000). The Legislature has set forth this duty in \u201cunmistakable terms,\u201d stating: \u201cIt is the public policy of the commonwealth that dependent children shall be maintained, as completely as possible, from the resources of their parents thereby relieving or avoiding, at least in part, the burden borne by the citizens of the commonwealth.\u201d <em>L.W.K. </em>v. <em>E.R.C., supra </em>at 444, quoting G. L. c. 119A, \u00a7 1. To \u201ceffectuate\u201d that public policy, the Legislature has declared that the statutes concerning child support enforcement \u201cshall be liberally construed.\u201d <em>L.W.K. </em>v. <em>E.R.C., supra, </em>quoting G. L. c. 119A, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The Legislature has extended the provision of child support to children who have not been bom (or who do not remain) in a traditional family context. Indeed, the protection of nonmarital children, as well as children of divorced parents, \u201chas been a hallmark of legislative action and of the jurisprudence of this court.\u201d <em>L.W.K. </em>v. <em>E.R.C., supra </em>at 448. With respect to the provision of child support for nonmarital children, the Legislature expressly has mandated, by enacting G. L. c. 209C,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that such children be supported by their biological parents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">\u201cChildren bom to parents who are not married to each other shall be entitled to the same rights and protections of the law as all other children. It is the purpose of this chapter to establish a means for such children either to be acknowledged by their parents voluntarily or, on complaint by one or the other of their parents ... to have an acknowledgment or adjudication of their paternity, <em>to have an order for their support </em>and to have a declaration relative to their custody or visitation rights ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction. . . . <em>Every person is responsible for the support of his child born out of wedlock </em>from its birth up to the age of eighteen, or, where such child is domiciled in the home of a parent and principally dependent upon said parent for maintenance, to age twenty-one. <em>Each person charged with support under this section shall be required to furnish support </em>according to his financial abil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>ity and earning capacity pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">That one parent of a nonmarital child may forgo petitioning the court for an order of support under G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 9, from the other parent, who undisputedly is a \u201cperson charged with support\u201d under \u00a7 1, does not negate the status of the other parent as continually being a \u201cperson charged with support.\u201d A parent may choose to avoid seeking a court order for support pursuant to \u00a7 9 for a variety of reasons, such as financial limitations or finding resort to court intervention unnecessary because the other parent voluntarily has been supporting the nonmarital child. What remains constant, in the circumstances of either the presence or absence of an actual order of support, is the obligation of a parent to provide support and a child\u2019s continued need for that support. A child\u2019s needs do not end with the death of a parent who has been providing support. Thus, our conclusion comports with an additional important public policy furthered by the child support scheme, namely, the provision for the best interests of children. <em>Department of Revenue </em>v. <em>Mason M., </em>439 Mass. 665, 674-675 (2003). It also is consistent with the Legislature\u2019s imperative to abolish discriminatory treatment (at least by statute) toward nonmarital children. See G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 1 (stating nonmarital children \u201cshall be entitled to the same rights and protections of the law as all other children\u201d); <em>Goodridge </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>440 Mass. 309, 325 (2003) (noting \u201cCommonwealth\u2019s strong public policy to abolish legal distinctions between marital and nonmarital children in providing for the support and care of minors\u201d); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 590, 592 (1987) (pointing out that discriminatory treatment of nonmarital children in matters of support, intestate succession, and remedies in domestic relations controversies usually will result in an unconstitutional denial of equal protection). See also <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Barba, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 322, 323 (1994) (concluding that Probate and Family Court judge could modify child support provisions of judgment of divorce after death of obligor). As noted in <em>L.W.K. </em>v. <em>E.R.C., supra </em>at 443 n.15, unlike marital children, nonmarital children cannot benefit from spousal elective share legislation when an obligor dies.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>While many courts have decided the issue presented in <em>L.W.K. </em>v. <em>E.R.C., supra, </em>see 2 H.H. Clark, Jr., Domestic Relations in the United States \u00a7 18.2, at 377-378 (2d ed. 1987), it does not appear that many courts have passed on the narrow issue presented in this case. At least one other State appellate court, however, has held that its State\u2019s statutory scheme and legal precedents did not, on an obligor\u2019s death, bar the entry of a postmortem order of child support against the obligor\u2019s estate. See <em>Matter of the Estate of Delara, </em>131 N.M. 430, 433 (Ct. App. 2001). Although the nature and form of the \u201cobligation\u201d to support a child, and the timing of the imposition of such \u201cobligation,\u201d has not been specifically addressed, contemporary legal authority supports, in general terms, the enforcement of an \u201cobligation\u201d to pay child support after the obligor\u2019s death. See American Law Institute\u2019s (ALI) Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution: Analysis and Recommendations \u00a7 3.25 (2002).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See also 2 H.H. Clark, Jr., Domestic Relations in the United States, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 18.2, at 379 (suggesting that determinative factors include \u201cwhat equity and fairness demand at the time of the obligor\u2019s death, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing\u201d). The Legislature has adopted the same view. See <em>L.W.K. </em>v. <em>E.R.C., supra </em>at 445. Under the Child Support Enforcement Act, an \u201c[ojbligor\u201d is defined as \u201can individual, or <em>the estate of a decedent, who owes or may owe a duty of support, </em>or who is hable under a child support obligation, or who is alleged, by sworn statement, to be the parent of a child to whom a duty of support is owed\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 119A, \u00a7 1A. The italicized language \u201cplainly suggests] that the Legislature intended liability for child support obligations to survive the death of a parent.\u201d <em>L.W.K. </em>v. <em>E.R.C., supra. </em>So also is the implication contained in G. L. c. 190, \u00a7 7, see note 8, <em>supra. </em>To limit enforcement of a child support obligation to only those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>taking the form of a preexisting legal order would have the potential of adversely affecting the financial stability of children and would discourage parents from attempting to resolve support issues amicably and without resort to court intervention, the latter of which can fast consume one\u2019s resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">2. We conclude that the judge\u2019s question, as reported, must be answered as follows: Where paternity is not disputed, the unequivocal policy mandates of the Legislature concerning the support and protection of nonmarital children, permit a Probate and Family Court judge to enter (and subsequently enforce) an initial award of child support for a nonmarital child after the death of the obligor. In fashioning such an order, the judge must take into account, by means of a credit to JM.M.\u2019s estate, the Social Security survivor benefits, life insurance proceeds, and any other payments or benefits Jaclyn has, or will, receive.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>L.W.K. </em>v. <em>E.R.C., supra </em>at 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b702-16\">General Laws c. 209C, \u00a7 9 (a), addresses orders for child support in paternity actions.
