L. c. 93A (count three). The defendant filed a special motion to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s complaint pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, commonly known as the \u201canti-SLAPP\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> law. The special motion was denied by a judge in the Superior Court. The defendant appealed from that denial, and we transferred the case here on our own motion. See <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>436 Mass. 517, 520-522 (2002), <em>S.C., </em>441 Mass. 9 (2004) (allowing interlocutory appeal from denial of motion to dismiss under \u00a7 59H). We conclude that the denial of the special motion to dismiss with respect to count three of the complaint was proper, but that the special motion to dismiss should have been allowed as to counts one and two. Our reasoning is as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-12\">1. The record reveals a plethora of factual disputes. The parties appear to agree, however, on the facts material to this appeal, which we now set forth. The defendant represented the plaintiff on various legal matters over the course of eight years. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>In January, 2005, the plaintiff gave the defendant a check for $10,000 as payment for legal services performed in 2003. When the defendant attempted to deposit the check in his bank account, the check was returned to the defendant with the notation \u201cNSF [insufficient funds].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">On January 12, 2006, the defendant sent the plaintiff a formal written demand for payment by certified mail, which was returned because it was not claimed by the plaintiff. On February 3, the defendant had the formal written demand delivered by hand to the plaintiff. In the letter, the defendant notified the plaintiff of his intent to apply for criminal charges against him if he (the plaintiff) failed to provide payment as promised. On February 8, the plaintiff responded by informing the defendant that he intended to assert claims of malpractice against the defendant. Two days later, the defendant filed an application for a criminal complaint, pursuant to G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 35A, in the Dedham Division of the District Court Department, against the plaintiff for larceny by check, G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 37.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s application was considered by a clerk-magistrate of the District Court, who, after an evidentiary hearing, determined that there was no probable cause for the complaint to issue and denied the application.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">On July 14, 2006, the plaintiff filed a complaint in the Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Court asserting claims against the defendant for malicious prosecution and abuse of process. The opening paragraph of the complaint states that the claims therein \u201caris[e] out of a criminal claim brought in the Dedham District Court.\u201d The plaintiff later amended the complaint to add a third claim for violations of G. L. c. 93A. We now consider the merits of the defendant\u2019s special motion to dismiss the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">2. General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 59H,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cprotects the \u2018exercise of [the] right of petition under the constitution of the United States or of the [Commonwealth,\u2019 by creating a procedural mechanism, in the form of a special motion to dismiss, for the expedient resolution\u201d of suits designed to deter or retaliate against individuals who seek to exercise their right of petition. <em>Office One, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>437 Mass. 113, 121 (2002). A SLAPP suit generally has no merit; the plaintiff\u2019s objective is not to win, but to \u201cuse litigation to intimidate opponents\u2019 exercise of rights of petitioning and speech,\u201d and \u201cto deter common citizens from exercising their political or legal rights or to punish them for doing so.\u201d <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., </em>427 Mass. 156, 161-162 (1998), quoting <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>27 Cal. App. 4th 809, 816-817 (1994). The statutory definition of \u201ca party\u2019s exercise of its right of petition\u201d includes \u201cany written or oral statement made before or submitted to a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other governmental proceeding.\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. \u201cThe typical mischief that the legislation intended to remedy was lawsuits directed at individual citizens of modest means for speaking publicly against development pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>jects.\u201d <em>Office One, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lopez, supra </em>at 121-122, quoting <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., supra. </em>Although many States require that the petitioning activity involve a matter of public concern, as a prerequisite to invoking the protection of their own anti-SLAPP statute, the \u201cpublic concern\u201d element is not part of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. See <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., supra </em>at 163-164 &amp; n.12. See also <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>434 Mass. 543, 548-549 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">The burden-shifting procedure governing an anti-SLAPP motion is established. See <em>Cadle Co. </em>v. <em>Schlichtmann, </em>448 Mass. 242, 249 (2007); <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>436 Mass. 517, 520 (2002); <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, supra </em>at 544, 551-552; <em>McLarnon </em>v. <em>Jokisch, </em>431 Mass. 343, 348-349 (2000); <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., supra </em>at 167-168. We briefly outline that procedure. As a threshold matter, the party seeking dismissal (the defendant) must demonstrate, through pleadings and affidavits, that the plaintiff\u2019s claims are based on \u201cpetitioning activities alone and have no substantial basis other than or in addition to the petitioning activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If this showing is not made, the special motion must be denied. If the showing is made, then the burden shifts to the nonmoving party (the plaintiff) to demonstrate, again by pleadings and affidavits, that the moving party\u2019s petitioning activities were \u201cdevoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law\u201d and the petitioning activities \u201ccaused actual injury to the responding party.\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. If these showings are made, by a preponderance of the evidence, then the special motion to dismiss must be denied. If that standard is not met for one or both elements, the special motion to dismiss must be allowed. See <em>Cadle Co. </em>v. <em>Schlichtmann, supra; Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, supra </em>at 522-524; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, supra; McLarnon </em>v. <em>Jokisch, supra </em>at 348-349.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">3. Applying these principles to counts one and two of the plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint, it is beyond doubt that the defendant has met his initial burden of proving that the only conduct complained of is petitioning activity. See <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, supra </em>at 524. As has been stated, the plaintiff explicitly states in his amended complaint that his claims \u201caris[e] out of a criminal claim brought in the Dedham District Court.\u201d Although the factual allegations of the amended complaint that followed include grievances other than the filing of the criminal complaint application, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>those grievances pertain to the defendant\u2019s misconduct in the performance of professional services to the plaintiff, the subject matter of the plaintiff\u2019s claim under G. L. c. 93A in count three, and they have no apparent relationship to the malicious prosecution and abuse of process claims. It then falls to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the defendant\u2019s petitioning activity is devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law. He has not met this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">A person is guilty of attempted larceny under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 37, when he, \u201cwith intent to defraud, makes, draws, utters or delivers any check ... for the payment of money upon any bank . . . with knowledge that the maker or drawer has not sufficient funds or credit at such bank ... for the payment of such instrument,\u201d and is guilty of larceny \u201cif money or property or services are obtained thereby.\u201d The statute further provides that \u201cthe making, drawing, uttering or delivery of such a check . . . shall be prima facie evidence of intent to defraud and of knowledge of insufficient funds,\u201d unless payment is made for the amount due (together with costs incurred) within two days after receiving notice that the check was returned for insufficient funds. G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 37. The defendant\u2019s version of events indicates that he informed the plaintiff that the plaintiff\u2019s check had \u201cbounced,\u201d and the plaintiff promised to deliver a new check. The replacement check, however, was never forthcoming. The plaintiff, on the other hand, denies knowing that the check was dishonored by his bank until he received notice of the defendant\u2019s intention to seek a criminal complaint. (He acknowledges knowing, however, that the check was never cashed.) The plaintiff\u2019s attorney conceded at the District Court hearing that the defendant \u201cclearly thought,\u201d at the time the application for the criminal complaint was filed and, until informed otherwise during the hearing, that the plaintiff\u2019s check had been returned for insufficient funds. There is a sufficient basis in the record, therefore, to allow a reasonable conclusion (albeit, perhaps, misinformed) on the defendant\u2019s part that the plaintiff\u2019s conduct had satisfied the elements of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 37, for attempted larceny, and that there was \u201cprima facie evidence of [the plaintiff\u2019s] intent to defraud and of knowledge of insufficient funds.\u201d The defendant thus had a factual basis for filing the application for a criminal complaint against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Addressing the legal basis for the application, the Superior Court judge reasoned that the knowing passing of a \u201cbad check\u201d does not, by itself, constitute the crime of larceny or attempted larceny. For a crime to occur, the judge further reasoned, one must obtain, or attempt to obtain, something of value by means of delivering the bad check. The judge concluded that because the check in this case was in payment for past services, the transaction did not involve an effort to obtain something of value, and because the defendant (an attorney) should have known this, the complaint had no arguable legal basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">While some aspects of the judge\u2019s reasoning are undoubtedly correct, the analysis is not. The critical determination is not whether the petitioning activity in question will be successful, but whether it contains any reasonable factual or legal merit at all. We have noted that in the context of an anti-SLAPP motion, to demonstrate that a claim is devoid of any arguable basis in law, \u201c[i]t is not enough for [the plaintiff] to show that [the defendant\u2019s] alleged petitioning activity . . . was based on an error of law; he must show that no reasonable person could conclude that there was [a basis in law] for [the petitioning activity].\u201d <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, supra </em>at 555 n.20. We are aware of no Massachusetts cases holding that to make out a claim for attempted larceny under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 37, based on a bad check, the complainant must demonstrate that the putative defendant was attempting to obtain something of value, and that past professional services do not qualify. That the complaint ultimately did not issue is not dispositive of the issue whether the anti-SLAPP statute protects the defendant\u2019s conduct. See <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 595, 600 (2000).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> With no definitive law on whether past services can constitute a basis for seeking a larceny complaint under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 37, and in light of the instruction just quoted in the <em>Baker </em>decision, the plaintiff has not shown that the defendant\u2019s petitioning activity lacked an arguable basis in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>The plaintiff\u2019s essential position is that the defendant\u2019s application for a criminal complaint was baseless and reckless and filed in \u201ca transparent attempt to collect a debt.\u201d The plaintiff points out that the defendant brought the criminal allegations against him two days after being put on notice of potential legal malpractice claims and posits that such abuse of the judicial system is of particular concern where the defendant himself is an attorney. The plaintiff\u2019s expressions of umbrage at the defendant\u2019s professional ethics, or lack thereof, are not determinative. Although we may dislike or disfavor an attorney\u2019s choice to seek a criminal complaint against a former client in an attempt to collect payment for past services, we cannot deny any citizen the constitutional right to petition the courts to seek legal redress. We conclude that counts one and two of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint may not go forward.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s G. L. c. 93A claim, however, is a different matter. That claim alleges, generally, that the defendant was negligent, committed legal malpractice, and breached fiduciary duties owed to the plaintiff in connection with his legal services. The plaintiff\u2019s complaint lists more specific allegations as well; we repeat but a few. According to the plaintiff, the defendant \u201cmade repeated misrepresentations, false statements, and engaged in misconduct calculated to cause damage to [the plaintiff]\u201d; \u201cfailed to provide a reasonable and necessary explanation of the legal matters in which [the plaintiff] was involved necessary to permit him to make informed decisions regarding the representation\u201d; \u201ccharged and collected an illegal [or] clearly excessive fee\u201d; \u201cregularly represented [the plaintiff] and failed to communicate to [the plaintiff] in writing before or within a reasonable time after commencing the representation the basis of the fee to be charged and the services to be provided\u201d; \u201cfailed to keep individual client records and, upon information and belief, misrepresented and deceived [the plaintiff] in the amount, the time spent, the services rendered, and the cost of said service, in order to intentionally deceive [the plaintiff] in paying greater legal fees than the [defendant was allowed to charge pursuant to the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">The defendant asserts that the plaintiff\u2019s G. L. c. 93A claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>involves \u201cunsubstantiated factual and legal issues\u201d and that the plaintiff filed this claim not for the purpose of winning the case, but to retaliate against the defendant. The defendant further asserts that \u201c[m]pst of the conduct alleged is not even actionable\u201d and that this is an instance of \u201csham litigation.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These assertions may be true, and the plaintiff\u2019s claim may not proceed far before being dismissed on other grounds. It is unclear whether the plaintiff brings his claim under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, or under \u00a7 11.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is clear, however, that the laundry list of alleged grievances enumerated in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint include a multitude of matters, claims, and disputes independent of the defendant\u2019s application for a criminal complaint on the dishonored check, thereby removing the G. L. c. 93A claim from the strictures of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. As a consequence, the defendant\u2019s special motion to dismiss as to the G. L. c. 93A claim was properly denied.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">4. The order denying the defendant\u2019s special motion to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s complaint is vacated. A new order is to enter allowing the special motion to dismiss as to counts one and two of the amended complaint, and denying the motion to dismiss as to count three of that complaint. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b22-13\">\u201cSLAPP\u201d is an acronym for \u201cstrategic litigation against public participation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b23-7\">For purposes of this case, we accept the plaintiff\u2019s explanation that the bank\u2019s notation was in error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b23-8\">General Laws c. 266, \u00a7 37, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-9\">\u201cWhoever, with intent to defraud, makes, draws, utters or delivers any check ... for the payment of money upon any bank . . . with knowledge that the maker or drawer has not sufficient funds or credit at such bank ... for the payment of such instrument, although no express representation is made in reference thereto, shall be guilty of attempted larceny, and if money or property or services are obtained thereby shall be guilty of larceny.
