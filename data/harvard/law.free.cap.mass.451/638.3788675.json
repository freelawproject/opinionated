L. c. 21E, eventually spending more than $800,000 in the effort. At issue in this case is the trustees\u2019 endeavor to recover the costs incurred in carrying out this response from the several entities that successively leased the property between 1963 and 1988, as well as from corporate parents of some of those entities. The trustees commenced this action in the Superior Court to accomplish the cost recovery; their claims under G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4, as well as a contract-based claim, were tried to a jury, and the trial judge thereafter tried jury-waived the various parties\u2019 claims to attorney\u2019s fees and costs under G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7\u00a7 4A and 15. We conclude that, pursuant to the jury\u2019s verdict, the trustees are entitled to recover their response costs under G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4, and also in connection with their contract claim<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>; and that they are entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under c. 21E, \u00a7 15. We also conclude that none of the defendants is entitled to recover its litigation-related attorney\u2019s fees and costs under c. 21E, \u00a7 4A (/). We affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment entered in the Superior Court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">1. <em>Background. </em>What follows is a brief summary of the factual background of the case and the proceedings in the Superior Court<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>; further details concerning the facts and prior proceedings are discussed in connection with particular issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>The trust is the owner of an eleven-acre property on Lincoln Street in Waltham (the site, or the property). The entire beneficial interest of the trust is owned by the Middlesex Mutual Building Trust (MMBT). The trust leased the property seriatim to a number of different entities between 1963 and 1988 under the same lease agreement, which was dated August 2, 1963 (lease). At the outset of the lease term, the trustees built a two-story manufacturing facility on the site in accordance with the specifications of the original tenant, the Jarrell Ash Company (JAC), and during the twenty-five years the lease was in effect, the successive lessees manufactured scientific instruments on the site. The lease included a provision requiring the lessee to indemnify the trust from liabilities arising from the lessee\u2019s use of or activities on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">a. <em>Corporate history. </em>The various entities that operated on the site present a complicated corporate history. The first tenant, JAC, occupied and used the site from the commencement of the lease in August, 1963, to some time in 1968. In that year, JAC sold some of its assets to Fisher Scientific Company, a Pennsylvania corporation (Fisher Pennsylvania). Fisher Pennsylvania assumed the lease pursuant to a written assignment, and took over manufacturing at the site. In 1981, Fisher Pennsylvania was acquired by Allied Corporation (Allied).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Allied formed a Delaware subsidiary and merged Fisher Pennsylvania into it, and the subsidiary then changed its name to Fisher Scientific Company (Fisher Delaware). In 1984, Fisher Delaware merged with Instrumentation Laboratory Inc. (IL Inc.). The new combined entity was renamed Allied Health &amp; Scientific Products Company (AHSPC), and it remained a subsidiary of Allied. AHSPC continued to manufacture scientific equipment on the site.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">In 1986, AHSPC sold its Jarrell Ash scientific instrumentation manufacturing business to Thermo Jarrell Ash Corporation (TJA),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> a subsidiary of Thermo Electron Corporation (Thermo Electron) that was created for purposes of completing the sale. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>AHSPC then assigned its interest in the 1963 lease to TJA. The asset purchase and closing agreement between AHSPC and TJA included an indemnification provision that allowed TJA to pass on to AHSPC any liability resulting from AHSPC\u2019s tenancy on the site. Shortly after the asset sale between AHSPC and TJA took place, AHSPC changed its name to Fisher Scientific Company (Fisher Delaware II), which remained a subsidiary of Allied.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">In 1988, TJA signed a lease termination agreement (1988 agreement, or agreement) with the trustees that contained an indemnification provision in favor of the trustees. In the same year, TCE was discovered on the site. In 1991, Fisher Delaware II formed a subsidiary called Instrumentation Laboratory Company (IL Co.), which was sold later that year. Before the sale, Fisher Delaware II (formerly AHSPC) assigned to IL Co. the indemnity obligation that it owed to TJA under the 1986 asset sale agreement between AHSPC and TJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">b. <em>Discovery of TCE and ensuing response action. </em>In 1985, the trust\u2019s beneficial owner, MMBT, commissioned an environmental consulting firm, Haley &amp; Aldrich, to conduct a preliminary site investigation at the property. The investigation revealed some broken sewer lines, as well as past discharges of chemicals into the floor drains, but it did not uncover any evidence of a discharge of chemicals into the ground. In 1987, MMBT commissioned Haley &amp; Aldrich to conduct an additional investigation of the site, and the 1988 report of that work concluded that TCE was present in groundwater at the site in concentrations above recommended levels. As the owners of the property and therefore a hable party under G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 5 <em>(a) </em>(2), the trustees undertook a response action on the site pursuant to G. L. c. 2 IE, \u00a7 4. The response was not completed until 2000. The twelve-year effort spanned both the promulgation of the Massachusetts Contingency Plan in October, 1988, see 310 Code Mass. Regs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>\u00a7 40.006 (1988), and its revision in 1993, see 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 40.0005 (1995). The trust eventually spent more than $800,000 in consultant fees, drilling, and laboratory costs, including approximately $90,000 for response-related work conducted by the trust\u2019s attorneys. At the conclusion of the work, the Department of Environmental Protection (department) approved the trustees\u2019 conclusion that the amount of TCE on the site was sufficiently small that it did not need to be contained or removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The trustees believed that TJA was liable for the response costs under the indemnity provision in the 1988 agreement. Accordingly, beginning in 1989, Thomas M. Dusel, one of the trustees, kept Earl R. Lewis, then TJA\u2019s senior vice-president and later president, informed of the progress of the response action. In a 1989 letter, TJA informed Fisher Delaware II of the contamination found at the site and invoked Fisher Delaware EEs obligation to indemnify TJA for any liability TJA had for the cleanup costs. The parties met at least twice to discuss the response costs, once in 1991 and once in 1992. In December, 1995, the trustees sent a letter setting out a formal demand for reimbursement of response costs under G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4A. The letter was sent to JAC, Fisher Delaware H, Allied,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> EL Ene., AHSPC, TJA, and Thermo Electron.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The recipients responded within the time required by \u00a7 4A <em>(a),</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and a meeting was held in April, 1996, to discuss the trustees\u2019 demand. The parties did not reach an agreement at the meeting, and no subsequent meeting was ever arranged. The trustees commenced this action in the Superior Court in June, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">c. <em>Procedural history. </em>The trustees\u2019 original complaint named the eight recipients of the \u00a7 4A demand letter as defendants, and in an amended complaint filed in November, 1996, added EL Co. as a ninth defendant. The trustees included in their complaint claims against all defendants under G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 4A, 5, and 15, a request for declaratory relief to resolve liability for future response costs, and a breach of contract claim against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>TJA based on the indemnification provision in the lease termination agreement. In 1998, a judge in the Superior Court denied cross motions for partial summary judgment filed by TJA and the trustees on the breach of contract claim, ruling that the language of the indemnification provision in the lease termination agreement was ambiguous and a trial was required to establish its meaning. In 2000, a different Superior Court judge granted partial summary judgment with respect to some of the trustees\u2019 remaining claims under G. L. c. 2IE. The judge ruled that all claims under G. L. c. 21E for response costs paid by the trustees before July 1, 1989, as well as the trustees\u2019 claims under c. 21E, \u00a7 5, were barred by the applicable statutes of limitations.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The case was tried by a third Superior Court judge in two parts in 2002. In September, 2002, the trustees\u2019 claims to recover response costs pursuant to \u00a7 4 and to recover on the indemnity provision in the 1988 agreement were tried to a jury.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The jury found that the trust did not cause or contribute to the release of TCE at the site, that Fisher Delaware II should bear a one hundred per cent equitable share of the response costs \u2014 which were determined to be $719,484.20 \u2014 and that the trust should bear a zero per cent equitable share. The jury also found that under the 1988 agreement TJA had agreed to indemnify the trust for the release of hazardous material that occurred during the full term of the lease; the total damages awarded by the jury on this contract claim were $796,612.82. Finally, based on the jury\u2019s allocation of response costs to the years they were incurred, the judge determined the amount of prejudgment interest to be paid by Fisher Delaware II on the response costs for which it was responsible under \u00a7 4, and to be paid by TJA on the response costs for which it was responsible under the contract claim. Following the entry of judgment in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the judge granted TJA\u2019s motion for judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>notwithstanding the verdict (judgment n.o.v.) on the contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">In October, 2002, the same judge conducted a jury-waived trial to determine the trustees\u2019 entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees under G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4A <em>(d), </em>and the claims of several defendants for attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 4A <em>(f). </em>The judge found that the trustees were entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 4A <em>(d), </em>to be paid by Fisher Delaware II; and that Thermo Electron, but none of the other defendants, was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 4A <em>if). </em>The judge later amended his judgment to conclude that none of the defendants was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 4A (/). The judge also awarded fees to the trustees under \u00a7 15, to be paid by Fisher Delaware II. Both the trustees and the defendants have appealed. We granted Thermo Elemental\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">2. <em>Breach of contract claim. </em>The trustees appeal from the allowance of TJA\u2019s motion for entry of judgment n.o.v. on their contract claim for indemnification under their 1988 agreement with TJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">a. <em>Background </em>In March of 1986, AHSPC was the lessee under the lease with the trust. On March 28, 1986, TJA, a subsidiary of Thermo Electron, purchased AHSPC\u2019s scientific instrument manufacturing business operated on the property. AHSPC and TJA also executed an assignment of the lease, to which the trustees assented. TJA thus assumed all the lessee\u2019s rights, duties, and liabilities as defined in the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">The lease, with its commencement date of August 2, 1963, had been extended once pursuant to one of two extension options, and was set to expire on April 1, 1989, if not extended for an additional five years under the second extension option. In 1987, TJA decided to move all its manufacturing operations to Franklin, and thus no longer intended to use the property in Waltham <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>that was the subject of the lease. At some point in late 1987 or early 1988, representatives of TJA approached the trustees to suggest an early termination of the lease, an occurrence that would also benefit the trust because of the fixed rental amounts prescribed in the 1963 lease. The parties then negotiated an agreement to end the lease. Thomas Dusel was the principal negotiator for the trust, and Earl Lewis served as the primary negotiator for TJA. Dusel and Lewis worked out the substantive business terms of the agreement, but the actual drafting was left to lawyers representing the respective parties: Thomas Taylor, of the law firm of Hill &amp; Barlow, for the trust, and for TJA, Sandra Lambert, an in-house counsel for Thermo Electron. The parties executed the agreement on March 30, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The agreement recites that it is made between the trustees as lessor and TJA as lessee. It further recites that the parties, or their predecessors in interest, \u201centered into a certain lease dated August 2,1963 (the \u2018Lease\u2019) respecting the premises now known as 590 Lincoln Street. . . (the \u2018Premises\u2019),\u201d and that the parties wish to terminate the lease \u201cprior to the expiration of its stated term.\u201d The indemnification provision relating to the release of hazardous materials, set out as a separate paragraph of the agreement, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">\u201c3. Lessee shall save Lessor harmless and indemnify (and shall defend Lessor with counsel reasonably approved by Lessor) against any claim, loss or cost arising out of any release of hazardous materials arising out of Lessee\u2019s use or activities of Lessee, its employees and agents on the Premises during the term of the Lease in violation of [certain Federal and State environmental protection statutes and regulations, including G. L. c. 21E]. This provision shall not impose any requirement on Lessee with respect to activities off the Premises that result in a violation of any of [the listed environmental statutes or regulations] on or under the Premises without any involvement of Lessee, its employees or agents or with respect to conditions existing on, under or around the Premises prior to the Lease commencement date.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">The trustees\u2019 position is that this provision, read as a whole, commits TJA to indemnify the trust with respect to any release <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>of hazardous material resulting from a lessee\u2019s activities on the property at any point during the lease term \u2014 that is, at any time between the commencement of the lease in 1963 up to its termination in 1988. TJA, on the other hand, contends that (1) the provision restricts the proffered indemnification solely to releases resulting from TJA\u2019s activities on the site during the two years of its tenancy, 1986 to 1988; and (2) because there was no evidence that TJA\u2019s operations on the site during this time caused any release of TCE or any other hazardous material to-occur,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the indemnity provision was not triggered. By their verdict in favor of the trustees on the contract claim, it is clear that the jury accepted the broader interpretation of the indemnity provision advanced by the trustees; by granting TJA\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v., the judge sided with TJA\u2019s more narrow view.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">In his decision allowing the motion, the judge concluded that the words of the agreement were unambiguous.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> He began his analysis by a review of some evidence presented at the trial concerning the negotiations over the agreement. After reciting the evidence presented through TJA\u2019s lawyer Sandra Lambert about her purpose in proposing language that the indemnification was to be for releases of hazardous materials \u201carising out of Lessee\u2019s use or activities of Lessee, its employees or agents on the Premises\u201d \u2014 language that appears in the executed version of the agreement \u2014 the judge concluded that the plain meaning of this phrase was, as Lambert had testified, to restrict the scope of the indemnification to releases occurring during TJA\u2019s own tenancy. In accordance with that conclusion, the judge opined that the reference, in the same sentence of the indemnity provision, to the \u201cterm of the Lease,\u201d as well as the later exception for hazardous waste conditions existing on the property \u201cprior to the Lease commencement date,\u201d represented \u201csurplusage\u201d and \u201cexcess verbiage\u201d that needed to yield to the true intention of the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>as evidenced by. a review of the contract as a whole, which, in his view, was to confine the indemnity to releases caused by TJA\u2019s own activities on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">b. <em>Discussion. </em>The issue presented by the trustees\u2019 appeal, in the first instance, is whether the indemnity provision in the agreement is ambiguous. Determining the existence of a contract ambiguity presents a question of law for the court; when a trial judge undertakes the interpretation of an unambiguous contract, the judge\u2019s ruling is subject to plenary review on appeal. See, e.g., <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College </em>v. <em>PECO Energy Co., </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 888, 891 (2003). See also <em>Berkowitz </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 262, 270 (2003). To answer the ambiguity question, the court must first examine the language of the contract by itself, independent of extrinsic evidence concerning the drafting history or the intention of the parties. See <em>General Convention of the New Jerusalem in the U.S., Inc. </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, </em>449 Mass. 832, 835-836, 838 (2007). \u201cContract language is ambiguous \u2018where the phraseology can support a reasonable difference of opinion as to the meaning of the words employed and the obligations undertaken.\u2019 \u201d <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College </em>v. <em>PECO Energy Co., supra </em>at 896, quoting <em>Suffolk Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Lanco Scaffolding Co., </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 726, 729 (1999). See <em>In re Navigation Tech. Corp., </em>880 F.2d 1491, 1495 (1st Cir. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">In the present case, an examination of the language used in the agreement\u2019s indemnity provision indicates the existence of an ambiguity. The indemnity provision begins by stating that \u201cLessee\u201d is to hold \u201cLessor\u201d harmless \u201cagainst any claim, loss or cost arising out of any release of hazardous materials <em>arising out of Lessee\u2019s use or activities of Lessee, its employees and agents on the Premises during the term of the </em>Lease\u201d (emphasis supplied). Given that TJA is identified in the first paragraph of the agreement as \u201cLessee,\u201d and further that TJA was lessee only from 1986 to the lease termination date in 1988, the first part of this sentence appears at first blush to limit the promised indemnification to TJA\u2019s use of and activities on the premises during the two years of its own tenancy.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> However, the inclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>sion of the phrase \u201cduring the term of the Lease\u201d in the same sentence suggests a period of time going back to 1963, when the \u201cLease\u201d \u2014 a defined term in the agreement referring to the \u201ccertain lease dated August 2, 1963\u201d \u2014 began. The quoted sentence taken as a whole, therefore, at least raises the possibility that the indemnification being granted by TJA was to cover releases of hazardous materials caused by <em>any </em>lessee\u2019s activities on, and uses of, the leased premises during the entire lease term.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">That this possibility is indeed what the sentence was intended to convey finds support in the final sentence of the indemnity provision, which explicitly carves out two exceptions from the scope of the indemnification. The first exception is for activities taking place off the leased premises resulting in the release of hazardous wastes on or under those premises; the second, and the one of particular relevance here, is for \u201cconditions existing on, under or around the Premises <em>prior to the Lease commencement </em>date\u201d (emphasis supplied). The \u201cLease commencement date\u201d again appears to be a reference to August 2, 1963, the commencement date of the defined term \u201cLease.\u201d As the trustees point out, if indeed the earlier sentence in the indemnity provision that concerns the \u201cLessee\u2019s use or activities of the Lessee ... on the Premises\u201d was meant to limit the indemnification to TJA\u2019s own activities while it was the lessee, there would be no need to carve out this second exception for activities occurring prior to 1963 \u2014 more than twenty years before TJA\u2019s tenancy began.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">By considering the language against the backdrop of a portion of the trial evidence, the judge relied, at least in part, on extrinsic evidence to conclude that there was no ambiguity in the contract to begin with. But extrinsic evidence may be used as an interpretive guide only after the judge or the court determines that the contract is ambiguous on its face or as applied. See <em>General Convention of the New Jerusalem in the U.S., Inc. </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, </em>449 Mass. at 835-836. It is not to be used as the basis for concluding in the first instance that a contract is unambiguous as matter of law. See <em>id. </em>at 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">The indemnity provision unquestionably contains language that supports an interpretation restricting the indemnity to releases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>caused only by TJA. Moreover, as the judge pointed out, the agreement identifies TJA as the \u201cLessee\u201d in its first paragraph, uses the term \u201cLessee\u201d over twenty times, and in all sections of the agreement other than the indemnity provision, the \u201cLessee\u201d being referred to is clearly only TJA. Accordingly, the trustees\u2019 argument that in certain portions of this provision, the parties used the term \u201cLessee\u201d to include not only TJA but the earlier lessees as well, appears at first blush to be quixotic. However, the trustees are correct that the term \u201cLessee\u201d is not formally defined in the agreement, in contrast to terms such as \u201cLease,\u201d \u201cPremises,\u201d and \u201cTermination Date,\u201d and although \u201cwords used in one undoubted sense in one place [in a will, contract, or statute] may be presumed to be used in the same meaning in another place in the writing,\u201d <em>Clark </em>v. <em>State St. Trust Co., </em>270 Mass. 140, 151 (1930), this rule itself \u201cis an aid and not an end. It is generally to be followed but it is not inflexible. It yields to the main purpose, which is to find out what the writing means as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accord <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Katz, </em>448 Mass. 519, 528 n.20 (2007).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In this case, the indemnification provision \u201cas a whole\u201d contains some language that suggests the indemnification was intended to cover hazardous material releases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>by any of the lessees. In the circumstances, it was error for the judge to rule as matter of law that the agreement unambiguously restricted the indemnification provision to TJA\u2019s activities alone. The meaning of this provision, and the scope of the indemnity being provided in particular, presented a question of fact to be decided by the fact finder \u25a0\u2014 in this case, the jury. See <em>Seaco Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Barbosa, </em>435 Mass. 772, 779, 781 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Near the end of his ruling, the judge turned briefly to a review of the sufficiency of the trial evidence. He determined that the only reasonable conclusion this evidence permitted was that the indemnity provided by the agreement covered solely TJA\u2019s activities on the site during its two-year tenancy. If the judge\u2019s determination was correct, then the error concerning the agreement\u2019s non-ambiguity would be immaterial. See <em>Suffolk Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Lanco Scaffolding Co., </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 726, 731 (1999) (where trial evidence on meaning of arguably ambiguous contract language was insufficient to support interpretation chosen by jury, judgment n.o.v. should have been granted). However, the judge was not correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Our standard for reviewing a motion for judgment n.o.v. is \u201cwhether, \u2018anywhere in the evidence, from whatever source derived, any combination of circumstances could be found from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the [other party].\u2019 \u201d <em>Masingill </em>v. <em>EMC Corp., </em>449 Mass. 532, 543 (2007), quoting <em>Raunela </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., </em>361 Mass. 341, 343 (1972). It is true that Sandra Lambert\u2019s testimony about her conversations with the trustees\u2019 attorney, Thomas Taylor, concerning the limiting language she proposed for the indemnification provision was not \u201ccontroverted,\u201d because Taylor did not testify at trial. Nevertheless, the jury were not obliged to accept what Lambert said, in whole or in part. See, e.g., <em>Calderone </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>360 Mass. 174, 176 (1971); <em>Lydon </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Ry., </em>309 Mass. 205, 206 (1941). Countervailing evidence certainly was before the jury. In particular, there was evidence presented by <em>both </em>Thomas Dusel, the trustee who had negotiated the business terms of the agreement for the trust, <em>and </em>Earl Lewis, Dusel\u2019s TJA counterpart negotiator,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> that when the two men discussed the business terms of the agreement before it was drafted, Dusel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>made it clear that he wanted an indemnification provision covering any release of hazardous material by any of the lessees during the entire term of the 1963 lease, and that he and Lewis specifically agreed to this extended indemnity because TJA itself was indemnified by one of the preceding lessees, AHSPC. Lewis further testified that he was certain that before any drafting, he talked to Lambert about what the terms of his agreement with Dusel were \u2014 \u201cwhat I thought we were agreeing to.\" In this regard, he also stated that he must have said to Lambert that the trustees wanted a broad indemnity and that he had explained to Dusel the fact that TJA itself was indemnified by AHSPC. The jury were free to credit this testimony (as well as other supporting evidence presented<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>), and ultimately to resolve the ambiguities in the indemnification provision in a way that was consistent with the business terms testified to by Dusel and Lewis: the indemnification being provided by TJA as the \u201cLessee\u201d extended back through the entire \u201cterm of the Lease,\u201d but did not reach \u201cconditions existing on, under or around the Premises prior to the Lease commencement date.\u201d TJA\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v. should not have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">3. <em>Trustees\u2019 compliance with the Massachusetts Contingency </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number><em>Plan. </em>The defendants appeal from the judgment entered against Fisher Delaware II on the trustees\u2019 claim under G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4. They begin with a claim that judgment cannot stand because the undisputed evidence shows the trustees did not comply fully with all requirements of the Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">General Laws c. 21E imposes liability for the release of hazardous material on a number of parties, including the owner of the property on which the release occurs, and anyone who caused the release. G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 5 (a). Liable property owners are encouraged to undertake their own \u201cresponse actions\u201d to assess, contain, and remove any hazardous materials on affected property. G. L. c. 2 IE, \u00a7 4. Failure to do so may result in liability for any later response actions conducted by the Commonwealth, as well as treble damages. G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 5 (a), <em>(e). </em>Any private party who undertakes such a response action may then seek contribution from other potentially liable parties. G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 4A.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">\u201cSimply put, G. L. c. 21E was drafted in a comprehensive fashion to compel the prompt and efficient cleanup of hazardous material and to ensure that costs and damages are borne by the appropriate responsible parties. To that end, the department has promulgated extensive regulations, known collectively as the Massachusetts Contingency Plan ... for purposes of implementing, administering, and enforcing G. L. c. 21E.\u201d <em>Taygeta Corp. </em>v. <em>Varian Assocs., </em>436 Mass. 217, 223 (2002). The purpose of the MCP is, among other things, to \u201cprovide for the protection of health, safety, public welfare and the environment\u201d by encouraging \u201cpersons responsible for releases . . . of . . . hazardous material to undertake necessary and appropriate response actions in a timely way.\u201d 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 40.0002 (1995).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">The defendants argue that the private right of action created <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>in \u00a7 4 requires strict compliance with the MCP. In support of this position, the defendants cite the provision, found in G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-5\">\u201cNothing in this section shall preclude assessment, containment and removal by any person threatened or damaged by such release or threat of release, provided such assessment, containment and removal is conducted in accordance with the Massachusetts contingency plan and consistently with the assessment, containment and removal actions conducted by the department.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">G. L. c. 2IE, \u00a7 4, second par. They argue that because the trustees failed to comply strictly with the requirements of the MCP, they are completely barred from recovery of response costs under \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">The defendants identify two respects in which the trust\u2019s response action failed to conform to the requirements of the MCP. The first concerns an assessment report prepared for the trust in 1991 by Haley &amp; Aldrich, entitled, \u201cPhase II \u2014 Comprehensive Site Assessment.\u201d The 1988 MCP required all phase II comprehensive site assessments to include a section called a \u201cscope of work,\u201d 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 40.545(l)(b) (1988), that was supposed to contain, among other things, a schedule for implementation of the phase II comprehensive site assessment, a sampling plan and analytical protocols, a quality assurance control plan, and a health and safety plan. See 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 40.545(2) (1988). According to the defendants, the comprehensive site assessment report prepared for the trust did not include a scope of work section, in violation of the provisions in the MCP then in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">The second claimed violation concerned work done at the site after the expiration of a \u201cWaiver of Approvals.\u201d Under the 1988 version of the MCP, in an attempt to streamline G. L. c. 21E\u2019s cleanup process, the department began granting waivers to low-risk cleanup operations, allowing them to proceed through the multiple cleanup phases outlined in the MCP without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>obtaining the required department approval for each successive phase. 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 40.536, 40.537 (1988). As a low-risk site, the trust received such a waiver in 1989. The waiver expired on February 28, 1994, but the response action continued after that date. The department informed the trust that the response actions taken after the expiration of the waiver were \u201cconducted in non-compliance\u201d with G. L. c. 21E and the MCP.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The defendants assert that these two violations of the MCP preclude the trust from recovering any response costs incurred after October 3, 1988, when the MCP first went into effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">General Laws c. 21E, \u00a7 4, speaks to the performance of response actions to assess, contain, or remove a release of hazardous material. In the first paragraph, the department is \u201cauthorized\u201d to undertake or arrange for \u201csuch response actions as it reasonably deems necessary ... by reference to the [MCP].\u201d The second paragraph focuses on private parties, providing that \u201c[n]othing in this section shall preclude assessment, containment and removal by any person threatened or damaged by [a] release\u201d of oil or hazardous material to undertake an \u201cassessment, containment and removal\u201d of the contamination, \u201cprovided such assessment, containment and removal is conducted in accordance with the [MCP] and consistently with assessment, containment and removal actions conducted by the department.\u201d The third paragraph of \u00a7 4 then provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-7\">\u201cAny person who undertakes a necessary and appropriate response action regarding the release or threat of release of oil or hazardous material shall be entitled to reimbursement from any other person liable for such release or threat of release for the reasonable costs of such response action. . . . All claims and actions for contribution, reimbursement or equitable share by persons other than the commonwealth pursuant to this paragraph, except those pending in court on the effective date of section four A shall be subject to, and brought in accordance with, the procedures set forth in section 4A.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">We have consistently and specifically identified this third paragraph of \u00a7 4 as the statutory authorization for the type of pri-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>vote response cost recovery lawsuit that the trustees have brought here. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>444 Mass. 324, 343 (2005); <em>Mailman\u2019s Steam Carpet Cleaning Corp. </em>v. <em>Lizotte, </em>415 Mass. 865, 874 (1993). The only condition this paragraph imposes on a private party\u2019s recovery of such costs is that the response action undertaken be \u201cnecessary and appropriate,\u201d that the costs be \u201creasonable,\u201d and that the private party follow the presuit notice and settlement procedures set out in \u00a7 4A. Compliance with the MCP is not mentioned.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> That does not mean that the MCP is irrelevant. When the second paragraph of \u00a7 4 is read together with the third \u2014 as rules of statutory construction propose they should be, see, e.g., <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Gormally, </em>440 Mass. 699, 704 (2004); <em>Negron </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>373 Mass. 199, 201 (1977) \u2014 the reasonable conclusion is that the MCP helps to define the contours of \u201ca necessary and appropriate response action\u201d described in the third paragraph of \u00a7 4. But looking to the MCP for assistance in determining what is \u201cnecessary and appropriate\u201d in terms of a response to the release of hazardous material does not mean that exact compliance with every detail of the MCP operates as a condition precedent to recovery of <em>any </em>response costs. If the Legislature had wanted to make strict adherence to the MCP such a condition, it could have done so; the reference to the MCP in the second paragraph of \u00a7 4,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> its absence in the third paragraph, and the use of the phrase \u201cnecessary and appropriate\u201d instead, indicates that the Legislature did not have this intent.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Fontaine </em>v. <em>Ebtec Corp., </em>415 Mass. 309, 321 (1993), quoting <em>Hartford Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., </em>410 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>279, 283 (1991) (\u201cAs a general rule, when the Legislature has employed specific language in one part of a statute, but not in another part which deals with the same topic, the earlier language should not be implied where it is not present\u201d). See also <em>Mystic Landing, LLC </em>v. <em>Pharmacia Corp., </em>443 F. Supp. 2d 97, 107 (D. Mass. 2006) (\u201cThere is no indication that full compliance with the MCP is a statutory condition precedent to recovery of response costs under Chapter 21E, \u00a7 4\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">For support of their claim, the defendants cite <em>Black </em>v. <em>Coastal Oil New England, Inc., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 461, 462 n.3 (1998) <em>(Black </em>I), <em>S.C., </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 696, 697 n.2 (2003) <em>(Black II), </em>a case involving a claim by property owners to recover from the defendant oil company for both response costs under G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4, and damage to their personal property under c. 21E, \u00a7 5. <em>Black I, supra </em>at 462. The issues before the Appeals Court concerned a judge\u2019s damage award under \u00a7 5 for diminution of the property\u2019s market value and the award of attorney\u2019s fees under c. 2IE, \u00a7 15. <em>Black II, supra </em>at 697. In each <em>Black </em>decision, the Appeals Court noted in a footnote that with respect to the \u00a7 4 response costs, the judge had determined that the plaintiffs had incurred costs but had failed to comply with the MCP, which went into effect during the time they were carrying out the response action, and the judge had limited the plaintiffs\u2019 response recovery to response costs incurred before the effective date of the MCP. <em>Black II, supra </em>at 697 n.2. <em>Black I, supra </em>at 462 n.3. However, the <em>Black </em>plaintiffs apparently did not challenge the judge\u2019s limitation of their \u00a7 4 recovery, as there is no substantive discussion in either of the Appeals Court\u2019s opinions concerning the issue, and no mention of what the MCP violations were. Nothing in either opinion suggests that every violation of the MCP results in forfeiture of the right to recover all response costs. The <em>Black </em>decisions do not aid the defendants\u2019 argument in any material respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Furthermore, although the failure of a response action to comply with the MCP might, in some circumstances, tend to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>that it was not necessary or appropriate, or that the costs incurred were not reasonable, this case does not present such a circumstance. The defendants do not point to any way in which the claimed MCP violations compromised or negatively affected their response to the TCE contamination.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The question whether the response action was necessary and appropriate, with reasonable costs, was a factual one properly left to the jury in this case. The jury heard the evidence presented at trial of the MCP violations, yet still found that the trust\u2019s response action met the necessary and appropriate standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The defendants also challenge the judge\u2019s jury instruction on this issue. The judge instructed the jury that the trustees\u2019 response action must be reasonable, and incurred for services that were \u201cnecessary and appropriate.\u201d He went on to define \u201cnecessary and appropriate\u201d as conducted \u201cin accordance with the MCP,\u201d and explained that \u201c[tjhe burden is on the plaintiff to show by a preponderance of the evidence that its response action was conducted in accordance with the MCP.\u201d The judge explained that to be conducted \u201cin accordance\u201d with the MCP does not require \u201cstrict compliance or perfection.\u201d He further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-6\">\u201cAn immaterial or insubstantial deviation from the MCP would not mean that the response action was not conducted in accordance with the MCP.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-7\">\u201cThe question for you on this point is whether the trust deviated in some material way from the MCP as to any part of its response action. If the answer is yes, then it will be up to you to determine what effect that should have on the trust\u2019s claim for response costs. If you have found that there was a deviation which increased the cost of the response action, for example, because non-compliant work was done and charged for that otherwise would not have been done and charged for, or because additional work was required to correct any non-compliant portion of the trust action \u2014 those are just examples \u2014 then any such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>additional costs should be deducted from the trust\u2019s claim for response costs because they were not pursuant to a necessary and appropriate response action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The defendants argue that this instruction allowed the trustees to recover for even material deviations from the MCP. The defendants misinterpret the instruction. The import of the judge\u2019s words were that over-all, substantial compliance with the MCP was required in order to demonstrate that the trust had conducted a response action that was \u201cin accordance with the MCP.\u201d This instruction expresses accurately the thrust of the authorizing language in the third paragraph of \u00a7 4, and if anything, is more favorable to the defendants than the statute required, insofar as it expressly defines a \u201cnecessary and appropriate\u201d response action in terms of substantial compliance with the MCP, rather than presenting such compliance as one, albeit highly significant, criterion to consider. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">4. <em>Attorney\u2019s fees as response costs. </em>The defendants also challenge the allowance, as a type of permissible response costs, of fees paid by the trust to its attorneys for work on the response action. Under G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4, one who undertakes a \u201cnecessary and appropriate response action\u201d is \u201centitled to reimbursement from any other person hable for such release ... for the reasonable costs of such response action.\u201d A \u201cresponse action\u201d is defined to include assessment, containment, and removal, and \u201cassessment\u201d is defined to include, \u201cwithout limitation, studies, services and investigations to plan, manage and direct assessment, containment and removal actions, to determine and recover the costs thereof, and to otherwise accomplish the purposes of this chapter.\u201d G. L. c. 2IE, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The jury awarded the trustees $90,214 for work undertaken by their attorneys, Hill &amp; Barlow, to manage the response action. The judge instructed the jury that \u201c[sjervices provided by a lawyer in connection with an environmental case may or may not qualify as response costs. To be recoverable as response costs, attorney\u2019s fees must be for services that are closely tied to the response action . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">This instruction accurately reflected the requirements of G. L. c. 21E. There is nothing in the statute to exclude otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>legitimate response costs simply because they relate to services provided by an attorney. As with any other response cost, attorney\u2019s fees must be reasonable, necessary, and appropriate to be recoverable under G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4, and the judge properly instructed the jury on this point. The judge further directed the jury to include only those attorney\u2019s fees that were \u201cclosely tied to the response action,\u201d and to deduct any Hill &amp; Barlow fees for litigation-related activity. These instructions ensured that the only attorney\u2019s fees included in the \u00a7 4 award would be legitimate response costs, not litigation costs that could only be recovered, if at all, under G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4A <em>(d) </em>or 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The United States Supreme Court has interpreted the analogous provision in the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607 (2000), in much the same manner, holding that \u201csome lawyers\u2019 work that is closely tied to the actual cleanup may constitute a necessary cost of response.\u201d <em>Key Tronic Corp. </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 511 U.S. 809, 820 (1994).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> See <em>Martignetti </em>v. <em>Haigh-Farr, Inc., </em>425 Mass. 294, 301 n.12 (1997) (\u201cTo the extent that there are similarities in language and structure [between G. L. c. 21E and CERCLA], it is desirable to arrive at similar interpretations . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The defendants argue that, according to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Sanitoy, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ilco Unican Corp., </em>413 Mass. 627, 630 (1992), the judge\u2019s instruction was in error because no attorney\u2019s fees may be recovered as part of \u00a7 4\u2019s response costs. The defendants\u2019 argument is without merit. The court in <em>Sanitoy </em>held that \u00a7 4 contains \u201cno provision for the recovery of attorneys\u2019 or expert witness fees by parties seeking reimbursement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That holding concerns only attorney\u2019s fees related to the conduct of the litigation, and is limited to a prohibition on recovery of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>fees under \u00a7 4. The court in that case had no occasion to, and did not, consider attorney\u2019s fees as one type of response costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The defendants also object to the specific items represented on Hill &amp; Barlow\u2019s billing records, arguing that even if some attorney\u2019s fees might be recoverable as response costs, the objected-to fees were clearly neither necessary nor appropriate, and the jury\u2019s conclusion to the contrary requires reversal.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Whether any individual charge was related to litigation or to response costs was a factual question for the jury to decide. The disputed billing records include entries such as \u201cTelephone conference with T. Dusel re: Therm Meeting,\u201d and \u201cAttention to Therm claim; review CERCLA cases, chronology of events and corporation transactions, and 21E amendments.\u201d According to the defendants, these entries could relate only to the indemnity claim the trustees intended to litigate, and could not be considered as necessary and appropriate management costs of the response action. The defendants read the entries too narrowly. The jury would have been warranted to conclude that a 1991 discussion with Thermo Electron, the parent of a former tenant of the site, at a time when the source of the contamination was still uncertain, was related to the response action. Similarly, the jury could have concluded that research into G. L. c. 21E and CERCLA was related to the response action itself and not the subsequent litigation.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Furthermore, the jury also heard expert testimony that the work done by Hill &amp; Barlow was necessary and appropriate, closely tied to the response action, and typical of response work carried out by attorneys in situations such as this one. There was sufficient evidence in the record to support the jury\u2019s conclusions regarding Hill &amp; Barlow\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>5. <em>Prejudgment interest. </em>The judge ordered Fisher Delaware II to pay prejudgment interest on the jury\u2019s awards of response cost damages against it. To calculate the amount of interest owed, the judge instructed the jury to allocate the trust\u2019s response costs, as evidenced in more than 180 invoices, to the calendar year in which the particular work was done. At trial, Dusel testified that MMBT (the sole beneficiary of the trust) received the trust\u2019s response-related bills and paid them within ninety days of receiving each invoice. MMBT later charged those costs back to the trust\u2019s account through subsequent bookkeeping entries. The judge assessed interest as of December 31 of each year to which the jury had assigned costs. The defendants argue that the judge\u2019s calculation of interest was error because the evidence presented at trial established only the date the debts were incurred and MMBT\u2019s practice of paying the bills within ninety days. According to the defendants, prejudgment interest must be measured from the date a bill was paid by the trust, not the date a debt was incurred by it or paid by MMBT, and there was no evidence presented at trial concerning when the response costs were eventually charged against the trust\u2019s account. Therefore, the defendants argue, the awards of prejudgment interest must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">An award of prejudgment interest is made \u201cso that a person wrongfully deprived of the use of money\u201d is \u201cmade whole for his loss.\u201d See <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>397 Mass. 837, 841 (1986), quoting <em>Perkins Schs. for the Blind </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, </em>383 Mass. 825, 835 (1981). When applying G. L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 6B and 6C, \u201cthe fact that no loss was incurred until after an action was commenced should be recognized, as a matter of fairness, in order to avoid giving a party an undeserved windfall.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <em>St. Paul Surplus Lines Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Feingold &amp; Fein-gold Ins. Agency, Inc., </em>427 Mass. 372, 377 (1998). Thus, when expenses incurred as a result of a contract breach are not paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>by a plaintiff until after the breach has occurred, the interest is calculated not from the date of the breach or even the date the action was commenced, as the plain language of the statute would require, but from the date or dates on which the plaintiff made such payments. See <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., supra </em>at 841-842. This avoids the windfall that would otherwise be created for the plaintiff were courts to allow interest to accrue from the date of breach even when the plaintiff does not lose the use of funds until much later. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The facts of this case present a similar dilemma. An application of the plain language of the statute would allow interest to accrue \u201cfrom the date of commencement of the action\u201d or \u201cfrom the date of the breach,\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 6B and 6C, but most costs were not paid by the trust until much later. The judge recognized the potential windfall for the trust, and avoided that result by calculating interest from the last day of the year in which each bill was paid by MMBT. This approximation avoided using the more than 180 different dates of accrual that would have been required for a more precise calculation based on the actual dates the invoices were paid. See <em>O\u2019Malley </em>v. <em>O\u2019Malley, </em>419 Mass. 377, 381 (1995) (calculating \u00a7 6C interest owed over multi-year period as of each year\u2019s end). The approximation would also almost certainly undercharge Fisher Delaware II, because there was testimony that all bills were paid within ninety days of receipt of an invoice, and most were paid within thirty days. As to the defendants\u2019 contention that prejudgment interest could only run from the dates that MMBT charged back the response costs to the trust, and not when they were paid by MMBT, we conclude that in the circumstances of this case, where MMBT owned the entire beneficial interest of the trust, and also managed the books and accounts for the trust, the approximation employed by the judge fairly reflected the legislative purpose of G.

L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4A (/). Section \u00a7 4A (/) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">\u201cIf the court finds that (1) the plaintiff did not partici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>pate in negotiations or dispute resolution in good faith; (2) the plaintiff had no reasonable basis for asserting that the defendant was liable, or (3) the plaintiff\u2019s position with respect to the amount of the defendant\u2019s liability pursuant to the provisions of this chapter was unreasonable, it shall award litigation costs and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees to the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">In their response to the trustees\u2019 \u00a7 4A demand letter, Thermo Electron and TJA asserted their intention of seeking attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 4A (/). Similarly, in their answer to the trustees\u2019 original complaint, Thermo Electron and TJA included a counterclaim alleging entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 4A <em>(f) </em>on the grounds that the trustees did not negotiate in good faith and there was no reasonable basis for claiming liability on the part of Thermo Electron and TJA under G. L. c. 21E. However, in their answer to the trustees\u2019 amended complaint, Thermo Electron and TJA, this time joined by Fisher Delaware II, Allied, Allied-Signal, and EL Co., did not include any counterclaim requesting relief under \u00a7 4A (/), or otherwise refer to attorney\u2019s fees recoverable under that section. Rather, the defendants only made a generic request for \u201ctheir costs of defending this action.\u201d Following the jury trial, the judge tried without a jury both the trustees\u2019 claim against Fisher Delaware II for litigation costs and attorney\u2019s fees under G. L. c. 2IE, \u00a7 4A <em>(d), </em>and the defendants\u2019 corresponding claims for such costs and fees under \u00a7 4A (/). He reserved, however, the threshold question whether some of the defendants\u2019 \u00a7 4A <em>(f) </em>claims were waived because the defendants had not asserted the claims by way of a counterclaim or otherwise in their answers. In his decision following the trial, the judge ruled that all of the defendants, with the exception of Thermo Electron and TJA, were precluded from recovering litigation costs and attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 4A (/) because they had not included any counterclaim seeking such relief.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> He then went on to reach the merits of the \u00a7 4A <em>(f) </em>claims raised by Thermo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Electron and TJA. He ruled that TJA had failed to establish that the trustees had no reasonable basis to allege liability on its part and therefore TJA was not entitled to an award under \u00a7 4A (/), but that Thermo Electron was entitled to the award because it was unreasonable for the trustees to assert a claim against it based solely on its status as a parent company. Thereafter, however, the trustees pointed out in a posttrial motion that the answer to the trustees\u2019 amended complaint, filed on behalf of all the defendants (including Thermo Electron) in fact did not include such a \u00a7 4A <em>(f) </em>counterclaim. The trustees\u2019 contention was that like the other defendants, Thermo Electron was not entitled to costs and fees under \u00a7 4A (/) because of a failure to plead. In his memorandum and order on the posttrial motions, the judge agreed, and reversed his ruling in favor of Thermo Electron. Therefore, the judge\u2019s ultimate determination was that none of the defendants was entitled to an award of costs and attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 4A (/). We agree with the judge\u2019s ultimate ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Unquestionably, the defendants\u2019 claim to recover litigation costs and attorney\u2019s fees represents a claim for relief in the form of a monetary award. Under the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, a claim for relief is to be set forth in a pleading that contains \u201c(1) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, and (2) a demand for judgment for the relief to which he deems himself entitled.\u201d Mass. R. Civ. P. 8 (a), 365 Mass. 749 (1974). One purpose of this requirement is to give fair notice of the claim to the parties. See <em>Lazzaro </em>v. <em>Holladay, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 108, 110-111 (1983). As the judge pointed out, by the failure to include the \u00a7 4A <em>(f) </em>claim for litigation costs and attorney\u2019s fees in their answer, the defendants \u201cdeprived [the trust] of the opportunity to do discovery or other pretrial preparation or motion practice on any factual or legal issues that such a pleading might have raised.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The defendants argue that the denial of their \u00a7 4A (/) claims solely for a failure to plead \u201cexalted form over substance\u201d and constituted legal error because the plain language of \u00a7 4A (/) does not require a defendant affirmatively to plead such a claim; in the defendants\u2019 view, the judge was adding requirements to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>the statute that the Legislature had not seen fit to include. The argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">We fail to understand the significance of the fact that \u00a7 4A (/) contains no explicit direction to a defendant to plead a claim under that section as a prerequisite for obtaining relief. As a general rule, statutes that authorize or direct the award of attorney\u2019s fees do not contain any such language. See, e.g., G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 111 (civil rights act); G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 15 (citizen enforcement of environmental protection statute)<footnotemark>33</footnotemark>; G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 11 (consumer protection act); G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9 (antidiscrimination statute); G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H (\u201canti-SLAPP\u201d statute). Nonetheless, parties seeking such fees are to include the request in their pleadings. See, e.g., <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>436 Mass. 517, 525 (2002), <em>S.C., </em>441 Mass. 9 (2004) (in reversing denial of defendant\u2019s special motion to dismiss under anti-SLAPP statute, which requires award of costs and attorney\u2019s fees if granted, court specifically noted that defendant had included request for costs and attorney\u2019s fees in her motion and would be entitled to award of such fees and costs on remand).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Moreover, there is a particular reason for requiring a party seeking an award of litigation costs and attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 4A \u2014 whether \u00a7 4A (/) or \u00a7 4A <em>(d) </em>\u2014 to set out its claim in a pleading. Under most statutory fee-shifting provisions (and all the statutory provisions cited in the previous paragraph), the party bringing the substantive claim may receive an award of costs and attorney\u2019s fees directly as a consequence of prevailing on the merits of that claim; the entitlement or authorization is not contingent on proof of any other condition or fact. In contrast, \u00a7 4A (/) and <em>(d) </em>condition an award of litigation costs and attorney\u2019s fees on a factual showing, and a resulting finding by the judge, that the party against whom the award of costs and fees is sought has acted in at least one of several specified ways that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>deleterious to settlement of the underlying response action.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Contrary to the defendants\u2019 claim that an award of costs and fees under \u00a7 4A <em>(f) </em>is \u201cself-effectuating,\u201d the requirement that the judge make factual findings as a prerequisite to such an award leads inexorably to the conclusion that one of the parties to the litigation present the court with evidence on which such findings could be based. Because the defendant is the party seeking the award, it follows that the defendant should bear the burden of producing the necessary evidence. Basic rules of civil pleading and practice require, however, that in such circumstances, the opposing party receive fair notice of the nature of the defendant\u2019s claim and the evidence that supports it. The fundamental way that such notice is initiated is through pleadings. Cf. <em>Anthony\u2019s Pier Four, Inc. </em>v. <em>HBC Assocs., </em>411 Mass. 451, 471 (1991) (failure to plead affirmative defense results in waiver of that defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The defendants also contend that by permitting the trustees to avoid a fee award against them based only on a \u201cprocedural technicality,\u201d the judge contravened the section\u2019s underlying legislative intent to sanction \u201copprobrious\u201d conduct on the part of response action plaintiffs. The argument mixes apples and oranges. There is little doubt that \u00a7 4A (/) (and also \u00a7 4A <em>[d\\) </em>reflects a legislative intent to use fee-shifting awards as a sanction for misconduct, in order to encourage parties to negotiate and implement resolutions of environmental cleanup actions without costly and time-consuming htigation. But requiring those parties to abide by generally applicable rules of pleading and procedure when they seek to enforce the sanction does not conflict with this legislative purpose.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">7. <em>The litigation fees. </em>The trust was awarded litigation fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>and costs under G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 15.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Section 15 allows a court to award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and expert witness fees to any party \u201cwho advances the purposes of this chapter.\u201d This provision authorizes a judge to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs to a party that brings suit under G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4, for reimbursement of response costs as long as that party has not caused or contributed to the release of hazardous materials necessitating its response action. <em>Martignetti </em>v. <em>Haigh-Farr, Inc., </em>425 Mass. 294, 319-321 (1997). Because the jury found that the trust did not cause or contribute to the contamination, the judge\u2019s award under \u00a7 15 was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Fisher Delaware II argues<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> that the trustees did not advance the purposes of the statute because they (1) pursued claims against a number of defendants against which they knew they had no reasonable claim and relied on facts which they knew to be false; (2) rejected settlement offers made during litigation; and (3) conducted a response action that was unreasonably delayed and that violated the MCP. Fisher\u2019s argument is without merit. All that G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 15, requires is that a plaintiff has sought reimbursement under G. L. c. 2 IE, \u00a7 4, and has not contributed to the hazardous waste release. <em>Martignetti </em>v. <em>Haigh-Farr, Inc., supra </em>at 321, 323-324. The statutory prerequisites for recovery under \u00a7 4 are that the plaintiff give sufficient notice to the defendants, \u00a7 4A (a); participate in negotiations in good faith, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>\u00a7 4A (b); and conduct a necessary and appropriate response action in accordance with the MCP, \u00a7 4, second and third pars.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The jury\u2019s findings in this case established that the trustees conducted a necessary and appropriate response action in accordance with the MCP, and that the trust was not responsible for causing the contamination. None of the alleged defects cited by Fisher Delaware II would result in a violation of the two remaining prerequisites of notice and good faith negotiation. The allegedly false statement cited by Fisher Delaware II, found in the trustees\u2019 \u00a7 4A letter, indicated that it was the trustees\u2019 understanding \u201cthat [TCE] was used on the site from 1964-1988.\u201d During his testimony Richard Rudman, the lawyer responsible for drafting the letter, admitted that the dates were a drafting error, and that the letter should have said \u201c1964-1986.\u201d Although the error suggested that the release of TCE might have occurred during TJA\u2019s tenancy, it does not amount to bad faith negotiation or insufficient notice. Fisher Delaware II also argues that the trustees pursued manifestly unreasonable theories of corporate parent liability against EL Co., Thermo Electron, and Allied. Yet even if such theories were unreasonable with respect to EL Co., Thermo Electron, or Allied, they could have had no harmful effect on Fisher Delaware n. Fisher Delaware El\u2019s last argument is that the final offer made during litigation, for $917,000, was for $200,000 more than the jury\u2019s verdict, and the trustees\u2019 failure to accept that offer means that Fisher Delaware II should not bear any costs of litigation incurred after that offer was made.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The offer in question was made during litigation, and thus cannot contribute to a finding of bad faith in the pretrial negotiation process required by \u00a7 4A. The trastees \u201cadvanced the purposes of the statute,\u201d and therefore the judge\u2019s award was justified.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">8. <em>Jurisdiction. </em>The defendants argue that the trustees\u2019 failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>to propose an equitable share of the response costs, together with the alleged false or misleading statements made in the \u00a7 4A letter, deprived the Superior Court of jurisdiction over the trustees\u2019 claims. The defendants cite \u00a7 4A (c), which provides that a party may commence a civil action under \u00a7 4A \u201c[ojnly after notice has been given and after the procedures described in this section have been carried out. . . .\u201d G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4A (c). Those procedures include the requirement that the \u00a7 4A letter state each recipient\u2019s \u201cproposed contribution, reimbursement or equitable share\u201d of liability. G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4A <em>(a). </em>The alleged defects cited by the defendants do not deprive the Superior Court of jurisdiction. Minor inaccuracies, omissions, and errors in the contents of the \u00a7 4A letter cannot bar jurisdiction when all other procedural requirements of \u00a7 4A are complied with. See <em>Rudnick </em>v. <em>Hospital Mtge. Group, Inc., </em>951 F. Supp. 7, 9 (D. Mass. 1996) (\u201cwhen a party gives . . . actual notice, section 4A <em>[a] </em>is not a jurisdictional bar to commencement of an action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">9. <em>Environmental report. </em>The defendants\u2019 final argument is that an environmental report commissioned by the trust was erroneously admitted in evidence over the defendants\u2019 objections. The report contained a speculative assertion that an above-ground storage tank was the probable source of the TCE contamination. Fisher Delaware II contends that the report suggested that it was responsible for the contamination because it was Fisher Delaware II (and its corporate predecessors) that operated the aboveground storage tank. According to this argument, the report was highly prejudicial, should not have been admitted for any purpose, and its admission was an error requiring a new trial. \u201cRelevant evidence is admissible unless unduly prejudicial, and, \u2018[i]n weighing the probative value of evidence against any prejudicial effect it might have on a jury, we afford trial judges great latitude and discretion, and we uphold a judge\u2019s decision in this area unless it is palpably wrong.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>442 Mass. 135, 144 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sicari, </em>434 Mass. 732, 752 (2001), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1142 (2002). Here, the report was relevant to show that the trust was complying with the MCP, as well as to establish the amount of the response costs sought by the trustees. It was admitted with a limiting instruction that it was to be considered not for the truth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>of the matters asserted within it, but rather to show that it had been prepared and that the trustees were notified of its contents. That decision was well within the judge\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">10. <em>Conclusion. </em>That portion of the amended judgment relating to the trustees\u2019 claims under G. L. c. 2IE, \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 15, is affirmed.

The indemnity provision states that the obligation to indemnify applies to any hazardous material release \u201carising out of Lessee\u2019s use <em>or activities of Lessee, its employees and agents </em>on the Premises <em>during the term of the Lease\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). It also states that no requirement to indemnify is imposed \u201con Lessee with respect to activities off the Premises that result in [a hazardous material release] without any involvement of <em>Lessee, its employees or agents\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). These are the only two references to the \u201cLessee, its employees or agents\u201d \u2014 as opposed to simply the \u201cLessee\u201d \u2014 in the entire agreement. In light of the series of interconnected corporate mergers, asset purchases, and name changes among the various lessees of the property, and evidence that to some extent, the employees on the site did not change despite the corporate changes, it would not be unreasonable to construe the phrase \u201cLessee, its employees and agents\u201d as referring to TJA and its predecessor lessees, rather than just TJA. Given such a reading, all the words of the indemnity provision can be read consistently to mean that TJA, as the \u201cLessee\u201d in the agreement, is obligated to indemnify the trustees for releases arising from its own use of the property and also from activities conducted by the earlier lessees. Such a reading does \u201cno violence to the language\u201d of the agreement as a whole. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Katz, </em>448 Mass. 519, 528 n.20 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b671-7\">At trial, Lewis\u2019s deposition testimony was read to the jury; Lewis did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>testify as a live witness. The deposition had been taken October 30, 1998.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b672-7\">For example, there was evidence that when they were negotiating the terms to govern the agreement, Dusel and Lewis both understood that the 1963 lease contained an indemnification provision covering releases by all lessees. The jury also heard from Dusel that he discussed a draft of the agreement with the trustees\u2019 attorney Taylor, and Dusel understood that the final version of the agreement, the one he signed, did indeed provide indemnification for releases going back to the beginning of the lease: the language \u201cduring the term of the Lease\u201d that appeared in the indemnification provision of the agreement meant just that. Lewis, on the other hand, testified that he did not remember reviewing or discussing with Lambert any written drafts of the agreement or the final written version before he signed it. There was also evidence \u2014 again proffered by <em>both </em>Dusel and Lewis \u2014 that for the period of time extending from the signing of the agreement in the spring of 1988 up until 1992 (when a different lawyer for TJA became involved), TJA responded to the trustees\u2019 requests for payment of remediation costs not by denying any responsibility, but instead by referring to the indemnification that AHSPC had provided to TJA \u2014 in other words, in a manner consistent with Lewis\u2019 position that TJA could offer a broad indemnity to the trastees because TJA was in turn indemnified by AHSPC. In seeking to interpret the scope of the agreement\u2019s indemnity provision, the jury were entitled to consider this evidence concerning the parties\u2019 conduct following execution of the agreement.

L. c. 21E are to \u201ccompel the prompt and efficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>cleanup of hazardous material and to ensure that costs and damages are borne by the appropriate responsible parties.\u201d <em>Taygeta Corp. </em>v. <em>Varian Assocs., </em>436 Mass. 217, 223 (2002). See <em>Sanitoy, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ilco Unican Corp., </em>413 Mass. 627, 629-630 (1992). Reading \u00a7 4 as the defendants propose would run contrary to both these goals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b678-8\">For example, the defendants do not cite any deficiencies or expenses in the response action that would have been prevented if a scope of work had been prepared. And as to the \u201cwaiver\u201d violation, it is significant that even after the department learned of this violation, the department chose to do nothing about it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b680-7\">CERCLA includes a somewhat broader definition of a \u201cresponse action,\u201d including not only removal and remedial action, but also \u201cenforcement activities related thereto.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601(25). However, the United States Supreme Court in <em>Key Tronic </em>did not rely on the broader \u201cenforcement activities\u201d language to support its conclusion that some attorney\u2019s fees may be recoverable under \u00a7 9607 of CERCLA. <em>Key Tronic Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>511 U.S. 809, 820 (1994). See <em>Neumann </em>v. <em>Carlson Envtl., Inc., </em>429 F. Supp. 2d 946, 959-960 (N.D. Ill. 2006); <em>Nutrasweet Co. </em>v. <em>X-L Eng\u2019g Corp., </em>926 F. Supp. 767, 771 (N.D. Ill. 1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The defendants further argue that the records were improperly admitted hearsay because, having been redacted in preparation for litigation, they were not created in the ordinary course of business and therefore failed to conform to the requirements of the business records exception. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78. The defendants\u2019 argument fails because, as the judge determined, the records themselves were ordinary invoices plainly prepared in the ordinary course of business. Redacting a business record in preparation for litigation does not change the fact that the record was originally prepared in the ordinary course of business.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Richard Rudman, the Hill &amp; Barlow attorney primarily responsible for providing the legal response action services at issue, testified at length concerning the response-related work he performed, and the defendants had an opportunity to question him about the specific bills they now challenge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b682-6\">General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 6B, provides for prejudgment interest in tort actions, and G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6C, provides the same in relation to contract actions. The same principles govern the calculation of prejudgment interest under both statutes. See <em>St. Paul Surplus Lines Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Feingold &amp; Feingold Ins. Agency, Inc., 427 </em>Mass. 372, 377 (1998) (calculation of prejudgment interest on tort claim under G.

L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4A <em>(f), </em>claims, they were \u201cnot tried by consent. . . : [the trustees] timely made [their] objection to my hearing the claims.\u201d On their part, the trustees had specifically set out their corresponding claim against the defendants under \u00a7 4A <em>(d) </em>for litigation costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>and attorney\u2019s fees in a separate count of both their original and amended complaints.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b686-7\">The trustees\u2019 claim for attorney\u2019s fees and costs under G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 15, is discussed <em>infra. </em>The trustees included a specific request for such fees in their amended complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b686-8\">In a related vein, we have held that where a party seeks the award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs in a case where a statute has authorized the award of such fees and costs to the prevailing party at the trial level, the party seeking the fees must include the request in the appellate brief. <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>441 Mass. 9, 10 (2004). See <em>Yorke Mgt. </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>406 Mass. 17, 20 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Thus, G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4A <em>(f), </em>at issue here, directs that the court shall award costs and fees to the defendant on a specific finding \u201cthat (1) the plaintiff did not participate in negotiations or dispute resolution in good faith; (2) the plaintiff had no reasonable basis for asserting that the defendant was liable, or (3) the plaintiff\u2019s position with respect to the amount of the defendant\u2019s liability . . . was unreasonable.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b687-8\">As has been stated, the judge denied TJA\u2019s \u00a7 4A (/) claim on the merits. On appeal, TJA argues the judge committed error in doing so. We do not need to reach TJA\u2019s argument, however, because it is clear that TJA\u2019s claim would properly have been denied on the same ground as Thermo Electron\u2019s and the other defendants\u2019, namely, that TJA failed to plead it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b687-9\">The defendants\u2019 final point about their \u00a7 4A (/) claims is that at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Thermo Electron and TJA adequately put the trustees on notice that they were seeking costs and fees under the section, by referencing the claim in their response to the plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 4A demand letter, and later by including a specific counterclaim for costs and fees under \u00a7 4A (/) in their answer to the original complaint. In the circumstances, they contend, the judge\u2019s denial of their \u00a7 4A <em>(f) </em>claims for lack of pleading is particularly unjustified. We disagree. The inclusion of a \u00a7 4A <em>(f) </em>counterclaim in these two defendants\u2019 original answer, followed by an answer to the amended complaint that includes no such counterclaim and no reference to \u00a7 4A (/) \u2014 all occurring while these defendants were represented by competent and sophisticated counsel \u2014 might reasonably be interpreted as an intentional abandonment or waiver of the \u00a7 4A (/) claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b688-7\">The judge also awarded litigation costs and attorney\u2019s fees to the trust under G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4A (d). Because we conclude that the trustees are entitled to the fees awarded by the judge under \u00a7 15, we need not decide whether they are entitled to the identical fees under \u00a7 4A <em>(d).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b688-8\">Because Fisher Delaware II was the only party found responsible under G.
