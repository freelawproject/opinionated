In connection with an alleged drug transaction that occurred in May, 2003, the defendant, Elvin Stephens, and a codefendant were charged in the Lawrence Division of the District Court Department with possessing cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> possession of cocaine in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and conspiracy to violate the controlled substances act in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 40. Stephens was then indicted as a subsequent offender for distributing cocaine, and his case proceeded to the Superior Court, while his codefendant\u2019s case remained in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">In the District Court, the codefendant moved to suppress evidence seized during a warrantless stop and search of the automobile in which he and Stephens were sitting when they were stopped \u2014 a search that underlay the charges against Stephens and the codefendant \u2014 and statements made by him during the search. The judge allowed the codefendant\u2019s motion,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from which interlocutory ruling the Commonwealth did not seek leave to appeal. The charges against the codefendant subsequently were dismissed for failure to prosecute.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">In the interim, Stephens moved in the Superior Court to sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>press the same evidence, as well as statements made by him during the search. Several weeks after the codefendant\u2019s motion had been allowed \u2014 a development unknown to Stephens \u2014 an evidentiary hearing took place on his motion in the Superior Court. The judge in the Superior Court denied Stephens\u2019s motion to suppress, issuing detailed findings of fact and rulings of law. He concluded that the police officers had reasonable suspicion to stop Stephens and probable cause to search his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Months later, Stephens learned that the codefendant had successfully moved to suppress the evidence in the District Court. In consequence, Stephens moved for reconsideration of the denial of his motion to suppress, claiming that the Commonwealth was collaterally estopped from relitigating the propriety of the search because the issue had been resolved against it in the District Court. The Superior Court judge (who had earlier ruled on Stephens\u2019s motion to suppress) denied the motion, concluding that \u201cmutuality of the parties must exist in the criminal context\u201d and there was no mutuality here because \u201cthe defendant himself\u201d was not a party in the District Court case. After an initial mistrial, Stephens was tried and convicted of distributing cocaine, and was convicted as a subsequent offender. He appealed, and we transferred the case here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">In addition to the collateral estoppel claim, we must resolve whether (1) if collateral estoppel does not apply, the Superior Court judge erred in denying Stephens\u2019s motion to suppress; and (2) the evidence was sufficient to prove that Stephens was the seller rather than the buyer of cocaine. For reasons we shall explain, we agree with the judge in the Superior Court that the suppression order issued in the District Court in the codefendant\u2019s case did not have preclusive effect against the Commonwealth in this case. We further conclude that the stop and search of Stephens\u2019s motor vehicle was lawful and that there was sufficient evidence to support Stephens\u2019s conviction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">1. <em>Factual background. </em>We summarize in some detail the facts found by the motion judge, all of which are supported by the evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Sneed, 440 Mass. 216, 217 (2003); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>427 Mass. 117, 118 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">During the early evening of May 22, 2003, two \u201cexperienced\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>State police officers, in the motion judge\u2019s words, Sergeant Francis Hughes and Trooper Ernest Doherty, were conducting a surveillance of the parking lot of a Denny\u2019s restaurant located at the intersection of two highways in Lawrence. This was a \u201cprime location for\u201d and \u201cfrequent meeting place for illegal drug transactions.\u201d In that general location a \u201ctypical modus operandi\u201d for an illegal drug transaction was as follows: a prospective buyer would contact a prospective seller and arrange to meet at one of the establishments within the intersection area; the buyer would arrive first and park his vehicle to await the seller; on arrival of the seller, the two frequently would drive their vehicles to a more private location to consummate the illegal drug transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">On the night in question, the two officers were working together, in separate unmarked vehicles. They were watching a grey Honda automobile parked in a rear area of the Denny\u2019s parking lot, an area that \u201cwas not usually frequented by customers of the Denny\u2019s Restaurant.\u201d The driver, and sole occupant, of the Honda was later identified as the codefendant. After approximately fifteen to twenty minutes, the officers noted another male, later identified as Stephens, arrive and park his blue Ford Expedition vehicle in a parking space approximately three spaces away from the Honda. There was no apparent contact between the two men, but fully visible to both was a marked Lawrence police cruiser parked in a neighboring lot. After approximately two to three minutes, the codefendant drove his Honda directly in front of the Ford, and stopped. The codefendant then nodded his head in a manner that \u201cindicated that he wished the [Ford] to follow.\u201d The codefendant drove out of the parking lot, followed by Stephens in the Ford. The two officers followed surreptitiously in their respective vehicles. Stephens passed the codefendant and led the Honda into a gasoline station parking lot, which was darker and more secluded than the restaurant parking lot. The two men parked their motor vehicles next to each other, as the officers continued to watch from across a highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The codefendant left his Honda, opened the passenger door of the Ford and climbed in. At this point the officers drove their cars to the gasoline station lot and parked beside, but not block<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>ing, either vehicle. Both officers left their vehicles and approached the Ford, in which Stephens and the codefendant were now seated. Sergeant Hughes approached the passenger\u2019s side of the Ford, shining his flashlight into the vehicle, which illuminated the codefendant\u2019s shoulder and head. The codefendant looked at Hughes and then turned his head and upper torso and made a movement, which the motion judge described as \u201cfurtive,\u201d reaching down toward the center console. At the same time, Trooper Doherty approached and illuminated the driver\u2019s side of the Ford and saw Stephens look toward him, eyes widened in surprise. The trooper noted that Stephens was holding a black object in the area of his chest, which he quickly lowered to the area of his lap. Fearing that the black object was a weapon, Trooper Doherty immediately opened the driver\u2019s side door and grabbed Stephens\u2019s hands to minimize the danger to himself. While doing so, he saw \u201chundreds of dollars\u201d in Stephens\u2019s lap. Also in Stephens\u2019s lap the trooper saw several clear plastic sandwich bags; the top of each was knotted and one comer cut. Trooper Doherty was aware from his training and experience that the alterations to the plastic bags were consistent with packing illegal drags.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Trooper Doherty ordered Stephens out of the vehicle, conducted a patfnsk, and, feeling no weapon, informed him of his Miranda rights. At the same time, Sergeant Hughes, concerned about his safety due to the codefendant\u2019s \u201cfurtive movement toward the console area,\u201d opened the passenger door and ordered the codefendant out of the vehicle. He conducted a pat-frisk of the codefendant and advised him of his Miranda rights. The police officers then questioned the two men separately. Neither man knew the other\u2019s last name. They gave varying explanations of their activities: Stephens said they were meeting to talk, while the codefendant said they were meeting for drinks.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">After conferring with Sergeant Hughes, Trooper Doherty searched the front seat area of the vehicle. Under the passenger\u2019s seat next to the center console, he found three small clear cellophane bags containing white powder that appeared to him to be cocaine. The trooper collected $345 from the area of the driver\u2019s seat, an amount approximating the street value of the three bags of cocaine he had found. The officers then placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>both men under arrest. At trial, Trooper Doherty testified that, subsequent to the arrest, he searched Stephens and found, in his left pants pocket, additional plastic bags that had been altered.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">2. <em>Nonmutual collateral estoppel in criminal cases. </em>The doctrine of collateral estoppel provides that \u201cwhen an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>383 Mass. 497, 499 (1981), quoting <em>Ashe </em>v. <em>Swenson, </em>397 U.S. 436, 443 (1970). In a criminal case, the applicability of the doctrine may derive either from the common law, with roots in civil proceedings, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Oppenheimer, </em>242 U.S. 85 (1916); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>431 Mass. 71, 74 (2000) (direct estoppel)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cerveny, </em>387 Mass. 280, 284-285 (1982), or from the protection against double jeopardy of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, <em>Ashe </em>v. <em>Swenson, supra </em>at 445-446; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>389 Mass. 473, 475, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 915 (1983). The latter is not implicated in this case because Stephens was not placed in jeopardy in the District Court. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, supra </em>at 74 n.3; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cerveny, supra </em>at 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The common-law doctrine of collateral estoppel is designed to \u201crelieve parties of the cost and vexation of multiple lawsuits, conserve judicial resources, and, by preventing inconsistent decisions, encourage reliance on adjudication.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Prop. Ins. Underwriting Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Norrington, </em>395 Mass. 751, 756 (1985), quoting <em>Allen </em>v. <em>McCurry, </em>449 U.S. 90, 94 (1980). Historically, mutuality of the parties was required in order for collateral estoppel to apply, see <em>Home Owners Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Northwestern Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>354 Mass. 448, 451-452 (1968), a requirement now abandoned in civil cases. <em>Id. </em>at 455. In criminal cases, however, the doctrine of collateral estoppel generally has continued to apply only where there is mutuality of the parties. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benson, supra </em>at 478 n.6. While the application of nonmutual estoppel in civil cases promotes \u201cjudicial economy and conserve[s] private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>resources without unfairness to the litigant against whom estoppel [is] invoked,\u201d <em>Standefer </em>v. <em>United States, </em>447 U.S. 10, 21 (1980), in criminal cases the policy considerations of efficiency and fairness may be outweighed by the public interest in enforcement of the criminal laws. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cerveny, supra </em>at 286, where this court noted that \u201cthe public interest in securing just and accurate results in the criminal law leads us to conclude that the possibility of inconsistent <em>verdicts </em>should not bar the relitigation of an issue previously decided in favor of another defendant\u201d (emphasis added). In this respect Massachusetts common law mirrored Federal law because the United States Supreme Court had \u201cmade it clear that the Federal law doctrine of nonmutual collateral estoppel does not apply to criminal cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 284. See <em>Standefer </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 25 (doctrine inappropriate where parties not mutual because policy considerations in criminal cases \u201coutweigh the economy concerns that undergird the estoppel doctrine\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">While we have considered whether mutuality of the parties is required where inconsistent verdicts are at issue, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cerveny, supra, </em>we previously have not considered whether mutuality is required for an order suppressing evidence to have preclusive effect against the Commonwealth, a question of law we now consider de nova. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>444 Mass. 526, 532 (2005) (applying de nova review to question whether to adopt \u201cforfeiture by wrongdoing\u201d doctrine).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The \u201ctraditional view\u201d holds that mutuality is required for applicability of the collateral estoppel doctrine to suppression orders, as it is for verdicts. 6 W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 11.2(g), at 111 &amp; n.342 (4th ed. 2004) (\u201cIf evidence found in a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>search is to be offered in the separate trials of defendants <em>A </em>and <em>B </em>and a motion to suppress that evidence is made by A in his case, under the traditional view the ruling thereon does not govern in <em>B\u2019s </em>case\u201d). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Maybusher, </em>735 F.2d 366, 370 (9th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1110 (1985) (order suppressing evidence against codefendants did not have preclusive effect because \u201cit would be unfair to hold the Government in this matter to the determination of the issue regarding the search\u201d in codefendants\u2019 case where government may not have had \u201cincentive\u201d to litigate question fully); <em>State </em>v. <em>Stauffer, </em>112 Ariz. 26, 29 (1975) (State not bound by order suppressing evidence in earlier case against codefendant \u201cbecause the parties to the motion to suppress the evidence were different\u201d); <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>279 Ill. App. 3d 602, 605 (1996) (defendant could not invoke collateral estoppel to bar relitigation of issue in codefendant\u2019s previously allowed motion to suppress evidence because \u201cmutuality is required before collateral estoppel applies in a criminal case\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Stephens argues that we should reject the traditional view because \u201c[cjases refusing to apply nonmutual collateral estop-pel against the government were decided on a much different basis and in a much different context than the present matter.\u201d Pointing to <em>Standefer </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cerveny, supra, </em>he correctly notes that courts have permitted inconsistent verdicts, refusing to give a defendant the benefit of a codefendant\u2019s acquittal and explaining that there may be any number of reasons why the codefendant was acquitted. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cerveny, supra </em>at 285 (finding of not guilty can result from factors having nothing to do with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>defendant\u2019s actual guilt, including \u201can exclusionary rule of evidence, inadequate investigation or proof, the composition of the jury, or the defendant\u2019s own insanity\u201d). In contrast, he contends, a finding of no probable cause to stop and search is a \u201cclean cut\u201d issue \u201cparticularly suited\u201d to collateral estoppel. <em>People </em>v. <em>McGriff, </em>130 A.D.2d 141, 152 (N.Y. 1987). We are not persuaded. While the issues of reasonable suspicion to stop or probable cause to search may be more \u201cclean cut,\u201d the allowance of a motion to suppress in one case may result from factors that have little to do with the validity of a stop or search. In this case, the inconsistent suppression decisions were not based on the same evidence: in the District Court the Commonwealth called only one witness, Trooper Doherty, to testify. In contrast, both officers testified at Stephens\u2019s suppression hearing in the Superior Court, describing in somewhat greater detail not only their observations of Stephens and the codefen-dant, but also their experiences with illegal drug transactions in the area where the events occurred. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>75 N.J. 181, 195 (1977) (State produced no new evidence at second suppression hearing to support validity of search and inconsistent adjudications therefore based on same facts). For the same reasons we have concluded that inconsistent verdicts, while \u201cintellectually discomforting,\u201d must be tolerated to effectuate the societal interest \u201cin securing just and accurate results in the criminal law,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cerveny, supra </em>at 286, there is no sound policy reason why the Commonwealth should be precluded from seeking to enforce the criminal laws against a defendant where, for whatever reason, a codefendant has prevailed on a motion to suppress. See <em>Standefer </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 25, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Standefer, </em>610 F.2d 1076, 1093 (3d Cir. 1979) (\u201cpublic interest in the accuracy and justice of criminal results is greater than the concern for judicial economy professed in civil cases\u201d). As discussed below, the Commonwealth may choose not to take an interlocutory appeal from an incorrect decision on a motion to suppress. See <em>infra </em>at 379-380.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">We are cognizant that in a few cases nonmutual collateral estoppel has been used to bar a State from relitigating a suppression decision. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, supra </em>at 195-196 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>(State bound by allowance of coindictee\u2019s motion to suppress); <em>People </em>v. <em>McGriff, supra </em>at 152 (prosecution barred from relitigating validity of search warrant when different judge had allowed another defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to same warrant); <em>People </em>v. <em>Nieves, </em>106 Misc. 2d 395, 405-406 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1980) (State collaterally estopped from relitigating constitutionality of search warrant in prosecution of codefendants). Those cases, however, remain the clear minority view, and one we do not embrace.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As recently noted by the Supreme Court of Washington, the <em>Gonzalez </em>case is \u201cthe only remaining, still valid, appellate decision allowing nonmutual collateral estoppel to bar a criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Mullin-Coston, </em>152 Wash. 2d 107, 120 (2004) (concluding that doctrine of nonmutual collateral estoppel was not applicable to jury verdicts in criminal cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Mutuality of parties in criminal cases is required for another reason: to permit the Commonwealth to decide, depending on the import of each case and the resources available, whether to take an interlocutory appeal from a suppression order. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (a) (2), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E. A single justice \u201crarely\u201d refuses to grant a Commonwealth application when its case depends on the evidence that has been suppressed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>431 Mass. 71, 76 (2000). But a decision by the Commonwealth not to pursue an interlocutory appeal may be based on considerations independent of the merits of any appeal. The Commonwealth may elect to nol pros an indictment rather than appeal from an order suppressing evidence when a charge does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>not justify the cost of appeal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Or, if evidence is suppressed, the Commonwealth may decide to proceed without the evidence rather than seek an appeal. See 6 W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 11.2(g), at 103 &amp; n.313 (4th ed. 2004) (prosecutor may elect not to take appeal from order suppressing evidence if \u201cthe objects suppressed are not an important part of the proof\u201d). Here, the codefendant was charged with possession and distribution of cocaine, first offense. The Commonwealth, in its discretion, may have concluded that the charge did not justify the cost of appeal, or may have exercised its discretion not to appeal for other reasons. Abandoning a requirement of mutuality would compel the Commonwealth to pursue an interlocutory appeal from an order suppressing evidence in every case where a codefendant or coindictee did not participate in the suppression hearing. The resulting burden on all parties and the courts is obvious. See 6 W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 11. 2(g), at 103, quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 28 comment i (1980) (if it were necessary \u201cto appeal solely for the purpose of avoiding the application of the rule of issue preclusion, then the rule might be responsible for increasing the burdens of litigation on the parties and the courts rather than lightening those burdens\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Stephens points to our recent decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cabrera, </em>449 Mass. 825, 829 (2007), as supporting his claim that mutuality is not required for an order suppressing evidence to have preclusive effect against the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We held in that case that for collateral estoppel to apply in the context of a suppression decision \u201c(1) the issues in the two proceedings must be identical[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]; (2) the party estopped must have had sufficient incentive to litigate the issue fully and vigorously; (3) <em>the party </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number><em>estopped, </em>must have been a party to the previous litigation; (4) the applicable law must be identical in both proceedings; and (5) the first proceeding must have resulted in a final judgment on the merits[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>] such that the defendant had sufficient incentive and an opportunity to appeal\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>While a cursory reading of the third <em>Cabrera </em>factor may suggest that collateral estoppel could apply in a criminal case where there is nonmutuality of all parties, referencing as it does in the singular that \u201cthe party estopped\u201d (here the Commonwealth) must have been a party to the previous litigation for collateral estoppel to apply, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cabrera, supra, </em>there was in fact mutuality of the parties,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and the case did not involve or discuss nonmutual collateral estoppel. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cabrera, supra, </em>does not govern our decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">3. <em>Validity of the stop and search. </em>In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we accept the motion judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error, and conduct an independent review of the judge\u2019s ultimate findings and conclusions of law. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>449 Mass. 476, 480 (2007). We defer to the motion judge\u2019s determination regarding the weight and credibility of the testimony presented at the suppression hearing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yesilciman, </em>406 Mass. 736, 743 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">We first determine at what point the officers\u2019 interaction with Stephens \u201cstopped\u201d him, necessitating a finding of either reasonable suspicion or probable cause. We do not agree with Stephens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>that the officers\u2019 \u201capproach\u201d to his vehicle was unlawful and not justified by reasonable suspicion. The officers\u2019 approach did not constitute a stop; they were standing outside of the Ford and their vehicles did not block the Ford. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doulette, </em>414 Mass. 653, 655 (1993) (trooper\u2019s actions in approaching and shining flashlight into parked vehicle during check of commuter rail parking lot known for criminal activity was not stop under Fourth Amendment to United States Constitution). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ortiz-Monroy, </em>332 F.3d 525, 528 (8th Cir. 2003) (no stop where officer approached parked car in rest area and knocked on window); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hendricks, </em>319 F.3d 993, 1001 (7th Cir. 2003) (no stop where officer approached vehicle parked at gasoline station). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helme, 399 </em>Mass. 298, 303 (1987) (police officer conducted stop for Fourth Amendment purposes when he parked cruiser to block defendant\u2019s vehicle from leaving bar\u2019s parking lot); <em>Commonwealth v. King, </em>389 Mass. 233, 241 (1983) (officer intruded on Fourth Amendment rights when his cruiser blocked vehicle parked in rest area). The Fourth Amendment does not require \u201cthat the police be aware of specific and articulable facts that an individual is involved in criminal activity in order to look at the individual or the individual\u2019s automobile.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doulette, supra </em>at 657.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Rather, we agree with the motion judge that Stephens was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>stopped \u201cat the point where the police officers approached the vehicle <em>and </em>opened the doors\u201d (emphasis added). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stoute, </em>422 Mass. 782, 786 (1996) (defendant seized for purposes of art. 14 of Massachusetts Declaration of Rights because reasonable person would not have felt free to leave). The motion judge concluded that opening the door of the Ford was justified for two reasons: the officers had reasonable suspicion to believe that their safety was in danger, and based on what they had noted earlier, they had reasonable suspicion to believe that an illegal drug transaction was underway. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DePeiza, </em>449 Mass. 367, 371 (2007) (officers had reasonable suspicion to stop person walking with arm stiff and straight against body, shifting weight and appearing nervous while talking with officers, and attempting to conceal side of body from them). With regard to the first justification (safety concerns), we agree with the motion judge who concluded that Trooper Doherty reasonably believed that his safety was in danger when he saw a black object in Stephens\u2019s hands, which Stephens \u201cquickly lowered.\u201d Because the trooper \u201creasonably believed [the object] could be a weapon,\u201d he was justified in \u201copening the door, securing the defendant\u2019s hands and ordering the defendant from the car for a pat frisk limited to finding weapons.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fraser, </em>410 Mass. 541, 544-546 &amp; n.4 (1991) (officer with reasonable belief that defendant is \u201carmed and dangerous\u201d may conduct patfrisk to ensure safety if officer has legitimate basis for being in proximity).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Stephens argues that the motion judge\u2019s conclusion was erroneous because a stop cannot be justified \u201con the basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>ensuing safety concerns.\u201d See R.G. Stearns, Massachusetts Criminal Law: A Prosecutor\u2019s Guide 155 (27th ed. 2007) (justification for stop cannot be \u201cbootstrapped from events occurring after an officer has manifested the intention to effect a seizure\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wren, </em>391 Mass. 705, 708 n.2 (1984) (when officer has no basis for initiating stop, defendant\u2019s flight in response to show of authority cannot justify stop). This is not a case, however, where the officers already had conducted a threshold inquiry, and there \u201cwas no need for further protective precautions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Loughlin, </em>385 Mass. 60, 62-63 &amp; n.3 (1982), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferrara, </em>376 Mass. 502, 505 (1978) (no justification for exit order issued after occupants of vehicle in breakdown lane complied promptly with officer\u2019s request for identification). Trooper Doherty was justified in opening the door of the Ford and taking hold of Stephens\u2019s hands in order to ensure his safety. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fraser, supra </em>at 544-546 (patfrisk did not violate Fourth Amendment where officer reasonably believed defendant was armed and dangerous even without reasonable suspicion for stop), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knowles, ante </em>91, 99-108 (2008) (officer responding to report of man swinging baseball bat did not act reasonably in concern for safety when, after seeing defendant throw object into trunk of vehicle and without first asking to speak with defendant, he ordered defendant to stop, step away from vehicle, and approach with hands visible).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">With regard to the second justification for the stop (the officers\u2019 belief that an illegal drug sale was underway), the motion judge concluded that the \u201ctwo extremely experienced police officers\u201d had reasonable suspicion to believe that an illegal drug transaction was in progress because they had seen the defendants follow \u201cthe precise script of the typical illegal narcotic transaction\u201d in that area of Lawrence: the defendants had done the \u201cexpected and routine thing,\u201d i.e., had met at a parking lot in an area known for illicit drug dealing and moved to a \u201cmore remote location\u201d to complete the illegal transaction. It was a pattern that both officers had witnessed \u201con numerous occasions\u201d and with which they were \u201cintimately familiar.\u201d Stephens counters that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>this \u201cinnocent activity\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> was not sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion, and that to conclude otherwise would mean that \u201cany two friends who happen to meet up in a \u2018high crime\u2019 area and proceed together in only one car would be open to scrutiny.\u201d But the aggregation of otherwise innocent activities may give rise to reasonable suspicion. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>430 Mass. 725, 728-729 (2000) (officers had reasonable suspicion to stop suspects who entered hotel with no luggage, visited suspected drug dealer\u2019s room for short period, emerged with two heavy suitcases, and drove erratically and evasively because \u201c[seemingly innocent activities taken together can give rise to reasonable suspicion justifying a threshold inquiry\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sweezey, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 48, 49 (2000) (reasonable suspicion for stop where officers noted defendant approach other vehicle, talk with driver briefly, receive paper bag, and return to own vehicle).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The troopers\u2019 warrantless search of the Ford was also lawful. We agree with the motion judge that the observations made by the officers during the stop \u201celevated [their] reasonable suspicion to probable cause.\u201d \u201c[P]robable cause exists where, at the moment of arrest, the facts and circumstances within the knowledge of the police are enough to warrant a prudent person in believing that the individual arrested has committed or was committing an offense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santaliz, </em>413 Mass. 238, 241 (1992), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Storey, </em>378 Mass. 312, 321 (1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 955 (1980). Here, in addition to the suspicious activity that justified the stop, Trooper Doherty saw a \u201cconsiderable amount of money\u201d in Stephens\u2019s lap, as well as cut and tied plastic bags that were consistent with the packaging of cocaine. Sergeant Hughes noted the codefendant make a \u201cfurtive\u201d movement toward the center console. Both troopers obtained statements from the men, after issuing Miranda warnings, which, in the motion judge\u2019s words, \u201cmay have added <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>to the probable cause.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This was sufficient to constitute probable cause to arrest Stephens for engaging in an illegal drug transaction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>449 Mass. 476, 481 (2007) (troopers had probable cause to arrest when having witnessed defendants emerge from restroom with known drug dealer after dealer told undercover officer that he would be meeting with \u201chis guys\u201d in restroom to obtain drugs); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>448 Mass. 711, 714-715 (2007) (officer had probable cause to arrest defendant for drug transaction where officer saw defendant pace back and forth, retrieve item from shoe, and hand it to person who approached him in area known for drug sales).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Because Trooper Doherty had probable cause to arrest Stephens, the search of the vehicle was a valid search incident to the arrest.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 1. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>420 Mass. 542, 551 (1995) (search of defendant\u2019s pants was lawful where officer had probable cause at time of search to arrest for illegal drug transaction). That Trooper Doherty searched Stephens\u2019s vehicle prior to placing him under arrest does not make the search of the vehicle unreasonable. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>413 Mass. 598, 602-603 (1992) (search for weapon that preceded arrest valid where officer had probable cause to arrest independent of results of search). The search of the Ford and the arrest of Stephens were \u201croughly contemporaneous.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Washington, supra </em>at 481-482, and cases cited (\u201c[A] suspect need not be formally under arrest at the precise moment of a search incident to an arrest .... However, the search and the arrest still must be roughly contemporaneous\u201d).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">4. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>Stephens argues that the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>improperly denied his motions for a required finding of not guilty<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> because the evidence did not establish that he was the seller, as opposed to the buyer, in the transaction.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Viewed in its light most favorable to the Commonwealth, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979), we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to find Stephens guilty of unlawful distribution of cocaine. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>446 Mass. 620, 623-624 (2006) (evidence supported inference that defendant was drug seller rather than buyer where police had seen exchange in which defendant received cash from other man and defendant had only money and keys when stopped). The evidence need not require the jury to draw the inference of guilt; it is sufficient that the evidence permitted the inference that the jury obviously drew. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, supra </em>at 678-679. Here, the jury reasonably could have inferred that it was Stephens who unlawfully distributed the cocaine. The officers found, in his lap, clear plastic bags with the tops knotted and comers cut off, with additional altered plastic bags in his pocket. An expert witness for the Commonwealth testified that dealers package cocaine in plastic bags by cutting off the comers.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The officers testified that from their experience they were familiar with the modus operandi of the purchase of illegal dmgs, conduct that mirrored the conduct here: the codefendant arrived at the restaurant parking lot first, both vehicles moved to a second location, and the codefendant entered Stephens\u2019s vehicle to complete the drug transaction. The jury heard expert testimony that, where police have used undercover agents to purchase illicit dmgs, a dealer is \u201c[vjery seldom\u201d the first to arrive at the agreed location and \u201c[vjery seldom\u201d enters the vehicle of the would-be purchaser (the undercover agent).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Furthermore, the officers found $345 in Stephens\u2019s lap. On the passenger side of the console, toward which the codefendant had made a \u201cfurtive\u201d movement when he saw the trooper, they found three bags containing cocaine (two \u201ceight balls\u201d and a \u201cforty\u201d bag). The Commonwealth\u2019s expert testified that the approximate cost of two \u201ceight balls\u201d and a \u201cforty\u201d bag of cocaine in May, 2003, was $340. All of this evidence permitted the jury reasonably to draw an inference that Stephens was the seller; his motions for a required finding of not guilty were properly denied. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>441 Mass. 390, 400-402 (2004) (evidence sufficient to show intent to distribute narcotics where defendant possessed several \u201cdime\u201d bags of marijuana, almost $500 in cash, pager, and cellular telephone, and expert testified that facts consistent with intent to distribute).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">We affirm the judge\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress.
