After an evidentiary hearing, an arbitrator determined that the appointment violated the collective bargaining agreement applicable to city employees; directed the mayor to appoint the grievant to the position of director of veterans\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>services; and ordered the city to reimburse the grievant for lost wages and benefits, with interest compounded quarterly at twelve per cent. The city filed an application in the Superior Court seeking to vacate the arbitration award, and the union filed a counterclaim requesting that the award be affirmed. A judge in the Superior Court entered judgment on the pleadings for the union, affirming the award. The Appeals Court affirmed the judgment. <em>Somerville </em>v. <em>Somerville Municipal Employees Ass\u2019n, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 583 (2007). We granted the city\u2019s application for further appellate review. We conclude that the explicit legislative directive of G. L. c. 115, \u00a7 10, that a city\u2019s director of veterans\u2019 services \u201cshall be appointed ... by the mayor, with the approval of the city council,\u201d precludes the challenged appointment from being a proper subject for collective bargaining or arbitration. Accordingly, we now reverse the judgment and order that the award be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">1. The relevant background is as follows. The union represents two groups of city employees: unit A and unit B. Each group has its own collective bargaining agreement with the city. The unit A agreement generally covers department heads; the unit B agreement covers so-called \u201crank and file\u201d employees. The city and the union agree that the position of director of veterans\u2019 services is a unit A position and that the relevant language in both collective bargaining agreements is essentially the same. (We shall refer to the unit B collective bargaining agreement, which is the one applicable to this case, as simply the collective bargaining agreement.)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Article VII of the collective bargaining agreement sets forth procedures required for making promotions and filling vacancies. Section (h)(2) of art. VII states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">\u201cIn the case of a vacancy in any Unit A position for which no Unit A employee is selected, Unit B employees may apply and will be considered on the basis of the qualifications established for the position. In the event that any Unit B applicants and any non-Unit B applicants meet the qualifications(s) established for the [Unit A] position, and their respective qualification(s) are substantially equal, the [Unit A] position will be filled by the senior Unit B Employee among such applicants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>In October of 2003, the city posted the position of veterans\u2019 services director, listing the requirements and necessary qualifications for the job. Among candidates who applied for the job were Paul Nelson, a unit B city employee, and Frank Senesi, an elections commissioner for the city, who is not a member of the union. Both candidates are veterans.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">After the city\u2019s mayor hired Senesi for the job, Nelson filed a grievance with the union, claiming that the city had violated art. VII of the collective bargaining agreement in the appointment of Senesi. The dispute proceeded to arbitration, pursuant to a provision of the collective bargaining agreement providing for final and binding arbitration of disputes arising under the agreement. The question before the arbitrator was: \u201cDid the City of Somerville violate the Parties\u2019 Unit B Collective Bargaining Agreement by failing to appoint the Grievant, Paul Nelson,[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] to the position of Veterans\u2019 Services Director in or about January 2004: If so, what shall be the remedy?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">In a memorandum of decision and order, the arbitrator stated his opinion that one of the agreements made by the city in the collective bargaining agreement is to prefer union members over nonunion members with respect to union jobs. The arbitrator went on to reason as follows: Although the terms of the collective bargaining agreement permit the city to select a nonunion candidate for a vacant union position, the city must do so in a manner consistent with art. VII. When the choice for a unit A position is between a unit B and a nonunion candidate, it is the city\u2019s burden to establish, by objective evidence, that each candidate\u2019s qualifications are \u201chead and shoulders\u201d above those of any unit A candidates bypassed for the job. Then, should one candidate\u2019s qualifications be demonstrably superior to the other\u2019s, that candidate, whether unit B or nonunion, may be chosen. The arbitrator determined that, because the city had failed to establish that the qualifications of Senesi were demonstrably superior to Nelson\u2019s, who was also the senior candidate of the two, the city had violated art. VU(h)(2), when Senesi was appointed director of veterans\u2019 services. The award directed the city to appoint Nelson in his place.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>The city sought to vacate the award, pursuant to G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 <em>(a) </em>(3), which provides that \u201cthe superior court shall vacate an award if . . . the arbitrators exceeded their powers or rendered an award requiring a person to commit an act or engage in conduct prohibited by [S]tote or [F]ederal law.\u201d The city argued that the arbitrator had no authority to rule on the appointment, because the mayor\u2019s authority to appoint a director of veterans\u2019 services, conferred by G. L. c. 115, \u00a7 10, is exclusive and nondelegable and, therefore, not subject to collective bargaining or arbitration. The union, in response, filed a counterclaim asking that the award be confirmed pursuant to G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Considering the parties\u2019 cross motions on the pleadings, the judge concluded that, although the mayor\u2019s authority to appoint an individual to the position of veterans\u2019 services director is not an issue for collective bargaining, the procedure surrounding the appointment of an individual to any unit A position is an \u201cancillary matter\u201d appropriate for collective bargaining, <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 172, 179 (1997), which the city may, and did in this case, agree to arbitrate. We disagree with this conclusion and now proceed to explain why.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">2. We have recognized a strong public policy favoring collective bargaining between public employers and employees over certain conditions and terms of employment. See, e.g., <em>School Comm. of Pittsfield </em>v. <em>United Educators of Pittsfield, </em>438 Mass. 753, 761-762 (2003); <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>438 Mass. 177, 180-181 (2002). This policy is codified in the broad statutory language of G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6, providing that \u201c[t]he employer and the exclusive representative . . . shall negotiate in good faith with respect to wages, hours, standards [of] productivity, and performance, and any other terms and conditions of employment\u201d in keeping with the objective of creating a collective bargaining agreement. General Laws c. 150E, \u00a7 7 <em>id), </em>further provides that, where there is a conflict between a statute and the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement, the collective bargaining agreement \u201cshall prevail\u201d if the statute is one that is enumerated therein. See <em>Chief Justice for Admin. &amp; Mgt. of the Trial Court </em>v. <em>Office &amp; Professional Employees Int\u2019l Union, Local 6, </em>441 Mass. 620, 629 (2004). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>General Laws c. 115,\u00a7 10, however, is not among those statutes enumerated in \u00a7 7 <em>(d), </em>which the Legislature made subject to collective bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The narrow circumstances for vacating an arbitrator\u2019s award under G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 <em>(a), </em>see <em>School Comm. of Hanover </em>v. <em>Hanover Teachers Ass\u2019n, </em>435 Mass. 736, 740 (2002), reflect an (arguably) equally strong policy favoring arbitration. See <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Dedham, </em>440 Mass. 74, 78 (2003); <em>School Comm. of Pittsfield </em>v. <em>United Educators of Pittsfield, supra </em>at 758. Whether an award is improper because an arbitrator exceeded his authority is determined on a case-by-case basis. See <em>id. </em>at 759, citing <em>Higher Educ. Coordinating Council/Roxbury Community College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Teachers\u2019 Ass\u2019n/ Mass. Community College Council, </em>423 Mass. 23, 31-32 (1996). \u201c[Statutes not specifically enumerated in \u00a7 7 (\u00bf7) will prevail over contrary terms in collective bargaining agreements.\u201d <em>School Comm. of Natick </em>v. <em>Education Ass\u2019n of Natick, </em>423 Mass. 34, 39 (1996), quoting <em>National Ass\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>419 Mass. 448, 452, cert. denied, 515 U.S. 1161 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Our analysis begins with the presumption that the collective bargaining agreement compels the outcome directed by the award and ends with a determination whether that outcome materially conflicts with G. L. c. 115, \u00a7 10. See <em>Chief Justice for Admin. &amp; Mgt. of the Trial Court </em>v. <em>Office &amp; Professional Employees Int\u2019l Union, Local 6, supra. </em>See also <em>Fall River </em>v. <em>AFSCME Council 93, Local 3177, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 404, 410-411 (2004); <em>Leominster </em>v. <em>International Bhd. of Police Officers, Local 338, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 121, 124-125 (1992), citing <em>Rooney </em>v. <em>Yarmouth, </em>410 Mass. 485, 493 n.4 (1991). We have found a conflict to be material when an arbitration award usurps a discretionary power granted by the Legislature to a public authority that, by statute, cannot be delegated to another. See, e.g., <em>School Comm. of Natick </em>v. <em>Education Ass\u2019n of Natick, supra </em>at 39-41; <em>Massachusetts Coalition of Police, Local 165 </em>v. <em>Northborough, </em>416 Mass. 252, 255-256 (1993); <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth. </em>v. <em>Local 589, Amalgamated Transit Union, </em>406 Mass. 36, 39-41 (1989). This is such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">The position at issue is a creation of statute. The Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>has expressly directed city mayors, in G. L. c. 115, \u00a7 10, as amended by St. 1972, c. 122, to establish and maintain a local department of veterans\u2019 services \u201cfor the purpose of furnishing such information, advice and assistance to veterans and their dependents ... to enable them to procure benefits to which they are or may be entitled relative to employment, vocational or other educational opportunities, hospitalization, medical care, pensions, and other veterans\u2019 benefits.\u201d The Legislature also has specifically instructed that the director of the department, as well as any assistants or deputy directors, \u201cshall be a veteran and shall be appointed in a city by the mayor, with the approval of the city council.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The statutory language is unambiguous. The Legislature has established one prerequisite to eligibility for the position of director of veterans\u2019 services \u2014 that the person be a veteran. Beyond that requirement, the authority to appoint a veteran to that position is granted to the mayor (subject to the approval of city council).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The union accepts this premise, as it must, but contends nevertheless that the statutory language reflects a legislative intent to impose only a general obligation on mayors to hire someone to deliver the legislatively specified services. The union argues that art. Vfl(h)(2) of the collective bargaining agreement does not require the mayor to appoint a specific candidate, but merely expresses the city\u2019s promise to give a union candidate preference over a nonunion candidate (should the two be \u201csubstantially equal\u201d). Therefore, according to the union, art. VH(h)(2) does not \u201cmaterially conflict\u201d with the authority imposed on the mayor by G. L. c. 115, \u00a7 10. See, e.g., <em>Chief Justice for Admin. &amp; Mgt. of the Trial Court </em>v. <em>Office &amp; Professional Employees Int\u2019l Union, Local 6, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">We do not find this interpretation of the statute persuasive. The practical effect of following the procedures set forth in art. VII(h)(2), in this case, dictates the candidate to be appointed and, in so doing, usurps the authority specifically conferred on a mayor by legislative directive, to appoint, with the approval of the city council, a director of veterans\u2019 services. Indeed, the union\u2019s position leaves nothing for the city council to approve. We, therefore, discern a material conflict between the specific statutory power vested in the mayor by G. L. c. 115, \u00a7 10, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>the terms of the collective bargaining agreement setting forth required procedures for filling vacancies in unit A positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The Appeals Court has stated that, \u201cwhile an underlying decision may be reserved to the exclusive prerogative of the public employer . . . , the public employer may be required to arbitrate with respect to ancillary matters, such as procedures that the employer has agreed to follow prior to making the decision.\u201d <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 172, 179 (1997). In question in the <em>Lynn </em>case was the authority of the city\u2019s fire chief to file an application for the retirement of a fire fighter, without first engaging in collective bargaining with the union, and while the fire fighter\u2019s application for an accidental disability pension was pending before the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board. See <em>id. </em>at 175. The Appeals Court carefully differentiated between the broad category of cases involving challenges to an arbitration award, in which the public employer is operating under statutory authority granting general management powers, not listed in \u00a7 7 (d), and a narrow category in which the governmental employer acts under a specific authorizing statute, also not listed in \u00a7 7 <em>(d). </em>See <em>id. </em>at 178-182. The Appeals Court explained: \u201cIn the range of cases where the governmental employer acts pursuant to broad, general management powers, the danger is presented, as pointed out in <em>School Comm. of Newton </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>388 Mass. [557,] 564-566 [(1983)], that to recognize the statutory authority as exclusive would substantially undermine the purpose of G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6, to provide for meaningful collective bargaining as a general rule with respect to compensation and other terms and conditions of employment. That danger simply is not present when the governmental employer acts pursuant to a specific, narrow statutory mandate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 182. The Appeals Court concluded that the fire chief\u2019s specific authority to act under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 (1) (a), left \u201cnothing to bargain about\u201d and, therefore, was a matter of exclusive managerial prerogative not subject to collective bargaining. <em>Id. </em>at 184. We agree with what was said in the <em>Lynn </em>case and, moreover, find the reasoning there fully applicable to the circumstances before us. The mayor\u2019s specific authority granted by G. L. c. 115, \u00a7 10, leaves \u201cnothing to bargain about\u201d and, moreover, is undermined entirely should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>the mayor be bound to the procedures set forth in art. VII(h)(2). We cannot view the challenged decision to hire Senesi an \u201cancillary matter\u201d to the mayor\u2019s appointment power.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">In summary, the phrase \u201cshall be appointed by\u201d confers on the mayor the exclusive authority to decide which candidate shall serve as the director of veterans\u2019 service, subject only to the approval of the city council. Article VII(h)(2), as applied to this case, impermissibly infringes on this authority. Had the Legislature intended that the choice of director of veterans\u2019 services be open to the collective bargaining process, it easily could have included G. L. c. 115, \u00a7 10, in the statutes enumerated in G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 7 <em>(d). </em>In the absence of such inclusion, the city could not agree to collective bargaining provisions that interfere with the specific legislative directive contained in G. L. c. 115, \u00a7 10. It follows that the arbitrator was without authority to direct the city to appoint Nelson to the position of director of veterans\u2019 services. See <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Police Superior Officers Fed\u2019n, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 296, 299 (2001), quoting <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 260, 270 n.3 (1996) (\u201cThe fact that the city agreed to arbitrate the grievance is of no legal consequence if the issue is beyond the authority of the arbitrator\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">3. The judgment of the Superior Court is reversed. A new judgment shall enter vacating the arbitrator\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-7\">There were two grievants initially, but one withdrew his claim following the first day of arbitration hearings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b520-8\">Examples of cases in which we concluded that management decisions made in the public sector pursuant to a general statutory authority involved ancillary matters that are subject to collective bargaining are <em>Chief Justice for Admin. &amp; Mgt. of the Trial Court </em>v. <em>Office &amp; Professional Employees Int\u2019l Union, Local 6, </em>441 Mass. 620, 628-629 (2004) (Chief Justice may agree to follow procedures prior to making decisions under statutory authority to transfer employees); <em>School Comm. of Pittsfield </em>v. <em>United Educators of Pittsfield, </em>438 Mass. 753, 764 (2003) (although principal has statutory authority to determine whom to hire, involuntary transfer of teacher to different school remained proper subject of collective bargaining); and <em>School Comm. of Newton </em>v. <em>Newton Sch.
