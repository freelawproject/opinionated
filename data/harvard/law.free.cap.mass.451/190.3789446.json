The Appeals Court affirmed the decision of a single justice who had affirmed a decision of the reviewing board of the Department of Industrial Accidents (board) holding that, where claims are filed by workers\u2019 compensation insurers for reimbursement pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 37, and the worker sustained an injury while the 1985 version of the statute was in effect, no statute of limitations applies to the claim. <em>Oakes\u2019s Case, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 81, 82 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-15\">This case was paired for argument with <em>Alves\u2019s Case, ante </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>171 (2008), because it raised the same issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth in the decision in <em>Alves\u2019s Case, supra, </em>released today, we affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b211-7\">In its brief to the Appeals Court in <em>Oakes\u2019s Case, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 81 (2006), the Fund did not raise the issue of borrowing a statute of limitations from an analogous statute. Therefore the argument is waived in this case. Moreover, in its brief, the Fund does not argue that the Appeals Court\u2019s sole ground for rejecting Oakes\u2019s appeal, that the two-year statute of limitations contained in the 1991 amendment to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 37, should apply to the 1985 version of the statute, is erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b211-6\">Botsford, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ahy-dedup-0\">(concurring, with whom Marshall, C.J., and Cordy, J., join). For the reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in <em>Alves\u2019s Case, ante </em>171, 180-189 (2008) (Botsford, J., dissenting), I disagree that no statute of limitations applies to claims for reimbursement of compensation for second injuries that occurred while the 1985 version of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 37, was in effect. However, I concur in the disposition of this case because, as the court points out, <em>ante </em>at 191 n.l, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust Fund failed to argue to the Appeals Court that the court should borrow a statute of limitations for the 1985 version of \u00a7 37, and thus has waived the ground on which my dissent in the <em>Alves </em>case is based.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
