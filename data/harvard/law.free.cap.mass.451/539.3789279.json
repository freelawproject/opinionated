In 2003, the planning board of the town of Groton (planning board) issued a special permit to the defendant, A.L. Prime Energy Consultants (A.L. Prime), pursuant to \u00a7 218-30 (G) (1) of the town zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>bylaw (bylaw).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The permit authorized A.L. Prime to improve and modernize a gasoline station that it operates in Groton. The plaintiffs, abutters or abutters to the abutters to the gasoline station, appealed from the decision to the Superior Court, claiming they were \u201caggrieved\u201d by the planning board\u2019s decision. G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A judge in the Superior Court allowed A.L. Prime\u2019s motion to dismiss, ruling that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the issuance of the special permit because they had failed to put forth credible evidence that they were \u201caggrieved.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The Appeals Court reversed, concluding that the plaintiffs could \u201cderive standing\u201d on one of their claims from the language of the bylaw itself. <em>Sweenie </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Groton, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 477, 484-485 (2007). We granted A.L. Prime\u2019s application for further appellate review. We affirm the decision of the Superior Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>1. <em>Background. </em>As described more fully by the Appeals Court, <em>Sweenie </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Groton, supra </em>at 479-480, A.L. Prime now operates a gasoline station that has been located on the site in Groton since the 1940\u2019s. In August, 2003, A.L. Prime applied for a special permit for the \u201c[u]pgrade of [the] existing gasoline filling station and replacement of three (3) 5,000 gallon underground storage tanks with two (2) underground storage tanks totaling 20,000 gallons.\u201d After conducting five public hearings,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> at each of which at least one of the plaintiffs expressed opposition to the issuance of a special permit, in December, 2003, the planning board voted unanimously to grant a special permit to A.L. Prime. The permit authorizes the replacement of three old, single-walled gasoline storage tanks with two larger, double-walled tanks that would be capable of rapid detection of any leaks, and would comply with all Massachusetts regulations for fire prevention, spill containment, and overfill prevention. <em>Id. </em>at 480. The special permit also permits A.L. Prime to raze the existing gasoline station building, replacing it with a smaller structure containing a convenience store. A six-foot high stockade fence, buffered by shrubbery, would separate the parcel from abutters.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">In their appeal to the Superior Court the plaintiffs alleged, among other things, that the removal of the existing storage tanks could potentially harm their drinking water, which comes from nearby residential wells.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In response to discovery propounded by A.L. Prime,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the plaintiffs asserted that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>changes to the existing gasoline station would cause a threat of contamination of their drinking water caused by gasoline spillage during replacement and expansion of the underground storage tanks; an increase in artificial light on their properties at night; a decrease in their privacy; and an increase in traffic and related safety and noise concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">In June, 2005, A.L. Prime moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (1), 365 Mass. 754 (1974),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> supported by affidavits and exhibits addressing each of the plaintiffs\u2019 claimed adverse impacts. These included an affidavit from the president of A.L. Prime describing the new storage tanks, including their double-walled construction and leak detective systems; a \u201ctank plan\u201d prepared by a professional engineer, which indicates that the \u201cunderground tank installation shall comply with all applicable regulations, all requirements of Federal, State, and local codes\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>; a \u201clighting plan\u201d prepared by the same engineer, which demonstrates that no light will pass further from the site than forty feet onto a vacant lot that abuts the station; a traffic impact study from the same engineer concluding that there would be no increase in traffic; and an affidavit from an acoustical engineer to the effect that the proposed improvements would cause no increase in audible noise at the plaintiffs\u2019 residences and would likely reduce the noise level. The plaintiffs opposed the motion to dismiss, but filed no affidavits or other materials either contesting the expert opinions and affidavits of A.L. Prime or supporting their own claims. In January, 2006, a judge in the Superior Court allowed A.L. Prime\u2019s motion, concluding that the \u201cconcerns\u201d were \u201cpurely speculative\u201d and that the plaintiffs had failed to put forth credible evidence to support any of their claims. The plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The Appeals Court agreed, noting that the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cconcerns\u201d did not rise \u201cbeyond the level of speculation.\u201d <em>Sweenie </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Groton, supra </em>at 483. The court nonetheless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>determined that the plaintiffs had standing to pursue one of their claims \u2014 their claim that the replacement and expansion of the underground storage tanks could potentially harm their drinking water \u2014 reasoning that the water contamination claim did not \u201crequire evidentiary substantiation in order to support their standing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the view of the Appeals Court, the language of the bylaw \u201ccodifies the abutters\u2019 fears,\u201d from which the plaintiffs could derive standing. <em>Id. </em>at 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, only a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d by a decision of a permitting authority has standing to appeal from the decision to the Superior Court. See note 9, <em>supra. </em>A \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d is one who \u201csuffers some infringement of his legal rights.\u201d <em>Marashlian </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Newburyport, </em>421 Mass. 719, 721 (1996), quoting <em>Circle Lounge &amp; Grille, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>324 Mass. 427, 430 (1949). The injury must be more than speculative, and plaintiffs \u201cmust put forth credible evidence to substantiate claims of injury to their legal rights.\u201d <em>Marashlian </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Newburyport, supra </em>at 723.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">The bylaw at issue provides that where a special permit is sought for a site in a water resource protection overlay district, the planning board \u201cshall give consideration to . . . the degree of threat to water quality that would result if the control measures failed.\u201d See note 2, <em>supra. </em>The Appeals Court concluded that this required consideration of the degree of threat \u201cnecessarily\u201d permits parties such as the plaintiffs who allege that they would be exposed to the threat of water contamination to challenge the planning board\u2019s decision in court. <em>Sweenie </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Groton, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 477, 485 (2007). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>support of its holding, the Appeals Court pointed to <em>Monks </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Plymouth, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 685 (1994) <em>(Monks), </em>deeming that case the \u201cmost closely fitting precedent.\u201d <em>Sweenie </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Groton, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The cases are different, however, in one crucial respect. <em>Monks </em>involved the potential adverse impact of a proposed cellular telephone tower on the plaintiffs\u2019 view from their home. The relevant bylaw under which the cellular telephone company obtained a permit to construct the tower conditioned the grant on a finding by the board of appeals that the proposed structure would not detract from the visual character or quality of the neighborhood. See <em>Monks, supra </em>at 688. While aesthetic or visual impacts generally are not cognizable injuries under zoning regulations, <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, </em>434 Mass. 141, 146-147 (2001), the Appeals Court held in <em>Monks </em>that, by conditioning the grant of the special permit on such a finding, the town had \u201ccreated and defined a protected interest.\u201d <em>Monks, supra. </em>The <em>Monks </em>court then reviewed the summary judgment record<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and determined that those plaintiffs had \u201cbrought themselves within the legal scope of that protection by establishing the direct visual effect of the proposed tower\u201d by presenting credible evidence to substantiate their claims of injury. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Even if the bylaw under which the planning board granted A.L. Prime\u2019s special permit \u201ccreated and defined a protected interest,\u201d <em>Monks, supra </em>at 688 \u2014 by requiring the planning board to give consideration to the potential threat to water quality that would result if the safety elements of the gasoline stor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>age tanks fail \u2014 this alone is not a sufficient basis on which to confer standing. In <em>Monks </em>the plaintiffs established the link between the bylaw and themselves by producing evidence of the actual visible impact on their property. Here, the plaintiffs produced no credible evidence to bring themselves within the legal scope of the protected interest created by the bylaw. They bear the burden, see note 11, <em>supra, </em>of substantiating their claims regarding any potential threat to the quality of their drinking water in order to bring <em>themselves </em>within the legal scope of that interest. See <em>Standerwick </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Andover, </em>447 Mass. 20, 30 (2006) (referring to \u201cour longstanding jurisprudence that standing to challenge a zoning decision is conferred only on those who can plausibly demonstrate that a proposed project will injure their own personal legal interests <em>and </em>that the injury is to a specific interest that the applicable zoning statute, ordinance, or bylaw at issue is intended to protect\u201d [emphasis in original]); <em>Marashlian </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Newburyport, supra </em>at 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The language of a bylaw cannot be sufficient in itself to confer standing: the creation of a protected interest (by statute, ordinance, bylaw, or otherwise) cannot be conflated with the additional, individualized requirements that establish standing. To conclude that a plaintiff can derive standing to challenge the issuance of a special permit from the language of a relevant bylaw, without more, eliminates the requirement that a plaintiff \u201cplausibly demonstrate\u201d a cognizable interest in order to establish that he is \u201caggrieved.\u201d <em>Standerwick </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Andover, supra </em>at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">In this case, the judge found that the plaintiffs had not done so, concluding that the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cfears are purely speculative and not in accordance with the standing requirements.\u201d On our own review of the record,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> we conclude that the judge\u2019s finding that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are speculative and that the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>offered no credible evidence to substantiate their claim that the permitting decision would adversely affect the quality of their groundwater was not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>Marashlian </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Newburyport, supra </em>at 721-722. See also <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Waltham, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 435, 441 (2005) (evidence must both provide \u201cspecific factual support for each of the claims of particularized injury the plaintiff has made\u201d and \u201cbe of a type on which a reasonable person could rely to conclude that the claimed injury likely will flow from the board\u2019s action. Conjecture, personal opinion, and hypothesis are therefore insufficient\u201d). The judgment of dismissal was properly entered. See <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Gloucester, </em>429 Mass. 551, 553-554 (1999) (abutter who failed to offer evidence of plausible claim did not have standing for purposes of G.
