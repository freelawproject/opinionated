L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, fourth par., prevents an automobile insurer from terminating personal injury protection (PIP) benefits based on an independent medical examination (IME) of a claimant by a practitioner licensed under a medical specialty different from the specialty of the treating or billing practitioner. A Superior Court judge granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment concluding that the statute required the determination to cease paying PIP benefits be made by a medical practitioner licensed in the same medical specialty as the treating or billing practitioner. The Appeals Court affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court. <em>Boone </em>v. <em>Commerce Ins. Co., </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 354, 354-355 (2007). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review. Because we conclude that the language, purpose, and legislative history of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, fourth par., support the conclusion that a PIP insurer may refuse to pay for medical bills, based on a physical examination of the claimant by a medical practitioner licensed under a medical speciality different from the treating or billing practitioner, we reverse the order of the Superior Court granting the plaintiff\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, and grant partial summary judgment for Commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\"><em>Facts and procedural background. </em>The facts underlying this appeal are not in dispute. In December, 1996, the plaintiff, Daniel Boone, was struck by a motor vehicle that was operated by Stephen M. Bonina and insured by Commerce Insurance Company (Commerce). The plaintiff suffered injuries to his head, neck, shoulder, and back.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">In January, 1997, the plaintiff commenced treatment with a chiropractor for his injuries. The plaintiff also filed a claim for PIP benefits to cover his chiropractic bills.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Commerce paid the bills for the treatment until September 17, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">On September 15, 1997, at the request of Commerce, the plaintiff submitted to an IME conducted by an orthopedic sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>geon who determined that, although the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were causally related to the motor vehicle accident, continued medical treatment was unnecessary. Based on this opinion, Commerce terminated PIP benefits on September 17, 1997. Nevertheless, the plaintiff continued his treatment until June 22, 1998, incurring additional bills for chiropractic services that totaled $4,300.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">In September, 1998, the plaintiff filed a three-count complaint in the District Court claiming, respectively, that he was injured as a result of Bonina\u2019s negligence for which he sought reimbursement for his medical expenses in excess of $2,000; that Commerce breached the terms of its policy by failing to provide PIP benefits; and that Commerce violated G. L. c. 93A and G. L. c. 176D.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">On cross motions for partial summary judgment on the two counts against Commerce, the plaintiff argued that, pursuant to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, fourth par., an insurer cannot refuse to pay a bill for medical services submitted by a medical provider licensed under one section of G. L. c. 112 based solely on an examination of the claimant by a medical provider licensed under a different section of G. L. c. 112.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge allowed Commerce\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment and denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The Appellate Division of the District Court reversed and ordered judgment in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $4,300 plus interest and costs. Commerce transferred the case to the Superior Court for a jury trial. The plaintiff and Commerce filed cross motions for partial summary judgment on the two counts against Commerce. A Superior Court judge allowed the plaintiff\u2019s motion, denied Commerce\u2019s motion, and ordered Commerce to pay the plaintiff $10,755.97, which included attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Commerce appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cThe standard of review of a grant of summary judgment is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, all material facts have been established and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>matter of law.\u201d <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991), citing Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). Here, we owe no deference to the Superior Court judge\u2019s decision because it is a ruling of law and involves no credibility or evidentiary determinations. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Schs. of Stoughton, </em>437 Mass. 1, 5 n.6 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 34A, requires an insurer to pay PIP benefits for \u201creasonable expenses incurred ... for necessary medical . . . services.\u201d Moreover, injured claimants are required to cooperate with the insurers by submitting to IMEs, which assist insurers in determining the amounts due. G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, third par.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 34M, fourth par., states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">\u201cPersonal injury protection benefits and benefits due from an insurer assigned shall be due and payable as loss accrues, upon receipt of reasonable proof of the fact and amount of expenses and loss incurred provided that upon notification of disability from a licensed physician, the insurer shall commence medical payments within ten days or give written notice of its intent not to make such payments, specifying reasons for said nonpayment, but an insurer may agree to a lump sum discharging all future liability for such benefits on its own behalf and on behalf of the insured. With respect to such benefits, and to medical coverage contained in [G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113C], <em>no insurer shall refuse to pay a bill for medical services submitted by a practitioner registered or licensed under the provisions of chapter one hundred and twelve, if such refusal is based solely on a medical review of the bill or of the medical services underlying the bill, which review was requested or conducted by the insurer, unless the insurer has submit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number><em>ted, for medical review, such bill or claim to at least one practitioner registered or licensed under the same section of [G. L. c. 112] as the practitioner who submitted the bill for medical services </em>...\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Relying on the language of \u00a7 34M, fourth, par., Commerce contends that the same profession requirement only applies \u201cwhen a refusal to pay a bill for medical service <em>\u2018is </em>based <em>solely </em>on a medical review of the bill or of the medical services underlying the bill.\u2019 \u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">A general principle of statutory interpretation is that \u201cevery word in a statute should be given meaning,\u201d <em>Matter of a Civil Investigative Demand Addressed to Yankee Milk, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 353, 358 (1977), and no word is considered superfluous. See <em>Casa Loma, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>377 Mass. 231, 234 (1979), and cases cited. Here, the word \u201csolely\u201d limits the application of the same profession requirement to circumstances where insurers challenge bills solely on the basis of a \u201cmedical review of the bill or the medical services underlying the bill.\u201d G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M. A medical review is a \u201csubmission of bills and medical records to a practitioner <em>without a physical examination </em>of the PIP claimant\u201d (emphasis added), Galena Chiropractic Office, <em>Inc. vs. </em>Amica Mut. Ins. Co., District Court, Appellate Division, Northern District No. 9731 (Sept. 24, 2001), to determine if the charges are reasonable and the treatment is necessary. See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A <em>(supra </em>at 195). In contrast, a \u201cphysical examination\u201d involves a claimant undergoing a medical examination by a physician selected by the insurer. G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, third par. Because Commerce\u2019s refusal to pay is based on an IME rather than a medical review of the bill or the medical services underlying the bill, we conclude that the plain language of the statute makes the same profession requirement inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">The plaintiff argues that when the third and fourth paragraphs of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, are construed together, the \u201cthird paragraph simply grants the authority to an insurer to have a claimant examined by a physician of [its] choice,\u201d while the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>\u201cfourth paragraph expounds upon and explains the authority granted.\u201d We disagree. \u201c[W]hen the Legislature has employed specific language in one part of a statute, but not in another part which deals with the same topic, the earlier language should not be implied where it is not present.\u201d <em>Leary </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>421 Mass. 344, 348 (1995), quoting <em>Fontaine </em>v. <em>Ebtec Corp., </em>415 Mass. 309, 321 (1993). Here, where the Legislature used the term \u201cphysical examinations\u201d in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, third par., and the term \u201cmedical review\u201d in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, fourth par., we should not extend the meaning of medical review to include a physical examination. Moreover, the plaintiff\u2019s reliance on Miller <em>vs. </em>AMICA Mut. Ins. Co., District Court, Appellate Division, Northern District No. 9521 (Nov. 11,1998), to support his argument that a \u201cmedical review\u201d encompasses an IME or physical examination of a PEP claimant is misplaced. Although the court stated that \u201can EME constitutes a medical review of the bill or of the medical services underlying the bill,\u201d the Miller case does not squarely address the issues presented in this case. In the Miller case, both the treating and reviewing practitioners were chiropractors whereas here, the treating practitioner was a chiropractor and the reviewing practitioner was an orthopedic surgeon.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The plaintiff contends that the same profession requirement applies to a \u201cdenial of coverage [by an insurer] based on a \u2018medical review\u2019 of a PIP benefits \u2018claim\u2019 (whether based on a physical examination or not\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This argument is unavailing because the plaintiff\u2019s interpretation of text ignores the word \u201csolely.\u201d <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Educ., </em>439 Mass. 124, 129 (2003) (no word of statute is treated as superfluous).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>The plaintiff further contends that if Commerce\u2019s position is adopted \u201cthe fourth paragraph of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, would be rendered . . . completely useless\u201d and an \u201cinsurer [would be able to] lawfully terminate [the] PIP benefits of a claimant who received dental injuries if an examining orthopedist, or chiropractor, felt that a medical end result had occurred.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He further argues that this scenario would lead to more litigation and delays in payments to injured claimants. These arguments lack merit. Orthopedic surgeons and chiropractors cannot lawfully practice outside the scope of their professional registration and render medical decisions about dentistry. Any person who attempts to practice dentistry without being registered is subject to penalties, G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 52, unless a registered physician \u201cdeems treatment necessary for the relief of his patient.\u201d G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 53. Moreover, there is some overlap among practitioners who are licensed in different practice areas. For example, orthopedics is defined as a medical specialty concerned with \u201cthe preservation, restoration, and development of form and function of the musculoskeletal system, extremities, [and the] spine\u201d; \u201cchiropractic\u201d is defined as \u201cthe relationship between the musculoskeletal structures and functions of the body, particularly of the spinal column and the nervous system.\u201d Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary 289,1102 (25th ed. 1990). Therefore, a licensed orthopedic surgeon would be qualified to treat most of the same type of injuries that a chiropractor could treat.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The statute\u2019s history confirms that our interpretation of G. L. c. 90, 34M, fourth par., is consistent with legislative intent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number><em>Chipman </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>366 Mass. 253, 256 (1974). The Legislature amended \u00a7 34M in 1989 by adding the second sentence of the fourth paragraph, to include the same profession requirement. St. 1989, c. 271. Originally, 1989 House Doc. No. 2865, which proposed to insert G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 8C V2, stated: \u201cAny Independent Medical Examination or medical claim review requested by any insurer shall be conducted only by a licensed practitioner of the same specialty licensed to practice as such under the provisions of chapter 112 of the General Laws.\u201d The Legislature specifically considered whether to impose the same profession requirement on insurers when their denials were based on an IME and the Legislature rejected this idea. Therefore, \u201cwe will not add to a statute a word that the Legislature had the option to, but chose not to, include.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Dartt </em>v. <em>Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc. (Mass.), </em>427 Mass. 1, 9 (1998).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons stated above, we reverse the partial summary judgment entered for the plaintiff, and order the entry of partial summary judgment in favor of Commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b213-8\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 34A, defines the term \u201c[p]ersonal injury protection,\u201d as \u201cprovisions of a motor vehicle liability policy . . . which provide for payment to the named insured ... of all reasonable expenses incurred within two years from the date of accident for necessary medical, surgical, x-ray, and dental services.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b214-9\">Here, the treating practitioner was a chiropractor who was licensed under G. L. c. 112, \u00a7\u00a7 89-97, and the IME was conducted by an orthopedic surgeon licensed under G. L. c. 112, \u00a7\u00a7 2-9B.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b215-8\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 34M, third par., provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe injured person shall submit to physical examinations by physicians selected by the insurer as often as may be reasonably required and shall do all things necessary to enable the insurer to obtain medical reports and other needed information to assist in determining the amounts due.\u201d This physical examination is commonly known as an IME. See Miller vs. AMIGA Mut. Ins. Co., District Court, Appellate Division, Northern District No. 9521 (Nov. 11, 1998); Galena Chiropractic Office, Inc. vs. Amica Mut. Ins. Co., District Court, Appellate Division, Northern District No. 9731 (Sept. 24, 2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b216-8\">For ease of reference we shall call the italicized portion of G.

Ins. Co., District Court, Appellate Division, Northern District No. 9402 (June 4, 1997), is misplaced. He argues that adopting Commerce\u2019s interpretation of the same profession requirement would essentially use an IME report \u201cto determine the medical necessity of a differently licensed provider\u2019s service [which is] not in accordance with ... the Nhem decision.\u201d We disagree. In the Nhem case, the court allowed the insurer to refuse to pay a claimant\u2019s bill based on a standard provider bill audit system. The court stated that the refusal was \u201cnot \u2018based solely on a medical review\u2019 of such bill,\u201d thus the court did not treat the word \u201csolely\u201d as superfluous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The plaintiff argues that the \u201cunderlying purpose of the [no-fault legisla-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>tian] was not only to reduce . . . tort litigation and control costs . . . but also to expedite insurance payments to injured parties.\u201d See <em>Flanagan </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>383 Mass. 195, 196 (1981). We interpret \u00a7 34M to create \u201cas far as feasible and reasonable, an harmonious structure faithful to the basic designs and purposes of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Mailhot </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>375 Mass. 342, 345 (1978). Toward this end, allowing insurers to deny payments for medical services where the denial is based on an IME by a medical practitioner in a specialty different from the treating or billing practitioner is consistent with the legislative goal of controlling costs and ensuring timely payments of medical bills.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b218-12\">The plaintiffs reliance on Knight <em>vs. </em>Trust Ins. Co., District Court, Appellate Division, Northern District No. 9508 (Sept. 11, 1998), to refute Commerce\u2019s interpretation of the same profession requirement is misplaced. The Knight case did not deal directly with the issue presented in this case because both the treating and the reviewing practitioners were chiropractors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s legislative history argument is not a model of clarity. He argues that the 1989 amendment was proposed initially as legislation \u201cto regulate independent medical examinations for health benefits under the motor vehicle insurance laws,\u201d and not related to \u201cno-fault\u201d rights. Although this is true he does not explain the relevance of that history given that the language was ultimately included in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Because of our conclusion, we need not address the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the failure of Commerce to pay the claimed PIP benefits violated G.
