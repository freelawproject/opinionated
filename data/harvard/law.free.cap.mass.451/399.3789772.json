Regs. \u00a7 64C.14.1 (1993) (\u00a7 64C.14.1), \u201cinvalid on its face as inconsistent with the provisions of G. L. c. 64C and the decision of the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>323 Mass. 154 (1948).\u201d We affirm the board\u2019s decision vacating the retailer\u2019s suspension, albeit on different grounds. We also conclude that the board did not have the authority to declare the regulation in question invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>Prohibition on below-cost cigarette sales. </em>An overview of the Massachusetts cigarette pricing laws, G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7\u00a7 12-21, and their implementing regulation, \u00a7 64C.14.1, is necessary to an understanding of the underlying dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">It is unlawful for a retailer to sell or advertise cigarettes at prices below its cost, \u201cwith intent to injure competitors [or to] destroy substantially or lessen competition.\u201d G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7 14 <em>(a).</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Evidence that a retailer has advertised or sold cigarettes at less than cost is \u201cprima facie evidence of intent to injure competitors.\u201d G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7 14 <em>(b).</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>General Laws c. 64C, \u00a7 13 <em>(a), </em>defines \u201ccost to the retailer\u201d as \u201cthe invoice cost of the cigarettes to the retailer ... to which shall be added the cost of doing business by said retailer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn the absence of proof of a lesser or higher cost,\u201d the \u201ccost of doing business\u201d of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>retailer is presumed to be \u201ctwenty-five per centum of the invoice cost of the cigarettes to the retailer,\u201d G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7 13 <em>(b). </em>Thus, the presumed \u201ccost to the retailer\u201d is 125 per cent of the invoice cost of the cigarettes it sells.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">A retailer may sell cigarettes below its presumed cost if the retailer can establish that its cost of doing business is less than twenty-five per cent of its invoice cost. In any event, G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7 16, permits \u201c[a]ny retailer\u201d to advertise and sell cigarettes \u201cat a price made in good faith to meet the prices of a competitor who is selling the same article at cost to him as a . . . retailer.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In other words, a retailer may sell below its cost, either actual or presumed, to meet the prices of a competitor with lower costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The commissioner is charged with enforcing the cigarette pricing laws. G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7 12. In 1989, the commissioner promulgated a regulation to administer G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7\u00a7 12-21.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See \u00a7 64C.14.1. The regulation establishes a \u201cgeneral rule\u201d that no retailer licensed to sell cigarettes \u201cshall advertise, offer to sell, or sell cigarettes at a price that is less than the applicable presumptive cost [also referred to as the \u201cpresumptive minimum price\u201d] without obtaining the commissioner\u2019s prior written approval.\u201d \u00a7 64C.14.1(3). Based on periodic inquiries by the commissioner with regard to the current prices charged by cigarette manufacturers, the commissioner establishes presumptive minimum prices for each brand.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Prior approval for a retailer to sell below these presumptive minimum prices is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>obtained through a process also set forth in the regulation. \u00a7 64C.14.1(4). Such approval is granted only after a hearing, at which the retailer has the burden to show \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence that [its] actual cost is less than the applicable presumptive cost.\u201d \u00a7 64C.14.1(4)(d). The commissioner\u2019s approval is \u201cvalid for a period of one year.\u201d \u00a7 64C.14.1(4)(i). There is no provision in the regulation by which a retailer can obtain prior approval to meet the prices of its competitors, as permitted by G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7 16, regardless of its costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">A retailer that advertises or sells cigarettes below their presumptive costs without the prior approval of the commissioner is subject, on the occasion of its first violation, to a five-day suspension of its license to sell cigarettes. \u00a7 64C.14.1(4)(j).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the retailer is found to have violated this regulation on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>second occasion within a twelve-month period, the commissioner \u201cmay summarily revoke\u201d its license. \u00a7 64C.14.1(3), (6). On receiving notice of the commissioner\u2019s finding of a violation and license suspension, the retailer may request a presuspension hearing to challenge them. \u00a7 64C.14.1(5)(a). The scope of the hearing is expressly \u201climited to a determination whether: 1. The licensee has requested and obtained the prior written approval of the commissioner ... to sell below the applicable presumptive cost; and 2. The licensee has demonstrated that no advertisements, offers to sell, or sales were made at prices below the applicable presumptive cost.\u201d \u00a7 64C.14.1(5)(h). If, after the hearing, the commissioner suspends the retailer\u2019s license, the aggrieved retailer can appeal from the commissioner\u2019s findings and sanction to the board. \u00a7 64C.14.1(7).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">b. <em>Facts. </em>Expedito Duarte is a licensed cigarette retailer<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> who owns and operates two convenience stores in New Bedford: Expo\u2019s at 332 Brock Avenue, and Expo\u2019s II at 390 Dartmouth Street.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The stores generate approximately $3 million per year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>from the sale of cigarettes, a substantial portion of their total revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">In response to anonymous complaints that Duarte was selling cigarettes below their presumptive costs, a Department of Revenue (department) tax examiner conducted an investigation of both retail stores on June 9, 2003. During the course of that investigation, the tax examiner provided Duarte with a list of the presumptive minimum prices as established by the commissioner<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and informed him that his prices for packs of cigarettes were below those pricing levels. The tax examiner warned Du-arte to raise his prices at both locations or he would face an enforcement action.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Four months later, the tax examiner returned to the stores. On October 15, 2003, the tax examiner visited Expo\u2019s II and found that the prices for cigarette packs again fell below the presumptive minimum prices. Duarte was in the store at the time and explained to the tax examiner that his prices were in line with those of a competitor \u2014 specifically, B.J.\u2019s Wholesale Club \u2014 and therefore in compliance with the law. Duarte also informed the examiner that the prices charged at both his store locations were the same, a fact confirmed by the tax examiner when he visited Expo\u2019s I on October 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">On October 27, 2003, the commissioner informed Duarte by letter that Expo\u2019s I and II were selling cigarettes below their presumptive costs without his prior written approval. The letter served as notification, pursuant to \u00a7 64C.14.1(5), that Duarte\u2019s conduct violated G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7 14, and \u00a7 64C.14.1(3), and that the commissioner intended to suspend his cigarette retailer license for five days. The letter offered Duarte the opportunity for a presuspension hearing, which he requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">The hearing took place on December 18, 2003. It was limited to the issues whether Duarte had sold or advertised cigarettes below their presumptive costs and, if so, whether he had obtained prior approval to do so. Duarte was precluded by the regulation from establishing that his prices were set in good faith to meet the prices of his competitors. Following the hearing, the commissioner found that \u201cthe Licensee failed to demonstrate that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>no advertisements, offers to sell, or sales were made at prices below the presumptive minimum cost,\u201d and that there was no question that Duarte had not sought prior written approval to sell cigarettes below those presumptive costs. Consequently, the commissioner suspended Duarte\u2019s licenses for five days effective January 19, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">c. <em>Further proceedings. </em>Duarte appealed from the commissioner\u2019s decision to the board. In that appeal, Duarte did not challenge the commissioner\u2019s finding that he advertised and sold cigarettes below their presumptive costs; rather, he contended that his cigarette prices were set \u201cin good faith to meet the prices of a competitor who [was] selling the same article,\u201d G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7 16, and therefore were not in violation of G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7 14. In addition, he claimed that because the department\u2019s regulation precluded him from demonstrating his compliance with G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7 16, at his suspension hearing, the regulation was inconsistent with and in excess of the statutory language on which it was purportedly based, and that its application to his case denied him due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">On March 16, 2005, the board held a hearing at which Duarte was permitted to offer evidence that he set his cigarette prices to meet the prices of competitors in the New Bedford area. He introduced in evidence receipts from other New Bedford stores dated between November 11, 2003, and March 15, 2005, establishing that those retailers sold cigarettes below the presumptive costs set by the commissioner, at least during the period after the enforcement action was brought against Duarte and through the date of the board\u2019s hearing. In addition, Duarte testified that it was his practice during 2003 to keep track of the sales of the top ten retail sellers of cigarettes in New Bedford, and to match their prices in his stores.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Duarte also testified that in the months following his receipt of the October 27, 2003, notice of violation and suspension, he filed (to no avail) written complaints against fifty-one different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>retailers with the department, asserting that those retailers (his competitors in New Bedford) were uniformly charging less than their presumptive costs.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Duarte further testified that when he asked the department to provide him with the names of cigarette retailers in the New Bedford area that had received prior approval to sell below their presumptive costs, the department refused to provide the information, claiming that it was confidential, and that its disclosure was specifically precluded by law.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The board took Duarte\u2019s appeal under advisement and subsequently ordered a second hearing to address two issues: first, whether \u00a7 64C.14.1 is consistent with <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>323 Mass. 154, 157 (1948) (commissioner has no authority to \u201cfix prices for cigarettes\u201d); and second, \u201c[wjhether the [b]card has jurisdiction to hear and decide the matter of the proposed suspension of [Duarte\u2019s] license to sell cigarettes.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">On July 10, 2006, the board issued its decision vacating the commissioner\u2019s suspension of Duarte\u2019s license and declaring \u00a7 64C.14.1 \u201cinvalid and of no legal effect\u201d because it is \u201cinconsistent with the statute[, G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7\u00a7 12-21,] and constitutionally deficient.\u201d The board found, as a matter of fact, that Duarte \u201cdid offer cigarettes for sale for prices not previously authorized by [the department],\u201d but that \u201c[i]n so doing, he was acting in good faith to meet the prices charged by his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>competitors in the New Bedford area.\u201d In addition, the board found that cigarettes \u201cwere widely available in the New Bed-ford area for prices under the . . . mandated minimum levels during the time frame of the enforcement action against Mr. Duarte.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">In its decision, the board noted an \u201cincongruity between the commissioner\u2019s price-fixing regulation and the statutory provisions upon which it is based.\u201d The board concluded, as a matter of law, that \u00a7 64C.14.1 exceeded the scope of G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7\u00a7 12-21, because the regulation \u201chad the effect of fixing prices for cigarettes, without statutory authorization.\u201d The board further concluded that the presuspension hearing provided for by \u00a7 64C.14.1(5) failed to comply \u201cwith constitutional requirements of procedural due process,\u201d because \u201cthe risk of an erroneous deprivation of [Duarte\u2019s] . . . license . . . would appear to be high.\u201d The board found that \u201c[r]egardless of the relationship between his cigarette prices and actual cost, the regulation would make the sanction of license suspension or revocation all but automatic\u201d if the retailer had not sought prior approval to sell below the presumptive cost. Such a \u201cregulatory scheme truncates the issues allowable for consideration at the hearing in a way that makes an erroneous outcome not merely possible, but likely in cases like the appellant\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The commissioner filed a timely notice of appeal, and we transferred his appeal to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>On appeal, the commissioner claims that the establishment of presumptive costs under \u00a7 64C.14.1 is consistent with G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7\u00a7 13 and 14; that the presuspension hearing process established by \u00a7 64C.14.1(5) is consistent with State and Federal due process protections; that, regardless of the constitutionality of the hearing process, the board lacks the authority to declare a regulation unconstitutional; and, finally, that the board\u2019s conclusion that Duarte sold his cigarettes below the presumptive minimum prices in a good faith effort to match his competitors is unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">We conclude that the commissioner\u2019s regulation establishing presumptive costs is not inconsistent with the statutory framework and does not constitute \u201cfixfing] prices\u201d in contravention of our decision in <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Ryan, supra. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>We also conclude that the board lacks authority to declare regulations promulgated by the commissioner to be facially \u201cinvalid and of no legal effect,\u201d although it may find that their application in a case before it is violative of due process or inconsistent with the statutory purpose. We agree with the board that the hearing process set forth in \u00a7 64C.14.1(5) failed to provide Du-arte with the due process to which he was entitled under the statutory framework, and that Duarte presented sufficient evidence to support the board\u2019s conclusion that \u201che was acting in good faith to meet the prices charged by his competitors in the New Bedford area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">a. <em>Standard of review. </em>\u201cWe will not modify or reverse a decision of the board if the decision is based on both substantial evidence and a correct application of the law.\u201d <em>Boston Professional Hockey Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>443 Mass. 276, 285 (2005). <em>Kennametal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>426 Mass. 39, 43 (1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1059 (1998). Our review of the sufficiency of the evidence is limited to \u201cwhether a contrary conclusion is not merely a possible but a necessary inference from the findings.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Houghton Mifflin Co., </em>423 Mass. 42, 43 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">b. <em>Presumptive cost. </em>The board found that \u00a7 64C.14.1 had the \u201ceffect of fixing prices for cigarettes,\u201d and that this effect conflicts with G. L. c. 64C, as construed by this court. The board, therefore, concluded that the regulation was invalid. Setting aside for the moment the board\u2019s authority to declare a regulation invalid, we disagree with the substance of its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Our review of the \u201cvalidity of a regulation promulgated by a State agency is guided by the established principle that \u2018[Regulations are not to be declared void unless their provisions cannot by any reasonable construction be interpreted in harmony with the legislative mandate,\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transitional Assistance, </em>431 Mass. 638, 646 (2000), quoting <em>Dowell </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transitional Assistance, </em>424 Mass. 610, 613 (1997). Only an \u201cagency regulation that is contrary to the plain language of the statute and its underlying purpose may be rejected by the courts.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transitional Assistance, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>In <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Ryan, supra </em>at 157, the court stated that \u201cnowhere in G. L. c. 64C is authority given to the commissioner to fix prices for cigarettes,\u201d and that, under G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7\u00a7 13 and 14, \u201c[t]he cost, below which cigarettes may not be sold, is the actual cost to the particular retailer, and not the usual cost in the trade or the cost as determined by any survey or by any public officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The context in which these statements were made was a proclamation by the commissioner that the retail price of \u201cpopular brands\u201d of cigarettes should not be less than $1.98 per carton or twenty cents per pack. <em>Id. </em>at 156. This was not a presumptive minimum price that could be rebutted by evidence of actual cost. The license of a drugstore was suspended for selling cigarettes below the price the commissioner had set. We rejected this ground for the suspension, but also held that the board had the right to rely on the presumption, created by G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7 13 <em>(b), </em>that \u201c \u2018[i]n the absence of proof of a lesser or higher cost of doing business by the retailer\u2019 the cost of doing business shall be taken to be six per cent [now twenty-five per cent] of the invoice cost of the cigarettes to the retailer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 158-159.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Contrary to the board\u2019s conclusion, the commissioner\u2019s regulation providing for the periodic establishment of presumptive costs is not inconsistent with the language and purpose of G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7\u00a7 13 and 14, and is rationally related to its enforcement. The regulation does not \u201cfix\u201d prices but instead creates a rebuttable presumption that the costs periodically established by the commissioner reflect the costs to the retailer of selling various packs of cigarettes.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The regulation and the statute are consistent in their definition of a retailer\u2019s \u201cpresumptive cost\u201d (invoice cost plus twenty-five per cent),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and both provide that a retailer may sell cigarettes below its presumptive costs by providing \u201cproof of a less[e]r . . . cost of doing business.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7 13 <em>(b). </em>The principal difference between the statute and the regulation is the requirement that such proof be presented before the retailer proceeds to make sales below its presumptive costs. If this regulatory requirement is valid, then the commissioner may appropriately base the suspension of a retailer\u2019s license on its wilful violation. G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">While the statute is silent on this point, in our view it does not preclude such a regulatory requirement where the requirement is a reasonable and practical means of enforcing the statute\u2019s provisions and efficiently accomplishing its goal of preventing retailers from selling cigarettes as \u201c \u2018loss-leaders\u2019 with intent to injure competitors or to destroy competition.\u201d G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7 12. Thus, we conclude that \u00a7 64C.14.1(l)-(4) is rationally related to the statutory goals set forth in G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7\u00a7 12-21, and is, accordingly, valid. See <em>Cacicio </em>v. <em>Secretary of Pub. Safety, </em>422 Mass. 764, 769 (1996), quoting <em>American Family Life Assur. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>388 Mass. 468, 477, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 850 (1983) (\u201cIn reviewing a regulation, a court \u2018[cannot] substitute [its] judgment as to the need for a regulation, or the propriety of the means chosen to implement the statutory goals, so long as the regulation is rationally related to those goals\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">c. <em>Scope of the presuspension hearing. </em>We agree with the board that the presuspension hearing process provided by \u00a7 64C.14.1(5) \u201ctruncates the issues allowable for consideration at the hearing in a way that makes an erroneous outcome not merely possible, but likely in cases like [Duarte\u2019s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">While G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7 14 <em>(a), </em>provides that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for any retailer . . . [to] sell at retail cigarettes at less than cost to the retailer,\u201d \u00a7 16 permits \u201c[a]ny retailer\u201d to sell \u201ccigarettes at a price made in good faith to meet the prices of a competitor who is selling the same article at cost to him.\u201d Section 16, therefore, presents an alternative statutory basis for (and defense to) below-cost sales if the retailer can demonstrate that his prices were set, in good faith, to match those of his competitors.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The regulation, however, effectively writes \u00a7 16 out of the statute by, on the one hand, allowing the \u201cCommis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>sioner [to] suspend any license for a period of five days if the licensee . . . sells cigarettes at less than the applicable presumptive cost without the Commissioner\u2019s prior written approval,\u201d \u00a7 64C.14.1(3); and, on the other hand, not providing for prior written approval based on a retailer\u2019s \u201cgood faith\u201d need to meet a competitor\u2019s prices regardless of the retailer\u2019s costs.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The regulation further truncates the retailer\u2019s rights under the statute by providing for a presuspension hearing \u201climited to a determination of whether . . . [t]he licensee has requested and obtained prior written approval ... to sell below the applicable presumptive cost; and [whether] the licensee has demonstrated that no . . . sales were made at prices below the presumptive cost.\u201d Thus, the retailer is expressly precluded from demonstrating actual compliance with \u00a7 16 by, in good faith, meeting the prices of its competitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">While we generally defer to the regulations promulgated by a State agency, the \u201cprinciples of deference ... are not principles of abdication.\u201d <em>Nuclear Metals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Low-Level Radioactive Waste Mgt. Bd., </em>421 Mass. 196, 211 (1995). An agency \u201chas no authority to promulgate rules and regulations which are in conflict with the statutes or exceed the authority conferred by the statutes\u201d under which the agency operates. <em>Telles </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>410 Mass. 560, 564 (1991), quoting <em>Bureau of Old Age Assistance of Natick </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>326 Mass. 121, 124 (1950). The hearing process established here is incongruous with \u00a7 16, at least as applied to retailers who rely on its alternative basis for cigarette sales made below their presumptive or actual costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Additionally, the hearing process fails to conform to Federal and State due process requirements,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> to which Duarte is entitled. Cf. <em>Goldstein </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Chiropractors, </em>426 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Mass. 606, 613 (1998) (adjudicatory proceeding in which chiropractor\u2019s license could be revoked implicates due process rights). Cf. <em>Konstantopoulos </em>v. <em>Whatley, </em>384 Mass. 123, 131-132 (1981) (\u201cplaintiff\u2019s entertainment license clothes him with a constitutionally protected interest of which he cannot be deprived without procedural due process\u201d). \u201cThe fundamental requirement of due process is notice and the opportunity to be heard \u2018at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner,\u2019 \u201d <em>Matter of Angela, </em>445 Mass. 55, 62 (2005), quoting <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Manzo, </em>380 U.S. 545, 552 (1965), although exactly what that entails \u201cvaries with context.\u201d <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley, </em>387 Mass. 258, 274 (1982). \u201c[T]he specific dictates of due process generally required consideration of three distinct factors: First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedure used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\u201d <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976). See <em>Aime </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>414 Mass. 667, 675 (1993) (\u201cthe individual interest at stake must be balanced against the nature of the governmental interest and the risk of an erroneous deprivation of liberty or property under the procedures which the State seeks to use\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Duarte stands to lose the right to sell cigarettes, the sales of which make up a substantial portion of his retail stores\u2019 revenue, for five days. That property interest is not insubstantial. Under the process afforded to Duarte, the chance of erroneous deprivation of his license is high. General Laws c. 64C, \u00a7 16, allows retailers to set prices in a good faith effort to match competing retailers, and Duarte introduced evidence before the board that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>he did just that. He was not, however, afforded the opportunity to make that showing or present that statutory defense in the limited presuspension hearing provided by \u00a7 64C.14.1(5). The commissioner\u2019s interest in such a limited hearing is, as the board found, \u201celusive,\u201d where the commissioner is required in any event to hold a presuspension hearing if one is requested. See \u00a7 64C.14.1(5)(a). Considering additional evidence at that hearing on the question whether the retailer has complied with \u00a7 16 cannot be considered unduly burdensome. The commissioner\u2019s interest is to maximize the collection of tax revenue from the sales of cigarettes by ensuring competition. See G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7 12 (\u201cNo person shall be permitted to sell cigarettes as \u2018loss-leaders\u2019 with intent to injure competitors or to destroy competition, and the commissioner shall enforce sections thirteen to twenty-one, inclusive, in order to prohibit such sales and stabilize and increase collections under this chapter\u201d). This interest is not furthered by a process that may erroneously deprive retailers of the right to remain competitive and continue to make such sales. Consequently, to the extent that the regulation precluded Duarte from presenting evidence of his compliance with \u00a7 16 at a license suspension hearing, the regulation violated his right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The question remains whether the board had the authority to declare \u00a7 64C.14.1(5) (governing the suspension hearing) invalid and of no legal effect. The board \u201cmay act only to the extent that it has express or implied statutory authority to do so.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Marr Scaffolding Co., </em>414 Mass. 489, 493 (1993). Here the board was acting under the authority granted by G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 68, to hear an appeal from the commissioner\u2019s decision to suspend a license to sell cigarettes. The scope of that review should, accordingly, have been limited to whether the commissioner properly concluded that Duarte \u201cwillfully failed to comply with any provision of the tax laws of the commonwealth or regulations thereunder,\u201d G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 68. To the extent that the regulation limited Duarte\u2019s ability to present his defense under \u00a7 16 of G. L. c. 64C, the board had the authority to regard the regulation as invalidly applied to the case before it, and could properly hear and consider the evidence that Duarte was barred from presenting at his hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>before the commissioner. The board, however, lacked the \u201cinherent or common law authority\u201d to strike down the regulation. <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Marr Scaffolding Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">d. <em>Duarte\u2019s evidence. </em>The commissioner contends that Duarte failed to introduce sufficient evidence for the board to conclude that he was permissibly selling \u201ccigarettes at a price made in good faith to meet the prices of a competitor who [was] selling the same article at cost to him as a wholesaler or retailer.\u201d G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7 16. The commissioner first argues that because the evidence Duarte introduced was collected only after the enforcement action began, it does not establish that Duarte set his prices to match his competitors\u2019 prices on the dates when the tax examiners found him to be in noncompliance. In other words, the commissioner argues that receipts collected between November, 2003, and March, 2005, are irrelevant in determining the prices charged by Duarte\u2019s competitors on June 9, 2003; October 15, 2003; and October 17, 2003. In fact, the commissioner suggests that the evidence supports the proposition that the other stores lowered their prices to match Duarte.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The board properly rejected the commissioner\u2019s arguments. Duarte introduced substantial evidence that cigarettes were \u201creadily and widely available ... in the New Bedford area\u201d for less than their presumptive costs. He introduced receipts of cigarette purchases from competitors demonstrating that those retailers were charging below the presumptive minimum prices from November, 2003, forward, and fifty-one underpricing complaints that he filed with the department during that same time period. Additionally, Duarte testified that he conducted an extensive investigation of cigarette retailers in the area, and found that they were \u201ccontinuously selling below State minimum [prices].\u201d He also testified that in June of 2003, it was his practice to monitor the prices of his competitors and to match their prices. On the basis of this evidence, the board permissibly concluded that the prices charged by Duarte\u2019s competitors in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>November, 2003, and thereafter reflected the prices charged for the same items during the previous months, and that Duarte, in good faith, set his prices accordingly. We will not reverse the board\u2019s factual findings unless a \u201ca contrary conclusion is not merely a possible but a necessary inference from the findings.\u201d <em>Kennametal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>426 Mass. 39, 43 (1997). A contrary conclusion is not necessary here.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The commissioner also contends that Duarte failed to demonstrate that he acted in good faith to meet the \u201cprices of a competitor who [was] selling the same article <em>at cost to him\u201d </em>(emphasis added) and, therefore, failed to show compliance with G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7 16. Specifically, the commissioner asserts that, even assuming Duarte was meeting his competitors\u2019 prices, he lacked \u201cgood faith\u201d in doing so, because all of his competitors were likewise illegally selling cigarettes below their actual costs, and Duarte knew as much. To the contrary, a reasonable inference from the evidence presented is that Duarte would have had no reason to believe that the large number of his competitors who were selling below the presumptive minimum prices were all selling below their actual costs.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The board, which was in position to hear the witnesses and assess the credibility of their testimony, found that Duarte was acting in \u201cgood faith,\u201d and we will not disturb that finding. <em>Kennametal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra </em>at 43 n.6.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The board\u2019s ruling that \u00a7 64C.14.1, in its entirety, was invalid on its face and of no legal effect, is vacated. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Further, although we conclude that the presumptive pricing framework set forth in the regulation, \u00a7 64C.14.1(l)-(4), (7)-(ll), is rationally related to the enforcement of G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7\u00a7 12-21, a licensed retailer like Duarte must be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate that he has sold cigarettes \u201cat a price made in good faith to meet the prices of a competitor,\u201d G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7 16, before his license can be suspended. To the extent that the hearing regulation set forth in \u00a7 64C.14.1(5) and (6) foreclosed Duarte\u2019s opportunity to make such a showing, it is inconsistent with the statute and due process. Finally, the board\u2019s determination that Duarte set his prices in a good faith effort to meet the prices charged by competitors and that his license should therefore not be suspended is supported by substantial evidence and is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b420-10\">The stated purpose of the law is to prevent retailers or wholesalers from selling cigarettes as \u201closs-leaders\u201d and thereby \u201cdestroying] competition.\u201d G.

G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7 13 <em>(b). </em>The \u201cinvoice cost of the cigarettes to the\u201d licensed seller is referred to in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>regulation as the \u201c[b]ose cost of cigarettes.\u201d \u00a7 64C.14.1(2). This base cost is determined by the commissioner, who periodically obtains each cigarette manufacturer\u2019s list price for all the cigarette brands sold in Massachusetts, which is assumed to be the \u201cwholesale cost.\u201d In accordance with G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7 13, and \u00a7 64C.14.1(2), the \u201c[b]ose cost\u201d of cigarettes to the retailer is then calculated. In the case of nonchain stores, the base cost is 102.75 per cent of the wholesale cost. See G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7 13 (\u201ctwo per centum\u201d more than cost to wholesaler, plus cartage cost \u201cdeemed to be three-fourths of one percent of the basic cost of the cigarettes to the wholesaler\u201d). In the case of chain retail stores, the base cost is 101.25 per cent of the wholesale cost. See <em>id. </em>(defining \u201cchain store\u201d as \u201cany person or persons who own or maintain ten or more retail outlets in the commonwealth,\u201d and stating that base cost for chain stores is \u201cone-half per centum\u201d greater than cost to wholesalers, plus \u201cthree-fourths of one percent\u201d for cartage).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Once the base cost of each brand of cigarettes is established, the statutorily presumed cost of doing business (twenty-five per cent of invoice cost) is added to establish the \u201cpresumptive cost.\u201d The presumed \u201ccost of doing business\u201d was raised in 1995, St. 1995, c. 69, from 12.4 per cent of the base cost to twenty-five per cent. This increase is reflected in the language of \u00a7 13 <em>(b) </em>but not in the applicable regulation. See 830 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 64C.14.1(2) (retailer\u2019s presumptive cost defined as \u201c112.4% of the base cost of the cigarettes to the retailer\u201d). In determining the presumptive cost, the commissioner uses the statutory twenty-five per cent rather than the outdated regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">The commissioner determines the base cost and the presumptive cost (also referred to as the \u201cpresumptive minimum price\u201d) several times each year, and posts them for each brand of cigarette on the Department of Revenue (department) Web site. They are also delivered to licensees during department investigations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b422-9\">General Laws c. 64C, \u00a7 14, sets forth a different penalty for a retailer who makes a sale in violation of the cigarette pricing laws, namely a \u201cfine of not more than five hundred dollars.\u201d The commissioner asserts that the power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>suspend a retailer\u2019s license derives from G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 68, which allows the \u201ccommissioner [to] suspend or revoke any license\u201d if \u201c[t]he licensee or registrant has . . . willfully failed to comply with any provision of the tax laws of the commonwealth or regulations thereunder.\u201d G.
