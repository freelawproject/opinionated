Patrick to remove him from office as chief medical examiner of the Commonwealth, effective August 1, 2007. In an amended complaint filed in the Superior Court against the Commonwealth, the Governor, and the Secretary of Public Safety (Secretary) (together, the Commonwealth), the plaintiff sought damages for breach of contract (counts one through five) and wrongful removal (counts six through eleven). In addition to damages, the plaintiff sought an order vacating the Governor\u2019s decision and mandamus restoring him to office (count twelve). A single justice of this court allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s motion, filed pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4A, to transfer the case to the county court. There, the Commonwealth moved to dismiss counts one through five of the plaintiff\u2019s second amended complaint, pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), and, in answer to claims six through twelve of the second amended complaint, the Commonwealth filed the record of the proceedings before the Governor in connection with the plaintiff\u2019s dismissal. The Commonwealth then filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on counts six through twelve, pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (c), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). The single justice reserved and reported the Commonwealth\u2019s motions, without decision, to the full court. The parties have submitted proposed questions, which we rephrase for clarity as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-9\">1. a. Whether a Governor may remove a chief medical examiner from office \u201cfor cause,\u201d under G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 <em>9, </em>in the absence of proof of misfeasance, malfeasance, or wilful neglect of duty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-10\">b. Whether the proper standard by which a reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>court evaluates a Governor\u2019s decision to remove a chief medical examiner from office \u201cfor cause\u201d is whether some evidence in the record before the Governor supported his decision, that is, whether the decision was not arbitrary or capricious?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-5\">c. Whether that standard has been met in the circumstances of this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-6\">2. Assuming that the January 21, 2005, letter of agreement, signed by the plaintiff and the (then current) Secretary, constitutes an employment contract, are the terms of that contract enforceable in the circumstances of this case?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">We answer all parts of question one in the affirmative and question two in the negative. We now explain why, first deciding the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, because resolution of that motion in the Commonwealth\u2019s favor will have a substantial effect on the motion to dismiss, which will also be resolved in the Commonwealth\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">1. A motion for judgment on the pleadings, under rule 12 (c), is a challenge to the legal sufficiency of a complaint. See <em>Jarosz </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>436 Mass. 526, 529 (2002), quoting J.W. Smith &amp; H.B. Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 12.16 (1974) (rule 12 [c] motion is \u201cactually a motion to dismiss . . . [that] argues that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted\u201d). \u201cFor purposes of the court\u2019s consideration of the [rule 12 (c)] motion, all of the well pleaded factual allegations in the adversary\u2019s pleadings are assumed to be true and all contravening assertions in the movant\u2019s pleadings are taken to be false.\u201d <em>Minaya </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Credit Union Share Ins. Corp., </em>392 Mass. 904, 905 (1984), quoting 5 C.A. Wright &amp; A.R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1368, at 691 (1969). Judgment on the pleadings may be entered if a plaintiff fails to present sufficient facts in the complaint to support the legal claims made. For purposes of deciding the Commonwealth\u2019s motion, we accept as true the following factual assertions contained in the plaintiff\u2019s second amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">The plaintiff is a physician registered to practice medicine in the Commonwealth. He is board certified in anatomical and for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>ensic pathology and also holds a doctorate in neuroscience. Governor Mitt Romney appointed the plaintiff to the office of chief medical examiner on January 21, 2005, pursuant to G. L. c. 38, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This appointment followed an aggressive recruitment process necessitated by chronic shortcomings ..in the office of the chief medical examiner (OCME). The Governor, the Secretary (then Edward Flynn), the undersecretary of forensic services (undersecretary), and members of the commission on medicolegal investigation (CMI)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were involved in the plaintiff\u2019s recruitment and appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">On January 21, 2005, the plaintiff and the Secretary signed a letter, drafted by the undersecretary, which embodied the terms on which the plaintiff\u2019s acceptance of the appointment would be conditioned. The letter states that its purpose is \u201cto confirm our mutual understanding regarding the commitment of the Commonwealth to support and advocate for the changes you envision for the reform and recovery of the [OCME] and your commitment to restore the integrity and reputation of the office by professionalizing the medicolegal services the OCME provides to the public.\u201d The letter lists major focus areas of concern within the OCME that would require: (1) \u201can increase in the number of medical examiners necessary to handle the cases within the jurisdiction of the OCME\u201d; (2) \u201cthe development of a comprehensive medicolegal investigation system within the OCME\u201d; (3) \u201c[ajccreditation under [national] standards\u201d; and (4) \u201c[t]he improvement or replacement of [medical examiner] facilities so that all are accreditable.\u201d The letter states an understanding that \u201cit will take approximately [three to five] years to achieve these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>goals.\u201d The letter further provides that the Executive Office of Public Safety (EOPS) \u201cwill support [the plaintiff] in the establishment and promotion of changes to current policies and practices\u201d and that the Secretary looked forward to working with the plaintiff. The letter expressly states that the plaintiff\u2019s appointment is governed by G. L. c. 38, \u00a7 2, and G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 9. The letter was delivered to Governor Romney, who (the plaintiff alleges) ratified its provisions when he appointed the plaintiff to office. The plaintiffs five-year term of office began on April 25, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">On May 3, 2007, the current Secretary (Kevin M. Burke) placed the plaintiff on paid administrative leave and denied him access to the OCME. On June 7, the plaintiff received written notice from the Governor (now Governor Patrick) of his decision to initiate removal proceedings against him \u201cfor cause,\u201d in accordance with G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 9.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the letter, the Governor referred to what he termed \u201cfundamental operational [and] administrative failures\u201d of the OCME during the prior three months, including a substantial backlog of bodies; one case of a missing body; the OCME\u2019s failure to meet public health and occupational safety standards; and the plaintiff\u2019s \u201clack of candor with the administration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">The Governor conducted a hearing on the charges on July 27, 2007. The hearing lasted approximately one hour. In a letter dated August 1, 2007, the Governor informed the plaintiff that he was being removed from office \u201cfor cause,\u201d effective immediately. The Governor acknowledged in the letter that no question had been raised as to the plaintiffs excellent reputation as a pathologist,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but stated that there had been \u201cserious problems concerning the performance of [the plaintiff\u2019s] administrative and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>managerial duties at the [OCME], most prominently [his] unacceptable handling of. the missing body situation.\u201d The Governor continued that the plaintiff himself had \u201ccandidly acknowledged several operational and administrative failures at the OCME for which [the plaintiff was] responsible\u201d and that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to exercise effective management and supervision of the OCME, and the \u201cparticular operational failures that have been identified in the record, [left him] without confidence in [the plaintiff\u2019s] ability to effectively perform the necessary functions of the office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">a. The parties agree that the plaintiff is a public official subject to removal by the Governor under G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 9, \u201cfor cause.\u201d They disagree, however, on the appropriate standard by which \u201ccause\u201d is measured. The Commonwealth contends that \u00a7 9 permits the Governor to remove the chief medical examiner on a general finding of poor performance that includes, among other things, neglect of duty, incompetence, inefficiency, or poor supervision. The plaintiff asserts that statutory \u201ccause\u201d is met only by proof of misfeasance, malfeasance, or wilful neglect of duty. We agree with the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Some additional statutory background will be helpful at this point. In 1992, the Legislature established the OCME as an office within the EOPS.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See St. 1992, c. 368, \u00a7 2. The Secretary is the executive officer of the EOPS and serves directly under the Governor, as a member of his cabinet, to carry out the duties and responsibilities of the office. See G. L. c. 6A, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, 4 (Secretary \u201cconduces] comprehensive planning with respect to the functions of [the EOPS] and coordinate^] the activities and progress of the [S]tote agencies therein\u201d). In 2004, the Legislature created the position of undersecretary of forensic services, St. 2004, c. 149, \u00a7 18, to be appointed by the Secretary, and gave the undersecretary, among other duties, responsibility for direct oversight of the \u201cfunctions and administration\u201d of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>OCME. G. L. c. 6A, \u00a7 18 <em>xh. </em>Section 18 V2 also directs the undersecretary to \u201cconduct studies of the operations of [the OCME] and work with [the OCME] in effecting procedures and programs which promote efficiency and improvements in [its] administration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The statutory scheme places the OCME and the chief medical examiner squarely within the operations, and under the control, of the executive branch. In <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Acting Governor, 436 </em>Mass. 736, 748-749 (2002), we recognized that what constitutes sufficient cause to remove the head (or a member) of a governmental agency from office is determined in the context of the authority of the particular agency to act as an independent body. See <em>id. </em>at 749. We differentiated between independent entities that operate more like a business than a governmental agency, and which have importance to the public that demands that they be \u201cfree from the changing winds of politics,\u201d and those agencies that have responsibilities and duties within the broad power of oversight and control of the Governor. <em>Id. </em>at 748. The statutory scheme governing this case demonstrates that the OCME is nothing like a \u201cindependent corporate body,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 749, such as the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, at issue in the <em>Levy </em>case, in which cause to remove a member must be in the order of malfeasance, misfeasance, or wilful neglect of duty. See <em>id., </em>citing, as examples, St. 1956, c. 465, \u00a7 2 (Massachusetts Port Authority); and St. 1984, \u00a7 372, \u00a7 3 (Massachusetts Water Resources Authority).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">We conclude that the standard by which \u201ccause\u201d is measured in this case is the one traditionally offered as a legitimate reason for an employee\u2019s discharge: to name a few examples, any \u201cgrounds for discharge reasonably related, in the employer\u2019s honest judgment, to the needs of his business,\u201d <em>Amoco Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Dickson, </em>378 Mass. 44, 48 (1979), quoting <em>G &amp; M Employment Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>358 Mass. 430, 435 (1970); a dispute over policy \u201cabout which there may be an honest difference of opinion,\u201d <em>Rinaldo </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Revere, </em>294 Mass. 167, 169 (1936); or, in the case of a public official, the Governor\u2019s \u201cconclusion that the interests of the public require the removal of the public officer,\u201d <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>300 Mass. 232, 236 (1938); or \u201cless than complete confidence\u201d in a public of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>ficial\u2019s \u201ccompetency and efficiency.\u201d <em>McSweeney </em>v. <em>Town Manager of Lexington, </em>379 Mass. 794, 798 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">b. The parties also disagree on the standard of review to be applied by a reviewing court charged with determining whether the Governor\u2019s removal of a public official \u201cfor cause\u201d is justified. The Commonwealth argues that the \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d standard should apply. The plaintiff contends that the standard of review should be \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d that is, evidence that \u201ca reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Acting Governor, supra </em>at 745, quoting G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (6). The Commonwealth\u2019s position is the correct one. In view of what has been said above with respect to the Governor\u2019s broad power of oversight over the OCME, his decision to remove a chief medical examiner from office must be accorded great deference. We conclude, therefore, that our power to override the Governor\u2019s decision, in cases such as this, is limited to decisions that we determine to be \u201carbitrary or capricious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">c. We now review the Governor\u2019s decision to remove the plaintiff from office to determine whether it was \u201carbitrary or capricious.\u201d Documents in the record demonstrate a substantial measure of favorable support for the plaintiff\u2019s professional accomplishments during his years of service to the Commonwealth, as well as recognition, by his peers, of the valuable skills and expertise the plaintiff commands in the field of forensic medicine, which may prove difficult, or impossible, for the Governor to replace. The plaintiff submitted to the Governor thirty affidavits on his behalf, all attesting to points of significant progress made in the OCME under his leadership. The question before us, however, is not whether, in our judgment, the Governor\u2019s decision was a wise one, or even whether, on balance, it was in the public interest. The question is whether the Governor\u2019s decision to remove the plaintiff from office \u201cfor cause\u201d was arbitrary or capricious. It was not.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">The Governor had before him evidence and information, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>the form of reports from the division of occupational safety (DOS) and the Department of Public Health (DPH), that the OCME had received substandard performance ratings on recently conducted health and safety inspections and that the hazardous workplace environment at the OCME, together with a lack of established protocol or written policies, poses numerous serious safety risks to persons working there. (To provide but two examples, the DPH found the OCME to be in violation of eleven State regulations promulgated to protect people from overexposure to radiation, and the DOS determined that OCME workers were unprotected from exposure to chemical and biological hazards in the autopsy area.) Findings and recommendations of a consulting firm hired by the EOPS to conduct an independent study of the OCME mirrored the reports of the DOS and DPH.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">In addition, the Secretary had provided the Governor with evidence of two recent operational failures within the OCME, which, the Secretary opined, had damaged the integrity and reputation of the office, and which could have been avoided with effective oversight by the plaintiff. Overcrowding had long plagued the OCME.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On March 15, 2007, it was reported in the Boston Globe that bodies overflowed the storage areas at the OCME and were being stacked in refrigerator trucks, parked outside the building, that are normally reserved for holding disaster victims. The plaintiff\u2019s initial response to the EOPS was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>that sixty cases had lingered at its facility for longer than fourteen days, either unclaimed or unidentified. Further investigation forced the plaintiff to admit that there were, in fact, over one hundred cases in that category. In a series of electronic mail messages (emails), the Secretary issued the plaintiff a directive charging the OCME with eliminating the case backlog. Subsequent e-mails indicate that the plaintiff was less than responsive to inquiries, made by the undersecretary, as to his progress in this assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">By April 25, however, the body backlog had been addressed and the facility was operating at just below capacity. On that day, OCME personnel were unable to locate a body that a forensic dentist had been assigned to work on. According to the OCME mortuary manager, it was not \u201cuncommon in our recent practices to not be able to locate a body within the facility right awa[y], because we have had an abundance of bodies here.\u201d On Tuesday, May 1, the body still had not been located. On the morning of Wednesday, May 2, the plaintiff was informed that a body was missing and that a search had been conducted. Although the plaintiff was told that the body had been missing for one week, he did not alert the undersecretary, who was present at the OCME that morning, of the situation. The next day, when the OCME\u2019s chief administrative officer learned that the plaintiff (despite advice given to him by his legal counsel) still had not communicated with the Secretary or the undersecretary about the missing body, she did so herself. By that time, however, a funeral home and a Globe reporter had called the OCME to make inquiries about a missing body. The plaintiff acknowledged to the Governor at the hearing that his twenty-four-hour delay in communicating with the Secretary or the undersecretary was an error.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">We agree that the \u201cfor cause\u201d standard in \u00a7 9 cannot be read in a vacuum, but requires assessment in the context of the reasonable expectations and demands of a particular governmental office. Even when we accept the parties\u2019 understandings memorialized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>in the January 21, 2005, letter, generally to define the standards by which the Governor would evaluate the plaintiff\u2019s performance in office, we conclude that the missing body situation, and the plaintiff\u2019s mishandling of that situation, sufficiently supports the Governor\u2019s decision to remove the plaintiff from office \u201cfor cause.\u201d Given the separate obligations and duties imposed on the chief medical examiner by legislative directive, see G. L. c. 38, \u00a7 2, it is not reasonable to suggest, as does the plaintiff, that the Governor was barred from criticizing the plaintiff\u2019s performance until three to five years had passed, or that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to meet expectations not covered within the terms of the letter could not constitute sufficient \u201ccause\u201d to permit the Governor to exercise his discretion, under G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 9, to remove the plaintiff from office.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The evidence before the Governor sufficiently supports his determination that there were serious problems concerning the performance of the plaintiff\u2019s administrative and managerial duties. The Governor was presented with reason to believe that the body backlog and the missing body situation (even though perhaps not directly attributable to the plaintiff\u2019s conduct) were exacerbated by the plaintiff\u2019s failure to communicate fully and frankly with his superiors at the EOPS. (The plaintiff himself concedes that the missing body situation was within his area of responsibility and that his failure to report, in a timely manner, and confer fully with the Secretary and undersecretary, was his own error.) The record also supports the Governor\u2019s conclusion that a critical lack of effective oversight, including written procedures and protocols, existed at the OCME. Because the Governor\u2019s decision has support in the record and is free from any error of law, it is not arbitrary or capricious. Judgment on the pleadings of the plaintiff\u2019s wrongful dismissal claims is warranted.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">2. We now take up the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s contract claims under the familiar standard applicable to motions pursuant to rule 12 (b): \u201ca complaint should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Citron, </em>372 Mass. 96, 98 (1977), quoting <em>Conley </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In appraising the sufficiency of the plaintiffs complaint, we accept the relevant facts alleged in the complaint, as well as such inferences as may be drawn therefrom in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, as true. See <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Citron, supra. </em>We recite briefly those facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">During the recruitment process, the plaintiff met with Governor Romney, who offered to appoint the plaintiff as chief medical examiner, subject to the recommendation from the CMI. The plaintiff informed Governor Romney of his need for an agreement establishing the priorities of the OCME and evidencing the administration\u2019s commitment to their achievement during the five-year term of his appointment. The plaintiff explained that the OCME was in an administrative, operational, and forensic medical crisis, that the agency\u2019s deficiencies were long standing and severe, and that substantial commitments, financial, administrative, and programmatic, were necessary to resolve the crisis and to establish a truly independent, professional office of the type necessary to meet national standards of accreditation and satisfy the State\u2019s statutory requirements. Governor Romney stated that he would make those commitments, and, at Governor Romney\u2019s direction, the plaintiff pursued further negotiation of the terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>his employment agreement with the Secretary and the undersecretary. The plaintiff verified with the Secretary and the undersecretary that they had the authority to negotiate the details of the agreement. During the negotiations, on several occasions, the plaintiff stated that he would in no circumstances accept the appointment unless a mutual understanding was reached concerning the problems he would face as chief medical examiner and that he absolutely would not accept the appointment if expectations for his performance were, in his judgment, unreasonable. The Secretary promised the plaintiff that his effort to lead the medical recovery of the OCME would receive the full support of the administration. Together, the parties negotiated the terms of a work plan that would produce results from three to five years after the plaintiff assumed his position as chief medical examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s contract claims are premised on the interpretation of the Secretary\u2019s letter as an enforceable contract. The plaintiff asserts that Governor Romney intended the letter to be a written memorialization of their understanding that the difficulties that the plaintiff was undertaking to address would require a long-term effort (three to five years) and a promise, on the part of his administration, to support the plaintiff in this effort. The plaintiff further asserts that Governor Romney understood that such a contract was a prerequisite to the plaintiff\u2019s acceptance of the job offer and that his indorsement of the letter acted as a voluntary constraint on the exercise of gubernatorial discretion under G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">We conclude that the plaintiff has failed to state a claim on which relief may be granted. This is so, because the contract (assuming, as the plaintiff does, that the letter is a contract) states on its face that the plaintiff\u2019s tenure as chief medical examiner is governed by G. L. c. 38, \u00a7 2 (standards for appointment), and G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 9 (standards for removal). Although the statutory standards for appointment express that the appointment would be for a term of five years, tenure in office under the provisions of G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 9, may be cut short at any time \u201cfor cause.\u201d As discussed in part 1 of this opinion, cause was sufficiently established to support the Governor\u2019s decision to remove the plaintiff from office. The Commonwealth is entitled to dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s contract claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>One more point is in order. In reply to the plaintiff\u2019s assertion that the January 21 letter operates as a voluntary constraint, authorized by Governor Romney, on the future exercise of gubernatorial discretion (currently, by Governor Patrick), the Attorney General argues that a Governor cannot waive legislative authority and that \u201cenforcement of contractual obligations [contained in the letter] would conflict with the Governor\u2019s power over enforcement [of G. L. c. 38, \u00a7 2, and G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 9].\u201d This argument may not hold true in every case. A Governor clearly has authority, in the absence of statutory or other provision to the contrary, to enter into agreements that would, effectively, bind or constrain gubernatorial administrative, or managerial, discretion in the future. Simply put, any contractual agreements in this case have been terminated, not because of the lack of gubernatorial authority to execute them, but because the parties intended, and stated, that any contractual undertakings were to operate within the statutory limitations of G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">3. The Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss claims one through five of the plaintiff\u2019s second amended complaint, and its motion for judgment on the pleadings as to claims six through twelve of the complaint, are allowed. This case is remanded to the county court, where judgment is to enter in favor of the Commonwealth on claims six through twelve of the second amended complaint, and where claims one through five are to be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b763-6\">General Laws c. 38, \u00a7 2, establishes the office of chief medical examiner, under the supervision and control of the chief medical examiner, and within the executive office of public safety. The statute sets forth professional qualifications for the position of chief medical examiner and provides that \u201cthe chief medical examiner shall be appointed by the governor for a term of five years from among a list of not less than three nominees recommended by the commission on medicolegal investigation\u201d (CMI).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b763-7\">The CMI is organized under G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 184, and is \u201cin the executive office of public safety.\u201d Its members are the \u201cattorney general, the secretary of public safety, the commissioner of public health or their designees, and thirteen persons to be appointed by the governor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>According to facts alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s second amended complaint, the CMI evaluated eligible candidates for the position of chief medical examiner and recommended the plaintiff alone for appointment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b764-7\">General Laws c. 30, \u00a7 9, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-8\">\u201cUnless some other mode of removal is provided by law, a public officer, if appointed by the governor, may at any time be removed by him for cause, and, if appointed by him with the advice and consent of the council, may be so removed with its advice and consent.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b764-9\">We join the Governor in the assessment of the plaintiffs medical credentials. Those credentials, and his curriculum vitae, establish excellent competency in the areas in which he practices and has skills. In the public sector, however, collision can occur between the professional competency of the public official involved and the official\u2019s administration of a difficult job, such that the provisions of G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 9, are called into play. When such a collision occurs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>the legal question presented is the determination of \u201ccause\u201d for removal, which invokes consideration by the Governor of the need for efficient and effective administration of a public office. That consideration necessarily requires evaluation of factors beyond professional competency alone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b765-11\">Pursuant to St. 2007, c. 19, \u00a7 3, the name of the Executive Office of Public Safety has changed to the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security. This change has no bearing on the issues before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b767-8\">We do not consider the plaintiffs claim, raised in his reply brief, that the hearing he was afforded before the Governor was constitutionally insufficient. The plaintiff was given \u201cnotice of the charges against him, an explanation of the [Governor\u2019s] evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story.\u201d <em>Cleveland Bd. of Educ. </em>v. <em>Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985). Moreover, neither the plaintiff, nor his counsel, objected at the hearing to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>manner in which it was conducted. No procedural claim was asserted in the plaintiff\u2019s second amended complaint, nor was one included as a proposed question for this court\u2019s review in the addendum to the single justice\u2019s reservation and report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b768-10\">The plaintiff argued, primarily through his counsel, at the hearing that the deficiencies at the OCME were long standing and that only substantial financial, administrative, and programmatic commitments would turn the situation around. The plaintiff emphasized to the Governor that his five-year appointment to office was conditioned on the understanding that he would need at least three to five years to achieve the objectives set forth for him at that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b768-11\">In September, 2006, in response to the plaintiff\u2019s urging, the EOPS promulgated emergency regulations to permit the release of unclaimed or unidentified bodies to the Department of Transitional Assistance for burial, two weeks after the body was received by the OCME (after reasonable steps were taken to identify the bodies and next of kin). See 505 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.04 (2006). The regulation went into effect on October 30, 2006. <em>Id. </em>From that date, until mid-March, 2007, however, the OCME had released only three or four unclaimed bodies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b769-7\">It was discovered, later in the afternoon of May 3, that the missing body had been mistakenly released to a funeral home, on April 24, in place of another body. The mixup occurred because mortuary technicians at the OCME failed to confirm the identity of the body, by checking information contained on its \u201ctoe tag,\u201d or scanning the \u201ctoe tag\u201d into the OCME\u2019s computer system, before releasing it for burial. The plaintiff argued before the Governor that the situation was one of \u201chuman error\u201d for which he was not responsible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b770-7\">In light of this conclusion, we need not comment on the Commonwealth\u2019s claim, raised in its motion to dismiss count twelve of the plaintiff\u2019s second amended complaint, that relief by mandamus, in these circumstances, cannot be obtained against the Governor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b771-6\">In <em>Bell Atl. Corp. </em>v. <em>Twombly, </em>127 S. Ct. 1955 (2007), the Supreme Court of the United States altered the traditional wording of the rule applicable to motions to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), set forth one-half century earlier in <em>Conley </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957). The modified Federal rule is that, to survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain factual allegations \u201cenough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level . . . on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. </em>v. <em>Twombly, supra </em>at 1965, citing 5 C.A. Wright &amp; A.R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1216, at 235-236 (3d ed. 2004). See <em>Nguyen </em>v. <em>William Joiner Ctr. for Study of War &amp; Social Consequences, </em>450 Mass 291, 296 n.7 (2007); <em>Eigerman </em>v. <em>Putnam Invs., Inc., </em>450 Mass. 281, 286 n.7 (2007). The new Federal standard was recently adopted by this court, see <em>Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., ante </em>623, 625 n.7, 635-636 (2008), but we did so after the time of the filing of the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss, and the Commonwealth does not ask us to apply the stricter standard to its motion. The plaintiff\u2019s complaint would not survive a motion to dismiss considered under either standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
