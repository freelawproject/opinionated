After a hearing which complied with the requirements of G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43 (a), Rossi was discharged by unanimous vote of the school committee because of serious misconduct involving a male pupil at the school. Rossi seasonably requested a hearing by the Civil Service Commission (Commission) under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43 (b). On September 18, 1963, a pro forma hearing was had before a hearing officer; no witnesses were heard; the hearing was continued to October 4, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">By letter dated September 18, 1963, the committee requested the city solicitor of Everett <em>\u201cto </em>represent it at this formal hearing on October 4, 1963; and [stated^ that the Committee will be glad to cooperate in supplying you with whatever information it may have with regard to the entire matter.\u201d At the hearing on October 4, 1963, the city solicitor represented the committee. He \u201cwas accompanied by\u201d the superintendent of schools who also acts as secretary for the committee, but is not a member of the committee. The hearing was completed on October 4, 1963. At its conclusion, Rossi\u2019s council and the city solicitor submitted to the hearing officer a paper dated October 4, 1963, bearing the caption \u201cAgreement\u201d which read as follows: \u2014 \u201cIt is hereby agreed that the Appointing Authority\u2019s decision of September 4, 1963 be modified so that it reads \u2018Voted to suspend you from your position as custodian until Septem-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>her 1, 1964 without pay.\u2019 Further Frank K. Rossi waives all right to appeal and other remedies he may have.\u201d The statement was signed by Rossi. Near the left margin of the paper below the quoted recital were the words \u201cAssented to,\u201d beneath which appeared the signature of Rossi\u2019s counsel and the signature of the city solicitor followed by the words \u201cCity Solicitor for appointing authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">On February 26, 1964, the Commission voted that the action of the committee in discharging Rossi be modified to a suspension without pay from September 5, 1963, to September 5, 1964. The Commission notified the parties that \u201cafter due consideration of all the evidence\u201d the modification was made \u201cas agreed between the employee and the appointing authority.\u201d The committee refused to file a reinstatement form as instructed by the Director of Civil Service. An exchange of letters between the Commission and the committee followed. The committee insisted that although the city solicitor represented it at the hearing, he had no authority to make the agreement with Rossi, that the committee was the appointing authority and as such had unanimously voted to discharge Rossi, that the vote remained unchanged and that the committee had never been a party to any agreement to the contrary. The Commission, on the other hand, took the position that the city solicitor \u201cas the authorized representative of the appointing authority . . . had the power to enter into the agreement upon which the Commission acted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Since there is no express agreement to the contrary, under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 126, we are at liberty, as was the trial judge, to draw inferences from the facts and documents stated in the case to determine facts for ourselves and reach such conclusions as we think are warranted. <em>Cambridge </em>v. Somerville, 329 Mass. 658, 660. <em>Yates </em>v. <em>Salem, </em>342 Mass. 460, 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The letters from the Commission to the committee show \u2022that but for the purported \u201cagreement\u201d submitted to the hearing officer the Commission\u2019s decision to modify the appointing authority\u2019s order would not have been made. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>We think that the city solicitor had no authority, express or implied, to make the \u201cagreement.\u201d The committee requested and expected the city solicitor to contest Rossi\u2019s appeal from its order discharging him. It did not delegate to the city solicitor the right to exercise its prerogatives or powers under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43 (a), as the appointing authority. There is nothing in the Revised Ordinances of the city, which are included in the agreed facts so far as they relate to the powers and duties of the city solicitor, conferring upon him the power to act as he presumed to act here. Nor was there apparent authority in the city solicitor to make the agreement. He had not been held out by the committee to Rossi or to the Commission as empowered to do more than to use his professional talents to protect his client\u2019s interest at the hearing. We attach no significance favorable to Rossi to the fact that the superintendent of schools \u201caccompanied\u201d the city solicitor. The superintendent had no authority to change the committee\u2019s vote as the appointing authority. The superintendent\u2019s correspondence with the Commission on behalf of the committee both before and after the October hearing shows that neither he nor the members of the committee were aware of the nature or contents of the paper submitted to the hearing officer by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">It is our conclusion that the city solicitor acted without authority and that neither Rossi nor the Commission had the right to rely upon the city solicitor\u2019s representation, implied by his assent to the agreement, that he had such authority. Faced with this factual situation we apply the rule stated in <em>Precious </em>v. <em>O\u2019Rourke, </em>270 Mass. 305, 308. \u201cWhen the attorney undertakes to bind his client by an agreement to compromise his client\u2019s substantial rights, the opposing party must ascertain at his peril whether the attorney has authority to make the settlement.\u201d The Commission\u2019s decision, having been based upon an unauthorized compromise agreement between Rossi and the city solicitor, cannot stand. <em>Precious </em>v. <em>O\u2019Rourke, </em>270 Mass. 305, 308, 309. The judge\u2019s order was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
