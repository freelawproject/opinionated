The case was heard on a case stated. The judge found for the plaintiffs. On report to the Appellate Division the finding was vacated and a finding for the defendant was ordered. The plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">During the period here material the plaintiffs were the holders of a policy of insurance entitled \u201cCrime Policy\u201d issued by the defendant. The plaintiffs owned and operated the Falls Theatre in Chicopee Falls, and the policy covered this theatre, except for Coverages B and C, which were expressly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">On August 27, 1965, two youths of about thirteen years of age entered the Falls Theatre, while it was not open for business, \u201cby forcing a rear exit door, as evidenced by physical damage to the exterior of the premises at the place of entry.\u201d After entering \u201cthey broke into a candy case and ice-cream freezer, taking some of the contents thereof.\u201d The theatre \u201cwas found littered with candy and ice cream.\u201d They also \u201cslashed the picture screen which is affixed to the building.\u201d *<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 234567All conditions for recovery under the policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>such as notice, proof of loss and payment of premium have been complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The defendant\u2019s requests for rulings, which were denied, need not concern us. It was the duty of the judge to order the correct judgment on the case stated; requests for rulings had no standing. <em>Associates Discount Corp. </em>v. <em>Gillineau, </em>322 Mass. 490, 491. <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Cambridge Sav. Bank, </em>346 Mass. 327, 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The plaintiffs ground their right to recover on Coverage D (2) of the policy under which the defendant undertook to \u201cpay for . . . <em>damage to the premises caused </em>by robbery, by safe burglary or <em>by or following burglarious entry into the premises, or attempt thereat\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). Since there was no robbery or safe burglary, the plaintiffs must bring themselves under the italicized portion of Coverage D (2), and show that there was \u201cdamage to the premises,\u201d which was caused \u201cby or following burglarious entry into the premises.\u201d Coverage D (2) has other provisions, but the only one here material is that quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">We first must consider whether the agreed facts show a \u201cburglarious entry,\u201d for if there was not such an entry the plaintiffs cannot prevail. Although \u201cburglarious\u201d is not defined in the policy, \u201cburglary\u201d is defined as \u201cthe wrongful abstraction ... of merchandise, furnishings, fixtures and equipment by any person or persons making felonious entry into the premises.\u201d The parties appear to agree that \u201cburglarious\u201d should be interpreted in the light of the above definition, with emphasis on the words \u201cwrongful abstraction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">The defendant has not raised the issue whether the wrongful entry was felonious. Eather the defendant contends that there was no \u201cwrongful abstraction\u201d and therefore no \u201cburglarious entry,\u201d because the boys may not have taken any of the ice cream or candy when they left. Thus, it is argued, their conduct constituted vandalism but not burglary. We are of opinion that this construction of the facts is too restrictive. \u201cAbstraction\u201d is not a word of settled technical meaning such as \u201cembezzlement\u201d or \u201clarceny.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Northway, </em>120 U. S. 327, 334; <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>332 F. 2d 123, 133 (5th Cir.). It has been, defined as a \u201c[Tjaking from with intent to injure or defraud.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4th ed.). The removal of the ice cream from the freezer and the resulting loss to the plaintiffs constituted such a taking, even if the boys did not carry it out of the building. We hold that there was a \u201cburglarious entry\u201d within the meaning of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">\u25a0 We turn now to the question whether the damage to the picture screen, candy, and ice cream comes within the coverage of \u201cdamage to the premises\u201d contained in the policy. The term \u201cpremises\u201d is defined in the policy to mean \u201cthose portions of the interior of any building which are occupied and controlled\u201d by the insured. But this definition does little to resolve the issue whether \u201cpremises\u201d refers only to the building itself or includes fixtures, equipment, and merchandise as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The word \u201cpremises\u201d may have different meanings, depending on the context in which it is used. See <em>Old South Assn. </em>v. <em>Codman, </em>211 Mass. 211, 216, and cases cited. The word \u201cas . . . commonly used . . . has reference to lands or buildings regarded as separate units or entities .... Except possibly when used in some peculiar context, \u2018premises\u2019 does not include personal property.\u201d <em>Doherty\u2019s Case, </em>294 Mass. 363, 366-367. Other cases to the same effect are: <em>Casey </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry. </em>255 Mass. 33; <em>Staley </em>v. <em>People, </em>78 Colo. 67, 70; <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Roger Williams Ins. Co. </em>60 N. H. 513 (\u201c[T]he term \u2018premises\u2019 does not include and is never used to designate personal property. It is used, both in law and in common speech, to indicate lands and tenements.\u201d P. 520); <em>Mosley </em>v. <em>Vermont Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>55 Vt. 142, 148-149.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">We are mindful that the principal damage was to the picture screen which was \u201caffixed\u201d to \"the building. We assume, as the plaintiffs argue, that it was a fixture. But it does not follow that it constituted part of the \u201cpremises\u201d within the meaning of the policy. Earlier in the very portion of the policy, Coverage D (2), under which the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>tiffs seek to recover there is a clause covering \u201closs of other property or damage thereto caused by robbery within the premises.\u201d \u201cProperty\u201d is defined as \u201cmoney, securities, merchandise, furnishings, equipment or other tangible personal property, and <em>fixtures, real or </em>personal\u201d (emphasis supplied). An examination of other clauses in the policy reveals an intent to differentiate between \u201cpremises\u201d and \u201cfixtures.\u201d - For example, Coverage B (2) affords protection for \u201cdamage to the <em>premises </em>and to merchandise, furnishings, <em>fixtures </em>and equipment within the premises caused by burglary [or] robbery of a watchman\u201d (emphasis supplied). Other clauses in Coverage D indicate that whenever the word \u201cpremises\u201d is used it applies only to the building itself, and not to its contents. Thus when Coverages-D (4) and D (5) include property within their scope, they refer specifically to \u201cdamage to the premises <em>and to property within the premises\" </em>(emphasis supplied). We conclude, therefore, 'that the words \u201cdamage to the premises\u201d in Coverage D (2) did not protect the plaintiffs, with an exception presently to be noted, with respect to any of the property here involved. And subject to this exception the order of the Appellate .Division was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">At the arguments before us, counsel for the defendant stated that if there was a burglarious entry the plaintiffs are entitled to recover the sum of $44.50, the cost of repairing the exit doors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since we have held that there was a bur-glarious entry, the plaintiffs are entitled to recover this sum. Accordingly, to permit- such recovery, the order of the Appellate Division, otherwise correct, must be reversed and judgment is to be entered for the plaintiffs in the sum of $44.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">\n<em>So ordered.-</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-10\"> \u201cThe charges incurred by the plaintiffs as a result of the damage are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">1.
