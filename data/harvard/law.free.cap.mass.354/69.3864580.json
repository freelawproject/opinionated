The jury returned verdicts of guilty on both indictments with a recommendation that the sentence of death be not imposed. The trial was held subject to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G, and the cases are here by appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">The defendant filed three assignments of error. Each of these relates to the denial of his motions to suppress various items of \u201cevidence and information,\u201d on the grounds that they were obtained (assignment 1) \u201cas a result of the use of wire tapping devices in violation of Mass. G. L. [c.] 272, Sec. 99, Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, Chapter 722, Art. 38.23, Federal Statute, 47 U. S. C. 605, and the Constitution of the United States, Amendments IV and V\u201d; (assignment 2) \u201cwithout warrant by an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of the Constitution of the United States, Amendment IV\u201d; and (assignment 3) \u201cfrom the defendant in violation of the Constitution of the United States, Amendment VI, while the defendant was deprived of the assistance of counsel.\u201d The defendant made one motion to suppress which was denied, without prejudice, after hearing, several months before the trial. A second motion to suppress was heard at the trial and also denied. In ruling on both motions, the judge heard testimony on voir dire and made findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">A complaint charging the defendant with murder, and a warrant for his arrest, were issued by the District Court in Worcester on May 16, 1966.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On May 17, 1966, the district attorney applied for an order under G. L. c. 272, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>\u00a7 99, authorizing Worcester police officers to tap the telephone of one Karen Nylen. The order was issued on the same day. After the wiretap was in effect, the defendant telephoned Karen Nylen from San Antonio, Texas, five to seven times. The Worcester police, by intercepting these calls, discovered that the defendant was in San Antonio. They subsequently informed the Bexar County, Texas, sheriff\u2019s office of the defendant\u2019s presence in San Antonio, and sent to the sheriff\u2019s office a description of the outstanding complaint and a photograph of the defendant. The sheriff\u2019s officers in San Antonio asked the local telephone company to inform them of any calls between that city and Worcester. When, on May 23, 1966, the defendant telephoned Karen Nylen from a booth at the San Antonio YMCA, he was arrested in the booth within a few minutes of placing the call. The defendant was taken by the arresting officers past the desk of the YMCA. The desk clerk \u201chad a bag, bowling bag\u201d and the defendant \u201cstated that was his bag.\u201d One of the officers asked the defendant if he \u201cwanted the bag,\u201d and he said, \u201c[Y]es.\u201d The clerk handed the bag to one of the officers. It contained a .22 calibre pistol (identified at the trial as the murder weapon), ammunition, clothing, and various papers which were later admitted in evidence. These items constitute the tangible evidence which the defendant seeks to suppress. Subsequently, the defendant was taken before a Texas court where he waived rendition proceedings. The defendant was then returned to the Commonwealth in the company of two Worcester police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The defendant contends that the wiretap in Massachusetts and the telephone interception in Texas were in violation of applicable State statutes, and that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, is unconstitutional. In support of the latter proposition the defendant cites <em>Berger </em>v. <em>New York, </em>388 U. S. 41. He further argues that \u201cWithout the tap the person and property of . . . [the defendant] would not have been seized.\u201d Under the so called \u201cexclusionary rule\u201d of <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U. S. 643, 655, 657, it is argued, the pistol and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>items were evidence derived from an unlawful search and were \"branded with the initial taint.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spafford, </em>343 Mass. 703, 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">We do not agree. A valid warrant, supported by evidence of probable cause, was issued before the wiretap was instituted. Even if we assume that there was some defect in the wiretap, we cannot perceive how this evidence was thereby tainted. \"We need not hold that all evidence is \u2018fruit of the poisonous tree\u2019 simply because it would not have come to light but for the illegal actions of the police. Rather, the more apt question in such a case is \u2018whether, granting establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which instant objection is made has been come at by exploitation of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 371 U. S. 471, 487-488. In the instant case the means are sufficiently distinguishable. The judge found that the seizure of the defendant\u2019s bag was incident to a lawful arrest. It appears that the only information garnered from the tap pertained not to probable cause but only to the defendant\u2019s whereabouts. To hold that an arrest is not lawful where the only illegality alleged involves the discovery of information leading to the defendant\u2019s apprehension, goes far beyond the already stringent effects of the exclusionary rule. We believe the seizure was incident to a lawful arrest, and as a consequence we hold that the line between the alleged illegality and the discovery of the questioned evidence had \"become so attenuated as to dissipate the taint.\u201d <em>Nardone </em>v. <em>United States, </em>308 U. S. 338, 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The defendant also contends that he was not warned of his constitutional rights as required by <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436, 467, 468, \u201cbefore being asked to identify the bag\u201d at the San Antonio YMCA. It is apparently urged that because of this lack of warning, the defendant\u2019s admission that the bag was his should have been suppressed. Whatever may be the precise thrust of this argument, it appears to be founded on a misreading of the record. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>arresting officer testified on voir dire that the defendant observed his bag in the possession of the desk clerk, volunteered that it was his, and was asked only if he wanted it. The defendant testified to a totally different chain of events, but the judge found that he \u201cwas not worthy of belief in his contentions concerning the bag . . ..\u201d There appears to have been no trace of \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d to which the rule of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>might apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The defendant\u2019s final contention is that he was denied counsel at the rendition hearing in Texas, which was a \u201ccritical stage of the proceedings against . . . [him],\u201d and that he could not intelligently waive his \u201crights.\u201d There was conflicting evidence as to the degree of the defendant\u2019s understanding of the proceedings, the advice he was given, and his alleged decision to forgo the assistance of counsel until he returned to Worcester. We do not find it necessary to resolve the question whether his waiver was intelligent or whether he was adequately informed of his rights to counsel. <em>\u201cMiranda </em>does not apply to rendition . . . hearings .... Interstate rendition proceedings are summary in nature and the accused is not entitled to all of the procedural protections of a criminal trial.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Flood, Warden, </em>374 F. 2d 554, 557 (2d Cir.). The defendant has availed himself of the opportunity to argue the constitutionality of his arrest at the trial and on this appeal. The motion to suppress was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">We have reviewed the entire record and are of opinion that justice does not require a new trial or the entry of a verdict of a lesser degree of guilt in the murder case. See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, as amended by St. 1962, c. 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b114-10\"> The defendant does not contend that there was not probable cause for the issuance of the warrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
