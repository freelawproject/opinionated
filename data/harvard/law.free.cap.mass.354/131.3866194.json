Her husband seeks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>consequential damages. Counts for gross negligence having been waived, the case was submitted to the jury on the counts for negligence. Verdicts were returned for the plaintiff and her husband, which were recorded under leave reserved. Thereafter the judge, on motion, entered verdicts for the defendants subject to the exceptions of the plaintiff and her husband. In determining the correctness of this action the same test is applied as in the case of a motion for a directed verdict. <em>Berwick &amp; Smith Co. </em>v. <em>Salem </em>Press, <em>Inc. </em>331 Mass. 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The pertinent evidence was as follows: The plaintiff and the defendant Leone Myers are sisters. Prior to the date of the accident they had agreed to go to the home of a relative in Norwell to dispose of the effects of a deceased aunt. Leone\u2019s car not being available, the plaintiff, at Leone\u2019s request, drove to Cohasset in order to transport her to Nor-well. While the plaintiff was in Leone\u2019s house the telephone rang and, Leone being in another part of the house, the plaintiff undertook to answer it. In hurrying to the telephone she slipped on a scatter rug and fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The issue is whether the plaintiff was conferring such a benefit on her sister as to entitle the plaintiff to the care owed to a business visitor, rather than that owed to a guest, i.e., to refrain from acts of gross negligence. We are of opinion that the plaintiff\u2019s status was that of \u00e1 social guest. Such benefit as the plaintiff was conferring on her sister was that of a \u201cmember of a family . . . rendering friendly help in household routine\u201d and was not of \u201cthe character . . . [to] make it clearly the dominant aspect of the relationship.\u201d <em>Pandiscio </em>v. Bowen, 342 Mass. 435, 437-438. That case is controlling. See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Goldstein, </em>329 Mass. 161, 163-165, and cases there collected. Compare <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Brote, ante, </em>129.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">In view of this conclusion we do not reach the question whether the defendants were negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
