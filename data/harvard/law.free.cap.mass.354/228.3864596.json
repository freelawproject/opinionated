L. c. 117, \u00a7 24A (as amended through St. 1964, c. 515), for reimbursement for the cost of hospitalization furnished at the plaintiff\u2019s hospital in Boston to Tracy A. Laytart, a baby living with her parents in Nashua, New Hampshire, is reported without decision by a judge of the Superior Court on a statement of agreed facts, which, together with an auditor\u2019s report, \u201cmay be submitted as a case stated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">We cull the facts from the statement and the auditor\u2019s report and arrange them chronologically.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">Tracy was born August 12, 1964. Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center (Children\u2019s) provided adequate and necessary hospital care to her on three occasions: (1) October 30 to December 10, 1964; (2) March 3 to March 9, 1965; (3) March 27 to April 3, 1965. On October 29, 1964, she had extremely severe breathing problems, and was admitted to St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital in Nashua. There a tracheotomy was performed. A tube inserted in her chest became plugged. On the following day she was transported to Children\u2019s on the advice of her attending physician, who felt that the Nashua hospital\u2019s facilities were inadequate. He also felt that Children\u2019s with its hyperbaric unit could, handle the case most efficiently. Children\u2019s is the only hospital in Greater Boston with such a unit. Tracy in fact did not require the unit. The type of care furnished her was not unique to Children\u2019s, where she was placed in a croupette, given oxygen and antibiotics, and carefully watched. This was the type of care she needed. It could have been furnished by many hospitals in the area, including Boston City Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">The Nashua physician used good medical judgment in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>\u25a0referring Tracy to Children\u2019s but sent her \u201cin a highly unusual manner.\u201d He wrote a note to Children\u2019s and had Tracy transported there with her mother in an ambulance without previous communication. Neither Tracy nor her parents had prior contact with Children\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">On October 30,1964, it would not have been good medical practice for Children\u2019s to refuse Tracy admission or to transfer her to another hospital. She had labored breathing which diminished the capacity of the lung. On November 5, 1964, the chest opening where the tube had been inserted was enlarged because of a large collection of air in the mediastinum. During the latter part of November the doctors tried taking out the tube to allow her to breathe on her own. From November 21 through December 4, 1964, the tube was periodically removed and reinserted because she could not function without it. On December 6, she was able to function without a tube for the first time since admission, and on December 10 was returned to her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The child and her parents had no resources with which to pay her expenses of hospitalization. Upon her admission the mother agreed to pay the entire bill when she should be discharged. Upon discharge, a budget arrangement of $5 a month was made based upon the parents\u2019 ability to pay. At the time of the auditor\u2019s hearing the budget arrangement was being kept.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">On March 3, 1965, the child was again sent to Children\u2019s. The admission was medical and nonsurgical. It was good medical practice to continue the treatment at Children\u2019s. This was the most convenient and logical hospital to handle the case, but there was no emergency which could not have been handled by any other Boston hospital. It would not have been dangerous to her health to return the child to Nashua, but it would have been \u201cillogical, unreasonable and not in accordance with good medical practice.\u201d On March 3, Children\u2019s, having knowledge that Tracy was a welfare patient, reasonably could have refused her admission or referred the case to Boston City Hospital. That institu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>tian was fully capable of furnishing the same treatment in an equally competent and effective manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">On March 27, 1965, the child was X-rayed at Children\u2019s outpatient department, and as a result was admitted as an inpatient. She stayed seven days, and was given a \u201cbarium swallow\u201d and oxygen. Her temperature returned to normal on the fourth day.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Children\u2019s has notified the New Hampshire welfare authorities and has received no payment from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Children\u2019s \u201cduly notified the City of Boston, in writing, of each admission\u201d respectively on November 2, 1964, and March 5 and 30, 1965. Each notice was addressed to the Board of Public Welfare and contained the following: \u201cThe Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center having considered this patient\u2019s medical situation and family\u2019s financial circumstances, hereby gives notice to you that the above person is being furnished hospital care at this hospital under the provisions\u201d of G. L. c. 117, \u00a7 24A. \u201cNotice is hereby given that such care being necessarily incurred under c. 117 ... is being charged to your municipality henceforth and until in response to this request you make provision for the . . . patient.\u201d (Signed), \u201cThe Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center, by Community Assistance Office.\u201d \u201cThere was no signature of the patient or her parents on any of the aforesaid notices.\u201d At no time did the Boston welfare or hospital authorities ever remove, seek to remove, or request the removal of Tracy to the Boston City Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Children\u2019s made demand upon the parents by billing them for each admission. Bills are due and payable weekly and in full on discharge. The hospitalization in each admission was necessary and so continued until discharge. Children\u2019s made no agreement with the patient, her parents, any governmental agency, or anyone, to treat the patient without fair compensation. Its charter does not require Children\u2019s to provide support or hospital care to the patient without fair compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">The charges for the respective admissions were: (1) October 30 to December 10, 1964, $1,691.25, and special duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>nurses $770. (2) March 3 to 9, 1965, $269.16. (3) March 27 to April 3, 1965, $314.02, and \u201ctake home\u201d medicine $1.25. The total is $3,045.68 of which $125 has been paid on account. If entitled to recover for all three admissions the plaintiff is entitled to $2,920.68 with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The sole issue is whether Children\u2019s has met the requirements of G. L. c. 117, \u00a7 24A, which reads in material part: \u201cIf hospital care is furnished to a <em>person in need of public assistance </em>by any <em>person not liable by law for his </em>support, the town wherein he resides at the time his hospitalization begins or, if at such time he does not reside in the commonwealth, the town where such care is furnished, shall be liable for the expense of such <em>care necessarily incurred </em>under this chapter after <em>notice and request </em>made in writing and <em>signed by such person </em>to one or more members of the board of public welfare thereof, and <em>until provision </em>is made <em>by them\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">1. The defendant\u2019s first contention is that the hospital care furnished the patient was not \u201cnecessarily incurred.\u201d Reliance is placed in part on early decisions such as <em>Lamson </em>v. <em>Newburyport, </em>14 Allen, 30, 31, and <em>Rawson </em>v. <em>Uxbridge, </em>113 Mass. 47, 48, dealing with liability of municipalities for the support of \u201cpaupers.\u201d A pauper \u201cis 'one residing or found in any town where he falls into distress, and stands in need of immediate relief.\u2019 <em>Shearer </em>v. <em>Shelburne, </em>10 Cush. 3, 5.\u201d <em>Symmes Arlington Hosp. Inc. </em>v. <em>Arlington, </em>292 Mass. 162, 163. Stress is laid upon the existence of the Boston City Hospital as a \u201cprovision made,\u201d analogous to the provision of an almshouse in the cases cited above.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is contended, \u201cIf the plaintiff was not willing to take its chance as to the ability of the child or the child\u2019s parents to pay for the child\u2019s hospitalization, all that the plaintiff had to do was to refuse to admit the child and send it on to the defendant\u2019s hospital. ... So long as the child had hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>care, the defendant was under no obligation to remove her to the defendant\u2019s hospital.\u201d These contentions are made in the teeth of the agreed fact: \u201cThe hospitalization of the patient on each admission was necessarily incurred and continued until the date of the patient\u2019s discharge.\u201d We are, in effect, asked to relieve the city of its agreement on the ground that its making should be \u201cdeemed improvident or not conducive to justice.\u201d See <em>Loring </em>v. <em>Mercier, </em>318 Mass. 599, 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">We need not deal with this request so far as the first admission is concerned, because the specific facts show that the services then furnished were \u201cnecessarily incurred.\u201d When the mother and child arrived by ambulance at Children\u2019s without warning on October 30, 1964, the child, consistently with good medical practice, could not have been put out on the sidewalk or been transferred to another hospital. These conclusions are amply evident from the case stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">A majority of the court do not reach the same conclusion as to the second and third admissions. At the time of the second admission the indigent condition of the child and her parents was well known to Children\u2019s. Although it was good medical practice to continue the treatment at Children\u2019s, which was the most convenient and logical hospital to handle the case, this was not adequate ground to create liability on the part of the city. It would have been reasonable to refuse her admission and refer the case to the Boston City Hospital. The third admission is an even weaker case for holding the city. The expenses of the second and third admissions were not necessarily incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">2. A second argument of the city is that the person in need of assistance did not sign the \u201cnotice and request\u201d to the Board of Public Welfare. Section 24A is admittedly ambiguous. There is uncertainty as to whether the signature on the required notice is to be that of the person in need of assistance or that of the person rendering aid. It is our duty to give the section a reasonable construction. <em>Massachusetts Turnpike Authy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>347 Mass. 524, 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>As applied to the case at bar, the city\u2019s argument means that the statute requires the signature of a child, notwithstanding that her age at the time of the first admission was two and one-half months. In general, this construction would exclude care to a person in a coma or to one of mental incapacity who is incapable of signing his name. The confusing phrase, \u201csigned by such person,\u201d was inserted by St. 1964, c. 515. The defendant definitely attributes this change to a reason founded upon a derogatory estimate of the ethical standards of hospitals, namely, that otherwise \u201ca hospital could seek public assistance for furnishing care to a person without that person\u2019s knowledge.\u201d It would, of course, be larceny intentionally to collect twice for the same services. G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 30. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Louis Constr. Co. Inc. </em>343 Mass. 600, 603-605; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Iannello, </em>344 Mass. 723, 734; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kiernan, </em>348 Mass. 29, 46; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gardinier, </em>350 Mass. 331. We cannot believe that the legislative intent was to require the impossible of some indigents for the sole purpose of preventing dishonesty by hospitals. See <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp. </em>v. <em>Revere, </em>346 Mass. 217, 223. We accept the more reasonable interpretation that the \u201cperson in need of public assistance\u201d is not required to sign. If the legislative intent be otherwise, a correcting amendment may be enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">3. The plaintiff is entitled to recover $2,461.25, with interest from the date of demand, for the cost of hospital care and special duty nurses furnished during the first admission less any amounts paid by Tracy\u2019s parents which may have been applied to the expenses of the first admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-7\"> As presently amended, the Commonwealth bears this liability.
