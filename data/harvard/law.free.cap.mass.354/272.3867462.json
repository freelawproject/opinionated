The parties each operate retail package stores in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Somerville. The stores are located approximately 500 yards apart on opposite sides of the same street. The plaintiff\u2019s store is in Cutter Square and that of the defendant is in Davis Square. Both stores are visible from the dividing line between the two squares. For some ten years the plaintiff has employed the words \u201cThis is the Place\u201d in connection with its enterprise. It has promoted this legend by an illuminated sign inside its store during that time, and by advertising through direct mail, circulars and newspapers between five and ten years. It has also within a period of five to ten years used the words on its stationery and billheads. The jackets of its employees are emblazoned with the slogan. In early 1962 the defendant, which had since 1948 operated a package store in Roxbury, purchased its present store in Davis Square. When in 1948 the defendant\u2019s principals acquired the Roxbury store they hung out a sign saying \u201cThis is the New Place\u201d and subsequently hung another sign containing the same words on a second store in Roxbury to which they moved and which was located across the street from the first one. The trading area served by the Roxbury stores does not include any part of the trading areas involved with the stores in Davis and Cutter squares. In the last weeks of 1965, the defendant had a sign proclaiming \u201cThis is the New Place\u201d affixed perpendicular to the outside of its Davis Square store, the word \u201cNew\u201d being larger than the other words and set off by a distinctive color. The judge found that in December, 1965, \u201c \u2018This is the Place\u2019 had a particular and distinctive meaning in and around Davis Square, Somerville, which was synonymous with Paramount Beverage, the Plaintiff\u2019s . . . store,\u201d that the use of the words \u201cThis is the New Place\u201d created a substantial risk that potential customers would be misled into confusing the two stores, and that the plaintiff had endeavored to protect the words \u201cThis is the Place\u201d in its trading area by \u201cseeming a trademark pursuant to . . . General Laws, Chapter 110, \u00a7 8, on January 21, 1965, [\u00a1and] making demand on [\u00a1the] defendant to cease use of the name \u2018This is the New Place.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>- We find no fault with the decree. The judge found quite reasonably on what was before him that the phrase \u201cThis is the Place\u201d had acquired a secondary meaning. Under principles elucidated in <em>American Waltham Watch Co. </em>v. <em>United States Watch Co. </em>173 Mass. 85, and still the law, the plaintiff became entitled to relief. See <em>S. M. Spencer Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>319 Mass. 331, 337; <em>H. P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Whiting Milk Co. </em>345 Mass. 287; <em>Great Scott Food Mkt. Inc. </em>v. <em>Sunderland Wonder Inc. </em>348 Mass. 320, 323. In addition, as the plaintiff has rightly contended, it is entitled to relief on a second theory. Even in the absence of proof of deception of the public, the fact that the similarities in the slogans in this case may create a reasonable probability that purchasers using ordinary care may be led to trade with the defendant in the belief that they are trading with the plaintiff will form a basis for relief. <em>Blair\u2019s Foodland Inc. </em>v. <em>Shuman\u2019s Foodland, Inc. </em>311 Mass. 172, 174, 175. <em>Cain\u2019s Lobster House, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>312 Mass. 512, 514. <em>Jays Inc. </em>v. <em>Jay-Originals Inc. </em>321 Mass. 737,740. That the defendant has used the words \u201cThis is the New Place\u201d in Roxbury does not in any sense vitiate the decree which the judge entered. <em>Blair\u2019s Foodland Inc. </em>v. <em>Shuman\u2019s Foodland, Inc., supra, </em>at p. 177. See <em>Great Scott Food Mkt. Inc. </em>v. <em>Sunderland Wonder Inc., supra, </em>at p. 324. Finally, it may be stated that the decree in enjoining not only the defendant but its officers, agents and servants from using the phrase \u201c \u2018This is the New Place\u2019 or any similar phrase or phrases\u201d is not too broad, as reference to <em>Summerfield Co. of Boston </em>v. <em>Prime Furniture Co. </em>242 Mass. 149, 152, 156, will indicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
