The plaintiff alleges loss and damage suffered while the shipments were in the possession of the defendant. There was a finding for the plaintiff on each of the counts in contract. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>On report to the Appellate Division the findings for the plaintiff were vacated and findings were ordered to be entered for the defendant. The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The sole question reported by the Municipal Court judge to the Appellate Division was the admission in evidence of United States Department of Agriculture inspection certificates to prove the sound condition of the cantaloupes at point of origin. As stated in the opinion of the Appellate Division, \u2018 \u2018 [o]n the basis of these certificates and what they stated, the court would have been warranted in finding that when delivered to the carrier the cantaloupes were free of taint or defect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The certificates are headed \u201cUnited States Department of Agriculture\u201d and are entitled \u201cInspection Certificate.\u201d The foregoing is followed by a printed statement which reads: \u201cThis certificate is issued in compliance with the regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture governing the inspection of various products pursuant to the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, as amended (7 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1621 et seq.), . . . and is admissible as prima facie evidence in all courts of the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">We are of opinion that the certificates were admissible as business records under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78 (as amended through St. 1954, c. 442, \u00a7 1), which provides in material part: \u201cAn entry in an account kept in a book or by a card system or by any other system of keeping accounts, or a writing or record, whether in the form of an entry in a book or otherwise, made as a memorandum or record of any act, transaction, occurrence or event, shall not be inadmissible in any civil or criminal proceeding as evidence of the facts therein stated because it is transcribed or because it is hearsay or self-serving, if the court finds that the entry, writing or record was made in good faith in the regular course of business and before the beginning of the civil or criminal proceeding aforesaid and that it was the regular course of such business to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>make such memorandum or record at the time of such act, transaction, occurrence or event or within a reasonable time thereafter.\u201d Cf. Am. Law Inst., Model Code of Evidence, Rule 514 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">As nothing to the contrary appears, the admission of the certificates implies a finding of the facts prerequisite to their admission. <em>Bendett </em>v. <em>Bendett, </em>315 Mass. 59, 62. <em>Sellew </em>v. <em>Tuttle\u2019s Millinery Inc. </em>319 Mass. 368, 371. <em>Saba </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>333 Mass. 557, 558. The fact that these writings were in the form of certificates does not prevent their being admissible under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78. See <em>Chadwick &amp; Carr Co. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>293 Mass. 293, 295; <em>Wiley &amp; Foss, Inc. </em>v. <em>Saxony Theatres, Inc. </em>332 Mass. 172, 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">It is without the slightest consequence that the certificates were not made in the course of the <em>plaintiff\u2019s </em>business or that, as the defendant contends, the plaintiff does not always obtain such origin certificates and many of its perishable shipments are processed without them. The certificates were made by Federal inspectors in the regular course of the business of the Department of Agriculture. See 7 U. S. C. \u00a7 1622 (h) (1958). Copies were filed in its Washington headquarters. See 7 C. F. R. \u00a7 51.21 (1959). As stated in G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78, the word \u201cbusiness\u201d includes profession, occupation, and calling of every kind. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1732 (1964); Uniform Business Records as Evidence Act, \u00a7 1 (1936), 9A U. L. A. 504; Am. Law Inst., Model Code of Evidence, Rule 514 (3) (1942); Uniform Rules of Evidence, Rules 62, 63 (13) (1953), 9A U. L. A. 589, 633-634, 635-636; Wigmore on Evidence (3d ed.) \u00a7 1523.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The Federal statute relating to the admission in evidence of records made in the regular course of business, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1732 (1964), is very similar to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78. In <em>La Porte </em>v. <em>United States, </em>300 F. 2d 878 (9th Cir.), the defendant, a conscientious objector, had been charged in the District Court with failure to report, in lieu of military duty, to the Department of Charities of the city of Los Angeles, and a Selective Service form which indicated that he had failed so to report had been admitted in evidence at the trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>On appeal it was said at page 880: \u201cBy the terms of' 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1732, Form 153 was admissible to prove defendant\u2019s failure to report as a record of that occurrence made in the regular course of business. The operations of the instrumentalities of government constitute \u00bf business \u2019 within the meaning of the statute, and this is true of the operations of state and county agencies as well as those of the federal government agencies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The defendant argues that by the admission of the certificates it has been deprived of its right of cross-examina-tian and of any opportunity to impeach the testimony of the maker. Such an argument is of no avail. Section 78 does not require that a record be offered through the maker. \u201cUnder this statute it is plain that personal knowledge of the facts recorded on the part of the person testifying is not required.\u201d <em>Sellew </em>v. <em>Tuttle\u2019s Millinery Inc. </em>319 Mass. 368, 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">It is also completely irrelevant that the certificates may not be required by law but are obtainable at the option of the shipper. The certificates were not admitted as public records. So it is quite beside the point whether they may be described as required by law or made by a public officer in the performance of his duty. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dorr, </em>216 Mass. 314, 319; Leach and Liacos, Handbook of Massachusetts Evidence, 243-244; , McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7\u00a7 291, 292. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Slavski, </em>245 Mass. 405, 415-417.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">In their brief, the amici raise for the first time the objec-tian that the inspection certificates contain inadmissible expressions of opinion. We do not agree. The certificates were prepared after personal examination of the cantaloupes as packed in open crates. The descriptive notations are admissible, being similar in nature to a report of weather observations <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dorr, </em>216 Mass. 314, 319), or the evaluative report which accompanies X-ray photographs. <em>Whipple </em>v. <em>Grandchamp, </em>261 Mass. 40, 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">\n<em>Order of Appellate Division reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff on the findings of the Municipal Court.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b526-8\"> The Appellate Division opinion relied upon a definition in 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 451 (1964), as limiting \u201call courts of the United States\u201d to Federal courts. We need not discuss the point.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
