The single member had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>so ruled and the reviewing board had affirmed and adopted his findings and decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The employee\u2019s affliction was chronic bronchitis, emphysema and bronchiectasis. Some of the medical testimony tended to show that paint mist from his spray painting job aggravated the condition. There was contrary testimony. Because of his affliction the employee shifted to a different and lower paying job.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The insurer relies on the usual rule that the findings below are conclusive unless unsupported by the evidence or tainted by error of law. See <em>Look\u2019s Case, </em>345 Mass. 112, 114. The single member made his ruling of failure to sustain the burden of proof \u201con all the evidence.\u201d This by itself undoubtedly would imply that the member had rejected the testimony that permitted a finding of significant aggravation. But the single member began his findings with the statement, \u201cI find the credible evidence to be as follows.\u201d Although the intent is by no means clear, this statement could be taken to assert as credible all the evidence set out in the following recitals including that which if believed, taken with the consistent and supplementary testimony, would have furnished support, though slight, for a finding that the paint spray had aggravated the condition. <em>Clarici\u2019s Case, </em>340 Mass. 495, 498. There is further difficulty. There was direct testimony of two physicians that the paint spray could not have caused the plaintiff\u2019s illness. The ambiguous decision does not foreclose the possibility that the member wrongly deemed that the failure to show that the spray was the original cause of the affliction defeated the plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">We again call attention to the requirement that the findings on which the conclusion of the board depends be clearly and directly stated. <em>Mathewson\u2019s Case, </em>227 Mass. 470, 473. <em>Rozek\u2019s Case, </em>294 Mass. 205, 207. <em>Moore\u2019s Case, </em>330 Mass. 1, 5-6. <em>Herson\u2019s Case, </em>341 Mass. 402, 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">The final decree is reversed. A decree is to enter remanding the case to the board for further findings and the taking of additional evidence in its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
