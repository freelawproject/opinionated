The \u201centire front of the . . . [defendant\u2019s bakery] was clear, aluminum framed glass to the left and the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>of an outer vestibule in the center of the front of the store.\u201d The vestibule surrounded the front entrance which consisted of two clear glass doors. Opposite these doors was the front wall of the vestibule, \u201ca single sheet of clear clean glass.\u201d There were clear glass doors in the side walls of the vestibule which were the means of ingress from the outside. On the day of the accident, the plaintiff drove to the defendant\u2019s store, which he had never previously visited, intending to purchase a cake. \u201cHe got out of his car and walked between some cars parked close to the front of the center of the defendant\u2019s building. Directly in front of him, about twenty or thirty feet away, the plaintiff looked toward the bakery and saw the bakery counters and the inside of the bakery and a man coming through the double doors of the bakery which were directly in front of him. As he came between two parked cars he glanced down, stepped on the sidewalk, took one and one-half steps and walked into the outer plate glass window-wall of the vestibule. He did not know there was a pane of glass there, since to him there appeared to be nothing there. His knee struck the\u2019fglass, his right hand went up and the glass shattered . . ..\u201d The manager of the bakery \u201cstated that other people had approached the window thinking it was a door or that there was nothing there . . ..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The defendant admits that the plaintiff was a business invitee to whom it owed the duty of due care \u201cto keep the premises in reasonably safe condition for such visitors\u2019 use according to the\u2019! invitation extended . . ..\u201d <em>LeBlanc </em>v. <em>Atlantic Bldg. &amp; Supply Co., Inc. </em>323 Mass. 702, 705. The defendant argues, however, that the \u201cplaintiff\u2019s own conduct constituted negligence\u201d because the \u201cuse to which the plaintiff put the glass window-wall\u201d was not within the purposes to which the defendant \u201cintended [it] to be\"put.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The defendant\u2019s intention does not relieve it of the obligation to refrain from creating a situation which is a source of danger to its customers. The plaintiff was invited to use the vestibule and entrance to the defendant\u2019s premises. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>It is not a question of whether the plaintiff was invited to crash through a pane of glass, but whether a reasonable man might fail to see the glass outer wall or side doors of the vestibule and believe that his path to the front doors was unobstructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The defendant cites several cases in which this court has denied recovery to persons injured in collisions with glass doors. These cases are distinguishable on their facts. In <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Hartman, </em>313 Mass. 54, the door \u201ccould not have been wholly invisible. Its handles, lock and fittings were in plain sight. A door is to be expected at the entrance of a store\u201d (p. 55). In the case at bar, the plaintiff was confronted with a sheer pane of glass, and could reasonably have believed that there was nothing \u201cto be expected\u201d before he got to the doors which he could see. In <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>F. W. Woolworth Co. </em>338 Mass. 789, the plaintiff pushed on a door she knew to be one and shattered the glass. And in <em>Valunas </em>v. <em>J. J. Newberry Co. Inc. </em>336 Mass. 305, \u201cthe location and construction of the doors and panels were plain and obvious . . .\u201d (p. 306).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Whether the plaintiff's conduct was reasonable and foreseeable, and whether the defendant failed in its duty to him, were questions of fact for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
