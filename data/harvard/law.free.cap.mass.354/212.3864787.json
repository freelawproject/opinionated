O\u2019Neill were indicted for various offences. Douglas and O\u2019Neill were each charged with threats to extort. Alexander Celeste was charged with being an accessory before the fact to such threats. Frank Celeste and Alexander Celeste were each indicted for violation of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 110, making it a crime for an unlicensed person to conduct a small loan business (see fn. 3). All four defendants were charged with conspiracy to extort. Frank Celeste was found not guilty on the conspiracy indictment, but the other three defendants were found guilty. Each defendant was found guilty of the other offences, listed above, with which he was charged.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The cases are before us under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G, as amended. On somewhat conflicting evidence the facts set out below could have been found. The jury were not required to believe, or to regard as controlling, other evidence, which might tend to reflect adversely on the testimony and the behavior of the Commonwealth\u2019s principal witness, Melvin Sacks (as a partner in his insurance firm and as an employee of the Celestes from October, 1965, to August, 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">No defendant held a State license to make small loans. See G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 96, as amended through St. 1962, c. 795, \u00a7 1 (see later amendment by St. 1967, c. 190). In September, 1963, Alexander Celeste lent $500 to Sacks, an insur-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>anee broker. Interest was to be at the rate of $25 a week (equivalent to 260% per annum). Payments were to be 'made to one or the other of the Celestes. Some of about eight payments of $25 were made to Alexander Celeste. The other payments were made to Frank Celeste at Sacks\u2019s place of business. The payments were not applied to the principal of the loan. Early in November, 1963, Sacks paid Alexander the $500 principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">In November, 1964, Alexander Celeste again lent Sacks $500 on the same terms. Frank Celeste appeared about once a week to collect $25, and thirty-nine payments of $25 were made between November, 1964, and August, 1965 (a total of $975). During the period, O\u2019Neill began to accompany Frank Celeste when he made collections. No payments were made directly to Alexander Celeste. Sacks did not deduct on his 1965 Federal income tax return any interest payments on this loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">After these thirty-nine payments had been made, at a time when four or five $25 payments were due, Frank Celeste told Sacks to credit the amount to Frank\u2019s insurance account with the insurance firm in which Sacks was a partner with Malcolm Post. This credit involved about $175 for insurance premiums due. Sacks made no interest payments on the loan thereafter, at least until September, 1966. Sacks closed or sold his insurance agency and for a time after late August, 1965, was unemployed. In October, 1965 (when Sacks, in accordance with his 1964 arrangement with Alexander Celeste, owed the $500 principal plus four or five interest payments), Sacks was told by Alexander Celeste in Frank Celeste\u2019s presence, that he could start working for the , Celeste brothers at a used car lot (\u201cNew England Auto\u201d) in Dorchester. He said that they would \u201ctable\u201d the loan, pending a later arrangement for paying it. Sacks worked for eight to ten months for New England Auto, was clerk of the corporation, did bookkeeping for it, and was a stockholder in the concern. Sacks left New England Auto in . August, 1966, although he worked to some extent on their books for two months thereafter. There was testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>indicating disputes between the Celestes and Sacks concerning the latter\u2019s sales activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">On August 24, 1966, Douglas reported to Alexander Celeste by telephone in Sacks\u2019s presence that there had been a call from the district attorney\u2019s office concerning Sacks. Sacks, at Alexander Celeste\u2019s house, told Celeste that the call was about money Sacks had borrowed from another lender. Sacks\u2019s testimony was that Celeste then hit him in the face, and kicked him in the stomach. See, however, the verdict that Alexander Celeste was not guilty of assault and battery (fn. 1). On this occasion, Alexander told Sacks \u201cit was a cardinal sin to borrow money from another loan shark while owing one.\u201d Alexander also told Sacks that if he \u201cknew what was good for . . . [his] wife and kids,\u201d he had better not say anything to anyone from the district attorney\u2019s office. On an earlier visit Alexander had shown Sacks two sticks of dynamite, and on this occasion said that he would not \u201cthink twice about blowing up\u201d Sacks\u2019s house. Sacks also testified that he saw various victims \u201ctake a beating\u201d in back of the Celestes\u2019 garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Sacks in fact had borrowed from one Zine and owed money to one Carbone. The latter, when called as a witness in the absence of the jury, claimed his constitutional privilege not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">On August 25 or 26, 1966, Sacks was told by Douglas that he knew Sacks was leaving the employment of New England Auto, that Sacks \u201cstill owed some money, and that . . . [he would] have to make arrangements to pay it.\u201d Sacks had a similar talk with Frank Celeste and with Alexander Celeste. He also had a telephoned inquiry from Douglas who \u201casked . . . what . . . [Sacks] was doing about getting some money\u201d and said, \u201cYou better have it. . . . [Y]ou should pay it, if you don\u2019t want any trouble.\u201d On September 1, Douglas called again and demanded money by the next weekend. On September 8, 1966, Sacks spoke by telephone with O\u2019Neill and Douglas. O\u2019Neill said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to get hurt, you\u2019d better get some money . . . real fast.\u201d Douglas said, \u201c[Y]ou are almost at the end of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>the road.\u201d On September 14, O\u2019Neill told Sacks, \u201cYou\u2019d better have some money or you could be put in the hospital for four or five weeks.\u201d That day Sacks gave O\u2019Neill $300.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">On September 19, Sacks\u2019s father withdrew $1,000 from a savings bank and gave Sacks a check for $1,000. Sacks cashed this and paid the proceeds to Douglas. Douglas reported to Sacks that he paid these proceeds to Alexander Celeste. Two days later Douglas asked for the balance. When Sacks replied that he could not get $1,000 \u201cjust like that,\u201d Douglas said, \u201cWhen you feel that cold barrel [of a gun] to your head, you\u2019d be surprised how many ways you can think of of coming up with some money.\u201d He added, \u201c[Y]our kid must have a long walk . . . from school, and you wouldn\u2019t want anything to happen to her knee caps on the way home, would you?\u201d From early in September, Sacks received numerous telephone calls from Douglas substantially every day pressing for payment. Some of these calls were to Sacks\u2019s house, but many went to Sacks\u2019s new place of employment in Quincy.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">In September and early October, Sacks consulted an attorney, Mr. Jordan Ring, a neighbor. Mr. Ring then represented a client who had made an attachment on Sacks\u2019s house. Sacks wished to get this attachment removed so that he \u201ccould raise the money to pay A1 Celeste.\u201d It was brought out in part on cross-examination, and expanded in redirect examination, that Sacks told Mr. Ring the story of the threats. He informed Mr. Ring that he had told a detective from the district attorney\u2019s office nothing, because he did not \u201cwant any harm to come to . . . [his] family and\u201d himself. He informed Mr. Ring that he (Sacks) \u201cwould rather pay the money\u201d than go to the district attorney\u2019s office in view of the risks. Mr. Ring \u201cinsisted that . . . [Sacks] go to the District Attorney\u2019s office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">On October 11 or 12, 1966, Douglas went to Sacks\u2019s place of employment and renewed his demands. Sacks told Douglas he had no money for him. Douglas replied, \u201cI should bust you right in the face right now, but I am not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>going to. I\u2019m going to see what I can do for you but you\u2019d better have some money in the next day or so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Sacks called Mr. Ring. Two detectives from the district attorney\u2019s office visited him on October 11, 12, and 15. With Detective McLean listening on an extension telephone, Sacks \u201ccalled . . . Douglas back,\u201d apparently in response to a message left with Mrs. Sacks by Douglas. Douglas said, \u201cI can get you a few more days. ... I should have busted you this morning. You\u2019re a no-good . . ..\u201d He also told Sacks that he had \u201cbetter come up with the money.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Sacks gave the police permission to install a tape recorder on his telephone line. On October 17, there was recorded one of many telephone conversations between Sacks and Douglas during this period. In this conversation Douglas made demands for payment. Mr. Ring, Sacks\u2019s attorney, heard the conversation, which originated with a call by Sacks, with the aid of a speaker attached to the recorder on which one \u201ccan hear what is being taped.\u201d He verified the accuracy of the tape, which was received in evidence, after an extended voir dire. Douglas admitted that the recorded voice was his. The machine \u201cwas not telephone equipment.\u201d It was installed without the participation or consent of the telephone company, without any judicial authorization, and without Douglas\u2019s knowledge. The tape recorder gave off no \u201cbeeps\u201d which would inform a person on the line that it was operating. The first machine did not work and it was replaced prior to October 17. This, so the detective who installed it testified, was not a \u201cwire tap,\u201d be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>cause the machine was installed with the permission of Sacks, the telephone subscriber.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">On October 17, Sacks paid to Douglas five $10 marked bills. Sacks was then wearing an electronic device. No tape was procured, however, because the device did not function. On that day the Celeste brothers, O\u2019Neill, and Douglas were arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"AyX\">1. The Celeste brothers contend that G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 110, as amended through St. 1962, c. 795, \u00a7 2<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (see later amendment, St. 1967, c. 196, increasing the penalties), is void for vagueness and that the two indictments, charging them with violations of \u00a7 110, should have been dismissed because they failed to inform them with sufficient clarity of the offence charged. We perceive no such infirmity in the section or in the indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The Legislature may prohibit and make criminal the unlicensed granting of small loans. It may recognize \u201cthe danger that such a business . . :. [may] be conducted oppressively\u201d and the desir ability of furnishing a \u201cdegree of protection to [small] borrowers.\u201d <em>Dewey </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>206 Mass. 430, 432. <em>Goodowsky </em>v. <em>Rubenstein, </em>225 Mass. 448, 450-451 (\u201cThe statute [as it stood prior to St. 1913, c. 347, \u00a7 2] does not prohibit all such loans except by licensed persons,\u201d but \u201cforbids the making of such loans as a business unless one is licensed. The making of a single loan might be sufficient . . . [in] appropriate circumstances to warrant a finding that the one making the loan was carrying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>on the business. But it does not require such a finding\u201d). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silverman, </em>220 Mass. 552, 554-555. The section, taken with other sections to which it refers, is adequate \u201cto convey to a person of ordinary understanding . . . \u00a1X] description of the prohibited act.\u201d See <em>Jaquith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>331 Mass. 439, 442. All rational presumptions are to be made in favor of its validity. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Finnigan, </em>326 Mass. 378, 379. There is in \u00a7 110 no such vagueness as was considered in <em>Alegata </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>353 Mass. 287, 296-297, 299-301, but see pp. 303-304. The final sentence of \u00a7 110 (see fn. 3, at point [(A3) in specific terms defines what is sufficient to create a prima facie case of violation by apt reference to at least one set of facts having a rational tendency to show the conduct of a business. Provisions of this type are valid. See <em>Meunier\u2019s Case, </em>319 Mass. 421, 425-426. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>6 Gray, 1, 4-8; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spindel, </em>351 Mass. 673, 676-678. Proof of two small loans within a reasonable period of time, at a rate of more than twelve per cent per annum, supports the conclusion that the lender was in the business of making such loans. Loans made to friends, or as a matter of charity, are not often effected upon such terms or in such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">2. The defendants argue various exceptions concerning the evidence received of telephone conversations between Sacks and Douglas. Detective McLean, on an extension fine in Sacks\u2019s house, listened to one or more such conversations. Mr. Ring (with the aid of a speaker attached to a tape recorder) listened to another. This latter talk, with Sacks\u2019s permission, was recorded on a tape. There was no violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 (as amended by St. 1959, c. 449, \u00a7 l),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which creates the crime of eavesdropping. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Section 99 is supplemented by \u00a7 101. Each conversation was overheard with the consent of Sacks, \u201ca sender or receiver\u201d within \u00a7 99 (fn. 4). Section 101 (as amended by St. 1956, c. 48, \u00a7 4),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> merely makes certain conduct prima facie evidence of violation of \u00a7 99, but there is no violation where a sender or receiver has given consent to that conduct. The case thus is unlike <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spindel, </em>351 Mass. 673, 675, where \u201c[t]here was no evidence that . . . [any person participating in the conversation] consented to . . . monitoring.\u201d We need not consider whether the tape recorder was a \u201cdevice\u201d which Sacks, as owner of his house and \u201con premises under his exclusive control\u201d (see \u00a7 101, fn. 5), could install and use in any event. See the <em>Spindel </em>case, 351 Mass. 673, 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">In <em>Rathbun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>355 U. S. 107, 109-111, there was found no interception of the type then and now forbidden by 47 U. S. C. \u00a7 605 (1964). The court approved the admission in evidence of conversations overheard by police on a regularly used extension telephone with the consent of the telephone subscriber, a party to the conversation. A defendant who speaks incriminating words over the telephone runs the risk that the person with whom he talks may be an informer (see <em>Hoffa </em>v. <em>United States, </em>385 U. S. 293, 302-303) or that the conversation (as in the <em>Rathbun </em>case) may be overheard on an extension telephone. In the interests of sound law enforcement, in these days when telephone talks often supplant face to face encounters, he also should be held to take the risk that his words may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>recorded by his listener. See <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>373 U. S. 427, 437-440 (tape admissible of a personal interview during which a bribe was attempted). In the present case there was, of course, no such prior judicial authorization of the use of a recording device as in fact took place in <em>Osborn </em>v. <em>United States, </em>385 U. S. 323, 327-331. There was no occasion in the <em>Osborn </em>case for the Supreme Court of the United States to consider again the broad issue presented and decided in favor of admissibility in the <em>Lopez </em>decision, 373 U. S. 427, 437-440. There was no reason for such prior \u2022approval. The present case was not one of surreptitious placing of a recording device in another\u2019s office (see <em>Berger </em>v. <em>New York, </em>388 U. S. 41, 44-45), or in a position enabling third persons to overhear, without the consent of any party to the telephone conversation, a private call made from a public telephone booth. See <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U. S. 347, 354-359.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">In the case at bar, there was at most a recording of telephoned threats, themselves constituting the commission of a crime, made to the victim of the crime and of continued unlawful harassment. The victim, himself a participant in the conversation, consented to the recording. He was sitting in his own house, at his own telephone, with his own attorney listening to the conversation. If it be relevant (see <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>385 U. S. 206, 210-212), Sacks was not an informer committing a breach of confidence, and could be found to have been a victim of extortion. See <em>Dryden </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 F. 2d 214 (5th Cir. \u2014 recorder on extension telephone). Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>White, </em>36 U. S. L. Week 2613 (7th Cir. \u2014 electronic device on informer),<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> a case which seems inconsistent with the Supreme Court decisions already cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">No illegal search or other violation of any constitutional or statutory provision made the recording inadmissible. See <em>Glacy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>361 F. 2d 31, 35-36 (1st Cir.), cert. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>den. 385 U. S. 831; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States, </em>367 F. 2d 633, 635 (1st. Cir.), cert. den. 386 U. S. 915. Any other conclusion, we think, would give members of the underworld carte blanche to intimidate (or otherwise to engage in criminal conduct injurious to) innocent members of the public over the telephone, without risk that their words could be overheard or recorded (even with the consent of the victims) in a manner which would be used against the offenders in a court. See <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>344 U. S. 199, 203; <em>Pugach </em>v. <em>Dollinger, </em>277 F. 2d 739 (2d Cir.) affd. 365 U. S. 458; <em>United States ex rel Griffin </em>v. <em>Hendrick, </em>360 F. 2d 614 (3d Cir.). Cf. <em>Nardone </em>v. <em>United States, </em>302 U. S. 379, 382-385; 308 U. S. 338, 340-341; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dote, </em>371 F. 2d 176, 180-181 (7th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">3. There is no merit in the defendants\u2019 contention that the judge improperly received evidence of (a) a September, 1963, conversation<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> between Sacks and Alexander Celeste occurring prior to the period (October 15,1963 to October 18, 1965) mentioned in the indictment as explained by particulars, and (b) a loan transaction which took place in part before that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">As to Alexander Celeste, the conversation in September, 1963, related to a loan transaction the execution of which, by the collection and payments of interest and principal, continued well into the period covered by the indictment, and shed light on Celeste\u2019s activities during the period, including payments on the 1963 loan and the making and collection of the later loan. The) evidence was relevant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stasiun, </em>349)Mass. 38, 46-47. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Runge, </em>231 Mass. 598, 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The somewhat ambiguous evidence of Edwin Small concerning a 1966 loan to him by Alexander Celeste, at most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>tended to explain other activities of Alexander Celeste within the indictment period, if, indeed, the evidence was sufficiently definite or comprehensible to have any probative effect whatsoever. There was ample indication that Small was a hostile witness. It was not error to permit the prosecution (which had called him) to ask him leading questions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Monahan, 349 Mass. 139, 162-163. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soroko, </em>353 Mass. 254, 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">4. Similarly without merit is the contention that Sacks was not competent to testify concerning what was done (in crediting payments to principal or interest) with the payments made on the 1963 loan. Sacks, as the debtor under that arrangement, could reasonably conclude (where weekly payments remained constant at $25 a week, and were followed by a single payment of the $500 amount of the original loan) that the earlier payments had been applied as interest. Sacks\u2019s conclusions were consistent with the terms of the agreement imposed on him by Alexander Celeste.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">5. The judge did not abuse bis discretion when he refused to permit Sacks to be cross-examined concerning a conversation with Orlando J. Carbone, a witness later called by Douglas. The conversation had taken place in January, 1967, during the trial of these cases. The judge, as the evidence then stood, reasonably regarded this inquiry as irrelevant to the issues raised in the indictments. At a bench conference, the judge excluded the line of questions until such time as some other evidence showed the inquiry to be relevant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The assistant district attorney stated that he would produce Sacks for further cross-examination on a day\u2019s notice, if evidence later showed the inquiry to be relevant, and not merely to relate to a collateral matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">When Carbone later took the stand, it was represented to the judge that the witness would claim his privilege not to testify because of the possibility of self-incrimination. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>The judge conducted a voir dire, in the absence of the jury, and, except in answering questions concerning his name, address, and employment, Carbone claimed his privilege. Douglas\u2019s counsel then said, \u201cI submit that there would be no further purpose in inquiring of the witness.\u201d An exception claimed prior to the voir dire (to the judge\u2019s statement that he would not let the witness identify himself and claim his privilege in the presence of the jury until he heard the voir dire) was not renewed by the defendants after the voir dire. It was within the judge\u2019s discretion to hold a voir dire to ascertain whether inquiry in the presence of the jury would be prejudicial to the defendants or productive of relevant testimony. No objection or exception to what the judge did intelligibly raised the issue (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>348 Mass. 60, 63; cf. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, ante, </em>81, 83-84) whether the witness was being afforded too broad a protection based upon his privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">6. Sacks\u2019s testimony on redirect examination about what he told his attorney, Mr. Ring, was with respect to a matter opened up on cross-examination by inquiry about (a) what Sacks had told the attorney, and (b) what he had or had not told to the district attorney and to certain police officers when he had opportunity to talk to them. There may have been some indication that the defendants were claiming Sacks\u2019s story to be recently contrived. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>350 Mass. 48, 51-52. In any event, this testimony on redirect examination was reasonably permitted by the trial judge, as matter of discretion, in explanation of Sacks\u2019s testimony on cross-examination about (a) bis failure to make more prompt reports concerning the threats to the district attorney and to the police, and (b) his conversation with Mr. Ring. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>310 Mass. 733, 747. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Binkiewicz, </em>342 Mass. 740, 758; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>350 Mass. 664, 668-669.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">It is irrelevant that this testimony incidentally tended to show that the defendants may have committed other offences,, e.g. by intimidating other persons. The testimony was pertinent in that it tended to explain fears which led to Sacks\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>failure to report to the authorities the threats made to him and his delay in letting Mr. Ring do so. All this became of significance because of matters brought out on cross-examination. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feci, </em>235 Mass. 562, 567; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gettigan, </em>252 Mass. 450, 459-460. Similar principles apply to cross-examination (permitted within the judge\u2019s discretion) of a witness (Post) concerning an assault upon him by O\u2019Neill, in an effort to test Post\u2019s credibility by showing that he feared O\u2019Neill. This was not a case where the prosecution sought to introduce, through a witness called by it, evidence of other crimes to prove commission of the particular crimes charged. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>321 Mass. 471, 473; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welcome, </em>348 Mass. 68, 70-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">7. The defendants contend that testimony by Sacks concerning certain telephone conversations was admitted without prior proof that Sacks was able to identify the voice of the speaker. Objections were made and exceptions saved but without pointing out to the trial judge that the identification of the voice was the ground of any exception. There was no specific objection (see <em>Irving </em>v. <em>Goodimate Co. </em>320 Mass. 454, 460) based on the issues discussed in <em>Bond Pharmacy, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>338 Mass. 488, 490-491, and <em>Chartrand </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, </em>345 Mass. 321, 325. Sacks testified that he had received a call from Douglas. This reasonably implied that he recognized the latter\u2019s voice.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The conversations were relevant. There was also sufficient proof of cooperation by all the defendants in pressure on Sacks concerning the collection of the loans to him to warrant the judge\u2019s preliminary conclusion that there was a prima facie case of conspiracy permitting evidence of the acts and declarations of one conspirator in pursuance of the common object to be admitted against the others. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stasiun, </em>349 Mass. 38, 50-51, and the cases there reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">8. There was ample evidence from which it could be found that the Celestes made, or acted with respect to, two loans in violation of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 110, which were either made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>or paid within the period mentioned in the indictments and particulars. The evidence, as a whole, showed that the second loan to Sacks in November, 1964, was not a friendly or charitable act, but entered into for profit. Taken with the earlier loan, on the same terms, which was not paid until November, 1963, and with the testimony of widespread harassment and coercion to effect collection of the second loan, the evidence warranted the jury in concluding that (as to Sacks, at least) the Celestes were in the business of making such loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">There was direct evidence of Douglas\u2019s and O\u2019Neill\u2019s threats made to Sacks to enforce payment of the unconscionable and illegal 1964 loan. It could be reasonably inferred that the threats were made at the behest of Alexander Celeste, by his employees and in his interest. The evidence already summarized permitted the jury to conclude that, in exerting the pressures upon Sacks, all the defendants were acting in concert as conspirators to extort.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">There was no error in refusing to direct verdicts for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">9. Other assignments of error already have been covered adequately or do not merit discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b258-10\"> The Commonwealth nol pressed certain other indictments tried with these cases. Alexander Celeste was found not guilty on two indictments charging threats to extort, and on an indictment for assault and battery. The transcript states that O\u2019Neill, on the day he was sentenced in these cases, pleaded guilty to certain other indictments on which he also was sentenced. The record does not show these indictments to be related to the present cases'.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b262-7\"> On October 12, Sacks had a conversation with Douglas about how much he then owed. He quoted Douglas as saying that \u201che had discussed with A1 and Frankie [Celeste! and that they had figured [it! out to be $2,400, but that they would give me a break and make it $2,000.\u201d At least the amount of the payments in excess of the $500 originally borrowed by Sacks from Alexander Celeste appears to have been interest, referred to by various witnesses as \u201cvig\u201d or \u201cjuice.\u201d In the recorded telephone talk of October 17 mentioned in the text, Douglas demanded that. Sacks \u201ccome up with the vig\u201d and that he \u201cstart paying juice.\u201d Explanation by Sacks and others of the meaning of these slang expressions was admissible, if judicial notice could not be taken of the meaning.
