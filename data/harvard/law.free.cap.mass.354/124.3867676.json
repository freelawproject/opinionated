L. c. 152, \u00a7 31. A member of the Industrial Accident Board found that the employee sustained an injury \u201carising out of and in the course of his employment\u201d which led .to his death and ordered payment of benefits. The reviewing board affirmed and adopted the findings and decision of the single member. On the insurer\u2019s appeal to the Superior Court, the judge entered a decree dismissing the claim on the ground that \u201cthe evidence does not warrant a finding,that the employee\u2019s injury and death arose out of and in the course of his. employment.\u201d The case is before us on the claimant\u2019s appeal from the decree of the Superior Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">The findings of the reviewing board are final unless they are wholly lacking in evidential support or tainted by error of law. <em>Hachadourian\u2019s Case, </em>340 Mass. 81, 85. <em>Buck\u2019s Case </em>342 Mass. 766, 768. We summarize the evidence. Korsun was sixty-four years old and had been employed by the assured for forty years. In 1957, he had suffered from a condition known as coronary thrombosis. He was .employed as an elevator operator and rope cutter. On January <em>2, </em>1963, following a twelve day vacation, he returned to work. At the end of the work day he went home where he told his son, and later his wife, that upon his arrival at work he opened his desk drawer, found an empty whiskey bottle, went into an adjoining office where two fellow employees were, slammed the bottle on a desk and said, \u201cWhat are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>you fellows trying to do to me? Don\u2019t you know that I\u2019m scheduled to retire soon? If Mr. Frazier found this bottle I would get fired\u201d; that he was so upset he could not run the elevator; that all he did was cut rope; that he was never so upset in his life. His face was blue, his lips were dark blue. He ate very little dinner that evening. Examination of his lunch pail showed that he did not eat his lunch. During the evening of January 2 Korsun continued to be upset. He complained of pains in his chest. Repeatedly, when his wife or son offered him one of the pills which were kept for that condition, he declined and asked for and drank a \u201cshot\u201d of whiskey instead. He went to bed about 9:30 p.m. About midnight his condition appeared worse. He was removed by ambulance to a hospital where he died on January 4, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">The claimant\u2019s reliance upon the \u201chorseplay clause\u201d of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26 (as amended by St. 1937, c. 370, \u00a7 1), is misplaced.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There was no finding, no evidence and no basis for an inference as to how the whiskey bottle came to be in Korsun\u2019s desk. The question is, therefore, whether the death of an employee resulting from emotional stress induced by the sight of an empty whiskey bottle in his desk drawer when the employee was apprehensive of losing his job can be said to arise out of and in the course of his employment. (G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26.) It must be shown that the injury arose from some risk with which the employment brought him in contact or from the nature, conditions, obligations or incidents of the job. <em>Bedore\u2019s Case, </em>339 Mass. 639, 642, and cases cited. <em>Egan\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 11, 15, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Certain cases involving injury to the circulatory system or the nervous system of an employee because of physical exertion or strain or because of emotional stress or strain, or because of a combination of both in circumstances which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>were held to arise out of his employment and therefore compensable, are relevant to the issue before us and are briefly mentioned:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Paralysis, caused solely by fright and terror when a bolt of lightning struck the roof of the plant, followed along sprinkler pipes, and blew out, with flash of light and noise, motors near the employee. <em>Charon\u2019s Case, </em>321 Mass. 694. Death or incapacity resulting from the aggravation of a preexisting heart disease because of physical exertion or strain at work. <em>Madden\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 487. <em>Griffin\u2019s Case, </em>315 Mass. 71. <em>O\u2019Flaherty\u2019s Case, </em>325 Mass. 303. <em>Lysaght\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 451. See <em>Messersmith\u2019s Case, </em>340 Mass. 117, 123-124. A \u201cbrain difficulty\u201d suffered by and producing loss of speech in a cab driver who, responding to the order of a police officer to get help in the arrest of three men held at bay with a gun, became scared, nervous and excited when one of the men made a threatening gesture. <em>Egan\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 11. Death of a state inspector of motor vehicles from a heart attack which followed naturally from an earlier heart attack when the inspector pursued and had an altercation with a motorist and immediately showed the first signs of heart disease. <em>Stanton\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 378. Incapacity brought about by extremely heavy work load with accompanying physical and mental stress imposed upon the employee, a sales representative, by his employer. <em>Brown\u2019s Case, </em>334 Mass. 343. Death of a state motor vehicle accident investigator caused by the aggravation of a preexisting heart disease, the aggravation being due to emotional distress, worry and overwork in connection with the urgent and difficult investigation of a widely publicized episode involving a finding of suicide or accident. <em>McMurray\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">In all of the above mentioned cases, the emotional stress or strain which caused or aggravated the condition which resulted in incapacity or death, arose in connection with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>work of the employee. In <em>McMurray\u2019s Case, </em>it was said, \u201cIt is true that usually the emotional stress or strain .appears to have been accompanied by some physical exertion, in connection with the work of the employee, but we perceive no difference between a stress or strain brought about by physical exertion and that occasioned by distress, worry, fear, or anxiety [in connection with the work of the employee].\u201d The court also said that \u201cthis case goes to the verge.\u201d 331 Mass, at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">We think the case before us goes beyond the verge. In contemplation of the cases mentioned we hold as matter of law on the evidence before the board that Korsun\u2019s emotional stress, although it may have resulted in his death, was not a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d which is compensable under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Apprehension over the prospect of' losing one\u2019s job does not arise \u201cout of the nature, conditions, obligations or incidents of the employment.\u201d See <em>Caswell\u2019s Case, </em>305 Mass. 500, 502. Rather it is a state of mind which arises from the common necessity of working for a living. Social legislation designed to relieve the consequences of losing one\u2019s job is found elsewhere. G. L. c. 151A. <em>Gallant\u2019s Case, </em>326 Mass. 507, <em>S. C. </em>329 Mass. 607. <em>Roderick\u2019s Case, </em>342 Mass. 330, 333-334. See <em>Garrigan\u2019s Case, </em>341 Mass. 413, 415, fn. 1. The added emotional stress, allegedly induced by the sight of an empty whiskey bottle in his desk drawer, where its presence was wholly unexplained, was, on the evidence, a personal idiosyncrasy and was not connected with his work.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The decree dismissing the claim was right and is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">\n<em>So ordered. .</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b169-10\"> In view of the disposition which we make of the case on the merits, we need not consider either the contention of the insurer that the report of the single member, adopted by the board, did not meet the requirements of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 8, or the insurer\u2019s exceptions, properly preserved, to the rulings made by the single member at the hearing. We likewise do not discuss the finding of causal relation which the single member reached by \u201cadopting the opinions\u201d of two doctors whose testimony on salient points appears to be irreconcilable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b170-6\"> \u201c[I]f an employee while acting in the course of his employment . . .is injured by reason of the physical activities of fellow employees in which he does not participate, whether or not such activities are associated with the employment, such injury shall be conclusively presumed to have arisen out of the employment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b171-6\"> Excluded from consideration because of irrelevancy to the issue are cases where the employment brought the employee in contact with a risk which in fact produced the injury.
