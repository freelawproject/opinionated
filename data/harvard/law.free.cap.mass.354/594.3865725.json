The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the self-insurer, appealed from a final decree of the Superior Court upholding the decision of the reviewing board.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The employee in his claim stated that he sustained his injury on May 18, 1962, and that it consisted of emotional disturbance caused by association with the criminally insane. He had commenced work as a correction officer at the correctional institution at Bridgewater on December 1, 1958. During his employment there he witnessed incidents involving inmates which upset him emotionally. He recounted unpleasant and repelling experiences occurring during his work \u25a0while guarding criminally insane individuals and those who had committed sex violations. Several weeks before he terminated his employment at the institution he saw his doctor for a variety of ailments which he ascribed to his work and tranquilizers were prescribed for him. He had taken to drinking heavily and was truculent and abusive toward his family at home. Ten days after leaving his work at Bridgewater he first saw a psychiatrist who took a history from him and diagnosed his condition as an \u201cacute anxiety state.\u201d The employee testified that he had experienced no emotional problems prior to going to Bridgewater and the psychiatrist who treated him gave evidence that the etiology of his illness commenced during his service at that institution. The psychiatrist described the employee as a highly sensitive individual who never should have sought employment in such a position, and said that his personality was not such as to justify his daily labor in a situation where acts of violence were not uncommon. The employee had described to him symptoms of palpitation, stomach trouble, and nausea, but the psychiatrist stated that the employee was not in his opinion suffering from a \u201ctraumatic neurosis\u201d which he defined as trauma connected \u201cwith some type of impact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">On the second day of hearing, which took place eleven months after the first day, counsel for the Commonwealth sought upon cross-examination of the psychiatrist to examine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>the records and notes to which the doctor had referred while giving testimony on direct examination. After some colloquy with the single member and counsel, and a reiterated request from counsel for the Commonwealth, the doctor answered, \u201cI refuse, sir.\u201d Thereupon the single member stated that he would leave the question of whether the notes would be made available to \u201cthe doctor\u2019s discretion in view of the fact that in this type of case we are dealing with very personalized notes . . ..\u201d The Commonwealth excepted to this ruling and presses that exception here. The Commonwealth also complains about the refusal of the single member on the second day of hearing to allow counsel to review the history given to the psychiatrist by the employee. In view of our disposition of this matter we shall not pass upon this last complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">1. The Commonwealth\u2019s principal argument is directed to that portion of the decision upholding the employee\u2019s claim that he sustained a personal injury arising out of and in the course of his employment. The Commonwealth argues that while the psychiatrist testified that the employee\u2019s work at the correctional institution was the causative factor of his illness which was severe and prolonged, in fact that employment was a condition rather than a cause, and that the doctor had treated many guards \u201cbut not for this sort of thing.\u201d The Commonwealth further claims that the doctor\u2019s opinion was speculative in that it was based in large measure on the employee\u2019s contact with the more violently insane persons held in custody in a certain unit while the employment records of the employee indicate he had worked in that unit but one day in the latest five month period. However, we do not pass upon these contentions but move to a consideration of whether, assuming the existence of a causal relationship between the employment and the illness, the illness constituted a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d under the act. The Commonwealth has invited our attention to <em>Maggelet\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. 57, which denied compensation for an \u201coccupational neurosis.\u201d The court said at pages 61-62, \u201cThe act affords no relief against general disease. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>It is not a scheme for health insurance. It deals only with personal injuries following as an immediate result from the employment as its direct cause. ... A disease of mind or body which arises in the course of employment, with nothing more, is not within the act.\u201d The foregoing definition has been followed in a series of eases. In <em>Smith\u2019s Case, </em>307 Mass. 516, for instance, an employee contracted tuberculosis while employed in a hospital for contagious diseases with tubercular patients. In a full discussion of the problem presented by the case and similar to that presented here, Mr. Justice Lummus pointed out that \u201cdisease unaccompanied by personal injury is not compensable under the workmen\u2019s compensation act.\u201d P. 518. But see G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (7A); <em>Perron\u2019s Case, </em>325 Mass. 6. See also <em>Pimental\u2019s Case, </em>235 Mass. 598, 602; <em>Reardon\u2019s Case, </em>275 Mass. 24, 27; <em>Mercier\u2019s Case, </em>315 Mass. 238, 240. We are not disposed to vary the doctrine of those cases which have followed the principles elucidated in <em>Maggelet\u2019s Case. </em>Any change in those principles should come through legislative, not judicial, intervention. We thus conclude that the illness suffered by the employee was not a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d within the meaning of the act. See <em>Korsun\u2019s Case, ante, </em>124, 126-127. Cf. <em>Charon\u2019s Case, </em>321 Mass. 694; <em>Egan\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">2. While what has already been stated is dispositive of this claim, we wish also to comment upon the ruling which denied to counsel for the Commonwealth his right on cross-examination to examine the records and notes of the medical witness to which that witness had referred and upon which the witness relied in direct examination. This was a ruling which was highly prejudicial, which might have affected substantial rights of the Commonwealth, and which would have been sufficient in itself to warrant reversal. The error was compounded by the ruling that the single member would leave it to \u201cthe discretion\u201d of the witness whether or not he would surrender his notes for inspection by counsel engaged in cross-examination. What is involved here is so elementary that no further discussion is required. <em>Capodilupo </em>v. <em>F. W.
