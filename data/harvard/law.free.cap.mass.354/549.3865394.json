The case was tried subject to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G, and is here by appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">We summarize pertinent portions of the evidence. The defendant was questioned by the Springfield police as one of several persons who had been at a party attended by the victim on the evening of the murder. At that time, the defendant denied any knowledge of the crime. Subsequently, the police discovered an inconsistency between the defendant\u2019s report and that of another person interviewed. The police left a telephone message at the place where the defendant was staying asking him to come to the police station on Monday morning, July 11, 1966. In response to this request, the defendant voluntarily came to the station. He arrived about ten or ten thirty in the morning and was interviewed by three police officers. One of these, Lieutenant Shea, testified on voir dire that, after reviewing the events of the party, he asked the defendant whether, after the victim\u2019s departure, he had borrowed a friend\u2019s automobile keys and left the party alone. The defendant denied this. Lieutenant Shea \u201ctold him we \u2018have information that you did.\u2019 \u201d At \u201cabout the same time\u201d Shea noticed \u201cwhat appeared . . . to be . . . fingernail scratches on his neck,\u201d and asked the defendant about them. The defendant said they were scratches inflicted on the night of the party by a former girl friend. Shea said, \u201cHave you got any more on you? Take off your shirt.\u201d The defendant did so, and the officers observed three more scratches on his back. At this point, Lieutenant Shea \u201cstopped the interrogation and in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>formed him of the fact that he was a suspect,\u201d and \u201cinformed him of his constitutional rights.\u201d At the voir dire, Shea testified as follows: \u201cI told him that he was entitled to be represented at all times by counsel. I told him that he could remain silent, and if he said anything it could be used against him, and I asked him if he would voluntarily take a lie detector test that day.\u201d Later in the voir dire, Shea testified that on the defendant\u2019s return from the he detector test in the evening, \u201cI informed him <em>again </em>of his right to an attorney, the fact that if he couldn\u2019t afford one, that he would be furnished with one . . .\u201d (emphasis supplied). At the trial before the jury, Shea testified that in the morning \u201cI told him that he was entitled to the services of an attorney. . . . [T3hat he had the right to a telephone, and an attorney would be furnished to him at the expense of the Commonwealth if he was not able to afford one. ... I told him he had a right to remain silent and that anything he did say would be used against him if he chose to say anything to us.\u201d Either before or after these warnings were given, photographs were taken of the scratches on the defendant\u2019s neck and back. No further interrogation then took place. The defendant was taken to Boston, given a polygraph test, and then was returned to the Springfield police station about nine thirty or ten o\u2019clock in the evening. On his return, the defendant was given further warnings. Lieutenant Shea described these on the voir dire as follows: \u201cAt this time I informed him again of his right to an attorney, the fact that if he couldn\u2019t afford one, that he would be furnished with one; his right to remain silent; and the fact that anything he said would be used against him. I also informed him of his right to the use of the telephone. I told him that he could use the phone to call friends, relatives or even engage an attorney if he so desired. He declined the use of the telephone.\u201d On cross-examination on the voir dire, Shea gave this version of the evening warning: \u201cI said that, 'Ronald, you have a right to an attorney, an attorney can be present here now. You don\u2019t have to talk to us. If you do talk to us, anything you say will be used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>against you,\u2019 and I said, \u2018there is a telephone, if you want to call anyone, call a lawyer, call any friend or for any reason, this is the telephone, go ahead and use it.\u2019 He declined. He said, \u2018No, I don\u2019t want to use the phone.\u2019 \u201d Before the jury, Shea testified that after this conversation he asked the defendant, \u201c[D[]o you want to talk further with us about this case?\u201d and the defendant replied, \u201cI will.\u201d At the voir dire Lieutenant Shea testified that he told the defendant he had failed the polygraph test and that in his absence the police had interviewed his former girl friend and had determined that she could not have scratched him. The defendant said, \u201cI know it\u2019s very bad for me. . . . [I]t looks very bad for me.\u201d The interrogation continued until about eleven o\u2019clock, at which time the defendant confessed. About four o\u2019clock of the following morning, the confession was reduced to writing and the defendant signed it. The defendant also made a sketch of the scene of the crime. The photographs, the oral and written confessions, and the sketch were admitted in evidence over the defendant\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"anu-dedup-0\">The defendant\u2019s principal assignments of error concern the denial of his motion to suppress this evidence on the ground that the police did not conform with the requirements set forth in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436. At the conclusion of the voir dire on the motion to suppress, the judge made the following findings: \u201c[Aj]t the time when the suspicion of crime was focused upon the defendant, he was advised by the police that he had a right to remain silent, need not answer questions. He had a right to counsel and the services of counsel. And, Lieutenant Shea told him that if he couldn\u2019t afford one, that he would be furnished one. Anything he might say would be used against him and he could use the telephone to call friends, relatives or engage ah attorney if desired. . . . [T]he oral statements made and the written statements . . . were voluntarily made by the defendant without threats or duress or promises, or inducements or hope, or favor of reward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The defendant contends that the record of the voir dire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>testimony does not support the judge\u2019s finding that the defendant was informed in the morning of his right to have counsel provided at the Commonwealth\u2019s expense. While Lieutenant Shea omitted this item in his original recitation of the warnings given in the morning, when he described the warnings given in the evening he said that he \u201cagain\u201d advised the defendant of his right to counsel and of \u201cthe fact that if he couldn't afford one, that he would be furnished with one.\u201d From this testimony, the judge was warranted in determining that this portion of the warning was given in the morning. The correctness of this determination is borne out by Lieutenant Shea's testimony before the jury, recited above. We are of opinion that the warnings which the judge found were given to the defendant in the morning were in this respect in conformity with the rules set out in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The defendant also contends that the morning warnings were not given before the commencement of the defendant\u2019s in custody interrogation, and that as a consequence the confessions obtained many hours later were tainted with an initial illegality. In <em>Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>378 U. S. 478, 492, the Supreme Court of the United States held that the right to counsel attaches \u201cwhen the process shifts from investigatory to accusatory \u2014 when its focus is on the accused and its purpose is to elicit a confession.\u201d In <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>477, it was said that an individual must be warned of his rights \u201cwhen the individual is first subjected to police interrogation while in custody at the station or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d The defendant contends that the <em>Miranda </em>case modifies the \u201cfocus\u201d rule of <em>Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra, </em>by advancing the time when the right to counsel attaches (and warnings must be given) ahead of the point when the investigation becomes accusatory to the time when \u201ccustody\u201d begins. As applied to the case at bar, there is no conflict between these two standards. Lieutenant Shea\u2019s interrogation of the defendant became an in custody interrogation at the point when Shea observed the scratches and the investigation \u201cfocused\u201d on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At this point the warnings were given. Until this time, there is nothing to suggest that the defendant, who voluntarily came to the station at the telephoned request of the police, was \u201cin custody at the station or otherwise deprived of his freedom ... in any significant way.\u201d We believe the warnings given to the defendant in the morning were timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The defendant further argues that he was not apprised of his right to have an attorney present at the interrogation. In <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>it was held that \u201c[A]n individual held for interrogation must be clearly informed that he has the right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation.\u201d 384 U. S. at 471. Lieutenant Shea testified on the voir dire that he warned the defendant in the morning that \u201che was entitled to be represented at all times by counsel.\u201d Lieutenant Shea testified that on the defendant\u2019s return from Boston, he told him, \u201cPG\u00b0u have a right to an attorney, an attorney can be present here now.\u201d The ability to understand verbal communication, of course, varies among individuals. We are convinced on this record, however, that the defendant\u2019s right to the presence of an attorney was understandably communicated to him. We have said that the \u201cprinciples announced in the <em>Miranda </em>case must be applied reasonably and with common sense and do not constitute an arid, ritualistic formula to be administered inflexibly.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilbur, </em>353 Mass. 376, 383. We believe that the reasonable import of the warnings given the defendant were sufficient to apprise him of his right to have an attorney present.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The defendant contends that there was no evidence that, even if adequate warnings were given, the defendant know<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>ingly waived his right to have counsel present at the interrogation. It was said in the <em>Miranda </em>case at 475 that a \u201cvalid waiver will not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused after warnings are given or simply from the fact that a confession was in fact eventually obtained.\u201d In the instant case, there is more evidence of waiver than the simple silence of the defendant or the mere fact that he confessed. In the morning, after the warnings were given and the defendant declined the offered use of the telephone, the defendant was asked if he would go to Boston and undergo a polygraph test. Lieutenant Shea testified that he said, \u201cNow, before you can take this test, you\u2019ve got to sign a waiver of your rights in which you have been informed of all your rights, and that you voluntarily took this test.\u201d The defendant replied, \u201cI will,\u201d and then went to Boston and signed such a waiver. On his return, after again being warned, the defendant was offered the use of the telephone to call friends or an attorney. The defendant said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to use the phone.\u201d Immediately thereafter, he was asked, \u2018' [D]o you want to talk further with us about this case?\u201d He replied, \u201cI will.\u201d Within an hour the defendant confessed. The record discloses affirmative actions on the defendant\u2019s part in declining the offer of a telephone to obtain counsel,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in agreeing to go to Boston and to sign a waiver in regard to the polygraph test, and in expressing his willingness to continue the interrogation after the evening warnings. The facts reveal an affirmatively cooperative attitude on the defendant\u2019s part which presents an entirely different case from the passive model from which the Supreme Court in the <em>Miranda </em>case said a valid waiver will not be presumed. We hold that the Commonwealth here has sustained its burden in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">We deal briefly with the defendant\u2019s other assignments of error as they do not require any extended comment. The defendant claims error in the refusal of the judge to instruct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>the jury in his charge that the defendant was not informed of his right to have counsel present and to have counsel provided by the Commonwealth in the event that he could not afford one. Our discussion above disposes of that issue. There was no error. Nor was there an abuse of discretion in the judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. There was no prejudice in admitting the written statement of the witness Dwight Walker in corroboration of his oral testimony. There was no error in admitting the photographs of the scratches on the defendant\u2019s back and neck. It was not a violation of his constitutional rights to take the photographs. <em>Schmerber </em>v. <em>California, </em>384 U. S. 757. In cross-examination a sixteen year old acquaintance of the defendant who was called by him testified that in the course of a conversation on the evening of the murder the defendant had asked her to have intercourse with him. The denial of the motion to strike was within the judge\u2019s discretion, notwithstanding the risk of raising collateral issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">We have reviewed the entire record and do not believe that justice requires us to grant a new trial or the entry of a verdict of a lesser degree of guilt. See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, as amended by St. 1962, c. 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b598-7\"> Lieutenant Shea testified on the voir dire as follows: Q. \u201cHe had been a suspect since 10:00 or 11:00 o\u2019clock . . . [\u00a1in] the . . . morning?\u201d A. \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d Q. \u201cAnd is it fair to say, Lieutenant, that as a suspect, if he decided he was going to walk out and go back to New York, he wouldn\u2019t have been allowed to, would he?\u201d A. \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d This testimony does not suggest to us that the defendant was in custody at the time he arrived at the police station, but would have been restrained from leaving \u201cas a suspect,\u201d i.e., after he became one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b599-6\"> The record shows that the defendant had previously employed the services of an attorney at his home in New York State, and that this same attorney subsequently appeared in the defendant\u2019s behalf at the trial of the defendant in Massachusetts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b600-7\">Cutter, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_HL\">(concurring) I think that the ambiguous and somewhat contradictory evidence on the voir dire does not warrant the conclusion that Fisher (although warned of his right to remain silent and to be represented by counsel) was informed by the Springfield police on the morning of July 11, 1966, (a) that he could have counsel present at any police questioning, or (b) that, if he could not afford counsel, counsel would be provided for him at State expense. Perhaps the <em>Miranda </em>case, 384 U. S. 436, 468-479, on the present record, must be inflexibly construed as requiring that Fisher\u2019s apparently truthful confession be excluded if less than the complete warning (prescribed by the majority opinion in that case) was given on the morning of July 11. I perceive in the record no occasion for any warning until shortly after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>Fisher\u2019s unsatisfactory explanation of the scratches upon his person. If the <em>Miranda </em>case must be inflexibly interpreted, Fisher\u2019s death sentence should be reversed, and the present case should be remanded for a new trial in which the record concerning the police investigation less than a month after the <em>Miranda </em>decision can be developed more clearly and fully. Understandably a more complete record was not thought necessary at the carefully conducted trial only about three months and a half after that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The voir dire testimony warrants the following conclusions: (1) Fisher was given the complete <em>Miranda-type </em>warning and an opportunity to use the telephone on the evening of July 11. This was before any significant interrogation after his return to Springfield from Boston. There he and others (not like him suspected but only material witnesses) had taken polygraph tests after signing written waivers which are not before us. (2) No significant questioning (other than that involved in the polygraph test, not itself admissible in evidence, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fatalo, </em>346 Mass. 266) took place during the trip to Boston. (3) The police were attempting to comply fairly with requirements for custodial interrogation as they understood them. (4) Fisher proceeded cooperatively to answer police questions after each set of warnings. From his whole conduct, it could be inferred that he had decided to attempt by himself to allay police suspicions without asserting any rights of which he had been told.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">It seems to me, in all the circumstances, that the voir dire evidence should be regarded as warranting the conclusion that there was substantial compliance with the purport of \u25a0 the <em>Miranda </em>decision. Cf. the <em>Westover </em>situation discussed in the <em>Miranda </em>case, 384 U. S. 436, 494-495. I do not think that this record discloses literal compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">I concur in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b601-8\">Whittemore, J.</author>\n<p id=\"alo-dedup-1\">(dissenting) For the waiver to be made \u201cknowingly and intelligently\u201d as required by the <em>Miranda </em>rule, as to which the Commonwealth has the burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>proof, it must be shown that an understandable statement of the rights was given (384 U. S. at 479). The statement was required at least as early as the discovery of the scratches. It is not determinative that the express confessions were made in the evening interrogations. The defendant\u2019s custody began about 11 a.m., some twelve hours before his oral confession, and in the course of the day and evening he proceeded gradually into a state of inescapable involvement. The question whether he would take a lie detector test was a part of the police interrogation and the test was undoubtedly a factor leading to the later confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The evidence, to me, does not permit the conclusion that in the morning the defendant was \u201cclearly informed that he . . . Chad] the right to consult with a lawyer and <em>to have </em>the lawyer <em>with him during </em>interrogation\u201d (384 U. S. at 471) (emphasis supplied). Informing the defendant that he was entitled \u201cto be represented at all times by counsel,\u201d \u201cto the services of an attorney,\u201d and \u201cto the use of the phone for the purpose of engaging an attorney\u201d did not clearly inform him that he had a right to have the lawyer present at the police station and to consult with him before he answered any more questions. On the record it was only in the evening that the defendant was told that \u201can attorney can be present here now.\u201d It may be that the warnings given in the morning were as full as those given in the evening. Possibly in the use of the word \u201cagain\u201d Lieutenant Shea intended so to state. But this possibility is not enough to establish compliance with the rule. Hence, I conclude that the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The testimony (given by three officers and the defendant) at the voir dire did not permit the conclusion that it had been shown that the defendant had been told in the morning that an attorney would be provided if he could not afford one. Lieutenant Shea\u2019s testimony at the trial, as first given, also omitted this. It was only after a leading question which, although excluded, operated to call his attention to the omission, that the witness, in answer to a succeeding question, gave the testimony stated in the majority opinion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>The evidence is inconsistent and an unsatisfactory basis for a finding that the morning warning had been shown in this respect to be adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">A retrial would permit a determination to be made on evidence free of the present uncertainties and ambiguities.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">In this case the police pressures were not undue, the guilt of the defendant is clearly established by his confession, and it may be that whatever was said to the defendant he would have continued to talk. I believe, however, that the <em>Miranda </em>rule, so long as it remains an applicable principle of constitutional law, must be applied as declared.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
