We first consider the issue of notice. The employee in her testimony stated that while employed in the self-insurer\u2019s plant on or about June 14, 1963, she dropped \u201cat different times\u201d three jigs weighing from twenty-five to forty-eight pounds each on the palm of her left hand. The self-insurer argues that the first notice it had of this version of the employee\u2019s injury was at the first hearing before the single member on September 22, 1964. The records of the self-insurer\u2019s plant clinic indicate that on the morning of June 13, 1963, the employee stated at the clinic that \u201cshe [had] noticed a hard lump in the palmer [sic] base of her left index finger, doesn\u2019t know cause.\u201d On cross-examination the employee was unable to remember whether she stated at the clinic that she had dropped the jigs on her hand although she did say she told the layout operator about the jigs. The layout operator told her to first see the supervisor and then, she said, to \u201cgo to the first aid, but don\u2019t say too much up there, because she wanted me back on the job again.\u201d The clinical records refer to several nodules discovered in the employee\u2019s hand and over the \u201cdorsum of the right [sic] and right humerus.\u201d She was referred to an orthopedic surgeon who after a biopsy found the nodules to be benign giant cell tumors unrelated to her occupation. The history given to him failed to mention jigs falling on the patient\u2019s hand. The employee subsequently on May 20, 1964, was admitted to the Massachusetts General Hospital where she said that in the previous June \"she dropped some heavy things on . . . [left] hand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>and later that day noticed a sensation of tightness and swelling . . . [left] index finger as well as . . . [left] shoulder pain.\u201d On November 8, 1965, she started treatment with a general surgeon and told him \u201c[w]hile at work she dropped a \u2018jig\u2019 on her left index finger.\u201d On the basis of this pertinent evidence the reviewing board found \u201cthat the self-insurer has not been prejudiced as to notice as it appears that it had and availed itself of ample opportunity to make investigation and examination medically as to nature of condition present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">In our view the case presents serious doubt on the adequacy of notice. The formal claim for compensation filed with the board was silent on any injury to the employee resulting from falling jigs. Indeed, the clinical reports and the subsequent treatment by the orthopedic surgeon indicated the employee\u2019s medical condition to be unrelated to an industrial accident and no word reached the self-insurer to correct the impression. It is no answer to assert that the employee had prompt and competent medical care. The absence of such treatment is, however, not the only form of prejudice. <em>Garrigan\u2019s Case, </em>341 Mass. 413, 419. The self-insurer is harmed when from the nature of the knowledge which it acquires it is lulled into inactivity in an investigation which it would have actively pursued had it been aware of the true nature and basis of the employee\u2019s claim. See <em>Russell\u2019s Case, </em>334 Mass. 680, 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">In this instance, while the reviewing board has found that the employee sought and received prompt medical treatment, it has made no subsidiary findings which provide an \u201cadequate basis for knowing whether, in reaching the conclusion that there was no prejudice, the board applied correct legal principles.\u201d <em>Herson\u2019s Case, </em>341 Mass. 402, 407, and cases cited. We emphasize what was said in <em>Herson\u2019s Case, supra, </em>pp. 407 \u2014 408, relative to the necessity of findings sufficient to enable us to apply proper principles to test the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">2. Since this matter is to be remanded it is not inappropriate to point out that the record before us raises doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>whether the causal relationship between the alleged accident, or series of them, and the employee\u2019s injury has been established. Those engaged in further proceedings should take this into account.' <em>Larrabee\u2019s Case, </em>350 Mass. 305. <em>King\u2019s Case, </em>352 Mass. 488, 491-492.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">3. The decree of the Superior Court is reversed. The case is to be remanded to the board for appropriate subsidiary findings relating to the issues of notice, the self-insurer\u2019s knowledge of injury and prejudice, and for such further proceedings, which may include the taking of additional testimony, as may be consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
