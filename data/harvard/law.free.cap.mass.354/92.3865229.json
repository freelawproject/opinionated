Ciardiello &amp; Sons, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation, against which the Rizzos had brought a bill in equity on July 1, 1964, filing a lis pendens notice in the Land Court which described the bill as one to enjoin the corporation from throwing water and debris on the Rizzo land. A final decree in the equity suit, entered February 10, 1965, enjoined the corporation, its agents and assigns \u201cfrom suffering or permitting any broken stone, rocks, dirt, loam or other material placed on its lots to escape or to be deposited, spread or washed on to the land of the . . . [Rizzos].\u201d There is no evidence that any appeal was taken from this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>decree. The decree was not registered within sixty days of its rendition.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">General Laws c. 185, \u00a7 86, provides: \u201cNo writ of entry, petition for partition, or other proceeding at law or in equity affecting the title to land or the use and occupation thereof or the buildings thereon, and no judgment or decree, or any writ of error, bill of review or other proceeding to vacate or reverse any judgment or decree, shall have any effect upon registered land as against persons other than the parties thereto, unless a memorandum like that described in section fifteen of chapter one hundred and eighty-four, containing also a reference to the number of the certificate of title of the land affected and the volume and page of the registration book in which it is entered, is filed and registered. This section shall not apply to attachments, levies of execution, or to the probate of wills or administration in the probate court. If notice of the pendency of the proceeding has been duly registered, it shall be sufficient to register the judgment or decree within sixty days after the rendition thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">General Laws c. 184, \u00a7 15, makes provision for the filing of a lis pendens which was complied with by the Rizzos in their suit against the corporation. At common law the effect of lis pendens ended with the termination of the suit. <em>Steele </em>v. <em>Estabrook, </em>236 Mass. 252, 254. Patton on Titles (2d ed.) \u00a7 580. Tiffany, Real Property (3d ed.) \u00a7 1296. At most, G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 86, extends the effect of lis pendens in certain cases sixty days beyond entry of the final decree. More than sixty days having passed, no reason exists why the memorandum of notice should remain on the certificate and adversely affect the marketability of the petitioners\u2019 land. It follows that the Land Court acted properly under G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 114, in ordering cancellation of the memorandum from the petitioners\u2019 certificate of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
