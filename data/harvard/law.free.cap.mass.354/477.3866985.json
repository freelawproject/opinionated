L. . . . c. 156B\u201d; and, inter alla, to have the merger set aside. The defendant filed a plea in bar alleging that the plaintiff demanded \u201cpayment for Ms stock and an appraisal thereof ... as reqMred by Section 82 of G. L. c. 156B,\u201d and \u201cthat by demanding the payment of Ms stock, plaintiff elected to pursue Ms statutory remedy and is barred from bringing or maintaimng tMs suit.\u201d. The plaintiff appeals from an interlocutory decree sustaimng the plea'in bar, and from a final decree dismissing the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">We summarize the allegations of the bill. The plaintiff \u201cis the owner of 450 shares\u201d of the stock of Simonds. In November, 1965, Wallace-Murray offered to purchase the outstanding stock of Simonds for $43.50 a share. The plaintiff considered tMs price to be insufficient, and declined to sell Ms stock. Wallace-Murray succeeded, however, in acqmring 95% (about 1,444,856 shares) of the stock of Simonds. Subsequently, the plaintiff sought access to the stockholders\u2019 list of Simonds in order to commuMcate with the other minority stockholders \u201cabout the affairs of Simonds.\u201d Such access was demed by the officers of Simonds and of Wallace-Murray, allegedly in order to Mnder such communication. The plaintiff then requested Simonds to mail a commumeation to the other stockholders at Ms expense concermng \u201cthe possibility of an exchange of views between the minority shareholders of Simonds and possible future joint action by them in the event Wallace-Murray\u2019s . . . 95% stock interest in Simonds became adverse to . . . [the plaintiff] and the other . . . minority stockholders . . ..\u201d TMs request was also refused \u201cat the insistence of Wallace-Murray and for the same improper corporate purpose . . ..\u201d Wallace-Murray merged Simonds into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>itself under the provisions of G. L. c. 156B on June 30, 1966. Pursuant to G. L. c.. 156B, \u00a7 82, written notice of such merger was sent to the minority stockholders on July 1, 1966. Under the statute, the minority stockholders had twenty days after such notice to demand payment for their shares and an appraisal of their stock. Otherwise, they had no option but to accept the terms of the merger, which provided for the exchange of two shares of nonvoting preferred stock in Wallace-Murray for each share of Simonds voting .stock. This notice was not sent to the plaintiff. The plaintiff learned of the merger from a newspaper article, and upon his inquiry he received written notice of the merger on July 13, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The pl\u00e9a in bar states that with \u201cfull knowledge of the facts alleged in the Q/jill of [complaint,\u201d the plaintiff on July 14, 1966, within twenty days after the mailing of the notice to him, \u201cduly demanded in writing payment for his stock and an appraisal thereof.\u201d The parties agreed that these allegations are true.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The plaintiff argues that \u201cthe appraisal remedy is not exclusive and ... an objecting minority shareholder may also institute equitable proceedings.\u201d For this proposition, he relies on the case of <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>224 Mass. 504, 514. This case was decided long before the enactment of G. L. c. 156B. The plaintiff contends, however, that the statute \u201cdoes not change the rule,\u201d citing in this regard G. L. c. 156B, \u00a7 98.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff reads the words \u201csuch stockholder\u201d in the section cited as referring \u201cto a stockholder who is engaged in the enforcement of his appraisal rights under Section 82 (e) 3.\u201d The plaintiff maintains, therefore, that he has \u201cboth the right to demand an appraisal . . . and the right to seek equitable relief . . . where the merger is either illegal or fraudulent as to him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s allegations concerning the denial to him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>of access to the other minority stockholders do not amount to an allegation of illegality or fraud. Nor did the delayed notice to the plaintiff make the merger illegal as to him, since he was in fact notified in time to preserve his rights under G. L. c. 156B, \u00a7 82 (e). The only allegations concerning conduct of the defendant of which the plaintiff has a right to complain pertain to the valuation of his stock, and as to this valuation he has an adequate remedy at law. Where in a so-called \u201cshort form\u201d merger permitted by G. L. c. 156B, \u00a7 82, at least 90% of the stock of the corporation to be merged is owned by the parent corporation, and a minority stockholder declines to participate in the merger, the only right reserved to him, absent illegality or fraud as to him, is the right to a determination of the value of his stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">In the case of <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Wells, supra, </em>the plaintiff had made a demand for payment of his stock before he became aware that by mismanagement and fraudulent transfers the directors had deprived the corporation of a large part of its assets, thereby depressing the value of the stock. In the instant case, no such wrongdoing is alleged. While in parts of the bill not here recited the plaintiff alleges that the defendant has sought to make it difficult for minority stockholders to learn of Simonds\u2019 financial condition, the plaintiff himself had access to the financial report and he does not contend that the condition of Simonds has been manipulated. If, as he does allege, the other stockholders were not equally informed, he cannot assert that the merger was therefore illegal or fraudulent <em>as to him. </em>The plea in bar stated, and the plaintiff admitted, that he demanded payment with \u201cfull knowledge of the facts alleged\u201d in the bill. Even under the reasoning of <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Wells, supra, </em>the plaintiff would not be entitled to equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">\n<em>Interlocutory decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">\n<em>Final decree affirmed with costs of appeal.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-8\"> \u201cThe enforcement by a stockholder of his right to receive payment for bis shares in the manner provided in this section [\u00a7 82] shall be an exclusive remedy except that this section shall not exclude the right of such stockholder to bring or maintain an_ appropriate proceeding to obtain relief on the ground that such corporate action will be or is illegal or fraudulent as to him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
