The taking was for a proposed \u201couter belt highway.\u201d It is alleged that the Porembas\u2019 parcel (no. 13) \u201cis totally unnecessary for and extraneous to the construction of\u201d the highway; that parcel no. 12, belonging to Helen C. Riley, and parcel no. 10, belonging to Marjorie Dunning, a plaintiff, are both unnecessary for the construction; and that part of a parcel (no. 9) was unnecessarily taken from James A. and Bernice Bremner, other plaintiffs. The plaintiffs further allege (a) that the \u201c[c]ity has taken more land than is necessary for the construction of\u201d the highway; (b) on information and belief, \u201cthat the parcels . . . have been taken not for any public purpose, but for the private benefit of one . . . Albano [a defendant, see fn. 1] . . . owner of a large tract of business zoned land contiguous to the rear of the . . . parcels\u201d taken; and (c) that Albano \u201cattempted to . . . purchase . . . the properties prior to this taking and . . . indicated to . . . [the then owners] or to some of them, that if they did not sell to him,\u201d the city would take their land.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">Various errors or procedural deficiencies are also alleged to exist in connection with the taking. These allegations are summarized below in part 2 of this opinion. The plaintiffs, in addition to declaratory relief, seek to enjoin prosecution of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">The demurrer of the city and various of its officers sets out, among other grounds, (1) that the bill did not state any basis for relief in equity or against any named defendant, and (2) that persons not named in the bill as defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>were \u201cdirectly interested in the controversy.\u201d The case is before us on appeals from the interlocutory decree sustaining the demurrer and from the final decree dismissing the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">1. The basic allegations of the bill are mere conclusions, viz. (a) that the taking of lots nos. 13, 10, and 12 and of part of lot no. 9 is \u201cunnecessary for and extraneous to\u201d the highway; (b) that \u201cmore land than is necessary\u201d has been taken; and (c) that the parcels were not \u201ctaken ... for any public purpose\u201d but for Albano\u2019s private benefit. The taking is alleged to have been for a highway, a public purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">A wide discretion is entrusted to officials charged with responsibility to determine what land is essential to a public improvement. It requires clear allegations of specific facts to state a case for any relief, or to show that any real controversy exists, based upon abuse of such official discretion. See <em>Despatchers\u2019 Cafe Inc. </em>v. <em>Somerville Housing Authy. </em>332 Mass. 259, 262-264 (allegations inadequate against demurrer); <em>Moskow </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Authy. </em>349 Mass. 553, 562-564, cert. den. 382 U. S. 983 (allegations not sufficient). See also <em>N. Ward Co. </em>v. <em>Street Commrs. of Boston, </em>217 Mass. 381, 386; <em>McAuliffe &amp; Burke Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Housing Authy. </em>334 Mass. 28, 30-32; <em>Worcester Knitting Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Worcester Housing Authy. </em>335 Mass. 19, 22; <em>Luke </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Turnpike Authy. </em>337 Mass. 304, 308-310; <em>Robie </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Turnpike Authy. </em>347 Mass. 715, 727; <em>Caleb Pierce, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, ante, </em>306, 308-310. See also Nichols, Eminent Domain (Rev. 3d ed.) \u00a7 4.11; Antieau, Municipal Corporation Law, \u00a7 20.01. There are in the case at bar no allegations of underlying facts (as distinguished from conclusions) sufficient (a) to afford any adequate basis for a declaration of rights, (b) to set out a case for equitable relief against a taking, (c) to show that the taking was not for a public purpose, or (d) to establish that the city\u2019s action, by its various officers, was not in good faith and for the public benefit, or that it was for the private benefit of Albano. See <em>Stockus </em>v. <em>Boston Housing Authy. </em>304 Mass. 507, 511; <em>Chicoine </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>351 Mass. 664, 666. See also <em>Machado </em>v. <em>Board of Pub. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number><em>Works of Arlington, </em>321 Mass. 101, 104-105; <em>Sellors </em>v. <em>Concord, </em>329 Mass. 259, 262. The allegations concerning Albano\u2019s prior negotiations to purchase some of the affected parcels and his indication that the properties would be taken, if not sold to him, do not contain specific facts sufficient to describe action by public officers or bodies in bad faith. See <em>Stockus </em>v. <em>Boston Housing Authy. </em>304 Mass. 507, 511. The aspects of the bill thus far discussed fall within the principle of <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Neelon, </em>335 Mass. 357, 360-361, that a demurrer to a bill for declaratory relief may be sustained where the bill does not unequivocally set out facts showing a case presenting a significant controversy. See <em>Weinstein </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Fall River, </em>344 Mass. 314, 317; <em>Cary Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Chelsea, </em>345 Mass. 769. Cf. <em>Price </em>v. <em>Price, </em>341 Mass. 390, 393-394; <em>Fenestra Inc. </em>v. <em>Mared Bldg. Prod. Inc. </em>349 Mass. 734, 735-736. Cf. also <em>Massachusetts </em>Assn. <em>of Tobacco Distribs. </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn. ante, </em>85, 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">2. The plaintiffs allege that the city \u201chas not performed certain essential statutory steps.\u201d The only such step sufficiently argued in the plaintiffs\u2019 brief <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to require discussion is an alleged violation of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81I.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The allegations with respect to c. 41, \u00a7 81I, may be summarized as follows: (1) Springfield is a city, with a planning board established under c. 41, \u00a7 81A, which has not adopted an official map. (2) Section 811 (fn. 3) requires such a city \u201cto refer the proposed laying out ... of any public way to the planning board for consideration and report, as a prerequisite to the laying out . . . of . . . [the] way.\u201d (3) Springfield has failed to refer the laying out of the outer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>belt highway to the planning board. These allegations, the plaintiffs say, show that the order of taking is illegal and invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">No decision of this court has construed or applied \u00a7 811. The section bears some resemblance to statutory provisions relating to advisory reports (see <em>Noonan </em>v. <em>Moulton, </em>348 Mass. 633, 639) by a planning board concerning certain zoning matters. See e.g. G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, as amended; <em>Fish </em>v. <em>Canton, </em>322 Mass. 219, 222-224. Cf. <em>Burlington </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>318 Mass. 216, 217-219; <em>Doliner </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Millis, </em>343 Mass. 10, 13. In general, in Massachusetts, the adoption of official maps or plans has not been regarded as a prerequisite to municipal zoning activity. See <em>Noonan </em>v. <em>Moulton, </em>348 Mass. 633, 639. See also <em>Moskow </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Authy. </em>349 Mass. 553, 567-568. Nevertheless, the advisory reports of a planning board (as <em>Fish </em>v. <em>Canton, supra, </em>indicates) have been treated as important to some aspects of municipal action concerning land use and regulation. The history of \u00a7 81I indicates a legislative purpose to have some form of planning board recommendations considered before municipal action in laying out a public way.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Section 81I in its present form was enacted by St. 1947, c. 340, \u00a7 4, as part of a comprehensive revision of statutes relating to planning. It seems to have been designed principally to ensure that each municipal planning board would have opportunity to make recommendations concerning each significant highway change in the city, so that overall city plans would not be adversely affected. In large measure, the present \u00a7 81I took the place of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81E, inserted by St. 1936, c. 211, \u00a7 4. The 1936 form of \u00a7 81E provided only for discretionary reference of matters to the planning board \u201cby ordinance ... or vote.\u201d See Nichols, Massachusetts Law of Planning and Zoning (1943 ed.) 38 et seq., esp. at 41. The change to the present explicit language of \u00a7 81I (fn. 3) shows that something more specific was intended by the revised provision. See Shurtleff and Cantelmo, Planning Law and Administration in Massachusetts, 12-13; Hardy, Municipal Law, \u00a7\u00a7 362, 363, 366. Compare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>cases where emphatic statutory language has been construed as merely directory, rather than mandatory, where the context indicates that to have been the legislative purpose. See <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Acting Commr. of Ins. </em>265 Mass. 23, 28-29; <em>Monico\u2019s Case, </em>350 Mass. 183, 185-186.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">With \u00a7 81I must be read \u00a7 81B (as amended through St. 1953, c. 674, \u00a7 2). Section 81B, among other things, provides that the Superior Court for the county in which lies land affected by \u00a7\u00a7 81A to 81J, inclusive, \u201cshall have jurisdiction \u00a1In equity! on petition of a planning board ... to enforce any . . . provisions of said sections . . . and may restrain by injunction violations thereof.\u201d We think it clear that, if a city council (in a city having no official map) undertook to take action to lay out a public way without having before it some form of report from the planning board, the planning board itself could take action to compel a reference of the matter to it and to enjoin violation of \u00a7 81I. Whether an individual landowner by mandamus could compel a planning board to take such action, we need not now decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The allegations of basic facts in the bill do not show (a) the details of the order of taking; (b) what if any recommendations of the planning board were before the city council when the order was adopted; e.g. whether the planning board at some time had recommended or approved a comprehensive project or a scheme for highway development for which use of the land taken would be appropriate; (c) whether the taking follows a specification of the limits of the proposed highway or was in anticipation of a later setting of the highway limits; or (d) under what statutory authority, in addition to G. L. c. 79, the city purported to make the taking.i **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The bill thus does not allege facts con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>cerning the events leading up to and affecting the taking, or concerning the form and content of the order of taking, adequate to show to what extent, if any, c. 41, \u00a7 81I, is applicable to these takings at all, or that it has been violated in any manner. The allegations present no satisfactory basis for a judicial declaration of rights. The courts should not decide important questions of law which may widely affect eminent domain procedures and land titles upon indefinite allegations which are little more than conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">We do not reach the questions (a) whether any person, other than a planning board acting under present c. 41, \u00a7 81B, can complain of a violation of \u00a7 81I, either in the manner here attempted, or, perhaps, on a writ of certiorari to quash the order of taking (see <em>Byfield </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>247 Mass. 46, 52), (b) whether compliance with \u00a7 811 is a condition precedent to a valid taking for highway purposes, see <em>Sellors </em>v. <em>Concord, </em>329 Mass. 259, 262-263; cf. Nichols, Eminent Domain (Rev. 3d ed.) \u00a7 24.6 et seq; or (c) what types of action may constitute compliance with \u00a7 81I. The deficiencies in the bill, as it relates to \u00a7 81I, seem to us to bring this phase of the case also within the principle of cases, already cited, like <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Neelon, </em>335 Mass. 357, 360-361, despite the principle that ordinarily a demurrer to a bill for declaratory relief cannot be sustained. This is not a case where a declaration of rights (rather than dismissal of the bill) was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Doubtless, the trial judge, in his discretion, could have reserved action on the demurrer and heard on the merits at least the issues relating to \u00a7 81I. See <em>Olszewski </em>v. <em>Sardynski, </em>316 Mass. 715, 717; <em>Massachusetts Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Cronin, </em>351 Mass. 321, 323-324. He was not required to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">\n<em>Interlocutory decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">\n<em>Final decree affirmed with costs of appeal.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b479-7\"> No question relating to G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 15A (as amended through St. 1954, c. 105), mentioned in the plaintiffs\u2019 brief, has been sufficiently argued (see <em>Lolos </em>v. <em>Berlin, </em>338 Mass. 10, 14) to require any discussion (S. J. C. Rule 1:13) even if it be assumed that the bill raises any question under \u00a7 15A.
