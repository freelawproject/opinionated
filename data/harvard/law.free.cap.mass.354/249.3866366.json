He was again found guilty of murder in the first degree after a new trial, August 14-23, 1967. The new jury, however, recommended that the death sentence be not imposed. Nassar was sentenced to life imprisonment. The case is before us under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 \u00a7 33A-33G, as amended. The evidence was essentially that recited in the first <em>Nassar </em>case, 351 Mass. 37, 39-40, with some omissions and with the addition of the testimony of a new witness mentioned below.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-30\">On September 29,1964, Mrs. Rita Buote and her daughter Diane, then fourteen years old, drove into a filling station on Route 125 in Andover to purchase gasoline. The proprietor Irvin Hilton was on his knees in front of the lubri-eating bay, looldng up at a man holding a gun in his hand. This man fired a shot at Hilton, who fell over on his side. Hilton was then shot three more times.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-37\">The assailant walked rapidly toward Mrs. Buote\u2019s vehicle and approached the door on the driver\u2019s side. She had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>locked the door. He pointed the pistol at her and pulled the trigger twice. The gun did not fire. The man started banging on the window. Mrs. Buote thought she heard him say, \u201copen the door.\u201d He stood still for a moment, and looked toward the highway. Mrs. Buote got down on the floor of the vehicle, and could no longer see the assailant. Diane crouched on the seat. When both soon rose, the assailant was gone. Mrs. Buote and Diane identified Nassar as the assailant in circumstances described below.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">These events were also observed, from a more distant point, by two men, Reginald Mortimer and William King, occupants of a truck, which had been driven into the filling station while the murder was in progress. When they realized what was going on, Mortimer backed his truck and pulled out of the station. The assailant climbed into a black automobile with black and white Virginia license plates, no. 960-647, and drove in the direction of Lawrence. Mortimer and King described the assailant as approximately five feet seven to eight inches tall, about 135 pounds in weight, in his twenties or thirties, and clad in a trench coat. Neither identified Nassar as the assailant. Mortimer said that he would not be able to recognize the assailant if he saw him again. King would be able to give \u201c[o]nly a general description,\u201d for \u201cCwje were too interested in getting out of there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The principal issue is whether Nassar was in fact the assailant. Other evidence not summarized above, so far as relevant to matters argued, is discussed in the course of dealing with the assignments to which such evidence is pertinent.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">1. Nassar contends that his attorney was improperly denied adequate opportunity to question prospective jurors, with the consequence that he was unable intelligently to exercise his right to sixteen peremptory challenges. See G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 29.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the outset, the trial judge gave all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>the members of the venire careful, full, general instructions concerning their obligations and about the questions which would be put to them. He cautioned them against discussing or reading about the case prior to their interrogation. He put to each juror the questions required by c. 234, \u00a7 28,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and under our decisions. See e.g. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ladetto. </em>349 Mass. 237, 245. He dealt with the matter of additional questions as the names of individual jurors were drawn. In accordance (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ventura, </em>294 Mass. 113, 116-118) with our long standing practice, inquiry of prospective jurors was only by the judge. A trial judge is required only to ask those questions prescribed by statute or court decision. Other questions are in his discretion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>327 Mass. 641, 646-647. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Geagan, </em>339 Mass. 487, 502-508, cert. den. 361 U. S. 895. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kiernan, </em>348 Mass. 29, 35-36, cert. den. 380 U. S. 913. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monahan, </em>349 Mass. 139, 156-157. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nassar, </em>351 Mass. 37, 40-41. We see no occasion to alter our \u201cdignified, expeditious, and fair practice\u201d (see <em>Geagan </em>v. <em>Gavin, </em>181 F. Supp. 466, 474 [D. Mass.], affd. 292 F. 2d 244, 248-249 Cist Cir.], cert. den. 370 U. S. 903), although in other jurisdictions a different practice may exist. Cf. e.g. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Napoleone, </em>349 F. 2d 350, 353-354 (3d Cir.); <em>People </em>v. <em>Coen, </em>205 Cal. 596, 604-607; <em>People </em>v. <em>DeLerdo, </em>350 Ill. 148, 152-156 (in which the judge was shown to have engaged in somewhat summary conduct); <em>Fedorinchik </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>289 Mich. 436, 438-439 (no inquiry about a statutory disqualification); <em>Oden </em>v. <em>State, </em>166 Neb. 729, 730-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>735. We think that our practice has operated fairly to defendants and has been conducive to proper, just judicial administration. We see no reason to believe that any other method would produce more impartial or more competent jurors. There is ample power in this court to review whether a trial judge has committed any abuse of discretion in refusing to put additional questions, or otherwise to test members of the venire for bias or interest. See, in this connection, the very broad scope of review of capital cases under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, as amended through St. 1962, c. 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The trial judge in this case went to a considerable length to put suggested additional questions to prospective jurors. He exercised his discretionary power fairly and reasonably, with the consequence that a broad inquiry was made. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Subilosky, </em>352 Mass. 153, 157-161. Cf. <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>United States, </em>53 F. 2d 982, 983-984 (5th Cir.). He gave consideration to the possible effect of a particular news broadcast and a newspaper article. At the close of the selection of jurors, although the Commonwealth's peremptory challenges had been exhausted, Nassar had one unused. We think that the voir dire was patient, adequate, and impartial.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">A related assignment of error concerned a juror, who on the voir dire answered questions in a manner wholly consistent with lack of bias. No challenge for cause was made. No suggestion was made that he be asked additional questions. No exception to his selection was saved. During trial Nassar's counsel brought to the attention of the judge a telephone call from one Brady to Nassar's mother reporting that this juror had been \u201cfriendly with the decedent.\u201d This occurred on August 21. Prior to the charge on August 23, Nassar\u2019s attorney reported to the judge that he had been unable to get in touch with Brady. The judge declined, when the matter was first raised, to act on hearsay information. Prior to the charge, he refused to excuse the juror when after two days there had been no substantiation of the hearsay complaint. The juror participated in the verdict, for he was not one of the four extra jurors excused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>by lot after the charge (see fn. 2). The judge had before him no such substantial or direct information as should have led him to take any action concerning the juror. Cf. <em>Remmer </em>v. <em>United States, </em>350 U. S. 377, 380-381 (approach by an F.B.I. agent during trial); <em>United States </em>ex rel. <em>De Vita </em>v. <em>McCorkle, </em>248 F. 2d 1, 5-10 (3d Cir. en banc \u2014 alleged fraud of juror in concealing matter; opinion by majority of court), cert. den. 355 U. S. 873.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">2. It is asserted that Nassar may have been harmed by the exclusion from the jury of persons holding scruples against the imposition of capital punishment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nassar contends, with some exaggeration of the facts disclosed by the record (see fn. 5 below), that thereby he was deprived of a constitutional right to trial before an impartial jury representing a cross-section of the community. This contention is made, despite the circumstance that this jury recommended that the death sentence not be imposed on essentially undisputed facts establishing a brutal, cold-blooded murder by some person.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">A closely related contention we recently rejected in the <em>Ladetto </em>case, 349 Mass. 237, 246-247. Our statutory disqualification (G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 3) of jurors, \u201cwhose opinions are such as to preclude . . . finding a defendant guilty of a crime punishable with death,\u201d has already been quoted (fn. 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">During the selection of the jury, Nassar\u2019s counsel saved an exception to \u201cexcusing . . . any person because\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>judge found that the person \u201cdoes not believe in capital punishment\u201d on the ground that excusing such a person would result in a jury more ready to convict than one which included persons opposed to capital punishment. This general exception was saved after the judge had excused from service a woman who, as counsel agreed, should have been excused in any event. In other instances,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> exceptions were saved where the opinions concerning the death penalty of a person excused may have been at least one of the reasons for the excuse. The judge, however, took pains to ascertain whether each excused prospective juror would have been unable, because of his opinion, to act objectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Over a long period, it has been held proper to excuse a prospective juror from service in a capital case if his views on capital punishment would preclude him from joining in a verdict resulting in a death sentence. See cases collected in the <em>Ladetto </em>case, 349 Mass. 237, 246-247, and annotation, 48 A. L. R. 2d 560. Our statute prescribes the death sentence for murder in the first degree, \u201cunless the jury shall by their ^unanimous] verdict, and as a part thereof, upon and after consideration of all the evidence, recommend that sentence of death be not imposed, in which case\u201d the punishment is life imprisonment. See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 2, as amended through St. 1956, c. 731, \u00a7 12; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McNeil, </em>328 Mass. 436, 441-442. The legislative policy should not be thwarted by allowing jurors to sit in capital cases who are not prepared to examine the evidence impartially and to enforce that policy if (a) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>evidence convinces them of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and (b) they find in the evidence no mitigating or other circumstances which lead them to recommend that the death sentence not be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Members of the public now entertain a wide variety of views about the death penalty. See Thorsten Sellin, The Death Penalty (Report for Am. Law Inst. Model Penal Code Project, 1959), esp. p. 14, et seq. In view of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 3, however, we follow the rule of our cases,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which in our opinion does not impair any constitutional right to an impartial jury. That rule, in effect, excludes only those who (because of their views on the death penalty and to avoid its imposition), if they could not obtain a \u25a0unanimous recommendation that the death penalty be not imposed, would convict of a lesser crime than first degree murder or acquit without conscientious consideration of what crime was established by the evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">3. Nassar contends that irrelevant, prejudicial evidence was admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">(a) Mrs. Hilton, widow of the murder victim, answered only eight questions. Other witnesses, of course, could have been used to establish Hilton\u2019s ownership of the filling station where the crime occurred and the hour at which he went to work. The questions asked of her, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>were relevant. They were of a routine nature and had no tendency to inflame the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">(b) Testimony was admitted that Officer Fitzpatrick (mentioned later in this opinion), while performing his duties, selected a picture about two and a half hours after seeing in a newspaper a sketch supposed to resemble Hilton\u2019s murderer. In the first <em>Nassar </em>case, 351 Mass. 37, 42-43, we held that it was error to admit evidence that the officer \u201cwent to the identification files\u201d to find the picture. It was said to be \u201ccommon knowledge that the \u2018identification files\u2019 of the police contain pictures of men who have previously been connected with criminal activity, and, therefore, testimony about the process by which the photograph was selected should be excluded.\u201d At this second trial, however, there was no reference to \u201cidentification files.\u201d Reasonable efforts were made to comply with our earlier decision. See fn. 8. Officer Fitzpatrick\u2019s testimony was as neutral and colorless as it well could have been in view of the unavoidable inference that police ability to obtain a photograph promptly suggests that it was found in their files.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">(c) Testimony of Louis Devine, who had been a parole officer, was given without disclosure, or even intimation, of that fact. We think that the assistant district attorney amply complied with our earlier caution (351 Mass. 37, 46 \u2014 17) with respect to this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">4. Nassar contends, by various assignments of error, that the cross-examination of Mrs. Buote was unduly restricted.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">(a) We held in the first <em>Nassar </em>case, 351 Mass. 37, 47, that it was not error (1) to refuse to put the defendant (as Nassar\u2019s counsel desired to do in this trial also) in a position adjacent to Mrs. Buote\u2019s automobile to demonstrate physical facts allegedly inconsistent with her testimony, and (2) to exclude a conversation between Mrs. Buote and an investigator concerning her belief that there was \u201cadditional evidence establishing\u201d Nassar\u2019s guilt. We adhere to the view, then expressed, that the scope of cross-examination in such matters is within the discretion of the trial judge. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>The judge could reasonably view a question to her, asking whether she understood that her \u201ctestimony . . . identifying . . . [Nassar] is sufficient to warrant his conviction, \u201d as involving an issue of law not properly to be put to one not a lawyer.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Mrs. Buote\u2019s cross-examination dealt with a wide range of matters. Examination of it as a whole does not indicate any substantial or improper restriction of the scope of examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">(b) The trial judge, in his discretion, reasonably denied voir dire examinations prior to Mrs. Buote\u2019s and Diane\u2019s testimony. Each was expected to testify, and did testify, principally that she identified Nassar as the murderer. Nassar\u2019s counsel, however, contends that these identifications were induced by the Buotes\u2019 prior examination and identification of a photograph of Nassar, which, he submits, was shown to them in circumstances which require that the identifications be excluded entirely. See the first <em>Nassar </em>case, 351 Mass. 37, 39-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">This is not the type of situation in which a voir dire would be usual. Compare the situation relating to confessions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>351 Mass. 522, 529-531. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LePage, </em>352 Mass. 403, 410. The effect of allowing a voir dire on this type of testimony would be to hear much evidence twice. The record indicates no useful purpose to be served by thus prolonging the trial. In any event, the full facts bearing upon the propriety of the identification procedures are now before us in the very complete record.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">5. Without referring definitely to particular assignments of error, Nassar contends that the \u201cidentification evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>. . . was unreliable from the beginning\u201d and should not have been admitted. The evidence concerning events which preceded the Buotes\u2019 identification of Nassar is summarized below.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Mrs. Buote and Diane saw the crime committed. Each had an opportunity closely to observe the murderer without a hat and without glasses. Each talked promptly with the police at the scene of the crime. Each gave the police some description of Hilton\u2019s assailant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On the night of the murder, each of them was shown a group of pictures, not including one of Nassar. They did not identify any one of the pictures as portraying the murderer. The next day Officer Tammany of the Andover police force talked with Mrs. Buote. Together they prepared a sketch of the murderer, as she recalled him, with corrections made under her guidance in an effort to reflect \u201ca fair likeness\u201d of the assailant she had seen. This sketch was later shown to Diane, who was not present when it was prepared. The sketch was published in the newspapers the next day, with a report that the police \u201cwere looking for a man that looked like\u201d the sketch.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">On the night of September 30 to October 1, 1964, a Lawrence police officer, Joseph Fitzpatrick was on station duty. He saw the sketch in the issue of a Lawrence newspaper for October 1. As a consequence, he selected a photograph (portraying a front face and profile of a man\u2019s head and shoulders) and showed it to his superiors, although he had not previously \u201cbeen assigned to the investigation into\u201d Hilton\u2019s death.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Without making any effort to get in touch with \u201cLieutenant Leary or anyone . . . working on the case,\u201d Sergeant Herman of the Lawrence police force, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>who had no training as a detective, and Officer Fitzpatrick went to the Buote house together with Nassar's photograph<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> about 7 a.m. They showed the photograph (selected by Officer Fitzpatrick) to Mrs. Buote, separate from Diane. \"She wasn\u2019t too sure\u201d when she saw the profile picture, but, when she was shown the full face, she said, \u201cThat\u2019s him.\u201d Later, Diane, who had been asleep, was brought into the room. She was separately shown the photograph and said, \"[T]hat\u2019s him, that\u2019s the one.\u201d Later, the two Lawrence officers delivered the photograph to Lieutenant Leary.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Sometime during that day, Lieutenant Leary and Sergeant Deyermond (of the Andover police) showed Mrs. Buote, by herself, a number of pictures. She picked out Nassar\u2019s photograph. Later, Diane also did so separately. As already noted, both Mrs. Buote and Diane identified Nassar in the court room.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">It, of course, would have been better practice for these Lawrence policemen to have consulted the State and An-dover officers charged with investigating the crime, when Officer Fitzpatrick \u201cfound in . . . [his] own mind [similarity] between the [Nassar] photograph and the composite . . . [sketch] printed in the newspaper.\u201d Officer Fitzgerald acted on what he agreed was \u201c[s]art of on a hunch.\u201d The Lawrence officers\u2019 visit to the Buotes occurred at a time when (so far as the record shows) there was no suspect and when the police had no real leads. It then would have been natural for those investigating the crime to produce before the Buotes, from time to time, photographs of people who resembled the sketch. Lieutenant Leary and Sergeant Deyermond, as soon as they had the opportunity, tested the Buotes with a number of photographs, including that of Nassar whose family lived in the Lawrence area. We think that the Lawrence officers\u2019 action did not bar the use of the Buotes\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>The record does not indicate to us that there was any effort either by the Lawrence officers or by any officer actually charged with the investigation to influence the Buotes improperly to make an identification. The Buotes had both had a good, recent, close look at the murderer, in circumstances which neither of them was likely to forget. Nassar\u2019s photographs show his face to be one likely to be remembered. The full facts concerning the identifications were before the jury for whatever bearing they might have, upon the weight to be given to the Buotes\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">We recognize that, as in <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U. S. 377, 386, the action of the two Lawrence police officers had \"fallen short of the ideal.\u201d These events, however, occurred in 1964, long before the decisions (June, 1967) in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U. S. 218 (lineup procedures), and <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>California, </em>388 U. S. 263, 272-274, 296. Because, see <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>388 U. S. 293, 300-301, these decisions are not retroactive, we do not consider whether those cases have application to facts such as here appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">On \"the totality of the circumstances\u201d (see 388 U. S. at p. 302), we conclude that there was nothing in the process of identification adopted in this matter, in an effort to get some clue to the solution of a baffling crime, which was unreasonable in the light of the whole situation or was conducive to irreparable mistaken identification. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blackburn, ante, </em>200, 203. We hold that the Buotes\u2019 identifications of Nassar in open court were properly received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">6. There was one significant witness who did not testify at the first trial. Ruth Watson, a telephone operator, testified that she was riding in Andover on September 29, 1964, in an automobile with a friend, Mrs. Gertrude White. A motor vehicle with Virginia plates \"cut . . . [them] off, so that . . . [they] had to turn to the right sharply.\u201d She identified Nassar in the court room as the driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">On cross-examination she stated that she first reported this identification to the police about eight months after the murder. She had seen the composite sketch in a Law<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>rence newspaper and later had seen there Nassar\u2019s photographs. She realized that the Virginia automobile had been found in Andover and had been used in the murder.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Mrs.. White had advised her, when they talked about it, not to \u201cbecome involved . . . because . . . [Mrs. White] livens] alone and you never know what could happen.\u201d This, she said, was the reason she \u201cdidn\u2019t go to the police.\u201d After she had gone to the police she had picked Nassar out of two photographs of a lineup of twelve men, apparently photographs of a lineup conducted at the time of Nassar\u2019s original arrest. She had previously seen news photographs of Nassar.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">At the close of her testimony, just before a recess at 11:25 a.m. on August 21, 1967, near the end of the trial, Nassar\u2019s counsel asked for time to investigate this surprise witness. It was represented to the judge by the assistant district attorney that (although he had known about her) he had not used her at the first trial, even as a rebuttal witness, because he had \u201cfelt she was not necessary.\u201d The trial Judge adjourned the case until the next day and made available to defence counsel $200 for investigation of the witness. Prior to 10:20 a.m. on August 22, an investigator and defence counsel had interviewed Miss Watson and Mrs. White. The telephone company had declined to let the investigator make investigations, apparently in its offices (without the permission, not granted, of its legal department), to determine whether Miss Watson had talked with other employees about the Andover incident. Nassar\u2019s counsel conceded that he had \u201cno doubt,\u201d as a result of his talks with the two ladies, that they had in fact \u201cpassed a blue car with Virginia plates\u201d and \u201cat the place they say they passed.\u201d He conceded also \u201cthat it was the same car, sometime before the murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>The judge declined to grant a further continuance of the case for additional investigation. Nassar\u2019s counsel then conducted further cross-examination of Miss Watson. He also put Mrs. White on the stand as his witness. She herself was able to testify only that the driver of the Virginia automobile they had seen on the afternoon of the murder was a man, and that Miss Watson, when the \u201cnewspaper sketch was being discussed\u201d after its publication, had \u201cpassed a remark that it resembled the one that she saw.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Whether to allow a further continuance, after the Commonwealth had rested, was a matter within the discretion of the trial judge. The judge could reasonably be of opinion (a) that further investigation would be unlikely to be productive of more than cumulative proof of matters already brought out on cross-examination, at most going to the weight of Miss Watson\u2019s testimony, and (b) that delay in submitting the case to the jury, \u201clocked up\u201d for the duration of the trial, would be undesirable. There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">7. Mention should be made of certain other matters argued by Nassar.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">(a) The judge properly informed Nassar\u2019s counsel that it was not the latter\u2019s duty to explain the law concerning Nassar\u2019s right not to testify. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vanetzian, </em>350 Mass. 491, 494. Counsel had already sufficiently indicated that instructions on this subject would be given by the judge. As Nassar\u2019s brief concedes, \u201cthe judge did indeed give adequate instructions.\u201d We perceive no error and no objectionable reproof to counsel in what the judge said in the presence of the jury. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>352 Mass. 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">(b) The judge charged adequately on the issue of the identifications. The jury had heard and seen the identifying witnesses, who had been subjected to thorough, searching cross-examination. The judge permitted Nassar\u2019s counsel to emphasize in argument the importance of this issue. Thejfjudge charged fully and clearly on the jury\u2019s duty in weighing evidence and on the subject of reasonable doubt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>He was not obliged to charge, as requested by Nassar, \u201cthat experience has shown that eyewitness identifications are frequently erroneous.\u201d He had adequately indicated the criteria of judging the evidence and the witnesses. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monahan, </em>349 Mass. 139, 170-171, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">(c) The judge properly gave instructions on the theory that the murder could be found to have taken place in the course of an attempted armed robbery. To be sure, there was no evidence that any money had been taken from Hilton or his premises, or that the assailant left the scene of the crime with precipitant haste. There was, however, evidence (1) that blood stains had been found near the cash register and near the office; and (2) that there had been interruption of what was going on from the unexpected arrival of the Buotes, Mortimer, and King at the scene of the crime. There was evidence from which it could be inferred that Nassar needed funds. See the first <em>Nassar </em>case, 351 Mass. 37, 46-47. There was no indication of any motive for the brutal killing other than robbery (although, of course, proof of motive was not necessary; see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dawn, </em>302 Mass. 255, 263).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">8. Other assignments of error need not be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">9. In accordance with our duty in a capital case (G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, as amended) the whole record has been examined with a view to determining whether there was any miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kerrigan, </em>345 Mass. 508, 509-510, 513. Obviously the propriety of a conviction in this case depends largely upon an appraisal of the identification testimony. In making this, we recognize that we, unlike the judge and jury, did not see or hear the witnesses, an opportunity of great importance in determining issues of credibility. We perceive nothing in this record of a carefully and conscientiously conducted proceeding which leads us to conclude that justice requires a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">10. Counsel, who appeared for Nassar at his first trial, sought early in the second trial to be designated as appointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>counsel for Nassar. Concerning this request the trial judge made findings summarized below.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Nassar was indigent. Various donors provided funds for the defence of Nassar at the first trial. His attorney received some compensation from this source. These funds were not sufficient to provide compensation to counsel for prosecuting (in forma pauperis) the appeal from the sentence at the first trial. Nassar\u2019s counsel was competent to defend him. It was advantageous to have the attorney, who had defended Nassar at the first trial, act also at the second trial. Substitution of new counsel at the outset of the second trial would have caused delay and inconvenience, as well as substantial expense to the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The trial judge denied the motion for appointment because of Rule 95 of the Superior Court (1954) which requires that, in a capital case, appointed counsel have ten years\u2019 experience at the bar. Nassar\u2019s counsel, although competent, did not have the ten years of experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">We do not suggest that, in a case of original appointment of counsel, Rule 95 should not be applied to limit appointments in capital cases to attorneys of ten years\u2019 experience. In the circumstances of this second trial, however, the rule may operate to deny just compensation to counsel, who has performed necessary services. Although the trial judge by himself properly declined to disregard the rule, we are of the opinion that, in the circumstances, the interests of justice require that this court, in the exercise of its general supervisory and statutory powers, authorize the trial judge (or if he should not be available, any judge of the Superior Court designated by the Chief Justice of that court) to select Nassar\u2019s attorney as appointed counsel and in his discretion to order compensation paid to him. See G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, as amended through St. 1956, c. 707, \u00a7 1; c. 277, \u00a7\u00a7 55, 56; <em>Grady </em>v. <em>Treasurer of the County of Worcester, </em>352 Mass. 702, 703-704; <em>Abodeely </em>v. <em>County of Worcester, </em>352 Mass. 719, 722-725. This may be done nunc pro tune upon renewal of the prior request for appointment,.supplemented as the judge of the Superior Court hearing the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>quest may order. The facts found by the trial judge concerning this request, as printed in the present record, are to be taken as established.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">\u2022 11. The judgment is affirmed. In the Superior Court there may be further proceedings concerning the appointment and compensation of Nassar\u2019s counsel as indicated in the preceding paragraph (part 10 of this opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b295-39\"><em> Nassar </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>341 Mass. 584, dealt with a wholly different series of events. The reversal in the first <em>Nassar </em>case, 351 Mass. 37, was based largely upon error in receiving certain ambiguous alleged admissions by Nassar, which tended to show accusation of a prior similar crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b296-8\"> As amended through St. 1963, c. 187, \u00a7 29, provides, in a capital case, for twelve peremptory challenges plus one extra for each of the four additional jurors, empanelled under c. 234, \u00a7 26B, as amended by St. 1965, c. 355, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b297-5\"> Section 28 reads, \u201cUpon motion of either party, the court shall, or the parties or their attorneys may under the direction of the court, examine on oath a person who is called as a juror therein, to learn whether he is related to either party_ or has any interest in the case, or has expressed or formed an opinion, or is sensible of any bias or prejudice, therein; and the objecting party may introduce other competent evidence in support of the objection. If the court finds that the juror does not stand indifferent in the case, another shall be called in his stead.\u201d See also G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 3, which reads, \u201cA person whose opinions are such as to preclude him from finding a defendant guilty of a crime punishable with death shall not serve as a juror on the trial of an indictment for such crime.\u201d Section 3 has been in effect since 1836. See Rev. Sts. c. 137, \u00a7 6. No explanation of its adoption is set out in the Report of the Commissioners on the Revision of the Statutes (1836), part IV, pp. 54-55.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b299-8\"><em> </em>The judge\u2019s correct view of the relevant law is shown by part of his initial explanation of the process of jury selection to the whole venire. He said, \u201c [I]t is the [Massachusetts] law . . . that murder in the first degree without recommendation by the jury that the sentence of death be not imposed is punishable by death. Now, if you have any opinion against capital punishment, then you must ask yourself whether that opinion would conscientiously prevent you from finding a defendant guilty should you be convinced of his guilt, upon the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, of the crime of murder in the first degree. It may be that some of you would prefer that the laws . . . should be changed to abolish capital punishment, but that opinion . . . does not, standing by itself, preclude you from serving as jurors. Other jurors have entertained such belief, yet have courageously and fairly discharged their duties . . . uninfluenced by their private beliefs. It is only when a juror could not . . . [in] any circumstances, notwithstanding the evidence and its strength, find a defendant guilty of an offense punishable by death that hejs ineligible to serve,\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b300-6\"> One juror was excused who could \u201conly accept a guilty finding . . . with life imprisonment as against death\u201d and did not \u201cknow how . . . [he] would react\u201d in trying a crime of great atrocity. One was excused who could not render a verdict of guilty in the first degree. Another was excused whose opinion seems to have been based upon a preconception of guilt or innocence rather than on the death penalty. Two members of the venire had opinions which \u201cwould interfere with . . . rendering an impartial _ verdict on the <em>evidence.\u201d </em>Another person excused was unusually indefinite in answering questions. On the other hand, the final juror seated was one who stated that he did not \u201cbelieve in capital punishment,\u201d and who, if he \u201cthought . . . [the defendant was guilty, would vote] life imprisonment,\" but who denied that his opinion was such that it would interfere with an impartial verdict on the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b301-8\"> The Supreme Court of the United States has granted certiorari to consider on constitutional grounds an issue much like that discussed above. See <em>Bumper </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>389 U. S. 1034 (to review 270 N. C. 521); <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>389 U. S. 1035 (to review 36 Ill. 2d 471, 475-476). We decide this case with recognition that our decision may be affected by the decision in the two Supreme Court cases. Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>245 Cal. App. 2d 112, 138, cert, granted only on other issues, 389 U. S. 968. Cf. also <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Bounds, Warden, </em>395 F. 2d 297 (4th Cir.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b301-9\"> A closely similar situation would exist if a prospective juror should declare that he would not enforce any other criminal statute for violation of which a defendant was being tried. Such a person in effect would be prepared to substitute his judgment of the public interest for that of the Legislature. To exclude from jury service such persons seems to us to differ completely from discriminatory exclusion of a whole group, because of race, religion, economic status, national origin, background, or similar broad characteristics. As the judge appears to have interpreted G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 3 (fn. 3), he has excused jurors only because individually their strong beliefs prevented them from acting impartially on an issue to be brought before them. There is, of course, no occasion now to consider any problems which may conceivably be presented in a case where, upon a first degree murder conviction, a jury has not recommended that the death penalty be not imposed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b303-9\"> She had already testified that she understood \u201cthe significance of . . . [her] identifying . . . Nassar as the man who committed the brutal homicide\" (words used by his counsel in his question). As this was a second trial of a case, in which at the first trial a death sentence had been imposed, she could hardly have failed to know the importance of her testimony. The record shows no basis for suggesting that Mrs. Buote entertained any bias except such opinion about Nassar\u2019s guilt as might be based on her belief that she saw him commit a murder. The question was not an apt one to elicit information concerning whether she was relying on other evidence to buttress her identification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b304-7\"> Diane then indicated that one of the assailant\u2019s eyes \u201cdidn\u2019t line up.\u201d She, despite her mother\u2019s failure to observe this, stuck to this point at all stages. The jury during trial were given opportunity to observe Nassar, in this respect as in others.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b304-8\"> He then had no experience in the use of photographs in identification; he was not ordinarily assigned to investigations; he had never \u201cworked in the detective division\u201d; he had not \u201cbeen briefed as to the state of the investigation,\u201d and he knew that Detective Lieutenant Leary of the State Police was ordinarily assigned to the district attorney to head homicide investigations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b305-7\"> The photograph introduced in evidence at this trial was a double picture, profile and front face, of Nassar of a type frequently used in police files.

The evidence indicated that the vehicle had been stolen from a Cambridge parking lot at a time when it contained two guns and ammunition.
