The action was brought against two defendants, Amelio T. Danello, Jr. and George A. Torosian. It was first tried in the remand session of the District Court of Western Norfolk. The judge there found for the plaintiffs against the defendant Danello and in favor of the defendant Torosian. Thereafter the case was tried to a jury in the Superior Court. Torosian filed a motion for a directed verdict which was denied. The jury returned a verdict against both Danello and Torosian. Torosian filed a motion for a new trial which was denied. The case is here on Torosian\u2019s exceptions to the denial of his motion for a directed verdict and to the denial of his motion for \u00e1 new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">We summarize the evidence most favorable to the plaintiffs. The automobile in which the plaintiffs were riding was traveling in the right hand lane of a State highway at a speed of thirty-five or forty miles an hour. The plaintiffs saw the headlights of Danello\u2019s car approaching from the opposite direction, on the wrong side of the road. The plaintiff Ines R. Diomedes (Ines), who was driving, \u201cslowed down and stopped.\u201d Danello\u2019s car, which had been travel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>ing at a high rate of speed, skidded into the front of the plaintiffs\u2019 car at an angle. \u201c[A]lmost at the same time,\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 car was struck in the rear by the car driven by Torosian. There was extensive damage to both the front and rear of the automobile in which the plaintiffs were riding. Torosian was traveling some 150 feet behind the plaintiff\u2019s car at a similar speed, thirty-five or forty miles an hour. Torosian \u201csaw a car flash across the road in front of the car in front of us\u201d but thought that the car \u201cwas pulling into a road or driveway.\u201d He \u201csaw the brake lights of the car in front of us come on\u201d but \u201cthought she was just putting on her brakes to slow down.\u201d He then \u201capplied his brakes not in an emergency attitude, but as if one . . . [were] approaching a red light 100 feet away and slowed down.\u201d The plaintiff Mary Delfino (Mary) \u201cgot tossed frontwards and backwards\u201d by the first impact \u201cand then there was another car that hit from behind and that was when she went upwards; that she went into the windshield and got deep cuts across her nose over her eye requiring 28 stitches for her face.\u201d The plaintiff Anita Danello (Anita) saw the Danello car approaching and \u201cbraced herself with her hands and turned her face to the left to protect her face and as she turned to the left she saw another car coming from the rear and that was when she heard the first crash which threw her backward like and the second crash felt herself going up hitting the windshield.\u201d Anita required \u201c54 stitches across the face.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Torosian contends that \u201cNo evidence of [his] negligence ... is shown on this record having any causal relationship to the injuries of the plaintiffs.\u201d We do not agree. The recited facts include sufficient evidence from which the jury could find that the defendant failed to exercise due care in avoiding a collision with the plaintiffs\u2019 car. Torosian, in the District Court, testified that he thought he could have stopped within twenty or twenty-five feet at the speed he was then traveling. Yet he did not stop within 150 feet after he saw the*' brake lights of the car ahead. The facts bear some resemblance to those in the case of <em>Jennings </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number><em>Bragdon, </em>289 Mass. 595, and the evidence here, as there, is more than the \u201cIXJlight evidence of the circumstances\u201d which \u201cmay place the fault\u201d for a rear end collision. Page 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Torosian contends that there is no evidence to show that the plaintiffs\u2019 car, which was pushed backward by the initial impact, was not impelled into the front of his car, and not vice versa. Ines and Mary testified that the car in which they were riding was struck from behind, and the jury had before them photographs of the damaged vehicle. From this evidence the jury could find that Torosian\u2019s car ran into that of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Torosian further contends that \u201cThe plaintiffs have not shown beyond mere conjecture any injuries caused by . . . [his] conduct.\u201d He argues that the two impacts did not cause a single injury to the plaintiffs which would make him \u201cjointly and equally liable with Danello,\u201d and that the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery against him must be limited to injuries resulting from his own negligence. That there were two impacts separated by a brief interval does not, we believe, preclude concurrent liability. While mere nearness in time may not suffice to fix joint liability, the issue is whether \u201cthere was only one accident after all and it was caused by the combined negligence\u201d of the two tortfeasors. <em>Sluckus </em>v. <em>Fraktman, </em>322 Mass. 379, 384. There was evidence in the instant case that the plaintiffs were \u201ctossed\u201d around in their automobile, with two of them finally striking the windshield after the second collision. It is almost impossible to determine which injuries were due to Torosian\u2019s negligence and which injuries were caused by the conduct of Danello. It was, therefore, reasonable for the jury to conclude, in effect, that this was essentially one accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Since there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that Torosian was negligent and that as a result the plaintiffs, who were in the exercise of due care, were injured, there was no error in the denial of the motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">In regard to the denial of his motion for a new trial, Torosian makes essentially the same argument that he makes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>with reference to the denial of his motion for a directed verdict. As we have pointed out above, there was evidence that certain injuries were the result of the second impact, and the jury were entitled to conclude that Torosian was in part responsible for all of the injuries in what was essentially a single accident.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The assessment of damages against Torosian was therefore not merely speculative. In any event, a motion for a new trial is addressed to the discretion of the trial judge. <em>Bresnahan </em>v. <em>Proman, </em>312 Mass. 97, 101-102. There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b443-12\"> Torosian maintains that the charge given by the trial judge \u201cprecludes\u201d the jury from finding that \u201cDanella, Jr., and Torosian were joint tortfeasors or that their acts combined to produce a single injury.\u201d The judge instructed the jury that \u201cif you reach the question the defendant Torosian is responsible and come to the assessment of damages . . ., the plaintiffs have the burden of proving the damages were sustained as the result of the negligence of the defendant Torosian.\u201d We do not interpret this instruction as precluding a finding that damages were sustained as the result of Torosian\u2019s negligence in concurrence with that of the other defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
