The plaintiff brought this action of tort, the declaration in which contained two counts, one alleging negligence, and the other gross negligence. The judge directed a verdict for the defendant on the count for gross negligence, to which action no exception was taken. The count for negligence was submitted to the jury, who returned a verdict for the plaintiff. The case comes here on the defendant\u2019s exception to the denial of his motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-13\">We summarize the evidence as follows. At the time of the accident, the plaintiff (then unmarried) and the defendant were friends. The plaintiff and the defendant had been \"going steady\u201d for about two years, \"maybe a little bit more.\u201d When asked if she and the defendant were engaged, the plaintiff replied, \"No, not officially.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>the period of their friendship, \u201cthere were occasions when the defendant allowed her to use his car, and there were occasions when she . . . perforated] various duties for him.\u201d She had used the car two or three days before the accident. On the day of the accident the defendant \u201cpicked her up\u201d at her house. They then \u201cpicked up\u201d a friend of the plaintiff, and proceeded to the home of a friend of the defendant where the defendant got out. The defendant told the plaintiff \u201cto pick him up a can of spray paint.\u201d The plaintiff replied, \u201cO.K.\u201d; \u201c. . . [she] was going to go shopping anyhow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">While driving to Zayre\u2019s, where the plaintiff was going to buy the paint, she heaid a \u201cthumping noise.\u201d She put the car in neutral,\u201d shut off the engine, pulled up the emergency brake, and got out. As she passed in the rear of the car, \u201cthe emergency brake let go,\u201d and the car backed into her, pinning her down.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the plaintiff had a set of car keys of her own, she could not use the car any time she wished. The plaintiff testified that when she went to Zayre\u2019s to buy the paint, she \u201cwas probably going to look around . . . [there] for [herself] . . . just look around and browse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The plaintiff bases her right to recover on ordinary negligence. To recover on this ground there must be proof that the plaintiff had acquired the status of an invitee by \u201cconferring a benefit in the performance of something in which the defendant has an interest provided the benefit is other than \u2018those intangible advantages arising from mere social intercourse.\u2019\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Goldstein, </em>329 Mass. 161, 165. A \u201cmember of a family or household group or group of acquaintances rendering friendly help in household routine or commonplace tasks to another member of the group does not cease to be a licensee or social visitor unless the character or circumstances of the assistance make it clearly the dominant aspect of the relationship rather than a routine incident of social or group activities.\u201d <em>Pandiscio </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>342 Mass. 435, 437-438. Whether a case falls on one side of the line <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>or the other is sometimes difficult to determine. See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Goldstein, supra, </em>where numerous cases are collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">In the case at bar a majority of the court think it was a question of fact for the jury whether the plaintiff\u2019s undertaking to buy paint for the defendant was the dominant aspect of her trip so as to make it something more than a mere routine \u201crendering [of] friendly help.\u201d The defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict was rightly denied. Compare <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Myers, infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b173-14\"> Since this action was brought the plaintiff has married one Jones and the writ and declaration were amended to describe her by her married name, Ida M. Jones.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b174-7\"> Evidence as to the condition of the brake has been omitted, for the defendant concedes that this evidence warranted a finding of negligence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
