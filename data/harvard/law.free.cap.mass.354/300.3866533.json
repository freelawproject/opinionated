He submitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>the jury the special question \u201c[w]hether . . . [the defendant] entered into a contract with Ralph Letizia.\u201d The jury answered in the negative and the judge directed a verdict for the defendant on the count in contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">The evidence permitted the jury to find as follows. Condon in February, 1961, was arranging to end his insurance business in Rhode Island where he had been special agent of a fire insurance company in charge of all selling activities of that company. He began working for the defendant in Worcester on March 5, 1961. Before mid-February, 1961, Fenton Batton, an insurance adjuster who was a friend of Letizia and was acting for Letizia, called Condon at his home in Rhode Island and asked him to write fire insurance on Letizia\u2019s business in Condon\u2019s company. Condon said he would bind it and that he had done so. In mid-February, 1961, Batton called Condon, asked about Letizia\u2019s fire insurance and was told that Condon\u2019s company would not insure that risk. When Batton said he would place the insurance elsewhere Condon said, \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be necessary. . . . I\u2019m going into business with Taiman &amp; Johnson and I will bind this insurance right over with them immediately. The companies we will use will be Travelers and The Preferred Mutual.\u201d After Condon entered the defendant\u2019s employ Batton had at least two conversations with him. The first resulted from Batton\u2019s calling Condon at his home and Condon returning the call the next day \u201cfrom Worcester.\u201d In each conversation Batton asked, \u201cWhere are the insurance policies?\u201d and each time Condon replied that they had been written but because of the new job and for other reasons they had not been mailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">In the defendant\u2019s employ Condon was paid a salary but no commissions and had authority to solicit business and sell insurance but could not commit the defendant to any particular policies nor bind insurance. The defendant was not licensed to do business in Rhode Island. It was the defendant\u2019s practice to notify a customer immediately if the defendant was unable to place the desired insurance. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>the fire loss on April 14, 1961, Batton at Letizia\u2019s request called Condon at the defendant\u2019s office, reported the loss and asked Condon if he wanted Batten\u2019s office to handle the loss. Condon, replied in the affirmative and left the telephone to get his \u201cdailies\u201d as Batton requested but did not return to the telephone. \u201cMr. Dwyer,\u201d not identified beyond his name, came on the telephone and said, \u201cWe couldn\u2019t place that risk.\u201d Batton asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d Dwyer replied, \u201cWe just couldn\u2019t\u201d and to the further question, \u201cTo what companies did you try?\u201d he said, \u201cWhat difference does that make?\u201d and \u201cslammed up\u201d the telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The conversation in February as a result of which Batton, for Letizia, understood that the policy had been written has only background significance. Condon was not in the defendant\u2019s employ at the time. His undertaking to place insurance with the defendant could not have been found to bind the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">There is no evidence that any other contractual undertaking was made at any time by anyone. We assume that Dwyer\u2019s remarks were some evidence that the defendant had at some time dealt with the issue whether a policy could be obtained on Letizia\u2019s property. But it is conjectural whether this was because of a request made by Condon before or after he entered the defendant\u2019s employ and, in any event, considering at Condon\u2019s request whether a policy could be obtained would not show an undertaking to Letizia to insure him.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">There was, however, a basis for a recovery in tort under count 2 or count 3. The jury could have found that Batton\u2019s inquiries to Condon in March were made to him as the defendant\u2019s employee rather than to a friend who had undertaken to accommodate Letizia, and that it was within the actual as well as the apparent authority of Condon as an employee with power to solicit business and to sell insurance to represent whether policies had been procured by that office. What Condon said could have been found to have included by implication a representation that the defendant had accepted the business and had caused policies to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>written so that Letizia was insured. <em>Robichaud </em>v. <em>Athol Credit Union, </em>352 Mass. 351, 354-355.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Express testimony of reliance on the representation was not required. <em>Rayden Engr. Corp. </em>v. <em>Church, </em>337 Mass. 652, 660. That Batton testified that if he had not been told in February that the policies were bound he would have gotten insurance elsewhere does not negative the inescapable implication that if Condon had told the truth in March, Letizia, or Batton for him, would have acted then to protect Letizia.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">That the jury found that there was no contract suggests, as the defendant contends, that they would have found for the defendant in tort also. But the issues are not the same and we cannot rule that there was no error in taking the case in tort from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained as to the counts in tort.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant on the count in contract.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
