The petitioners are \u201ccitizens of, resident's in, and registered voters of the Town of Hopkinton.\u201d They allege that they are \u201caggrieved by erroneous rulings of law and unreasonable . . . action\u201d by the respondent board under the earth removal by-law of the town. The petitioners seek to have rescinded a permit issued by the board to the respondent Louis A. Drowne for \u201cearth removal operations\u201d on land belonging to him in the town of Hopkinton. The case was heard on the petition, the return of the respondent board, and the answer and return of the respondents Drowne and Pyne Sand &amp; Stone Co., Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">The petitioners allege that under the permit the \u201cstripping of loam and topsoil from the locus . . . will produce disagreeable dust and noise . . ., will leave a desert area . . ., will permanently destroy the soil . . . and leave the locus valueless . . ., and that the effect of such unsightly waste in a residential . . . community will be permanently to depress values of other lands in the neighborhood and to render them less desirable for homes . . ..\u201d The petitioners also allege \u201cthat the truck hauling requirements of said operation . . . will impose an undue burden upon the streets . . ., will create undue traffic hazards . . .,\u201d and will impose upon the \u201ctownspeople the economic burden of widening and relocating roads and streets . . .\u201d; and that \u201cthere is ... a clear and present danger\u201d that new permits will issue \u201cand the process . . . [wilT] be repeated upon tract after tract of agricultural and residential land . . .\u201d with disastrous results to the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>In essence, the petitioners\u2019 allegation is that the permit in question allows the operation of a \u201cgravel pit\u201d on the respondent Drowne\u2019s land; that a gravel pit is not a use permitted anywhere in the town of Hopkinton by the zoning by-law; that the earth removal by-law by its express terms cannot \u201camend, repeal or supersede the Zoning By-Law\u201d; and that the board of selectmen consequently committed an error of law in issuing the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\u201cIt is the general rule that resort cannot be had to certiorari unless the action of the tribunal of which a review is sought has resulted in substantial injury or manifest injustice to the petitioner.\u201d <em>North Shore Corp. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Topsfield, </em>322 Mass. 413, 418, and cases cited. In the instant case the allegations are speculative and the damage alleged is generalized. The petitioners allege that their properties abut the streets over which the trucks will travel, and we might infer that their land is somewhere near the locus. But it does not appear from the petition how close their properties lie to the locus or how they are substantially injured beyond the hypothetical injuries to the town of Hopkinton as a whole. The principal error alleged is in effect a violation of the zoning by-law. We are not persuaded that if this can be shown the petitioners have no other remedy. <em>Fino </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the City of Boston, </em>326 Mass. 277. <em>Cliff </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Amesbury, </em>343 Mass. 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">At the hearing on the petition, the trial judge ruled that the petitioners could not submit testimony or other extrinsic evidence in support of their petition. In view of what we have said above it is unnecessary to pass on the correctness of this ruling. It is likewise unnecessary to discuss the denial of the petitioners\u2019 motion to strike portions of the answer and return of two of the respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">\n<em>Order dismissing petition affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
