L. c. 151B, in respect of the renting of an apartment at 105 Charlton Street, South-bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">The Commission after a hearing made extensive findings and concluded that LaPierre had refused to negotiate in good faith and had withheld the apartment because of Cruz's national origin. It ordered, inter aha, that LaPierre desist from withholding the apartment and offer it to the Cruzes. It was stipulated before the Commission that Segundo Cruz is Puerto Rican.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">General Laws c. 151B, \u00a7 4, as amended through St. 1963, c. 197, \u00a7 2, provides, \u201cIt shall be an unlawful practice: . . . 7. For the owner ... of other covered housing accommodations ... (a) to refuse to rent or lease ... or negotiate for . . . lease or otherwise deny to or withhold from any person . . . such accommodations . . . because of the race, creed, color, national origin, or national ancestry of such person . . ..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">The apartment appears to be, as the Commission found, within the meaning of \u201cother covered housing accommodations.\u201d See c. 151B, \u00a7 1, par. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">LaPierre filed a petition for review xmder G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 6, and c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (8). A judge in the Superior Court ruled that the findings, the conclusions of law, andfthe orders were unsupported by substantial evidence and remanded the cause to the Commission. The Commission, after hearing counsel, in \u201cconsideration of all the evidence\u201d reaffirmed its prior findings and conclusions of law, and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>order. On a second petition for review, a final decree was entered in the Superior Court ruling as before (\u201cunsupported by substantial evidence\u201d). The decree ordered that the Commission dismiss the complaints against LaPierre.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">This appeal by the Commission to this court affords review \u201cin the same manner and form and with the same effect as in appeals from a final order or decree in proceedings in equity.\u201d G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 6. The issues are whether there was substantial evidence of refusal to rent or to negotiate and whether this was because of Cruz\u2019s \u201cnational origin\u201d within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">1. The conclusion of refusal to negotiate with the Cruzes in good faith and to rent to them was supported by substantial evidence. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (8) (e). <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>342 Mass. 45, 47, and cases cited. Compare <em>Sinclair </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>331 Mass. 101, 102; <em>Singer Sewing Mach. Co. </em>v. Assessors <em>of Boston, </em>341 Mass. 513, 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The findings, with support in the evidence, including testimony by LaPierre, tend to show that he did not negotiate with the Cruzes as he did with others in the same period; if he had done so he would have rented the apartment to them; he sought to avoid any occasion for negotiation; and he postponed declaring a decision as to renting by insisting, not in good faith, on a credit check. In the following summary we state the findings only, except where the testimony is expressly referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Prior to October, 1965, Mrs. Cruz learned of LaPierre\u2019s offering for rent an apartment in his six apartment building at 105 Charlton Street, Southbridge, went to the premises, and was shown the apartment by a tenant of another apartment. Mrs. Cruz then telephoned to and made several trips to LaPierre\u2019s place of business. Each time she talked with LaPierre\u2019s foreman. He told her that he did not have the keys and she would have to see LaPierre. Each time she telephoned he said he would have to speak with LaPierre who was not in. LaPierre was out of town a good deal and the.foreman accepted inquiries, sometimes showed the places <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>that were for rent and left written messages for LaPierre.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The foreman left written messages concerning Mrs. Cruz\u2019s inquiring for LaPierre who never returned the calls. LaPierre denied receiving the messages. The testimony of Mrs. Cruz as to the calls is corroborated in important aspects by the foreman<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who had continued in LaPierre\u2019s employ and had not heard LaPierre\u2019s contrary testimony. The Commission of course was not obliged to accept LaPierre\u2019s testimony and could weigh his denial on the issue of his good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">In the week of October 12 (a Tuesday), from the home of her sister, Mrs. Gloria Grzembski, Mrs. Cruz again called the \u201cLaPierre Mill Works\u201d and spoke to a man who told her she would have to speak to LaPierre and that he was out. Immediately thereafter Mrs. Grzembski called the works, inquired about the vacant apartment, and talked with the foreman who told her he would make arrangements for her to see the apartment. Later that day she received a call from LaPierre himself who asked if she was interested in the apartment. She replied that she was, but would have to discuss it with her husband. She asked if she could have the apartment if she wanted it, and LaPierre said that she could. No reference was made to credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">These findings are based on the testimony of Mrs. Grzemb-ski corroborated in substantial part by the other persons concerned. The foreman recalled that Mrs. Grzembski had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>called and testified that he had \u201cprobably\u201d left a note on LaPierre\u2019s desk. LaPierre testified that he got a message that Mrs. Grzembski had called for an apartment and \u201cthat same day . . . [he]] was in town\u201d and that he called her, described the apartment at 105 Charlton Street, and stated the rent ($17 a week payable monthly); he testified that she said she would have to speak to her husband and that he told her that if she was interested he would show her the apartment. Later he testified that he told her she could have the apartment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">On or about October 15, 1965, Mrs. Shirley Snitzer, Chairman of the Fair Housing Committee of Southbridge, Sturbridge and Webster, inquired of LaPierre about the availability of the apartment at 105 Charlton Street, telling him that she wanted to look at the apartment for her cousin. LaPierre told her that it was still available and that it would take two or three days to fix it up. He gave her the key and told her that it would rent for $17 a week. Mrs. Snitzer thereafter drove Cruz and his wife to the apartment and inspected it with Mrs. Cruz.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The three then drove to LaPierre\u2019s mill and Mrs. Cruz and Mrs. Snitzer went in and saw LaPierre and his foreman. Mrs. Snitzer told LaPierre that Mrs. Cruz was the cousin for whom she wanted the apartment. Mrs. Cruz was not, in fact, Mrs. Snitzer\u2019s cousin. Mrs. Cruz identified herself as \u201cMrs. Segundo Cruz,\u201d told LaPierre that she wanted the apartment, and offered to place a $20 deposit on it. He declined to take the deposit, giving as his reasons that the apartment was not ready, that he would have to do a credit check on her and that the rent would be at a monthly rate. Mrs. Snitzer gave LaPierre her address and telephone number and asked him to call her as soon as he decided to let Mrs. Cruz have the apartment. LaPierre did not request any information of a personal nature from Mrs. Cruz. He did not call Mrs. Snitzer.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">After complaint had been filed with the Commission on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>October 19, 1965, and during a visit from a field representative of the Commission, LaPierre consented to accept a deposit and stated that he wanted to run a credit check. He had a credit check run on the Cruzes by his local bank and about a month later he wrote to the complainants telling them that he deemed their credit unsatisfactory and that he would not rent them the apartment. The Commission excluded from evidence the contents of the credit report. At no time and for no other tenant or prospective tenant had LaPierre run a credit check.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">LaPierre contends that the absence of a credit check of others was of no significance; that his testimony shows that he had had few vacancies; that most of the tenants had been local people whom he knew; and that in the previous July, when he concluded he would have to evict tenants who owed back rent, he decided that he would take more precautions. The testimony as to the absence of requests to others for credit references is, however, to be read with the testimony of how LaPierre acted in respect of the Cruz credit check. So read, it supports the conclusion of a refusal to negotiate in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The evidence tended to show the following: It was only after LaPierre, on October 15, had learned Mrs. Cruz\u2019s name, that he said, inter alla, that he would take no deposit from anyone until the apartment was all fixed up and that he wanted a credit check. In the conference with the field representative on the next Tuesday, October 19, LaPierre said, \u201cShe\u2019s never come back with the deposit . . . and if her credit checks out she can have the apartment.\u201d He asked the investigator, \u201c[w]ill you give me two weeks . . . [to make the credit check] [b]ecause I am out of town five days a week. . . . [I]f you give me a couple of weeks, I will get it done and I will call and let you know.\u201d Mrs. Cruz promptly called at the mill office, paid a $68 deposit and left a list of credit references, including two banks and a jeweler. LaPierre received the fist on the next Friday and at some time checked two of the references. Arch Jeweler said she had just bought a vacuum cleaner and made two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>payments. The Webster bank said that all they could say was \u201cshe has a loan on an automobile.\u201d They did not say it was in default. There was evidence that it was not. There was no indication of an effort to check with Cruz\u2019s employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The field representative called LaPierre on November 2, 1965, and asked when the apartment would be available for Mrs. Cruz. LaPierre, as he testified, replied that he had not made a credit check yet and he \u201cintended to do it as soon as . . . [lie] could get to it\u201d and he would notify Mrs. Cruz when he got the credit report. He told the investigator, as the latter recalled, that he was not sure when he could do it \u201cbecause of his problem he was having in Vermont.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">LaPierre called the Southbridge Credit Bureau but found he had to be a member in order to get a report. He then called his own bank. When the bank asked why he wanted the information he replied, as he testified, \u201cI have been told that I have discriminated this person and . . . that I got 20 days to check her credit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">2. The second issue is whether there is support for the conclusion that the refusal to negotiate and to rent was because LaPierre knew that Cruz is Puerto Rican.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">The Commission ruled that illegal conduct had been shown in what happened prior to October 19.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But the Commission\u2019s express findings as to what LaPierre knew and why he acted in a discriminatory way as of that date clearly go beyond the evidence. The Commission found: \u201c12. The respondent [LaPierre] knew that the complainant, Segundo Cruz, was Puerto Rican at the time of the commission of the unlawful act. The respondent declined to respond in his usual way to telephone messages from Mrs. Cruz which were left him by bis foreman because he knew Segundo Cruz was Puerto Rican. The sole reason for respondent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>denying the complainant\u2019s rental of the apartment in question was that Segundo Cruz was Puerto Rican.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">On the subsidiary findings it appears that, prior to the conference with the field representative on October 19, LaPierre knew as to the possible ethnic classification of the applicant and her husband only the name Segundo Cruz. That name, the Commission could conclude, may have suggested the possibility that Cruz was of Puerto Rican origin. LaPierre\u2019s testimony about the interview shows a significant distinction in his mind between Puerto Ricans and persons who are \u201cwhite.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Discrimination because of the name Segundo Cruz is suggested by the evidence of unwillingness even to talk about renting with a woman who gave that name and the contrasting evidence of willingness to rent without a credit check to two unseen persons identified only by name or a supposed cousin\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">We assume that evidence justifying a conclusion of a refusal to rent because of suspected national origin, later established, may be ruled to be refusal to rent because of national origin. On this issue evidence of consistent conduct of LaPierre after he had credible information of national origin, such as is shown here, is relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">But, as noted, the Commission based its conclusion and its order on the findings that LaPierre knew that Cruz was a Puerto Rican when illegal acts were done before October 19. The only refusal to rent by LaPierre when in fact he had such knowledge was in the November, 1965, letter after the credit check. If LaPierre\u2019s knowledge was to be the basis of the conclusion and order, his knowledge at the time of that letter, including the credit report, was relevant. If the conclusion and order were to be based on other findings justified by the evidence they should have been stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">There is an additional reason why the Commission should have weighed LaPierre\u2019s acts in the light of his knowledge after the credit report. The process adopted by the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>mission\u2019s agents to show illegal discrimination included the field investigator\u2019s interview. Although LaPierre was then informed that Cruz was Puerto Bican he had already committed himself to a credit check. A reversal of position by LaPierre at that time would have appeared as an acceptance of the charge of illegal discrimination even if it was in fact otherwise based. The investigator on October 19 agreed that LaPierre should have a stated period to pursue the course he had embarked on. In the circumstances, the Commission, in judging LaPierre\u2019s conduct, should include what happened in the stated period.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">We do not suggest that adverse information in the report would necessarily point to a finding that the report was the bona fide basis of a refusal to rent,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or that there was not illegal discrimination, even prior to October 19. Nor do we suggest that the device of a credit report will be a means for those who wish to discriminate to escape the reasonable implications of discriminatory acts. But there is here a lack of substantial evidence to support an important conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Although the findings in one aspect were, as stated, unsupported by substantial evidence, inasmuch as discrimination has been shown and it does not appear that it could not be found to be for an illegal reason, the case will be remanded to the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">3. The petitioner argues that the complaints must fail because both the complaints and the Commission\u2019s findings assert discrimination based upon national origin and Segundo Cruz, as Puerto Bican, is an American by national origin. General Laws c. 151B, \u00a7 4, par. 7 (b), forbids discrimination based upon \u201crace, creed, color, national origin or national ancestry.\u201d Implicit in the complaint and the Commission\u2019s findings is the fact that the Cruzes were discriminated against because of Segundo Cruz\u2019s ancestry. The com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>plaints, although carelessly drawn, were sufficient to notify LaPierre of the nature of the charges against him and to bring the issues before the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The term, \u201cnational origin,\u201d is a broad one, adequate, unless controlled by the context, to include national ancestry. It has been defined to include national ancestry. See Webster\u2019s Third New Intl. Dictionary (1961), 1591. An early use in Federal legislation was in the Immigration Act of 1924 (now repealed). \u201c. . . [N]ational origin shall be ascertained by determining ... in respect of each geographical area which ... is to be treated as a separate country . . . the number of inhabitants . . . [of the United States] whose origin <em>by birth or ancestry </em>is attributable to such geographical area\u201d (emphasis supplied). 43 Stat. 153, c. 190, \u00a7 11 (c), May 26, 1924. New York Consol. Laws, Executive Law, \u00a7 292, par. 8, states, \u201cThe term \u2018national origin\u2019 shall, for the purposes of this article, include \u2018ancestry.\u2019\u201d The same definition is used in Administrative Code of the City of New York, \u00a7 Bl-2.0, par. 8, cited in 11 Race Rel. Rep. No. 1, p. 468. Minnesota State Act Against Discrimination, Minn. Sts. Anno. c. 363.01, subdiv. 6, states: \u201c\u2018National origin\u2019 means the place of birth of an individual or any of his lineal ancestors.\u201d The Model Anti-Discrimination Act, \u00a7 201, (4) (Handbook of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws 1966), provides: \u201cnational origin includes the national origin of an ancestor.\u201d The Civil Rights Act of 1964 (78 Stat. 241), mentions national origin only. See \u00a7\u00a7 201 (a), 202, 401, 601, 701 (b), 7\u00d33 (title and several paragraphs), 704 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The Act (G. L. c. 151B) has been amended and added to a number of times and in certain aspects lacks precision and verbal consistency. It could not be consistent and reasonable in effect if the terms \u201cnational origin\u201d and \u201cnational ancestry\u201d are deemed mutually exclusive. Thus in \u00a7 4, par. 6 (also dealing with discrimination in renting real estate), the term \u201cnational origin\u201d alone is used. Paragraph 8 of the same section, inserted by St. 1965, c. 213, \u00a7 2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>makes it unlawful \u201c (1) To refuse to rent commercial space because of . . . national origin .... (2) To discriminate . . . because of . . . national origin or national ancestry in the terms . . . of . . . rental .... (3) [To make inquiries] . . . concerning the . . . national origin or national ancestry . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Section 9 of c. 151B, as amended through St. 1965, c. 397, \u00a7 7, provides: \u201cThe provisions of this chapter shall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of the purposes thereof . . ..\u201d We conclude that the use of the more limited term \u201cnational ancestry\u201d in the provisions does not restrict the scope of the preceding term \u201cnational origin,\u201d and that the complaints state an offence under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">4. The petitioner\u2019s brief contends that the proceedings before the Commission were invalidated by the admission of hearsay evidence. The Commission is not bound by the strict rules of evidence and appears to have refrained from making any express findings not based on evidence other than hearsay. In any case, the pertinent evidence was not exclusively or in important part hearsay. <em>Moran </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Littleton, </em>317 Mass. 591, 596-597. Compare <em>Sinclair </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>331 Mass. 101, 103. Our disposition of the case makes irrelevant the only hearsay which conceivably may have affected the ultimate findings.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The brief also lays stress on the untrue allegations or implications of Segundo Cruz\u2019s own complaint.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>vestigator having drawn a complaint to be signed by Mrs. Cruz and having reported by telephone to his superior in Boston was told that Cruz himself had to sign a complaint. He then typed the complaint and got Cruz to sign it. The implication of the complaint is that Cruz was with his wife and Mrs. Snitzer in the talk with LaPierre, whereas the evidence was that although he went to the building he did not go inside. It was improper to draw the complaint with such ambiguities and implications. But nothing in it would justify dismissing the complaint or charging Cruz with improper intent. He did not testify and no assumptions as to his comprehension of such a document are justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">5. The final decree is vacated. A decree shall enter remanding the cause to the Commission for further evidence as indicated in this opinion and findings in the light thereof and an appropriate order.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b212-7\"> LaPierre testified, \u201cMy man that runs my shop will take phone calls and wifi say either we have a four ... or a five-room-apartment and what the rent is. . . . And he is to take the name. ... I take the list of what I have got to do and, from there on in, it\u2019s my problem.\u201d The Commission: \u201cSo then, if Mrs. Cruz says that she called and she left her name with someone. . . .\u201d The witness: \u201cI should have had it. . . . I never received a message from Mrs. Cruz, and I never spoke to Mrs. Cruz until the day she came in with Mrs. Snitzer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b212-8\"> The foreman testified.

The respondent [LaPierre] had no basis for denying the complainants the apartment because of alleged unsatisfactory credit at the time of the illegal act. Only after the complaint had been filed . . . alleging the unlawful act did the respondent seek information regarding the complainant\u2019s credit.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b216-9\"> LaPierre testified regarding his interview with the field representative as follows: \u201cHe said, \u2018Did you know that she was married to a Puerto Rican?\u2019 I said, \u2018No. . . . When those two women came in, they were white . . . there was no Puerto Rican with her. There was no mention of Puerto Ricans ....\u2019\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b217-7\"> Although LaPierre appears to have excepted to the exclusion of the credit report, in his brief he contends only that it was \u201cwithin his rights\u201d as a landlord \u201cto protect his real estate investment\u201d and to advise the applicants that their credit references were unsatisfactory. The brief does not assert that the contents of the report were such as to make manifestly inappropriate or improper an order to rent the apartment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b219-7\"> The findings make no mention of hearsay evidence of two telephone conversations with a person at LaPierre\u2019s home (probably, on all the evidence, LaPierre\u2019s mother) which tended to suggest that LaPierre may have been acting in the belief that Cruz was Puerto Rican. In the absence of express subsidiary findings it is speculative whether the Commission improperly gave weight to this testimony in finding No. 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b219-8\"> \u201cI, Segundo Cruz, residing at 23 Elm Street, Webster, Massachusetts, charge Gerald J.
