The de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>fendant moved for dismissal of the indictment \u201cbecause the charge is unconstitutionally vague and indefinite, and because it inflicts cruel and unusual punishment.\u201d This motion and a motion for a directed verdict of not guilty were denied. The case is before us only on exceptions to these denials.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">On December 14, 1966, Lawrence MacNamara, a Boston police officer serving in the narcotics division, went with other officers to an apartment at 35 Revere Street with a search warrant. Jimmy Boyer Banks, \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>occupant and tenant of the premises,\u201d opened the door. The other officers \u201cwent . . . into the parlor with\u201d Banks. Officer MacNamara went into the kitchen. Buckley was seated at the kitchen table on which was a brown envelope, found later by analysis to contain marijuana, and a partly smoked, unlighted cigarette, also found later to contain marijuana. Buckley was placed under arrest. He stated that he had \u201carrived . . . a few minutes before the police.\u201d Banks and Buckley were the only persons in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">1. General Laws c. 94, \u00a7 213A (as amended through St. 1960, c. 204, \u00a7 2), is set out in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Buckley contends that the first provision (following [AJ in fn. 1) is unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">There has been little discussion of \u00a7 213A in our cases. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taber, </em>350 Mass. 186, was a prosecution under the third provision of \u00a7 213A concerning conspiracy (see fn. 1 at [C]). There was no occasion to consider the questions now before us. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>342 Mass. 393, an appeal from a conviction of violation of G. L. c. 271, \u00a7 17, as amended, there was passing reference (p. 397, fn. 1) to c. 94, \u00a7 213A. At pp. 396-397, we said, \u201cSubject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>to possible constitutional limitations as to the operation of a statute . . . the Legislature may determine what shall be deemed a 'public welfare offense\u2019 punishable notwithstanding innocent intent. . . . But an intention to create such an offence should appear in <em>clear and unambiguous </em>language\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Although \u00a7 213A was materially revised by St. 1960, c. 204, \u00a7 2, the language of the first clause as it appeared in St. 1957, c. 660, \u00a7 1 (p. 568), was not changed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 1957, however, \u00a7 213A authorized merely the arrest without a warrant of a person \"present\u201d where narcotics were. By the 1960 amendment, such presence was made a criminal offence.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The first clause of \u00a7 213A, if read literally, imposes strict criminal liability without regard to whether the accused had knowledge or mens rea. The provision cannot be construed as merely stating the circumstances which give rise to a prima facie case sufficient to establish guilt. Compare the statutes discussed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Douglas, ante, </em>212, 219-220, and cases cited. We thus first consider whether a literal reading of the section as a \"public welfare\u201d statute, imposing strict liability \"notwithstanding innocent intent,\u201d should be taken as reflecting the legislative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Statutes, purporting to create criminal offences which may \"impinge upon the public\u2019s access to constitutionally protected matter\u201d (see <em>Demetropolos </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>342 Mass. 658, 661), have been construed to require knowledge by the accused of the facts giving rise to criminality. Such an interpretation is in part, at least, to preserve interests protected under the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corey, </em>351 Mass. 331, 332-334. There is some indication that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment may\u00a1 require knowledge in a range of situations not limited to those which have First <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Amendment aspects. See <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>California, </em>355 U. S. 225, 228-230 (failure of a person who had previously been convicted of a felony to register as required by a city ordinance, where such person had no knowledge of the ordinance).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Generally, however, it has been held that the Legislature may make criminal an act or omission even where the person responsible has no \u201cblameworthy condition of the mind.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mixer, </em>207 Mass. 141, 142-143; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ober, </em>286 Mass. 25, 30; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>331 Mass. 166,168; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>342 Mass. 393, 396; Williams, Criminal Law, The General Part (2d ed.), \u00a7\u00a7 75-90, esp. at pp. 234-239, 250-254, 255-265; Perkins, Criminal Law, 692-712; Sayre, Public Welfare Offenses, 33 Col. L. Rev. 55; Hart, Aims of the Criminal Law, 23 Law and Contemporary Problems, 401, 422-425. See also Mr. Justice Jackson\u2019s discussion of \u201cpublic welfare\u201d or \u201cstrict liability\u201d offences in <em>Morissette </em>v. <em>United States, </em>342 U. S. 246, 250-273. There (at pp. 256-258) it is suggested that these are often offences where punishment is by \u201cpenalties commonly . . . relatively small\u201d and where \u201cconviction does no grave damage to an offender\u2019s reputation.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For other instances of public welfare offences, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Balint, </em>258 U. S. 250, 252-254; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dotterweich, </em>320 U. S. 277, 280-281. Cf. Borre, Public Welfare Offenses: A New Approach, 52 J. Crim. Law 418-422.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Section 213A permits the imposition of a severe penalty, as much as five years in prison. It hardly can be regarded as a minor offence. Thus it would take unusually clear legislative language to lead us to the view that knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>is not required for a conviction under the first clause (fn. 1 at [A]). In view of the <em>Lambert </em>case, 355 U. S. 225, any other interpretation would raise serious constitutional doubts. Indeed, in another jurisdiction a closely similar statute has been held invalid. <em>Seattle </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>54 Wash. 2d 655, 659-662. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Birdsell, </em>235 La. 396, 411-415. To avoid such possible constitutional doubts (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corey, </em>351 Mass. 331, 334; see also <em>Worcester County Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Banks, </em>340 Mass. 695, 701; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>341 Mass. 760, 785), we interpret the first clause of \u00a7 213A as requiring for a conviction proof that the accused was \u201cpresent where [he knew] a narcotic drug . . . [was] illegally kept or deposited.\u201d As in the situation discussed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holiday, </em>349 Mass. 126, 128, however, a \u201cperson\u2019s knowledge . . . like his intent, is a matter of fact, which may not be susceptible of proof by direct evidence. In that event resort must be had, and frequently is had, to proof by inference from all the facts and circumstances developed at the trial.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boris, </em>317 Mass. 309, 315 (\u201cresort frequently must be had to proof by inference\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">We recognize that the second clause of \u00a7 213A (see fn. 1 at [B]) expressly includes the word \u201cknowing,\u201d whereas the first clause does not. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>97 Mass. 567, 569. In view of the seriousness of the penalty which may be imposed under \u00a7 213A, we are unwilling to regard the omission from the first clause (of some word having an effect similar to that of \u201cknowing\u201d) as sufficiently indicating the Legislature\u2019s \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d intention to require no proof of knowledge in a prosecution under the first clause. See the <em>Murphy </em>case, 342 Mass. 393, 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>166 Mass. 370, 374-375 (presence where gaming instruments are found, that is, in a gaming house; St. 1895, c. 419), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kane, </em>173 Mass. 477, 481-482 (presence where instruments for smoking opium were found; St. 1895, c. 194), were mentioned in the <em>Murphy </em>case, 342 Mass. 393, 397. Those cases seem to us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>to be distinguishable from that before us. In those cases, also, knowledge may have been implied, in part at least, from the character of the particular places involved in those prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">2. Reading the first clause of \u00a7 213A as including a requirement that the accused be present where he knows a narcotic drug is illegally kept or deposited, we think that the words \u201c[wjhoever is present\u201d are not vague. These words, coupled with knowledge, do not import an unlimited area. The words must be given a reasonable interpretation which would permit the knowledge required to be proved. The language reasonably refers to a somewhat restricted space. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kane, </em>173 Mass. 477, 481-482.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">3. Buckley vaguely argues that (a) the first clause of the statute potentially interferes with the constitutional right of free association, and (b) that it imposes a cruel and unusual punishment. No such violation of constitutional interests can reasonably be found in view of the requirement in the first clause of \u00a7 213A, as interpreted by us, that there be proof of knowledge of facts constituting noncompliance with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">4. We are of opinion that there was ample evidence from which the jury could find violation of \u00a7 213A as we interpret it. The section is not invalidly vague on its face. There were no exceptions to the judge\u2019s charge or to any failure to give requested instructions. The jury reasonably could infer, from Buckley\u2019s presence at a table on which were found plainly visible marijuana and a half smoked marijuana cigarette, that he knew about these items.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">5. If in the trial court the case was tried on the theory that \u00a7 213A imposes strict liability without knowledge, this is ground for a motion for a new trial. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29, as amended through St. 1966, c. 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-8\"> Section 213A reads: \u201cWhoever [A] is <em>present </em>where a narcotic drug is <em>illegally kept or deposited, </em>or [B] whoever is in the company of a person, <em>knowing </em>that said person is illegally in possession of a narcotic drug, or [C] whoever conspires with another person to violate the narcotic drugs law, may be arrested without a warrant by an officer . . . whose duty it is .to enforce the narcotic drugs law, and may be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than five years, or by imprisonment in a . . . house of correction for not more than two years or by a fine of not less than five hundred dollars nor more than five thousand dollars\u201d (emphasis supplied). The letters in brackets are inserted to assist convenient reference to the language immediately following such letters, respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b554-8\"> The legislative history does not indicate why \u00a7 213A was inserted in the 1957 statute which contains many features of the Uniform Narcotics Drugs Act (see G. L. c. 94, \u00a7\u00a7 197-217D). That act contains no comparable provision. See Uniform Laws Annotated, vol. 9B, pp. 415, 423; 1957 House Bill No. 3072; 1957 Senate Bill No. 767; 1960 House Bills Nos. 2489, 2490.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b555-6\"> A later case, involving allegedly obscene materials, contains general language which may not be limited to prosecutions where there is some First Amendment consideration.
