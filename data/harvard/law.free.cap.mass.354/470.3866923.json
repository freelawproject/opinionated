Both \"counts allege that on or about May 10, 1966, the defendant was under contract with Boston Edison Company, the decedent\u2019s employer, to pay workmen\u2019s compensation under G. L. c. 152;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that the defendant assumed the duty to inspect the Edison premises and to assist in promoting safety for its employees; that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>defendant knew or should have known that this undertaking was for the protection of the employees, including the decedent; and that the defendant in negligently performing this undertaking violated its duty of care owed to the decedent, who, on or about May 10, 1966, as a result was electrocuted and killed. The defendant\u2019s demurrer for failure to state a cause of action was sustained, and leave to amend was denied. The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">As there was no allegation in the declaration that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate had given written notice to his employer of his claim of common law rights of action to recover damages for personal injuries arising out of and in the course of his employment, he must be taken (and it is not otherwise contended) to have given no such notice and to have waived such rights. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 24 (as amended through St. 1955, c. 174, \u00a7 5). In other words, if the defendant insurer stands in the shoes of the employer, the plaintiff will be restricted to recovery under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 24. See <em>Bresnahan </em>v. <em>Barre, </em>286 Mass. 593, 595-597; <em>Noble </em>v. <em>Greenbaum, </em>311 Mass. 722, 726; <em>West\u2019s Case, </em>313 Mass. 146, 153-154; <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Miettinen, </em>317 Mass. 633, 635. But if the defendant insurer is to be treated as a negligent third party, it may be held to liability at common law. See <em>Comeau </em>v. <em>Hebert, </em>352 Mass. 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The case at bar, accordingly, presents the question whether the insurer is \u201csome person other than the insured\u2019 \u2019 under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This is a subject as to which cases in other jurisdictions are not unanimous. The majority of courts which have considered this question have held that the insurer enjoys the same benefits and burdens as the employer, and have denied recovery in a common law action against the insurer. <em>Sarber </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins.

J. 398 (New Jersey Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act). See also 93 A. L. R. 2d 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">No case has squarely presented this question under our own statute. In <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Employers\u2019 Liab. Assur. Corp. Ltd. </em>288 Mass. 170, it was held that where a com-pensable injury had been aggravated by negligence charge<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>able to the insurer, the election of the injured employee to proceed under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act precluded his maintaining an action at law against the insurer, which, if successful, would have led to double recovery. In the course of discussion, the court observed (p. 174), \u201cOn a natural interpretation of the words, the insurer is \u2018some person other than the insured\u2019 within the meaning of the statutory provision in \u00a7 15 . . . . \u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">We do not extend the implications of this statement to conclude the present case, as we are of opinion that our Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act does not have as a purpose that the insurer be sued as a third party for performance of a function which furthers the goals of the entire compensation program. \u201cInsurance companies which engage in accident prevention work, the social desirability of which cannot be questioned, should be able to do so without incurring unlimited liability for failing to discover a hazard that some jury might think ought to have been discovered. If an insurance company can escape tort liability altogether by not making any inspections on the premises of the insured, but may incur unlimited tort liability by making some inspections, it more than likely will decline to make any, unless required to do so by statute. The ultimate losers will be workmen and their families.\u201d <em>Kotarski </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>244 F. Supp. 547, 558-559 (E. D. Mich.).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">With the exception of <em>Mager </em>v. <em>United Hosps. of Newark </em>88 N. J. Super. 421, the decisions reaching a contrary result either rest on a significantly different compensation statute<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>or have been vitiated by subsequent legislation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We believe that the object of workmen\u2019s compensation legislation will be best served by holding that, for the .purposes of this action, the defendant is not \u201csome person other than the insured\u201d under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15. See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. </em>358 F. 2d 799, 801 (4th <em>Cir.); Bartolotta </em>v. <em>United States, </em>276 F. Supp. 66, 72-74 (D. Conn.)<em>Kotarski </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., supra, </em>558-559.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The order sustaining the demurrer and denying leave to amend is affirmed. Judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\n<em>So ordered. \u25a0</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b514-13\"> The remaining counts are against other defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b514-14\"> See c. 152, \u00a7 1 (7).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-7\"> \u201cWhere the injury for which compensation is payable was caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in some person other than the insured to pay damages in respect thereof, the employee may at his option proceed either at law against that person to recover damages or against the insurer for compensation under this chapter, but . . . [with exceptions presently immaterial] not against both.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-7\"> This quotation, was cited with approval and followed in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>American Employers\u2019 Ins. Co. </em>102 N. H. 530, 532-533. The New Hampshire Compensation Act has been modified to define \u201cemployer\u201d to include the employer\u2019s compensation insurance carrier. N. H. Rev. Sts. Anno. \u00a7 281:2 (I) (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b517-8\"> The Iowa act considered in <em>Fabricius </em>v. <em>Montgomery Elev. Co. </em>254 Iowa, 1319, had no provision for third party liability at common law. The Florida act construed in <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Union Wire Rope Corp. </em>31 Ill. 2d 69, did not make the insurer primarily and directly liable to the injured employee. Our own Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act not only makes provision for common law actions against persons foreign to the compensation scheme (G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15), but also makes the insurer primarily liable in the event of a compensable injury. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b518-18\"> Compare <em>Smith </em>v. <em>American Employers\u2019 Ins. Co. </em>102 N. H. 530, with N. H. Rev. Sts.
