County, by appellees, doing business as E. W. Bailey &amp; Co., plaintiffs, against the appellant, James E. Taylor, as defendant, for the recovery of money advanced by Bailey and Company, as commission merchants, upon account of the purchase of 100 shares of Chicago Junction Bailway stock for appellant. Upon the trial the defendant, James E. Taylor, offered no evidence, but requested the court, at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, to instruct the jury to find the issues for the defendant, wrhich motion was denied; the jury rendered a verdict finding the issues for the plaintiffs, and assessing their damages at the amount claimed\u2014 $2,292.45. Judgment was entered on this verdict, from which judgment an appeal is taken to this court.</p><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b621-4\" pgmap=\"621\">Walker, Judd &amp; Hawley, attorneys for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b621-5\" pgmap=\"621\">Tenney, McConnell &amp; Coffeen, attorneys for appellees.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b621-6\" pgmap=\"621\">Mr. Justice Waterman</author> <p id=\"Aa4-\" pgmap=\"621\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p> <p id=\"b621-7\" pgmap=\"621\">Appellant contends that the purchase made for him was to enable him to gamble; that in this design he was knowingly aided by appellee, and that therefore no recovery can be had.</p> <p id=\"b621-8\" pgmap=\"621\">It is sufficient to say that we find in the record no warrant for such contention.
