Applicants are correct to note that relief was granted in McComish v. Bennett, 560 U.S. 961, 130 S. Ct. 3408, 177 L. Ed. 2d 320 (2010), which concerned a constitutional challenge to an Arizona law similar to the Maine law challenged by applicants here. The McComish applicants, however, requested a stay of an appeals court decision, whereas applicants here are asking for an injunction against enforcement of a presumptively constitutional state legislative act. Such a request \u201cdemands a significantly higher justification\u201d than a request for a stay, because unlike a stay, an injunction \u201cdoes not simply suspend judicial alteration of the status quo but grants judicial intervention that has been withheld by lower courts.\u201d Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy, Inc. v. NRC, 479 U.S. 1312, 1313, 107 S. Ct. 682, 93 L. Ed. 2d 692 (1986) (Scalia, J., in chambers). In light of these considerations, and given the difficulties in fashioning relief so close to the election, applicants\u2019 request for extraordinary relief is denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b448-7\">Justice Scalia and Justice Alito would grant the application for an injunction as to the matching fund provisions.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
