He alleges that respondents at the facility punished him for this decision by subjecting him to hard labor in 100-degree heat. According to Pitre, respondents repeatedly denied his requests for lighter duty more appropriate to his medical condition, even after prison officials twice thought his condition sufficiently serious to rush him to an emergency room. In response to one such request, respondent Cain expressly acknowledged in a letter attached to Pitre\u2019s complaint that Pitre was \u201cdealing with unnecessary pain and suffering, as well as cruel and unusual punishment,\u201d but he accused Pitre of\u2018bringing it on himself\u2019 by refusing to take his medication. App. F to Pet. for Cert. (Exh. A-2). Cain concluded, \u201cIf you are suffering because of your own choices, so be it.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>As a result of respondents\u2019 actions, Pitre alleges, his already-fragile medical condition deteriorated even further.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-15\">The courts below deemed these allegations insufficient to state an Eighth Amendment violation. The Magistrate Judge concluded that Pitre had been \u201c \u2018hoist by his own petard,\u2019 \u201d Report and Recommendation in No. 2:08-CV-1894 (WD La., Apr. 29, 2009), p. 9, App. C to Pet. for Cert., and <em>sua sponte </em>recommended dismissing the complaint as \u201cfrivolous,\u201d see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). The District Judge adopted this recommendation. Judgment in No. 2:08-CV-1894 (WD La., May 27, 2009), App. C to Pet. for Cert. The Fifth Circuit summarily affirmed, concluding, \u201cMr. Pitre has been given medical care, but he refuses to take medication which results at times in physical problems. Evidence of conscious indifference is not presented.\u201d 354 Fed. Appx. 142, 143 (2009) <em>(per curiam).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-16\">The Fifth Circuit\u2019s error in requiring Pitre to produce \u201cevidence\u201d in support of his allegations before a responsive pleading was filed, in and of itself, is sufficient reason to reverse the judgment below. See <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. </em>v. <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 564, n. 8, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (\u201c[W]hen a complaint adequately states a claim, it may not be dismissed based on a district court\u2019s assessment that the plaintiff will fail to find evidentiary support for his allegations\u201d). More fundamentally, however, in focusing on Pitre\u2019s own contribution to his health problems, the courts appear to have misunderstood the nature of Pitre\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim. His <em>pro se </em>complaint and attachments thereto, \u201cliberally con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>strued,\u201d <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S. Ct. 285, 50 L. Ed. 2d 251 (1976), allege not that respondents denied him medical care but that they punished him for refusing to take medication, or attempted to coerce him to take medication, by subjecting him to hard labor that they knew exceeded his medical limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\">\u201cThe principle that a competent person has a constitutionally protected liberty interest in refusing unwanted medical treatment may be inferred from our prior decisions.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Cruzan </em>v. <em>Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, </em>497 U.S. 261, 278, 110 S. Ct. 2841, 111 L. Ed. 2d 224 (1990). A prison regulation infringing an interest in avoiding unwanted medication is valid if it is \u201c \u2018reasonably related to legitimate peno-logical interests.\u2019 \u201d <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Harper, </em>494 U.S. 210, 223, 110 S. Ct. 1028, 108 L. Ed. 2d 178 (1990) (quoting <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S. Ct. 2254, 96 L. Ed. 2d 64 (1987)). We have thus held that prison officials may forcibly treat a mentally ill inmate with antipsychotic drugs \u201cif the inmate is dangerous to himself or others and the treatment is in the inmate\u2019s medical interest.\u201d <em>Harper, </em>494 U.S., at 227, 110 S. Ct. 1028, 108 L. Ed. 2d 178. We have not considered, however, whether prison officials may require inmates with HIV to take medication, such that the refusal to do so might justify the imposition of sanctions by such officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Even assuming respondents had a legitimate penological interest that outweighed a right to refuse HIV medication, that interest would not permit respondents to punish Pitre, or to attempt to coerce him to take medication, by subjecting him to hard labor that they knew posed \u201ca substantial risk of serious harm.\u201d <em>Farmer </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 128 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1994); see also <em>Hope </em>v. <em>Pelzer, </em>536 U.S. 730, 738, 122 S. Ct. 2508, 153 L. Ed. 2d 666 (2002). To determine whether prison officials\u2019 conduct violates the Eighth Amendment in the context of prison conditions, we ask whether \u201cthe officials involved acted with \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 to the inmates\u2019 health or safety.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 8, 112 S. Ct. 995, 117 L. Ed. 2d 156 (1992)). Pitre\u2019s complaint alleges that respondents subjected him to labor that they knew posed \u201ca substantial risk of serious harm\u201d to his health notwithstanding his pleas for a more appropriate assignment, <em>Farmer, </em>511 U.S., at 837, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 128 L. Ed. 2d 811, and he even attaches a letter from a prison official implying as much. This is more than sufficient to state a claim of deliberate indifference. See <em>ibid. </em>(holding that a prison official violates the Eighth Amendment if he denies \u201can inmate humane conditions of confinement [if] the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">To be sure, Pitre\u2019s decision to refuse medication may have been foolish and likely caused a significant part of his pain. But that decision does not give prison officials license to exacerbate Pitre\u2019s condition further as a means of punishing or coercing him\u2014just as a prisoner\u2019s disruptive conduct does not permit prison officials to punish the prisoner by handcuffing him to a hitching post, see <em>Hope, </em>536 U.S., at 738, 122 S. Ct. 2508, 153 L. Ed. 2d 666. Pitre\u2019s allegations, if true, describe \u201cpunitive treatment [that] amounts to gratuitous infliction of \u2018wanton and unnecessary\u2019 pain that our precedent clearly prohibits.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>I cannot comprehend how a court could deem such allegations \u201cfrivolous.\u201d Because I believe that Pitre\u2019s complaint states an Eighth Amendment violation, I would grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and reverse the judgment below.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-7\"> In the District Court, Pitre also claimed a liberty interest created by state law. See La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 15:860 (West 2005) (\u201cExcept as to compliance with the sanitary laws and all reasonable regulations relating to contagious and infectious diseases, any sane patient or sane inmate of the Louisiana State Penitentiary may decline any medical care or treatment offered or provided by the institution and provide other care for himself at his own expense\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
