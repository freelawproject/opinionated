There is no evidence in the record to suggest that the drug obtained from a foreign source is unsafe. The district court granted the restraining order because it was left to speculate as to the risk of harm. See Order Granting Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order in Landrigan v. Brewer, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113485, No. CV-10-02246PHX-ROS (D Ariz.), Doc. 21, p. 15 (\u201c[T]he Court is left to speculate . . . whether the non-FDA approved drug will cause pain and suffering.\u201d). But speculation cannot substitute for evidence that the use of the drug is \u201c <em>\u2018sure or very likely </em>to cause serious illness and needless suffering.\u2019 \u201d Baze v. Rees, 553 U.S. 35, 50, 128 S. Ct. 1520, 170 L. Ed. 2d 420 (2008) (quoting Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33, 113 S. Ct. 2475, 125 L. Ed. 2d 22 (1993)). There was no showing that the drug was unlawfully obtained, nor was there an offer of proof to that effect. Motion to file documents under seal denied as moot.</p>\n<judges id=\"b448-13\">Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan would deny the application to vacate the order granting a temporary restraining order.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
