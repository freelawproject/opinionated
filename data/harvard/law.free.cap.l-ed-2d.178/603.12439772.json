The means test instructs a debtor to deduct specified expenses from his current monthly income. The result is his \u201cdisposable income\u201d\u2014the amount he has available to reimburse creditors. \u00a7 1325(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">This case concerns the specified expense for vehicle-ownership costs. We must determine whether a debtor like petitioner Jason Ransom who owns his car outright, and so does not make loan or lease payments, may claim an allowance for car-ownership costs (thereby reducing the amount he will repay creditors). We hold that the text, context, and purpose of the statutory provision at issue preclude this result. A debtor who does not make loan or lease payments may not take the car-ownership deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">\u201cCongress enacted the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPAor Act) to correct perceived abuses of the bankruptcy system.\u201d <em>Milavetz, Gallop &amp; Milavetz, P. A. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>559 U.S. 229, 231-232, 130 S. Ct. 1324, 176 L. Ed. 2d 79 (2010). In particular, Congress adopted the means test\u2014 \u201c[t]he heart of [BAPCPA\u2019s] consumer bankruptcy reforms,\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 109-31, pt. 1, p. 2 (2005) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.), and the home of the statutory language at issue here\u2014to help ensure that debtors who <em>can </em>pay creditors <em>do </em>pay them. See, <em>e.g., ibid. </em>(under BAPCPA, \u201cdebtors [will] repay creditors the maximum they can afford\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">[562 U.S. 65]</p>\n<p id=\"b710-13\">In Chapter 13 proceedings, the means test provides a formula to calculate a debtor\u2019s disposable income, which the debtor must devote to reimbursing creditors under a court-approved plan generally lasting from three to five years. \u00a7\u00a7 1325(b)(1)(B) and (b)(4).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The statute defines \u201cdisposable income\u201d as \u201ccurrent monthly income\u201d less \u201camounts reasonably necessary to be expended\u201d for \u201cmaintenance or support,\u201d business expen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>di tures, and certain charitable contributions. \u00a7\u00a7 1325(b)(2)(A)(i) and (ii). For a debtor whose income is above the median for his State, the means test identifies which expenses qualify as \u201camounts reasonably necessary to be expended.\u201d The test supplants the pre-BAPCPA practice of calculating debtors\u2019 reasonable expenses on a case-by-case basis, which led to varying and often inconsistent determinations. See, <em>e.g., In re Slusher, </em>359 B.R. 290, 294 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Nev. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">Under the means test, a debtor calculating his \u201creasonably necessary\u201d expenses is directed to claim allowances for defined living expenses, as well as for secured and priority debt. \u00a7\u00a7 707(b)(2)(A)(ii)-(iv). As relevant here, the statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-5\">\u201cThe debtor\u2019s monthly expenses shall be the debtor\u2019s applicable monthly expense amounts specified under the National Standards and Local Standards, and the debtor\u2019s actual monthly expenses for the categories specified as Other Necessary Expenses issued by the Internal</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">[562 U.S. 66]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-7\">Revenue Service [IRS] for the area in which the debtor resides.\u201d \u00a7 707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">These are the principal amounts that the debtor can claim as his reasonable living expenses and thereby shield from creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">The National and Local Standards referenced in this provision are tables that the IRS prepares listing standardized expense amounts for basic necessities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The IRS uses the Standards to help calculate taxpayers\u2019 ability to pay overdue taxes.

App. 1, 54. Among his liabilities, Ransom itemized over $82,500 in unsecured debt, including a claim held by respondent FIA Card Services, N. A. (FIA). <em>Id., </em>at 41. Among his assets, Ransom listed a 2004 Toyota Camry, valued at $14,000, which he owns free of any debt. <em>Id., </em>at 38, 49, 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">For purposes of the means test, Ransom reported income of $4,248.56 per month. <em>Id., </em>at 46. He also listed monthly expenses totaling $4,038.01. <em>Id., </em>at 53. In determining those expenses, Ransom claimed a car-ownership deduction of $471 for the Camry, the full amount specified in the IRS\u2019s \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d table. <em>Id., </em>at 49. Ransom listed a separate deduction of $338 for car-operating costs. <em>Ibid. </em>Based on these figures, Ransom had disposable income of $210.55 per month. <em>Id., </em>at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Ransom proposed a 5-year plan that would result in repayment of approximately 25% of his unsecured debt. <em>Id., </em>at 55. FIA objected to confirmation of the plan on the ground that it did not direct all of Ransom\u2019s disposable income to unsecured creditors. <em>Id., </em>at 64. In particular, FIA argued that Ransom should not have claimed the car-ownership allowance because he does not make loan or lease payments on his car. <em>Id., </em>at 67. FIA noted that without this allowance, Ransom\u2019s disposable income would be $681.55\u2014the $210.55 he reported plus the $471 he deducted for vehicle ownership. <em>Id.., </em>at 71. The difference over the 60 months of the plan amounts to about $28,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">[562 U.S. 68]</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">The Bankruptcy Court denied confirmation of Ransom\u2019s plan. App. to Pet. for Cert. 48. The court held that Ransom could deduct a vehicle-ownership expense only \u201cif he is currently making loan or lease payments on that vehicle.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">Ransom appealed to the Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel, which affirmed. <em>In re Ransom, </em>380 B.R. 799, 808-809 (2007). The panel reasoned that an \u201cexpense [amount] becomes relevant to the debtor (i.e., appropriate or applicable to the debtor) when he or she in fact has such an expense.\u201d <em>Id.., </em>at 807. \u201c[W]hat is important,\u201d the panel noted, \u201cis the payments that debtors actually make, not how many cars they own, because [those] payments . . . are what actually affect their ability to\u201d reimburse unsecured creditors. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b712-11\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. <em>In re Ransom, </em>577 F.3d 1026, 1027 (2009). The plain language of the statute, the court held, \u201cdoes not allow a debtor to deduct an \u2018ownership cost\u2019. .. that the debtor does not have.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1030. The court observed that \u201c[a]n \u2018ownership cost\u2019 is not an \u2018expense\u2019\u2014either actual or applicable\u2014if it does not exist, period.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b712-12\">We granted a writ of certiorari to resolve a split of authority over whether a debtor who does not make loan or lease payments on his car may claim the deduction for vehicle-ownership costs. 559 U.S. 1066, 130 S. Ct. 2097, 176 L. Ed. 2d 721 (2010).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We now affirm the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>[562 U.S. 69]</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Our interpretation of the Bankruptcy Code starts \u201cwhere all such inquiries must begin: with the language of the statute itself.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., </em>489 U.S. 235, 241, 109 S. Ct. 1026, 103 L. Ed. 2d 290 (1989). As noted, the provision of the Code central to the decision of this case states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\">\u201cThe debtor\u2019s monthly expenses shall be the debtor\u2019s applicable monthly expense amounts specified under the National Standards and Local Standards, and the debtor\u2019s actual monthly expenses for the categories specified as Other Necessary Expenses issued by the [IRS] for the area in which the debtor resides.\u201d \u00a7 707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">The key word in this provision is \u201capplicable\u201d: A debtor may claim not all, but only \u201capplicable\u201d expense amounts listed in the Standards. Whether Ransom may claim the $471 car-ownership deduction accordingly turns on whether that expense amount is \u201capplicable\u201d to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Because the Code does not define \u201capplicable,\u201d we look to the ordinary meaning of the term. See, <em>e.g., Hamilton </em>v. <em>Panning, </em>560 U.S. 505, 513, 130 S. Ct. 2464, 177 L. Ed. 2d 23 (2010). \u201cApplicable\u201d means \u201ccapable of being applied: having relevance\u201d or \u201cfit, suitable, or right to be applied: appropriate.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 105 (2002). See also New Oxford American Dictionary 74 (2d ed. 2005) (\u201crelevant or appropriate\u201d); 1 Oxford English Dictionary 575 (2d ed. 1989) (\u201c[c]apable of being applied\u201d or \u201c[f]it or suitable for its purpose, appropriate\u201d). So an expense amount is \u201capplicable\u201d within the plain meaning of the statute when it is appropriate, relevant, suitable, or fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">What makes an expense amount \u201capplicable\u201d in this sense (appropriate, relevant, suitable, or fit) is most naturally understood to be its correspondence to an individual debtor\u2019s financial circumstances. Rather than authorizing all debtors to take deductions in all listed categories, Congress established</p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">[562 U.S. 70]</p>\n<p id=\"b713-12\">a filter: A debtor may claim a deduction from a National or Local Standard table (like \u201c[Car] Ownership Costs\u201d) if, but only if, that deduction is appropriate for him. And a deduction is so appropriate only if the debtor has costs corresponding to the category covered by the table\u2014 that is, only if the debtor will incur that kind of expense during the life of the plan. The statute underscores the necessity of making such an individualized determination by referring to <em>\u201cthe debtor\u2019s </em>applicable monthly expense amounts,\u201d \u00a7 707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) (emphasis added)\u2014in other words, the expense amounts applicable (appropriate, etc.) to each particular debtor. Identifying these amounts requires looking at the financial situation of the debtor and asking whether a National or Local Standard table is relevant to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">If Congress had not wanted to separate in this way debtors who qualify for an allowance from those who do not, it could have omitted the term \u201capplicable\u201d altogether. Without that word, all debtors would be eligible to claim a deduction for each category listed in the Standards. Congress presumably included \u201capplicable\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>achieve a different result. See <em>Leocal </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 12, 125 S. Ct. 377, 160 L. Ed. 2d 271 (2004)  (\u201c[W]e must give effect to every word of a statute wherever possible\u201d). Interpreting the statute to require a threshold determination of eligibility ensures that the term \u201capplicable\u201d carries meaning, as each word in a statute should.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">This reading of \u201capplicable\u201d also draws support from the statutory context.  The Code initially defines a debtor\u2019s disposable income as his \u201ccurrent monthly income . . . less amounts <em>reasonably necessary to be expended.\u201d </em>\u00a7 1325(b)(2) (emphasis added). The statute then instructs that \u201c[a]mounts reasonably necessary to be expended . . . shall be determined in accordance with\u201d the means test. \u00a7 1325(b)(3). Because Congress intended the means test to approximate the debtor\u2019s reasonable expenditures on essential items, a debtor should be required to qualify for a deduction by actually incurring an expense in the relevant category. If a debtor will not have a particular kind of expense</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">[562 U.S. 71]</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">during his plan, an allowance to cover that cost is not \u201creasonably necessary\u201d within the meaning of the statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Finally, consideration of BAPCPA\u2019s purpose strengthens our reading of the term \u201capplicable.\u201d Congress designed the means test to measure debtors\u2019 disposable income and, in that way, \u201cto ensure that [they] repay creditors the maximum they can afford.\u201d H. R. Rep., at 2. This purpose is best achieved by interpreting the means test, consistent with the statutory text, to reflect a debtor\u2019s ability to afford repayment. Cf. <em>Hamilton, </em>560 U.S., at 520, 130 S. Ct. 2464, 177 L. Ed. 2d 23 (rejecting an interpretation of the Bankruptcy Code that \u201cwould produce [the] senseless resul[t]\u201d of \u201cdenying] creditors payments that the debtor could easily make\u201d). Requiring a debtor to incur the kind of expenses for which he claims a means-test deduction thus advances BAPCPA\u2019s objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">Because we conclude that a person cannot claim an allowance for vehicle-ownership costs unless he has some expense falling within that category, the question in this case becomes: What expenses does the vehicle-ownership category cover? If it covers loan and lease payments alone, Ransom does not qualify, because he has no such expense. Only if that category also covers other costs associated with having a car would Ransom be entitled to this deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">The less inclusive understanding is the right one: The ownership category encompasses the costs of a car loan or lease and nothing more. As noted earlier, the numerical amounts listed in the \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d table are \u201cbase[d] ... on the five-year average of new and used car financing data compiled by the Federal Reserve Board.\u201d App. to Brief for Respondent</p>\n<p id=\"A6Ng\">[562 U.S. 72]</p>\n<p id=\"b714-11\">3a. In other words, the sum $471 is the average monthly payment for loans and leases nationwide; it is not intended to estimate other conceivable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>expenses associated with maintaining a car. The Standards do account for those additional expenses, but in a different way: They are mainly the province of the separate deduction for vehicle \u201cOperating Costs,\u201d which include payments for \u201c[v]ehicle insurance, . . . maintenance, fuel, state and local registration, required inspection, parking fees, tolls, [and] driver\u2019s license.\u201d Internal Revenue Manual \u00a7\u00a7 5.15.1.7 and 5.15.1.9 (May 1,2004), reprinted in App. to Brief for Respondent 16a, 20a; see also IRS, Collection Financial Standards (Feb. 19, 2010), http://www.irs.gov/individuals/article/ 0\u201eid=96543,00.html.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A person who owns a car free and clear is entitled to claim the \u201cOperating Costs\u201d deduction for all these expenses of driving\u2014 and Ransom in fact did so, to the tune of $338. But such a person is not entitled to claim the \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d deduction, because that allowance is for the separate costs of a car loan or lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">The Collection Financial Standards\u2014the IRS\u2019s explanatory guidelines to the National and Local Standards\u2014explicitly recognize this distinction between ownership and operating costs, making clear that individuals who have a car but make no loan or lease payments may claim only the operating allowance. App. to Brief for Respondent 3a; see <em>supra, </em>at 66-67, 178 L. Ed. 2d, at 609. Although the statute does not incorporate the IRS\u2019s guidelines, courts may consult this material in interpreting the National and Local Standards; after all, the IRS uses those tables for a similar purpose\u2014to determine how much money a delinquent taxpayer can afford to pay the Government. The guidelines of course cannot control if they are at odds with the statutory language. But here, the Collection</p>\n<p id=\"A3BOs\">[562 U.S. 73]</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Financial Standards\u2019 treatment of the car-ownership deduction reinforces our conclusion that, under the statute, a debtor seeking to claim this deduction must make some loan or lease payments.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Because Ransom owns his vehicle free and clear of any encumbrance, he incurs no expense in the \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d category of the Local Standards. Accordingly, the car-ownership expense amount is not \u201capplicable\u201d to him, and the Ninth Circuit correctly denied that deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">Ransom\u2019s argument to the contrary relies on a different interpretation of the key word \u201capplicable,\u201d an objection to our view of the scope of the \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d category, and a criticism of the policy implications of our approach. We do not think these claims persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">Ransom first offers another understanding of the term \u201capplicable.\u201d A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>debtor, he says, determines his \u201capplicable\u201d deductions by locating the box in each National or Local Standard table that corresponds to his geographic location, income, family size, or number of cars. Under this approach, a debtor \u201cconsult [s] the tablets] alone\u201d to determine his appropriate expense amounts. Reply Brief for Petitioner 16. Because he has one car, Ransom argues that his \u201capplicable\u201d allowance is the sum listed in the first column of the \u201cOwnership</p>\n<p id=\"Augg\">[562 U.S. 74]</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Costs\u201d table ($471); if he had a second vehicle, the amount in the second column ($332) would also be \u201capplicable.\u201d On this approach, the word \u201capplicable\u201d serves a function wholly internal to the tables; rather than filtering out debtors for whom a deduction is not at all suitable, the term merely directs each debtor to the correct box (and associated dollar amount of deduction) within every table.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">This alternative reading of \u201capplicable\u201d fails to comport with the statute\u2019s text, context, or purpose. As intimated earlier, <em>supra, </em>at 7-8, Ransom\u2019s interpretation would render the term \u201capplicable\u201d superfluous. Assume Congress had omitted that word and simply authorized a deduction of \u201cthe debtor\u2019s monthly expense amounts\u201d specified in the Standards. That language, most naturally read, would direct each debtor to locate the box in every table corresponding to his location, income, family size, or number of cars and to deduct the amount stated. In other words, the language would instruct the debtor to use the exact approach Ransom urges. The word \u201capplicable\u201d is not necessary to accomplish that result; it is necessary only for the different purpose of dividing debtors eligible to make use of the tables from those who are not. Further, Ransom\u2019s reading of \u201capplicable\u201d would sever the connection between the means test and the statutory provision it is meant to implement\u2014the authorization of an allowance for (but only for) \u201creasonably necessary\u201d expenses. Expenses that are wholly fictional are not easily thought of as reasonably necessary. And finally, Ransom\u2019s interpretation would run counter to the statute\u2019s overall purpose of ensuring that debtors repay creditors to the extent they can\u2014here, by shielding some $28,000 that he does not in fact need for loan or lease payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">As against all this, Ransom argues that his reading is necessary to account for the means test\u2019s distinction between \u201capplicable\u201d and \u201cactual\u201d expenses\u2014more fully stated, between the phrase <em>\u201capplicable </em>monthly expense</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">[562 U.S. 75]</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">amounts\u201d specified in the Standards and the phrase <em>\u201cactual </em>monthly expenses for . . . Other Necessary Expenses.\u201d \u00a7 707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) (emphasis added). The latter phrase enables a debtor to deduct his actual expenses in particular categories that the IRS designates relating mainly to taxpayers\u2019 health and welfare. Internal Revenue Manual \u00a75.15.1.10(1), http ://www. irs. gov/irm/part5/ir m_05-015-001.html#d0el381. According to Ransom, \u201capplicable\u201d cannot mean the same thing as \u201cactual.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 40. He thus concludes that \u201can \u2018applicable\u2019 expense can be claimed [under the means test] even if no \u2018actual\u2019 expense was incurred.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">Our interpretation of the statute, however, equally avoids conflating \u201capplicable\u201d with \u201cactual\u201d costs. Although the expense amounts in the Standards apply only if the debtor incurs the relevant expense, the debt- or\u2019s out-of-pocket cost may well not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>control the amount of the deduction. If a debtor\u2019s actual expenses exceed the amounts listed in the tables, for example, the debtor may claim an allowance only for the specified sum rather than for his real expenditures.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For the Other Necessary Expense categories, by contrast, the debtor may deduct his actual expenses, no matter how high</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">[562 U.S. 76]</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">they are.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Our reading of the means test thus gives full effect to \u201cthe distinction between \u2018applicable\u2019 and \u2018actual\u2019 without taking a further step to conclude that \u2018applicable\u2019 means \u2018nonexistent.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Ross-Tousey, </em>368 B.R. 762, 765 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Wis. 2007), rev\u2019d, 549 F.3d 1148 (CA7 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Finally, Ransom\u2019s reading of \u201capplicable\u201d may not even answer the essential question: whether a debtor may claim a deduction. \u201c[C]onsult-[ing] the tablets] alone\u201d to determine a debtor\u2019s deduction, as Ransom urges us to do, Reply Brief for Petitioner 16, often will not be sufficient because the tables are not self-defining. This case provides a prime example. The \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d table features two columns labeled \u201cFirst Car\u201d and \u201cSecond Car.\u201d See <em>supra, </em>at 66, 178 L. Ed. 2d, at 609. Standing alone, the table does not specify whether it refers to the first and second cars <em>owned </em>(as Ransom avers), or the first and second cars for which the debtor incurs <em>ownership costs </em>(as FIA maintains)\u2014and so the table does not resolve the issue in dispute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>In re Kimbro, </em>389 B.R. 518, 533</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">[562 U.S. 77]</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">(Bkrtcy. App. Panel CA6 2008) (Fulton, J., dissenting) (\u201c[0]ne cannot really \u2018just look up\u2019 dollar amounts in the tables without either referring to IRS guidelines for using the tables or imposing pre-existing assumptions about how [they] are to be navigated\u201d (footnote omitted)). Some amount of interpretation is nec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>essary to decide what the deduction is for and whether it is applicable to Ransom; and so we are brought back full circle to our prior analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Ransom next argues that viewing the car-ownership deduction as covering no more than loan and lease payments is inconsistent with a separate sentence of the means test that provides: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of this clause, the monthly expenses of the debtor shall not include any payments for debts.\u201d \u00a7 707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I). The car-ownership deduction cannot comprise <em>only </em>loan and lease payments, Ransom contends, because those payments are <em>always </em>debts. See Brief for Petitioner 28, 44-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Ransom ignores that the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d sentence governs the full panoply of deductions under the National and Local Standards and the Other Necessary Expense categories. We hesitate to rely on that general provision to interpret the content of the car-ownership deduction because Congress did not draft the former with the latter specially in mind; any friction between the two likely reflects only a lack of attention to how an across-the-board exclusion of debt payments would correspond to a particular IRS allowance.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">[562 U.S. 78]</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">Further, the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d sentence by its terms functions only to exclude, and not to authorize, deductions. It cannot establish an allowance for nonloan or nonlease ownership costs that no National or Local Standard covers. Accordingly, the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d sentence does nothing to alter our conclusion that the \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d table does not apply to a debtor whose car is not encumbered.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">Ransom finally contends that his view of the means test is necessary to avoid senseless results not intended by Congress. At the outset, we note that the policy concerns Ransom emphasizes pale beside one his reading creates: His interpretation, as we have explained, would frustrate BAPCPA\u2019s core purpose of ensuring that debtors devote their full disposable income to repaying creditors. See <em>supra, </em>at 71, 178 L. Ed. 2d, at 612. We nonetheless address each of Ransom\u2019s policy arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-12\">Ransom first points out a troubling anomaly: Under our interpretation, \u201c[d]ebtors can time their bankruptcy filing to take place while they still have a few car payments left, thus retaining an ownership deduction which they would lose if they filed just after making their last payment.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 54. Indeed, a debtor with only a single car payment remaining, Ransom notes, is eligible to claim a monthly ownership deduction. <em>Id., </em>at 15, 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-13\">But this kind of oddity is the inevitable result of a standardized formula like the means test, even more under Ransom\u2019s reading than under ours. Such formulas are by their nature over- and under-inclusive. In eliminating the pre-BAPCPA case-by-case adjudication of above-median-income debtors\u2019 expenses, on the ground that it leant itself to abuse, Congress chose to tolerate the occasional peculiarity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>that a brighter-line test produces. And Ransom\u2019s alternative reading of the statute would spawn its own anomalies\u2014even placing to one side the fundamental strangeness of giving a debtor an allowance for loan or lease payments when he has</p>\n<p id=\"Azrl7\">[562 U.S. 79]</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">not a penny of loan or lease costs. On Ransom\u2019s view, for example, a debtor entering bankruptcy might purchase for a song a junkyard car\u2014\u201can old, rusted pile of scrap metal [that would] si[t] on cinder blocks in his backyard,\u201d <em>In re Brown, </em>376 B.R. 601, 607 (Bkrtcy. Ct. SD Tex. 2007)\u2014in order to deduct the $471 car-ownership expense and reduce his payment to creditors by that amount. We do not see why Congress would have preferred that result to the one that worries Ransom. That is especially so because creditors may well be able to remedy Ransom\u2019s \u201cone payment left\u201d problem. If car payments cease during the life of the plan, just as if other financial circumstances change, an unsecured creditor may move to modify the plan to increase the amount the debtor must repay. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1329(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Ransom next contends that denying the ownership allowance to debtors in his position \u201csends entirely the wrong message, namely, that it is advantageous to be deeply in debt on motor vehicle loans, rather than to pay them off.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 55. But the choice here is not between thrifty savers and profligate borrowers, as Ransom would have it. Money is fungible: The $14,000 that Ransom spent to purchase his Camry outright was money he did not devote to paying down his credit card debt, and Congress did not express a preference for one use of these funds over the other. Further, Ransom\u2019s argument mistakes what the deductions in the means test are meant to accomplish. Rather than effecting any broad federal policy as to saving or borrowing, the deductions serve merely to ensure that debtors in bankruptcy can afford essential items. The car-ownership allowance thus safeguards a debtor\u2019s ability to retain a car throughout the plan period. If the debtor already owns a car outright, he has no need for this protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">Ransom finally argues that a debtor who owns his car free and clear may need to replace it during the life of the plan; \u201c [g] ranting the ownership cost deduction to a vehicle that is owned outright,\u201d he states, \u201caccords best with economic reality.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 52. In essence, Ransom seeks an emergency</p>\n<p id=\"AtbSv\">[562 U.S. 80]</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">cushion for car owners. But nothing in the statute authorizes such a cushion, which all debtors presumably would like in the event some unexpected need arises. And a person who enters bankruptcy without any car at all may also have to buy one during the plan period; yet Ransom concedes that a person in this position cannot claim the ownership deduction. Tr. of Oral Arg. 20. The appropriate way to account for unanticipated expenses like a new vehicle purchase is not to distort the scope of a deduction, but to use the method that the Code provides for all Chapter 13 debtors (and their creditors): modification of the plan in light of changed circumstances. See \u00a7 1329(a)(1); see also <em>supra, </em>at 79, 178 L. Ed. 2d, at 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">Based on BAPCPA\u2019s text, context, and purpose, we hold that the Local Standard expense amount for transportation \u201cOwnership Costs\u201d is not \u201capplicable\u201d to a debtor who will not incur any such costs during his bankruptcy plan. Because the \u201cOwnership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Costs\u201d category covers only loan and lease payments and because Ransom owns his car free from any debt or obligation, he may not claim the allowance. In short, Ransom may not deduct loan or lease expenses when he does not have any. We therefore affirm the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-12\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b710-14\">. Chapter 13 borrows the means test from Chapter 7, where it is used as a screening mechanism to determine whether a Chapter 7 proceeding is appropriate. Individuals who file for bankruptcy relief under Chapter 7 liquidate their nonexempt assets, rather than dedicate their future income, to repay creditors. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 704(a)(1), 726. If the debtor\u2019s Chapter 7 petition discloses that his disposable income as calculated by the means test exceeds a certain threshold, the petition is presumptively abusive. \u00a7 707(b)(2)(A)(i). If the debtor cannot rebut the presumption, the court may dismiss the case or, with the debtor\u2019s consent, convert it into a Chapter 13 proceeding. \u00a7 707(b)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b711-19\">.

This interpretation also avoids the anomalous result of granting preferential treatment to individuals with above-median income. Because the means test does not apply to Chapter 13 debtors whose incomes are below the median, those debtors must prove on a case-by-case basis that each claimed expense is reasonably necessary. See \u00a7\u00a7 1325(b)(2) and (3). If a below-median-income debtor cannot take a deduction for a nonexistent expense, we doubt Congress meant to provide such an allowance to an above-median-income debtor\u2014the very kind of debtor whose perceived abuse of the bankruptcy system inspired Congress to enact the means test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b715-12\">.

Ed. 2d, at 619-620, but we think that basis obvious: The IRS <em>creates </em>the National and Local Standards referenced in the statute, revises them as it deems necessary, and uses them every day.

The parties and the Solicitor General as <em>amicus curiae </em>dispute the proper deduction for a debtor who has expenses that are <em>lower </em>than the amounts listed in the Local Standards. Ransom argues that a debtor may claim the specified expense amount in full regardless of his out-of-pocket costs. Brief for Petitioner 24-27. The Government concurs with this view, provided (as we require) that a debtor has <em>some </em>expense relating to the deduction. See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>19-21. FIA, relying on the IRS\u2019s practice, contends to the contrary that a debtor may claim only his actual expenditures in this circumstance. Brief for Respondent 12, 45-46 (arguing that the Local Standards function as caps). We decline to resolve this issue. Because Ransom incurs no ownership expense at all, the car-ownership allowance is not applicable to him in the first instance.

Ed. 2d, at 619, but rather whether to claim a deduction for <em>any </em>car that is owned if the debtor has no ownership costs. Indeed, if we had to decide this question on the basis of the table alone, we might well decide that a debtor who does not make loan or lease payments cannot claim an allowance. The table, after all, is titled \u201cOwnership Costs\"\u2014suggesting that it applies to those debtors who incur such costs. And as noted earlier, the dollar amounts in the table represent average automobile loan and lease payments nationwide (with all other car-related expenses approximated in the separate \u201cOperating Costs\u2019\u2019 table). See <em>supra, </em>at 71-72, 178 L. Ed. 2d, at 612-613. Ransom himself concedes that not every debtor falls within the terms of this table; he would exclude, and thus prohibit from taking a deduction, a person who does not own a car.

Ed. 2d, at 612 <em>(quoting Leocal </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 12, 125 S. Ct. 377, 160 L. Ed. 2d 271 (2004)). I disagree. The canon against superfluity is not a canon against verbosity. When a thought could have been expressed more concisely, one does not always have to cast about for some additional meaning to the word or phrase that could have been dispensed with. This has always been understood. A House of Lords opinion holds, for example, that in the phrase \u201c \u2018in addition to and not in derogation of \u2019 \u201d the last part adds nothing but emphasis. <em>Davies </em>v. <em>Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries, Ltd., </em>[1942] A. C. 601, 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-15\">It seems to me that is the situation here. To be sure, one can say \u201caccording to the attached table\u201d; but it is acceptable (and indeed I think more common) to say \u201caccording to the applicable provisions of the attached table.\u201d That seems to me the fairest reading of \u201capplicable monthly expense</p>\n<p id=\"b720-16\">[562 U.S. 82]</p>\n<p id=\"b720-17\">amounts specified under the National Standards and Local Standards.\u201d That is especially so for the Ownership Costs portion of the Local Standards, which had no column titled \u201cNo Car.\u201d Here the expense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>amount would be that shown for one car (which is all the debtor here owned) rather than that shown for two cars; and it would be no expense amount if the debtor owned no car, since there is no \u201capplicable\u201d provision for that on the table. For operating and public transportation costs, the \u201capplicable\u201d amount would similarly be the amount provided by the Local Standards for the geographic region in which the debtor resides. (The debtor would not first be required to prove that he actually operates the cars that he owns, or, if he does not own a car, that he actually uses public transportation.) The Court claims that the tables \u201care not self-defining,\u201d and that \u201c[s]ome amount of interpretation\u201d is necessary in choosing whether to claim a deduction at all, for one car, or for two. <em>Ante, </em>at 76, 77, 178 L. Ed. 2d, at 615, 615-616. But this problem seems to me more metaphysical than practical. The point of the statutory language is to entitle debtors who own cars to an ownership deduction, and I have little doubt that debtors will be able to choose correctly whether to claim a deduction for one car or for two.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">If the meaning attributed to the word by the Court were intended, it would have been most precise to say \u201cmonthly expense amounts specified under the National Standards and Local Standards, if applicable for IRS collection purposes.\u201d And even if utter precision was too much to expect, it would at least have been more natural to say \u201cmonthly expense amounts specified under the National Standards and Local Standards, <em>if appli</em>cable.\u201d That would make it clear that amounts specified under those Standards may nonetheless not be applicable, justifying (perhaps) resort to some source other than the Standards themselves to give meaning to the condition. The very next paragraph of the Bankruptcy Code uses that formulation (\u201cif applicable\u201d) to limit to actual expenses the deduction for care of an elderly or chronically</p>\n<p id=\"AnrJHu\">[562 U.S. 83]</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">ill household member: \u201c[T]he debtor\u2019s monthly expenses may include, <em>if applicable, </em>the continuation of actual expenses paid by the debtor that are reasonable and necessary\u201d for that purpose. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 707(b)(2)(AKiiKII) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Elsewhere as well, the Code makes it very clear when prescribed deductions are limited to actual expenditures. Section 707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) itself authorizes deductions for a host of expenses\u2014health and disability insurance, for example\u2014only to the extent that they are \u201cactual . . . expenses\u201d that are \u201creasonably necessary.\u201d Additional deductions for energy are allowed, but again only if they are \u201cactual expenses\u201d that are \u201creasonable and necessary.\u201d \u00a7 707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(V). Given the clarity of those limitations to actual outlays, it seems strange for Congress to limit the car-ownership deduction to the somewhat peculiar category \u201ccars subject to any amount whatever of outstanding indebtedness\u201d by the mere word \u201capplicable,\u201d meant as incorporation of a limitation that appears in instructions to IRS agents.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>I do not find the normal meaning of the text undermined by the fact that it produces a situation in which a debtor who</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">[562 U.S. 84]</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">owes no payments on his car nonetheless gets the operating-expense allowance. For the Court\u2019s more strained interpretation still produces a situation in which a debtor who owes only a single remaining payment on his car gets the full allowance. As for the Court\u2019s imagined horrible in which \u201ca debtor entering bankruptcy might purchase for a song a junkyard car,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 79, 178 L. Ed. 2d, at 617: That is fairly matched by the imagined horrible that, under the Court\u2019s scheme, a debtor entering bankruptcy might purchase a junkyard car for a song plus a $10 promissory note payable over several years. He would get the full ownership-expense deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Thus, the Court\u2019s interpretation does not, as promised, maintain \u201cthe connection between the means test and the statutory provision it is meant to implement\u2014the authorization of an allowance for (but only for) \u2018reasonably necessary\u2019 expenses,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 74, 178 L. Ed. 2d, at 614. Nor do I think this difficulty is eliminated by the <em>deus ex machina </em>of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1329(a)(1), which according to the Court would allow an unsecured creditor to \u201cmove to modify the plan to increase the amount the debtor must repay,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 79, 178 L. Ed. 2d, at 617. Apart from the fact that, as a practical matter, the sums involved would hardly make this worth the legal costs, allowing such ongoing revisions of matters specifically covered by the rigid means test would return us to \u201cthe pre-BAPCPA case-by-case adjudication of above-median-income debtors\u2019 expenses,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 78, 178 L. Ed. 2d, at 616. If the BAPCPA had thought such adjustments necessary, surely it would have taken the much simpler and more logical step of providing going in that the ownership-expense allowance would apply only so long as monthly payments were due.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">The reality is, to describe it in the Court\u2019s own terms, that occasional overallowance (or, for that matter, un-derallowance) \u201cis the inevitable result of a standardized formula like the means test .... Congress chose to tolerate the occasional peculiarity that a brighter-line test produces.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Our job, it seems to me, is not to eliminate or reduce those \u201coddit[ies],\u201d <em>ibid.., </em>but to give the formula Congress</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">[562 U.S. 85]</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">adopted its fairest meaning. In my judgment the \u201capplicable monthly expense amounts\u201d for operating costs \u201cspecified under the . . . Local Standards\u201d are the amounts specified in those Standards for either one car or two cars, whichever of those is applicable.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b721-8\"> The Court protests that I misunderstand its use of the Collection Financial Standards. Its opinion does not, it says, find them to be incorporated by the Bankruptcy Code; they simply \u201creinforc[e] our conclusion that ... a debtor seeking to claim this deduction must make some loan or lease payments.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 73, 178 L. Ed. 2d, at 613. True enough, the opinion says that the Bankruptcy Code \u201cdoes not incorporate the IRS\u2019s guidelines,\u201d but it immediately continues that \u201ccourts may consult this material in interpreting the National and Local Standards\u201d so long as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>is not \u201cat odds with the statutory language.\u2019\u2019 <em>Ante, </em>at 72, 178 L. Ed. 2d, at 613. In the present context, the real-world difference between finding the guidelines incorporated and finding it appropriate to consult them escapes me, since I can imagine no basis for consulting them unless Congress meant them to be consulted, which would mean they are incorporated. And without incorporation, they <em>are </em>at odds with the statutory language, which otherwise contains no hint that eligibility for a car-ownership deduction requires anything other than ownership of a car.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
