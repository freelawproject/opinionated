Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 3041(b) (West Supp. 2010). If the board denies parole, the prisoner can seek judicial review in a state habeas petition. The California Supreme Court has explained that \u201cthe standard of review properly is characterized as whether \u2018some evidence\u2019 supports the conclusion that the inmate is unsuitable for parole because he or she currently is dangerous.\u201d <em>In re Lawrence, </em>44 Cal. 4th 1181, 1191, 190 P.3d 535, 539 (2008). See also <em>In re Shaputis, </em>44 Cal. 4th 1241, 1253-1254, 190 P.3d 573, 580 (2008); <em>In re Rosenkrantz, </em>29 Cal. 4th 616, 625-626, 59 P.3d 174, 183 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-26\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b836-27\">Respondent Damon Cooke was convicted of attempted first-degree murder in 1991, and a California court sentenced him to an indeterminate term of seven years to life in prison with the possibility of parole. In November 2002, the board determined that Cooke was not yet suitable for parole, basing its decision on the \u201ces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>pecially cruel and callous manner\u201d of his commitment offense, App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a; his failure to participate fully in rehabilitative programs; his failure to develop marketable skills; and three incidents of misconduct while in prison. The board admitted that Cooke had received a favorable psychological report, but it dismissed the report as not credible because it included several inconsistent and erroneous statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">Cooke filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in State Superior Court. The court denied his petition. \u201cThe record indicates,\u201d it said, \u201cthat there was some evidence, including but certainly not limited to the life offense, to support the board\u2019s denial.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 42a. Cooke subsequently filed a habeas petition with the California Court of Appeal and a petition for direct review by the California Supreme Court. Both were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">[562 U.S. 218]</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">In October 2004, Cooke filed a federal habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 challenging the parole board\u2019s determination. The District Court denied his petition. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that California\u2019s parole statute created a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause, and that \u201cCalifornia\u2019s \u2018some evidence\u2019 requirement\u201d was a \u201ccomponent\u201d of that federally protected liberty interest. <em>Cooke </em>v. <em>Solis, </em>606 F.3d 1206, 1213 (2010). It then concluded that the state court had made an \u201cunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence\u201d under \u00a7 2254(d)(2) by finding any evidence at all that Cooke would pose a threat to public safety if released. <em>Id., </em>at 1216 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">Respondent Elijah Clay was convicted of first-degree murder in 1978, and a California court sentenced him to imprisonment for seven years to life with the possibility of parole. In 2003, the board found Clay suitable for parole, but the Governor exercised his authority to review the case and found Clay unsuitable for parole. See Cal. Const., Art. 5, \u00a7 8(b); Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 3041.2 (West 2000). The Governor cited the gravity of Clay\u2019s crime; his extensive criminal history, which reflected \u201cthe culmination of a life of crime,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 116a; his failure to participate fully in self-help programs; and his unrealistic plans for employment and housing after being paroled. Regarding the last factor, the Governor concluded that Clay would be likely to return to crime, given his propensity for substance abuse and lack of a viable means of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">Clay filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in State Superior Court. That court denied Clay\u2019s petition, as did the California Court of Appeal. The California Supreme Court denied review.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-11\">Clay subsequently filed a federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which the District Court granted. The District</p>\n<p id=\"b837-12\">[562 U.S. 219]</p>\n<p id=\"b837-13\">Court concluded that the Governor\u2019s reliance on the nature of Clay\u2019s long-past commitment offense violated Clay\u2019s right to due process, and dismissed each of the other factors the Governor cited as unsupported by the record. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, agreeing with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe Governor\u2019s decision was an unreasonable application of California\u2019s \u2018some evidence\u2019 rule and was an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.\u201d <em>Clay </em>v. <em>Kane, </em>384 Fed. Appx. 544, 546 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">In granting habeas relief based on its conclusion that the state courts had misapplied California\u2019s \u201csome evidence\u201d rule, the Ninth Circuit must have assumed either that federal habeas relief is available for an error of state law, or that correct application of the State\u2019s \u201csome evidence\u201d standard is required by the federal Due Process Clause. Neither assumption is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">As to the first:  The habeas statute \u201cunambiguously provides that a federal court may issue a writ of ha-beas corpus to a state prisoner \u2018only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Corcoran, ante, </em>at 5, 131 S. Ct. 13, 178 L. Ed. 2d 276 <em>(per curiam) </em>(quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a)). \u201cWe have stated many times that \u2018federal habeas corpus relief does not he for errors of state law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 67, 112 S. Ct. 475, 116 L. Ed. 2d 385 (1991) (quoting <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Jeffers, </em>497 U.S. 764, 780, 110 S. Ct. 3092, 111 L. Ed. 2d 606 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">As for the Due Process Clause, standard analysis under that provision proceeds in two steps: We first ask whether there exists a liberty or property interest of which a person has been deprived, and if so we ask whether the procedures followed by the State were constitutionally sufficient. <em>Kentucky Dept. of Corrections </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>490 U.S. 454, 460, 109 S. Ct. 1904, 104 L. Ed. 2d 506 (1989). Here, the Ninth Circuit held that California law creates a liberty interest in parole, see 606 F.3d, at 1213. While we have no need to review that holding here, it is a</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">[562 U.S. 220]</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">reasonable application of our cases. See <em>Board of Pardons </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>482 U.S. 369, 373-381, 107 S. Ct. 2415, 96 L. Ed. 2d 303 (1987); <em>Greenholtz </em>v. <em>Inmates of Neb. Penal and Correctional Complex, </em>442 U.S. 1, 12, 99 S. Ct. 2100, 60 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">Whatever liberty interest exists is, of course, a <em>state </em>interest created by California law.  There is no right under the Federal Constitution to be conditionally released before the expiration of a valid sentence, and the States are under no duty to offer parole to their prisoners. <em>Id., </em>at 7, 99 S. Ct. 2100, 60 L. Ed. 2d 668. When, however, a State creates a liberty interest, the Due Process Clause requires fair procedures for its vindication\u2014and federal courts will review the application of those constitutionally required procedures. In the context of parole, we have held that the procedures required are minimal. In <em>Greenholtz, </em>we found that a prisoner subject to a parole statute similar to California\u2019s received adequate process when he was allowed an opportunity to be heard and was provided a statement of the reasons why parole was denied. <em>Id., </em>at 16, 99 S. Ct. 2100, 60 L. Ed. 2d 668. \u201cThe Constitution,\u201d we held, \u201cdoes not require more.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Cooke and Clay received at least this amount of process: They were allowed to speak at their parole hearings and to contest the evidence against them, were afforded access to their records in advance, and were notified as to the reasons why parole was denied. 606 F.3d, at 1208-1212; App. to Pet. for Cert. 69a-80a; Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 3041, 3041.5 (West Supp. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-11\">That should have been the beginning and the end of the federal habeas courts\u2019 inquiry into whether Cooke and Clay received due process. Instead, however, the Court of Appeals reviewed the state courts\u2019 decisions on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>the merits and concluded that they had unreasonably determined the facts in light of the evidence. See 606 F.3d, at 1213-1216; 384 Fed. Appx., at 545-546. Other Ninth Circuit cases have done the same. See, <em>e.g., Pearson </em>v. <em>Muntz, </em>606 F.3d 606, 611 (2010) <em>(per curiam). </em>No opinion of ours supports converting California\u2019s \u201csome evidence\u201d rule into a substantive</p>\n<p id=\"Acsn\">[562 U.S. 221]</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">federal requirement. The liberty interest at issue here is the interest in receiving parole when the California standards for parole have been met, and the minimum procedures adequate for due process protection of that interest are those set forth in <em>Greenholtz.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> See Hayward </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>603 F.3d 546, 559 (CA9 2010) (en banc). <em>Greenholtz </em>did not inquire into whether the constitutionally requisite procedures provided by Nebraska produced the result that the evidence required; <em>a fortiori </em>it is no federal concern here whether California\u2019s \u201csome evidence\u201d rule of judicial review (a procedure beyond what the Constitution demands) was correctly applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">It will not do to pronounce California\u2019s \u201csome evidence\u201d rule to be \u201ca component\u201d of the liberty interest, 606 F.3d, at 1213. Such reasoning would subject to federal-court merits review the application of all state-prescribed procedures in cases involving liberty or property interests, including (of course) those in criminal prosecutions. That has never</p>\n<p id=\"AqCSy\">[562 U.S. 222]</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">been the law. To the contrary, we have long recognized that  \u201ca \u2018mere error of state law\u2019 is not a denial of due process.\u201d <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Isaac, </em>456 U.S. 107, 121, n. 21, 102 S. Ct. 1558, 71 L. Ed. 2d 783 (1982); see also <em>Estelle, </em>502 U.S., at 67-68, 112 S. Ct. 475, 116 L. Ed. 2d 385. Because the only federal right at issue is procedural, the relevant inquiry is what process Cooke and Clay received, not whether the state court decided the case correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">The Ninth Circuit\u2019s questionable finding that there was <em>no </em>evidence in the record supporting the parole denials is irrelevant unless there is a federal right at stake, as \u00a7 2254(a) requires. See <em>id., </em>at 67, 112 S. Ct. 475, 116 L. Ed. 2d 385. The short of the matter is that the responsibility for ensuring that the constitutionally adequate procedures governing California\u2019s parole system are properly applied rests with California courts, and is no part of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondents\u2019 motions for leave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>are granted.</p>\n<p id=\"AxmT\">The judgments below are reversed,</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b839-12\"> Cooke and Clay argue that the greater protections afforded to the revocation of good-time credits should apply, citing <em>In re Rosenkrantz, </em>29 Cal. 4th 616, 657-658, 59 P.3d 174, 205 (2002), a California Supreme Court case that refers to our good-time-credits decision in <em>Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Institution at Walpole </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 105 S. Ct. 2768, 86 L. Ed. 2d 356 (1985). But <em>Rosenkrantz </em>did not purport to equate California\u2019s parole system with good-time credits. It cites <em>Hill </em>twice. The first citation merely observes that the court relied upon <em>Hill </em>in an earlier opinion adopting the \u201csome evidence\u2019\u2019 test for decisions to <em>revoke </em>parole that had previously been granted. 29 Cal. 4th, at 656, 59 P.3d, at 204. The second citation, which does occur in the part of the opinion discussing the need for \u201csome evidence\u2019\u2019 review in parole decisions, simply borrows language from <em>Hill </em>to support the proposition that \u201c \u2018[requiring a modicum of evidence\u2019 \u2019\u2019 can \u201c \u2018help to prevent arbitrary deprivations.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 29 Cal. 4th, at 658, 59 P.3d, at 205 (quoting <em>Hill, </em>472 U.S., at 455, 105 S. Ct. 2768, 86 L. Ed. 2d 356). In any event,  the question of which due process requirements apply is one of federal law, not California law; and neither of these citations comes close to addressing that question. Any doubt on that score is resolved by a subsequent footnote stating that the court\u2019s decision is premised only on state law. 29 Cal. 4th, at 658, n. 12, 59 P.3d, at 205, n. 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b840-4\">SEPARATE OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b840-5\">Justice Ginsburg,</author>\n<p id=\"AZVb\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">In <em>Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Institution at Walpole </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 455, 105 S. Ct. 2768, 86 L. Ed. 2d 356 (1985), this Court held that, to comply with due process, revocation of a prisoner\u2019s good time credits must be supported by \u201csome evidence.\u201d If California law entitled prisoners to parole upon satisfaction of specified criteria, then <em>Hill </em>would be closely in point. See <em>In re Rosenkrantz, </em>29 Cal. 4th 616, 657-658, 59 P.3d 174, 205 (2002). The Ninth Circuit, however, has determined that for California\u2019s parole system, as for Nebraska\u2019s, <em>Greenholtz </em>v. <em>Inmates of Neb. Penal and Correctional Complex, </em>442 U.S. 1, 99 S. Ct. 2100, 60 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1979), is the controlling precedent. <em>Hayward </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>603 F.3d 546, 559-561 (2010) (en banc).
