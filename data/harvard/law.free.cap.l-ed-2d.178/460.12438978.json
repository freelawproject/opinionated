Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611 (1978), this Court held that  civil rights plaintiffs</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">[562 U.S. 31]</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">suing a municipal entity under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 must show that their injury was caused by a municipal policy or custom. The case before the Court in <em>Monell </em>directly involved monetary damages. The question presented is whether the \u201cpolicy or custom\u201d requirement also applies when plaintiffs seek prospective relief, such as an injunction or a declaratory judgment. We conclude that it does so apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b566-18\">The case arises out of the following circumstances:  The California Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act, Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 11164 <em>et seq. </em>(West Rev. Supp. 2010), requires law enforcement and other state agencies to investigate allegations of child abuse. These agencies must report to the California Department of Justice all instances of reported child abuse the agency finds \u201cnot unfounded,\u201d even if they are \u201cinconclusive or unsubstantiated.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 11169(a), 11170(a)(3). The statute requires the department to include all these reports in a Child Abuse Central Index (Index), where they remain available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>to various state agencies for at least 10 years. \u00a7 11170(a). The statute also says that if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-4\">\u201ca report has previously been filed which subsequently proves to be unfounded, the Department of Justice shall be notified in writing of that fact and shall not retain the report.\u201d \u00a7 11169(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The statute, however, does not set forth procedures for reviewing whether a previously filed report is unfounded, or for allowing individuals to challenge their inclusion in the Index. Nor, up until the time of this lawsuit, had California or Los Angeles County created any such procedures. But cf. \u00a7 11170(a)(2) (\u201cThe submitting agencies are responsible for the accuracy, completeness, and retention of the reports described in this section\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The two plaintiffs in this case were initially accused of child abuse. But they were later exonerated. They sought to have their names removed from the Index. Unable to</p>\n<p id=\"AzPxi\">[562 U.S. 32]</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">convince the Los Angeles Sheriffs Department to remove them, they filed this \u00a7 1983 case against the attorney general of California, the Los Angeles County sheriff, two detectives in the sheriffs department, and the County of Los Angeles. They sought damages, an injunction, and a declaration that the defendants had deprived them of their constitutional rights by failing to create a procedural mechanism through which one could contest inclusion on the Index. See U. S. Const., Arndt. 14; Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1979, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The District Court for the Central District of California granted summary judgment to all of the defendants on the ground that California had not deprived the plaintiffs of a constitutionally protected \u201cliberty\u201d interest. But on appeal the Ninth Circuit disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">The Ninth Circuit held that the Fourteenth Amendment required the State to provide those included on the list notice and \u201c \u2018some kind of hearing.\u2019\u201d 554 F.3d 1170, 1201 (2009). Thus the Circuit held that the plaintiffs were entitled to declaratory relief, and it believed that (on remand) they might prove damages as well. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">The Ninth Circuit also held that the plaintiffs were prevailing parties, thereby entitled to approximately $600,000 in attorney\u2019s fees. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b) (providing for payment of attorney\u2019s fees to parties prevailing on \u00a7 1983 claims). See No. 05-56467 (June 22, 2009), App. to Pet. for Cert. 1-4 (hereinafter First Fee Order); No. 05-56467 (Dec. 2, 2009), App. to Reply to Brief in Opposition 1-2 (hereinafter Second Fee Order). The Ninth Circuit wrote that Los Angeles County must pay approximately $60,000 of this amount. First Fee Order 3; Second Fee Order 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">Los Angeles County denied that it was liable and therefore that it could be held responsible for attorney\u2019s fees. It argued that, in respect to the county, the plaintiffs were not prevailing parties. That is because the county is a municipal entity. Under Monell\u2019s holding a municipal entity is liable under \u00a7 1983 only if a municipal <em>\u201cpolicy or </em>custom\u201d caused a</p>\n<p id=\"Aab8\">[562 U.S. 33]</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">plaintiff to be deprived of a federal right. 436 U.S., at 694, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611 (emphasis added). And it was <em>state </em>policy, not <em>county </em>policy, that brought about any deprivation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">The Ninth Circuit responded to this argument as follows: First, it said that county policy <em>might </em>be responsible for the deprivation. It \u201cis possible,\u201d the Ninth Circuit said, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>county, \u201c[b]y failing to\u201d \u201ccreat[e] an independent procedure that would allow\u201d the plaintiffs \u201cto challenge their listing [,] . . . adopted a custom and policy that violated\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cconstitutional rights.\u201d 554 F.3d, at 1202. Second, it said that \u201cbecause this issue is not clear based on the record before us on appeal ... we remand to the district court to determine the County\u2019s liability under <em>Monell.\u201d Ibid. </em>Third, it saw no reason to remand in respect to the county\u2019s obligation to pay $60,000 in attorney\u2019s fees. That, it wrote, is because <em>\u201cin our circuit . . . the limitations to liability established, in Monell do not apply to claims for prospective relief\u201d </em>such as the declaratory judgment that the Circuit had ordered entered. First Fee Order 3-4 (citing <em>Chaloux </em>v. <em>Killeen, </em>886 F.2d 247, 250 (CA9 1989); <em>Truth </em>v. <em>Kent School Dist., </em>542 F.3d 634, 644 (CA9 2008); emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">The county then asked us to review this last-mentioned Ninth Circuit holding, namely, the holding that Monell\u2019s \u201cpolicy or custom\u201d requirement applies only to claims for damages but not to claims for prospective relief. Because the Courts of Appeals are divided on this question, we granted the county\u2019s petition for cer-tiorari. Compare <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Giuliani, </em>506 F.3d 183, 191 (CA2 2007) (holding that Monell\u2019s \u201cpolicy or custom\u201d requirement applies to claims for prospective relief as well as claims for damages); <em>Dirrane </em>v. <em>Brookline Police Dept., </em>315 F.3d 65, 71 (CA1 2002) (same); <em>Greensboro Professional Fire Fighters Assn., Local 3157 </em>v. <em>Greensboro, </em>64 F.3d 962, 967, n. 6 (CA4 1995) (applying the <em>Monell </em>requirement to a prospective relief claim); <em>Church </em>v. <em>Huntsville, </em>30 F.3d 1332, 1347 (CA11 1994) (same), with</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">[562 U.S. 34]</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\"><em>Chaloux, supra, </em>at 251 (holding that <em>Monell </em>does not apply to prospective relief claims). See also <em>Gernetzke </em>v. <em>Kenosha Unified School Dist. No. 1, </em>274 F.3d 464, 468 (CA7 2001) (reserving the question but noting the \u201cpredominant\u201d view that \u201cMonell\u2019s holding applies regardless of the nature of the relief sought\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">We conclude that Monell\u2019s holding applies to \u00a7 1983 claims against municipalities for prospective relief as well as to claims for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">We begin with \u00a7 1983 itself, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-12\">\u201cEvery <em>person </em>who, under color of any [state] statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage . . . subjects, or causes to be subjected, any . . . other person . . . to the deprivation of any rights . . . secured by the Constitution and laws [of the United States], shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-13\">In 1961, in <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Pape, </em>365 U.S. 167, 81 S. Ct. 473, 5 L. Ed. 2d 492, this Court held that municipal entities were not \u201cperson[s]\u201d under \u00a7 1983. The Court based this conclusion on the history of the Civil Rights Act of 187l\u2019s enactment. It noted that Congress rejected an amendment (called the Sherman amendment) that would have made municipalities liable for damage done by <em>private </em>persons \u201c \u2018riotously and tumultuously assembled.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 188-190, and n. 38, 81 S. Ct. 473, 5 L. Ed. 2d 492 (quoting Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 663 (1871)). This rejection, the Court thought, reflected a determination by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>the 1871 House of Representatives that \u201c \u2018Congress had no constitutional power to impose <em>any obligation </em>upon county and town organizations, the mere instrumentality for the administration of state law.\u2019 \u201d 365 U.S., at 190, 81 S. Ct. 473, 5 L. Ed. 2d 492 (quoting Cong. Globe, <em>supra, </em>at 804 (statement of Rep. Poland); emphasis added). The Court concluded that Congress must have doubted its \u201cconstitutional</p>\n<p id=\"AaVNN\">[562 U.S. 35]</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">power ... to impose civil liability on municipalities.\u201d 365 U.S., at 190, 81 S. Ct. 473, 5 L. Ed. 2d 492. And for that reason, Congress must have intended to exclude municipal corporations as \u00a7 1983 defendants. The statute\u2019s key term \u201cperson\u201d therefore did not cover municipal entities. <em>Id., </em>at 191, 81 S. Ct. 473, 5 L. Ed. 2d 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Sixteen years later, in <em>Monell, </em>the Court reconsidered the question of municipal liability. After reexamining the 1871 legislative history in detail, the Court concluded that Congress had rejected the Sherman amendment, not because it would have imposed liability upon municipalities, but because it would have imposed liability upon municipalities based purely upon the <em>acts of others. </em>That is to say, the rejected amendment would have imposed liability upon local governments \u201cwithout regard to whether a local government <em>was in any way at fault </em>for the breach of the peace for which it was to be held for damages.\u201d 436 U.S., at 681, n. 40, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611 (emphasis added). In Monell\u2019s view Congress may have thought that it lacked the power to impose that kind of indirect liability upon municipalities, <em>id., </em>at 679, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611, but \u201cnothing said in debate on the Sherman amendment would have prevented holding a municipality liable ... for <em>its own </em>violations of the Fourteenth Amendment,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 683, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611 (emphasis added). The Court, overruling <em>Monroe, </em>held that  municipalities were \u201cpersons\u201d under \u00a7 1983. 436 U.S., at 690, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">The Court also concluded that a municipality could not be held liable under \u00a7 1983 solely because it employed a tortfeasor. The Court\u2019s conclusion rested on \u201cthe language of \u00a7 1983, read against the background of the same legislative history.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 691, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611.  Section 1983\u2019s causation language imposes liability on a \u201c \u2018person who . . . shall subject, or cause to be subjected, any person\u2019 \u201d to a deprivation of federal rights. <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting 17 Stat. 13; emphasis deleted). That language, the Court observed, could not \u201cbe easily read to impose liability vicariously . . . solely on the basis of the existence of an employer-employee relationship with a tortfeasor.\u201d 436 U.S., at 692, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611. The statute\u2019s legislative history,</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">[562 U.S. 36]</p>\n<p id=\"b569-12\">in particular the constitutional objections that had been raised to the Sherman amendment, supported this conclusion. <em>Id., </em>at 692-694, and n. 57, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-13\">For these reasons, the Court concluded that  a municipality could be held liable under \u00a7 1983 only for its own violations of federal law. <em>Id., </em>at 694, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611. The Court described what made a violation a municipality\u2019s <em>own </em>violation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-14\">\u201cLocal governing bodies, therefore, can be sued directly under \u00a7 1983 for monetary, declaratory, or injunctive relief where, as here, the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body\u2019s officers. . . . [They can also be sued for] deprivations visited pursuant to governmental \u2018custom\u2019 even though such a custom has not received formal approval through the body\u2019s official decisionmaking channels.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 690-691, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">The Court has also included the terms \u201cusage\u201d and \u201cpractice\u201d as customs for which liability is appropriate. See <em>ibid. </em>The length of this list of types of municipal action leads us here to use a shorthand term \u201cpolicy or custom,\u201d but when we do so, we mean to refer to the entire list. See <em>id., </em>at 694, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611 (using the shorthand \u201cpolicy or custom\u201d); see also, <em>e.g., Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Barnstable School Comm., </em>555 U.S. 246, 257-258, 129 S. Ct. 788, 172 L. Ed. 2d 582 (2009) (using the phrase \u201ccustom, policy, or practice,\u201d to describe municipal liability under \u00a7 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">In sum, in <em>Monell </em>the Court held that  \u201ca municipality cannot be held liable\u201d solely for the acts of others, <em>e.g., \u201csolely </em>because it employs a tort-feasor.\u201d 436 U.S., at 691, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611. But the municipality may be held liable \u201cwhen execution of a government\u2019s <em>policy or custom . . . </em>inflicts the injury.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 694, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The language of \u00a7 1983 read in light of Monell\u2019s understanding of the legislative history explains why  claims for</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">[562 U.S. 37]</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">prospective relief, like claims for money damages, fall within the scope of the \u201cpolicy or custom\u201d requirement. Nothing in the text of \u00a7 1983 suggests that the causation requirement contained in the statute should change with the form of relief sought. In fact, the text suggests the opposite when  it provides that a person who meets \u00a7 1983\u2019s elements \u201cshall be liable ... in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\u201d Thus, as <em>Monell </em>explicitly stated, \u201c[l]ocal governing bodies .. . can be sued directly under \u00a7 1983 for monetary, <em>declaratory, or injunctive relief </em>where, as here, the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes\u201d a policy or custom. 436 U.S., at 690, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611 (emphasis added). <em>Monell </em>went on to quote this Court\u2019s statement in a 1973 case, <em>Kenosha </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>412 U.S. 507, 513, 93 S. Ct. 2222, 37 L. Ed. 2d 109, to the effect that  the Congress that enacted \u00a7 1983 did not intend the \u201c \u2018generic word \u201cperson\u201d . . . <em>to have a bifurcated application to municipal corporations depending on the nature of the relief sought against them.\u2019 \u201d </em>436 U.S., at 701, n. 66, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611 (emphasis added). <em>Monell </em>added that \u201c[n]othing we say today affects\u201d this <em>pre-Monell </em>\u201cconclusion.\u201d <em>Ibid-</em></p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\"><em>Monell\u2019s </em>logic also argues against any such relief-based bifurcation. The <em>Monell </em>Court thought that Congress intended potential \u00a7 1983 liability where a municipality\u2019s <em>own </em>violations were at issue but not where only the violations of <em>others </em>were at issue. The \u201cpolicy or custom\u201d requirement rests upon that distinction and embodies it in law. To find the requirement inapplicable where prospective relief is at issue would undermine Monell\u2019s logic. For whether an action or omission is a municipality\u2019s \u201cown\u201d has to do with the nature of the action or omission, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>not with the nature of the relief that is later sought in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The Humphrieses\u2019 (hereinafter respondents) arguments to the contrary are unconvincing. Respondents correctly note that by the time <em>Monell </em>reached the Supreme Court only the plaintiffs\u2019 damages claim remained live. See <em>id., </em>at 661, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">[562 U.S. 38]</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">From this fact they conclude that the Court\u2019s holding applies directly only to claims for monetary damages. A holding, however, can extend through its logic beyond the specific facts of the particular case. It does so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Respondents add that not only did <em>Monell </em>involve a damages claim, but its holding rests upon the concern that municipalities might have to pay large damages awards. The Court so suggests when it points out that municipalities should not be liable for an employee\u2019s wrongful acts, simply by applying agency-based principles of <em>respondeat superior. </em>But as we have pointed out, the Court\u2019s rejection of <em>respondeat superior </em>liability primarily rested not on the municipality\u2019s economic needs, but on the fact that liability in such a case does not arise out of the municipality\u2019s own wrongful conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">Respondents further claim that, where prospective relief is at issue, <em>Monell </em>is redundant. They say that a court cannot grant prospective relief against a municipality unless the municipality\u2019s own conduct has caused the violation. Hence, where such relief is otherwise proper, the <em>Monell </em>requirement \u201cshouldn\u2019t screen out any case.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">To argue that a requirement is necessarily satisfied, however, is not to argue that its satisfaction is unnecessary. If respondents are right, our holding may have limited practical significance. But that possibility does not provide us with a convincing reason to sow confusion by adopting a bifurcated relief-based approach to municipal liability that the Court has previously rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-12\">Finally, respondents make the mirror-image argument that applying Monell\u2019s requirement to prospective relief claims will leave some set of ongoing constitutional violations beyond redress. Despite the fact that four Circuits apply Monell\u2019s requirement to prospective relief, however, respondents have not presented us with any actual or hypothetical example that provides serious cause for concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-13\">[562 U.S. 39]</p>\n<p id=\"pA691\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"35\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAARoAAAAiAQAAAAColitjAAAAmElEQVR4nO3UMQoCQQyF4X/iFBaCpaX2XkLBg3gED+DdHE9g6ymWFSxEwVgmxYO12EpM9z0SyECY4gzW2YZ74N/0fVOfAwUDrjlXGHWn+3QVljDoUqxhMM8nJVFhdthHLlFhsjhGLmHALr9Ewv299iiFZvDcbmJWw73vljGs0AxuJW2h4f66nGJYoRnUR1pDYrwrKD/9F3wA+CyG2iefvgoAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"282\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b571-14\">For these reasons, we hold that Monell\u2019s \u201cpolicy or custom\u201d requirement applies in \u00a7 1983 cases irrespective of whether the relief sought is monetary or prospective. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s contrary judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-15\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-16\">Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
