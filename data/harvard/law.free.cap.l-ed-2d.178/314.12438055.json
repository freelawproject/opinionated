Their transgression was to have arrived at the event in a car that displayed a bumper sticker reading \u201cNo More Blood For Oil.\u201d After they were marched out, they allege, Secret Service officials confirmed to them that the bumper sticker was the reason for their exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-17\">I cannot see how reasonable public officials, or any staff or volunteers under their direction, could have viewed the bumper sticker as a permissible reason for depriving Weise and Young of access to the event. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals held respondents entitled to qualified immunity because \u201cno specific authority instructs this court . . . how to treat the ejection of a silent attendee from an official speech based on the attendee\u2019s protected expression outside the speech area.\u201d 593 F.3d 1163, 1170 (CA10 2010). No \u201cspecific authority\u201d should have been needed; \u201c[f] or at least a [half]-century, this Court has made clear that . . . [the government] may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interests.\u201d <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Sindermann, </em>408 U.S. 593, 597, 92 S. Ct. 2694, 33 L. Ed. 2d 570 (1972). As Judge Holloway noted in his incisive dissent, solidly established law \u201cmay apply with obvious clarity\u201d even to conduct startling in its novelty. 593 F.3d, at 1177 (quoting <em>Hope </em>v. <em>Pelzer, </em>536 U.S. 730, 741, 122 S. Ct. 2508, 153 L. Ed. 2d 666 (2002); emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-18\">The Court of Appeals suggested that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hurley </em>v. <em>Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., </em>515 U.S. 557, 115 S. Ct. 2338, 132 L. Ed. 2d 487 (1995), could have justified a decision to exclude individuals who appear to disagree with the President\u2019s views. But the comparison serves only to highlight the unlawfulness of Weise\u2019s and Young\u2019s alleged treatment: Not only was this an official presentation of the President\u2019s views, not a private act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>of expression as in <em>Hurley, </em>in addition, unlike the <em>Hurley </em>plaintiff who sought to engage in competing expression, Weise and Young were <em>\u201csilent </em>attendee[s],\u201d 593 F.3d, at 1170 (emphasis added). Their presence alone cannot have affected the President\u2019s message. Therefore, ejecting them for holding discordant views could only have been a reprisal for the expression conveyed by the bumper sticker. \u201cOfficial reprisal for protected speech \u2018offends the Constitution because it threatens to inhibit exercise of the protected right.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hartman </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>547 U.S. 250, 256, 126 S. Ct. 1695, 164 L. Ed. 2d 441 (2006) (quoting <em>Crawford-El </em>v. <em>Britton, </em>523 U.S. 574, 588, n. 10, 118 S. Ct. 1584, 140 L. Ed. 2d 759 (1998); brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\">I see only one arguable reason for deferring the question this case presents. Respondents were volunteers following instructions from White House officials. The Volunteer Protection Act of 1997, 111 Stat. 218, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501 <em>et seq., </em>had respondents invoked it in the courts below, might have shielded them from liability. Federal officials themselves, however, gain no shelter from that Act. Suits against the officials responsible for Weise\u2019s and Young\u2019s ouster remain pending and may offer this Court an opportunity to take up the issue avoided today.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
