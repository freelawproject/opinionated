Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624. Here, as in <em>Richter, </em>the Court reviews a deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>sion of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granting federal habeas corpus relief in a challenge to a state criminal conviction. Here, too, the case turns on the proper implementation of one of the stated premises for issuance of federal habeas corpus contained in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), the instruction that federal habeas corpus relief may not be granted with respect to any claim a state court has adjudicated on the merits unless, among other exceptions, the state court\u2019s decision denying relief involves \u201can unreasonable application\u201d of \u201cclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d And, as in <em>Richter, </em>the relevant clearly established law derives from <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), which provides the standard for inadequate assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment. <em>Richter </em>involves a California conviction and addresses the adequacy of representation when counsel did not consult or use certain experts in pretrial preparation and at trial. The instant case involves an unrelated Oregon conviction and concerns the adequacy of representation in providing an assessment of a plea bargain without first seeking suppression of a confession assumed to have been improperly obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">On December 7, 1995, respondent Randy Moore and two confederates attacked Kenneth Rogers at his home and bloodied him before tying him with duct tape and throwing</p>\n<p id=\"AW7df\">[562 U.S. 119]</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">him in the trunk of a car. They drove into the Oregon countryside, where Moore shot Rogers in the temple, killing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">Afterwards, Moore and one of his accomplices told two people\u2014Moore\u2019s brother and the accomplice\u2019s girlfriend\u2014about the crimes. According to Moore\u2019s brother, Moore and his accomplice admitted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-10\">\u201c[T]o make an example and put some scare into Mr. Rogers . . . , they had blind-folded him [and] duct taped him and put him in the trunk of the car and took him out to a place that\u2019s a little remote . . . .

On the advice of counsel Moore agreed to plead no contest to felony murder in exchange for a sentence of 300 months, the minimum sentence allowed by law for the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-13\">Moore later filed for postconviction relief in an Oregon state court, alleging that he had been denied his right to effective assistance of counsel. He complained that his lawyer had not filed a motion to suppress his confession to police in advance of the lawyer\u2019s advice that Moore considered before accepting the plea offer. After an evidentiary hearing, the Oregon court concluded a \u201cmotion to suppress would have been fruitless\u201d in light of the other admissible confession by Moore, to which two witnesses could testify. <em>Id., </em>at 140. As the court noted, Moore\u2019s trial counsel explained why he did not move to exclude Moore\u2019s confession to police:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-14\">\u201cMr. Moore and I discussed the possibility of filing a Motion to Suppress and concluded that it would be unavailing, because ... he had previously made a full confession to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>his brother and to [his accomplice\u2019s girlfriend], either</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-4\">[562 U.S. 120]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-5\">one of whom could have been called as a witness at any time to repeat his confession in full detail.\u201d Jordan Affidavit (Feb. 26, 1999), App. to Pet. for Cert. 70, \u00b6 4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Counsel added that he had made Moore aware of the possibility of being charged with aggravated murder, which carried a potential death sentence, as well as the possibility of a sentence of life imprisonment without parole. See Ore. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 163.105(l)(a) (1995). The intense and serious abuse to the victim before the shooting might well have led the State to insist on a strong response. In light of these facts the Oregon court concluded Moore had not established ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Moore filed a petition for habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, renewing his ineffective-assistance claim. The District Court denied the petition, finding sufficient evidence to support the Oregon court\u2019s conclusion that suppression would not have made a difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Czerniak, </em>574 F.3d 1092 (2009). In its view the state court\u2019s conclusion that counsel\u2019s action did not constitute ineffective assistance was an unreasonable application of clearly established law in light of <em>Strickland </em>and was contrary to <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 111 S. Ct. 1246, 113 L. Ed. 2d 302 (1991). Six judges dissented from denial of rehearing en banc. 574 F.3d, at 1162.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">We granted certiorari <em>sub nom.

Ed. 2d 361 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">The statutory authority of federal courts to issue habeas corpus relief for persons in state custody is defined by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, as amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). The text of \u00a7 2254(d) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-13\">\u201cAn application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-14\">[562 U.S. 121]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-15\">State court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-16\">\u201c(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-17\">\u201c(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-18\">AEDPA prohibits federal habeas relief for any claim adjudicated on the merits in state court, unless one of the exceptions listed in \u00a7 2254(d) obtains. Relevant here is \u00a7 2254(d)(l)\u2019s exception \u201cpermitting relitigation where the earlier state decision resulted from an \u2018unreasonable application of\u2019 clearly established federal law.\u201d <em>Richter, ante, </em>at 100, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624. The applicable federal law consists of the rules for determining when a criminal defendant has received inadequate representation as defined in <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b761-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>To establish ineffective assistance of counsel \u201ca defendant must show both deficient performance by counsel and prejudice.\u201d <em>Knowles </em>v. <em>Mirzayance, </em>556 U.S. 111, 122, 129 S. Ct. 1411, 173 L. Ed. 2d 251 (2009). In addressing this standard and its relationship to AEDPA, the Court today in <em>Richter, ante, </em>at 104-105, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624, gives the following explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-4\">\u201cTo establish deficient performance, a person challenging a conviction must show that \u2018counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of rea-sonableness.\u2019 <em>[Strickland,] </em>466 U.S., at 688 [104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674], A court considering a claim of ineffective assistance must apply a \u2018strong presumption\u2019 that counsel\u2019s representation was within the \u2018wide range\u2019 of reasonable professional assistance. <em>Id., </em>at 689 [104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674], The challenger\u2019s burden is to show \u2018that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-5\">[562 U.S. 122]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-6\">not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 687 [104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-7\">\u201cWith respect to prejudice, a challenger must demonstrate \u2018a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u2019. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-8\">\u201c \u2018  Surmounting Strickland\u2019s high bar is never an easy task.\u2019 <em>Padilla </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. 356, 371 [130 S. Ct. 1473, 176 L. Ed. 2d 284] (2010). An ineffective-assistance claim can function as a way to escape rules of waiver and forfeiture and raise issues not presented at trial [or in pretrial proceedings], and so the <em>Strickland </em>standard must be applied with scrupulous care, lest \u2018intrusive post-trial inquiry\u2019 threaten the integrity of the very adversary process the right to counsel is meant to serve. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S., at 689-690 [104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674]. Even under <em>de novo </em>review, the standard for judging counsel\u2019s representation is a most deferential one. Unlike a later reviewing court, the attorney observed the relevant proceedings, knew of materials outside the record, and interacted with the client, with opposing counsel, and with the judge. It is \u2018all too tempting\u2019 to \u2018second-guess counsel\u2019s assistance after conviction or adverse sentence.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 689 [104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674]; see also <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Cone, </em>535 U.S. 685, 702 [122 S. Ct. 1843, 152 L. Ed. 2d 914] (2002); <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>Fretwell, </em>506 U.S. 364, 372 [113 S. Ct. 838, 122 L. Ed. 2d 180] (1993). The question is whether an attorney\u2019s representation amounted to incompetence under \u2018prevailing professional norms,\u2019 not whether it deviated from best practices or most common custom. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S., at 690 [104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-11\">\u201cEstablishing that a state court\u2019s application of <em>Strickland </em>was unreasonable under \u00a7 2254(d) is ah the more difficult.  The standards created by <em>Strickland </em>and \u00a7 2254(d) are both \u2018highly deferential,\u2019 <em>id., </em>at 689 [104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674]; <em>Lindh </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>521 U.S. 320, 333, n. 7 [117 S. Ct. 2059, 138 L. Ed. 2d 481] (1997), and when the two apply in tandem, review is \u2018doubly\u2019 so, <em>Knowles, </em>556 U.S., at 123 [129 S. Ct. 1411, 173 L. Ed. 2d 251], The <em>Strickland </em>standard is</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axhs\">[562 U.S. 123]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-12\">a general one, so the range of reasonable applications is substantial. 556 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>U.S., at 123 [129 S. Ct. 1411, 173 L. Ed. 2d 251]. Federal habeas courts must guard against the danger of equating unreasonableness under <em>Strickland </em>with unreasonableness under \u00a7 2254(d). When \u00a7 2254(d) applies, the question is not whether counsel\u2019s actions were reasonable. The question is whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>deferential standard.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The question becomes whether Moore\u2019s counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to seek suppression of Moore\u2019s confession to police before advising Moore regarding the plea. Finding that any \u201cmotion to suppress would have been fruitless,\u201d the state postconviction court concluded that Moore had not received ineffective assistance of counsel. App. 140. The state court did not specify whether this was because there was no deficient performance under <em>Strickland </em>or because Moore suffered no <em>Strickland </em>prejudice, or both. To overcome the limitation imposed by \u00a7 2254(d), the Court of Appeals had to conclude that both findings would have involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. <em>See Richter, ante, </em>at 109-110, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624. In finding that this standard was met, the Court of Appeals erred, for the state-court decision was not an unreasonable application of either part of the <em>Strickland </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">The Court of Appeals was wrong to accord scant deference to counsel\u2019s judgment, and doubly wrong to conclude it would have been unreasonable to find that the defense attorney qualified as counsel for Sixth Amendment purposes. <em>Knowles, supra, </em>at 123, 129 S. Ct. 1411, 173 L. Ed. 2d 251; <em>Strickland, supra, </em>at 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. Counsel gave this explanation for his decision to discuss the plea bargain without first challenging Moore\u2019s confession to the police: that suppression would serve little purpose in</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">[562 U.S. 124]</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">light of Moore\u2019s other full and admissible confession, to which both his brother and his accomplice\u2019s girlfriend could testify. The state court would not have been unreasonable to accept this explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">Counsel also justified his decision by asserting that any motion to suppress was likely to fail. Reviewing the reasonableness of that justification is complicated by the possibility that petitioner forfeited one argument that would have supported its position: The Court of Appeals assumed that a motion would have succeeded because the warden did not argue otherwise. Of course that is not the same as a concession that no competent attorney would think a motion to suppress would have failed, which is the relevant question under <em>Strickland. See Kimmelman </em>v. <em>Morrison, 477 </em>U.S. 365, 382, 106 S. Ct. 2574, 91 L. Ed. 2d 305 (1986); <em>Richter, ante, </em>at 109-110, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624. It is unnecessary to consider whether counsel\u2019s second justification was reasonable, however, since the first and independent explanation\u2014that suppression would have been futile\u2014confirms that his representation was adequate under <em>Strickland, </em>or at least that it would have been reasonable for the state court to reach that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-13\">Acknowledging guilt and accepting responsibility by an early plea respond to certain basic premises in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>law and its function. Those principles are eroded if a guilty plea is too easily set aside based on facts and circumstances not apparent to a competent attorney when actions and advice leading to the plea took place. Plea bargains are the result of complex negotiations suffused with uncertainty, and defense attorneys must make careful strategic choices in balancing opportunities and risks. The opportunities, of course, include pleading to a lesser charge and obtaining a lesser sentence, as compared with what might be the outcome not only at trial but also from a later plea offer if the case grows stronger and prosecutors find stiffened resolve. A risk, in addition to the obvious one of losing the chance for a defense verdict, is that an early plea bargain might come</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">[562 U.S. 125]</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">before the prosecution finds its case is getting weaker, not stronger. The State\u2019s case can begin to fall apart as stories change, witnesses become unavailable, and new suspects are identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">These considerations make strict adherence to the <em>Strickland </em>standard all the more essential when reviewing the choices an attorney made at the plea bargain stage. Failure to respect the latitude <em>Strickland </em>requires can create at least two problems in the plea context. First, the potential for the distortions and imbalance that can inhere in a hindsight perspective may become all too real. The art of negotiation is at least as nuanced as the art of trial advocacy, and it presents questions further removed from immediate judicial supervision. There are, moreover, special difficulties in evaluating the basis for counsel\u2019s judgment: An attorney often has insights borne of past dealings with the same prosecutor or court, and the record at the pretrial stage is never as full as it is after a trial.  In determining how searching and exacting their review must be, habeas courts must respect their limited role in determining whether there was manifest deficiency in light of information then available to counsel. <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>Fretwell, </em>506 U.S. 364, 372, 113 S. Ct. 838, 122 L. Ed. 2d 180 (1993). AEDPA compounds the imperative of judicial caution.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">Second, ineffective-assistance claims that lack necessary foundation may bring instability to the very process the inquiry seeks to protect. <em>Strickland </em>allows a defendant \u201cto escape rules of waiver and forfeiture,\u201d <em>Richter, ante, </em>at 105, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624. Prosecutors must have assurance that a plea will not be undone years later because of infidelity to the requirements of AEDPA and the teachings of <em>Strickland. </em>The prospect that a plea deal will afterwards be unraveled when a court second-guesses counsel\u2019s decisions while failing to accord the latitude <em>Strickland </em>mandates or disregarding the structure dictated by AEDPA could lead prosecutors to forgo plea bargains that would benefit defendants, a result favorable to no one.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">[562 U.S. 126]</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">Whether before, during, or after trial, when the Sixth Amendment applies, the formulation of the standard is the same: reasonable competence in representing the accused. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S., at 688, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. In applying and defining this standard substantial deference must be accorded to counsel\u2019s judgment. <em>Id., </em>at 689, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. But at different stages of the case that deference may be measured in different ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">In the case of an early plea, neither the prosecution nor the defense may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>know with much certainty what course the case may take. It follows that each side, of necessity, risks consequences that may arise from contingencies or circumstances yet unperceived. The absence of a developed or an extensive record and the circumstance that neither the prosecution nor the defense case has been well defined create a particular risk that an after-the-fact assessment will run counter to the deference that must be accorded counsel\u2019s judgment and perspective when the plea was negotiated, offered, and entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Prosecutors in the present case faced the cost of litigation and the risk of trying their case without Moore\u2019s confession to the police. Moore\u2019s counsel could reasonably believe that a swift plea bargain would allow Moore to take advantage of the State\u2019s aversion to these hazards. And whenever cases involve multiple defendants, there is a chance that prosecutors might convince one defendant to testify against another in exchange for a better deal. Moore\u2019s plea eliminated that possibility and ended an ongoing investigation. Delaying the plea for further proceedings would have given the State time to uncover additional incriminating evidence that could have formed the basis of a capital prosecution. It must be remembered, after all, that Moore\u2019s claim that it was an accident when he shot the victim through the temple might be disbelieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">It is not clear how the successful exclusion of the confession would have affected counsel\u2019s strategic calculus. The prosecution had at its disposal two witnesses able to relate</p>\n<p id=\"AbVej\">[562 U.S. 127]</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">another confession. True, Moore\u2019s brother and the girlfriend of his accomplice might have changed their accounts in a manner favorable to Moore. But the record before the state court reveals no reason to believe that either witness would violate the legal obligation to convey the content of Moore\u2019s confession. And to the extent that his accomplice\u2019s girlfriend had an ongoing interest in the matter, she might have been tempted to put more blame, not less, on Moore. Then, too, the accomplices themselves might have decided to implicate Moore to a greater extent than his own confession did, say by indicating that Moore shot the victim deliberately, not accidentally. All these possibilities are speculative. What counsel knew at the time was that the existence of the two witnesses to an additional confession posed a serious strategic concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">Moore\u2019s prospects at trial were thus anything but certain. Even now, he does not deny any involvement in the kidnaping and killing. In these circumstances, and with a potential capital charge lurking, Moore\u2019s counsel made a reasonable choice to opt for a quick plea bargain. At the very least, the state court would not have been unreasonable to so conclude. Cf. <em>Yarborough </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>541 U.S. 652, 664, 124 S. Ct. 2140, 158 L. Ed. 2d 938 (2004) (explaining that  state courts enjoy \u201cmore leeway\u201d under AEDPA in applying general standards).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">The Court of Appeals\u2019 contrary holding rests on a case that did not involve ineffective assistance of counsel: <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 111 S. Ct. 1246, 113 L. Ed. 2d 302. To reach that result, it transposed that case into a novel context; and  novelty alone\u2014at least insofar as it renders the relevant rule less than \u201cclearly established\u201d\u2014provides a reason to reject it under AEDPA. See <em>Yarborough, supra, </em>at 666, 124 S. Ct. 2140, 158 L. Ed. 2d 938 (\u201cSection 2254(d)(1) would be undermined if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>habeas courts introduced rules not clearly established under the guise of extensions to existing law . . . [, although c] ertain principles are fundamental enough that when new factual permutations arise, the necessity to apply the earlier rule will be beyond doubt\u201d). And the transposition</p>\n<p id=\"AuKKj\">[562 U.S. 128]</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">is improper even on its own terms. According to the Court of Appeals, <em>\u201cFulmi-nante </em>stands for the proposition that the admission of an additional confession ordinarily reinforces and corroborates the others and is therefore prejudicial.\u201d 574 F.3d, at 1111. Based on that reading, the Court of Appeals held that the state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to <em>Fulminante.\u201d Id., </em>at 1102. But <em>Fulminante </em>may not be so incorporated into the <em>Strickland, </em>performance inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">A state-court adjudication of the performance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment cannot be \u201ccontrary to\u201d <em>Fulminante, </em>for <em>Fulmi-</em>nante\u2014which involved the admission of an involuntary confession in violation of the Fifth Amendment\u2014says nothing about the <em>Strickland </em>standard of effectiveness. See <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Cone, </em>535 U.S. 685, 694, 122 S. Ct. 1843, 152 L. Ed. 2d 914 (2002) (  \u201cA federal habeas court may issue the writ under the \u2018contrary to\u2019 clause if the state court applies a rule different from the governing law set forth in our cases, or if it decides a case differently than we have done on a set of materially indistinguishable facts\u201d). The <em>Fulminante </em>prejudice inquiry presumes a constitutional violation, whereas <em>Strickland, </em>seeks to define one. The state court accepted counsel\u2019s view that seeking to suppress Moore\u2019s second confession would have been \u201cfruitless.\u201d It would not have been unreasonable to conclude that counsel could incorporate that view into his assessment of a plea offer, a subject with which <em>Fulminante </em>is in no way concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">A finding of constitutionally adequate performance under <em>Strickland. </em>cannot be contrary to <em>Fulminante. </em>The state court likely reached the correct result under <em>Strickland. </em>And under \u00a7 2254(d), that it reached a reasonable one is sufficient. See <em>Richter, ante, </em>at 109, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">The Court of Appeals further concluded that it would have been unreasonable for the state postconviction court to have found no prejudice in counsel\u2019s failure to suppress Moore\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"AORjN\">[562 U.S. 129]</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">confession to police.  To prevail on prejudice before the state court Moore had to demonstrate \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S. Ct. 366, 88 L. Ed. 2d 203 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">Deference to the state court\u2019s prejudice determination is all the more significant in light of the uncertainty inherent in plea negotiations described above: The stakes for defendants are high, and many elect to limit risk by forgoing the right to assert their innocence. A defendant who accepts a plea bargain on counsel\u2019s advice does not necessarily suffer prejudice when his counsel fails to seek suppression of evidence, even if it would be reversible error for the court to admit that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-12\">The state court here reasonably could have determined that Moore would have accepted the plea agreement even if his second confession had been ruled inadmissible. By the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>time the plea agreement cut short investigation of Moore\u2019s crimes, the State\u2019s case was already formidable and included two witnesses to an admissible confession. Had the prosecution continued to investigate, its case might well have become stronger. At the same time, Moore faced grave punishments. His decision to plead no contest allowed him to avoid a possible sentence of life without parole or death. The bargain counsel struck was thus a favorable one\u2014the statutory minimum for the charged offense\u2014and the decision to forgo a challenge to the confession may have been essential to securing that agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Once again the Court of Appeals reached a contrary conclusion by pointing to <em>Fulminante: </em>\u201cThe state court\u2019s finding that a motion to suppress a recorded confession to the police would have been \u2018fruitless\u2019 . . . was without question contrary to clearly established federal law as set forth in <em>Fulminante.\u201d </em>574 F.3d, at 1112. And again there is no sense in which the state court\u2019s finding could be contrary to <em>Fulminante, </em>for  <em>Fulminante </em>says nothing about prejudice for</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">[562 U.S. 130]</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\"><em>Strickland </em>purposes, nor does it contemplate prejudice in the plea bargain context.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">The Court of Appeals appears to have treated <em>Fulminante </em>as a <em>per se </em>rule of prejudice, or something close to it, in all cases involving suppressible confessions. It is not. In <em>Fulmi-nante </em>five Justices made the uncontroversial observation that many confessions are powerful evidence. See, <em>e.g., </em>499 U.S., at 296, 111 S. Ct. 1246, 113 L. Ed. 2d 302.  <em>Fulmi-</em>nante\u2019s prejudice analysis arose on direct review following an acknowledged constitutional error at trial. The State therefore had the burden of showing that it was \u201cclear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found the defendant guilty absent the error.\u201d <em>Neder </em>v. <em>United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 18, 119 S. Ct. 1827, 144 L. Ed. 2d 35 (1999) (paraphrasing <em>Fulminante, supra). </em>That standard cannot apply to determinations whether inadequate assistance of counsel prejudiced a defendant who entered into a plea agreement. Many defendants reasonably enter plea agreements even though there is a significant probability\u2014much more than a reasonable doubt\u2014that they would be acquitted if they proceeded to trial. Thus, the question in the present case is not whether Moore was sure beyond a reasonable doubt that he would still be convicted if the extra confession were suppressed. It is whether Moore established the reasonable probability that he would not have entered his plea but for his counsel\u2019s deficiency, <em>Hill, supra, </em>at 59, 106 S. Ct. 366, 88 L. Ed. 2d 203, and more to the point, whether a state court\u2019s decision to the contrary would be unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">To the extent Fulminante\u2019s application of the harmless-error standard sheds any light on the present case, it suggests that the state court\u2019s prejudice determination was reasonable. <em>Fulminante </em>found that an improperly admitted confession was not harmless under <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 87 S. Ct. 824, 17 L. Ed. 2d 705 (1967), because the remaining evidence against the defendant was weak. The additional evidence consisted primarily of a second confession that Fulminante had made to the informant\u2019s fiance. But many of its details were not</p>\n<p id=\"b766-10\">[562 U.S. 131]</p>\n<p id=\"b766-11\">corroborated, the fiance had not reported the confession for a long period of time, the State had indicated that both confessions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>essential to its case, and the fiance potentially \u201chad a motive to he.\u201d 499 U.S., at 300, 111 S. Ct. 1246, 113 L. Ed. 2d 302. Moore\u2019s plea agreement, by contrast, ended the government\u2019s investigation well before trial, yet the evidence against Moore was strong. The accounts of Moore\u2019s second confession to his brother and his accomplice\u2019s girlfriend corroborated each other, were given to people without apparent reason to lie, and were reported without delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">The State gave no indication that its felony-murder prosecution depended on the admission of the police confession, and Moore does not now deny that he kidnaped and killed Rogers. Given all this, an unconstitutional admission of Moore\u2019s confession to police might well have been found harmless even on direct review if Moore had gone to trial after the denial of a suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Other than for its discussion of the basic proposition that a confession is often powerful evidence, <em>Fulminante </em>is not relevant to the present case.  The state postconviction court reasonably could have concluded that Moore was not prejudiced by counsel\u2019s actions. Under AEDPA, that finding ends federal review. See <em>Richter, ante, </em>at 109, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Judge Berzon\u2019s concurring opinion in the Court of Appeals does not provide a basis for issuance of the writ. The concurring opinion would have found the state court\u2019s prejudice determination unreasonable in light of <em>Kimmelman. </em>It relied on <em>Kimmelman </em>to find that Moore suffered prejudice for <em>Strickland </em>purposes because there was a reasonable possibility that he would have obtained a better plea agreement but for his counsel\u2019s errors. But <em>Kimmelman </em>concerned a conviction following a bench trial, so it did not establish, much less clearly establish,  the appropriate standard for prejudice in cases involving plea bargains. See 477 U.S., at 389, 106 S. Ct. 2574, 91 L. Ed. 2d 305. That standard was established in <em>Hill, </em>which held that a defendant who enters a plea agreement must show</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">[562 U.S. 132]</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">\u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d 474 U.S., at 59, 106 S. Ct. 366, 88 L. Ed. 2d 203. Moore\u2019s failure to make that showing forecloses relief under AEDPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">There are certain differences between inadequate-assistance-of-counsel claims in cases where there was a full trial on the merits and those, like this one, where a plea was entered even before the prosecution decided upon all of the charges. Atrial provides the full written record and factual background that serve to limit and clarify some of the choices counsel made. Still, hindsight cannot suffice for relief when counsel\u2019s choices were reasonable and legitimate based on predictions of how the trial would proceed. <em>See Richter, ante, </em>at 108, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">Hindsight and second guesses are also inappropriate, and often more so, where a plea has been entered without a full trial or, as in this case, even before the prosecution decided on the charges. The added uncertainty that results when there is no extended, formal record and no actual history to show how the charges have played out at trial works against the party alleging inadequate assistance. Counsel, too, faced that uncertainty. There is a most substantial burden on the claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>ant to show ineffective assistance. The plea process brings to the criminal justice system a stability and a certainty that must not be undermined by the prospect of collateral challenges in cases not only where witnesses and evidence have disappeared, but also in cases where witnesses and evidence were not presented in the first place. The substantial burden to show ineffective assistance of counsel, the burden the claimant must meet to avoid the plea, has not been met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">The state postconviction court\u2019s decision involved no unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent. Because the Court of Appeals erred in finding otherwise, its</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">[562 U.S. 133]</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-11\">Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b768-4\">SEPARATE OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b768-5\">Justice Ginsburg,</author>\n<p id=\"AfL8\">concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">To prevail under the prejudice requirement of <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), a petitioner for federal habeas corpus relief must demonstrate \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial,\u201d <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S. Ct. 366, 88 L. Ed. 2d 203 (1985). As Moore\u2019s counsel confirmed at oral argument, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 32, Moore never declared that, better informed, he would have resisted the plea bargain and opted for trial. For that reason, I concur in the Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
