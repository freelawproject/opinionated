Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64 (1977); <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Administrator of General Services, </em>433 U.S. 425, 457, 97 S. Ct. 2777, 53 L. Ed. 2d 867 (1977). Respondents in this case, federal contract employees at a Government laboratory, claim that two parts of a standard employment background investigation violate their rights under <em>Whalen andNixon. </em>Respondents challenge a section of a form questionnaire that asks employees about treatment or counseling for recent illegal-drug use. They also object to certain open-ended questions on a form sent to employees\u2019 designated references.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">We assume, without deciding, that the Constitution protects a privacy right of the sort mentioned in <em>Whalen </em>and <em>Nixon. </em>We hold, however, that the challenged portions of the Government\u2019s background check do not violate this right in the present case. The Government\u2019s interests as employer and proprietor in managing its internal operations, combined with the protections against public dissemination provided by the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a (2006 ed. and Supp. IV), satisfy any \u201cinterest in avoiding disclosure\u201d that may \u201carguably ha[ve] its roots in the Constitution.\u201d <em>Whalen, supra, </em>at 599, 605, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is an independent federal agency charged with planning and conducting the Government\u2019s \u201cspace activities.\u201d Pub. L. 111-314, \u00a7 3, 124 Stat. 3333, 51 U.S.C. \u00a7 20112(a)(1). NASA\u2019s work force numbers in the tens of thousands of employees. While many of these workers are federal civil servants, a substantial majority are employed directly by</p>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">[562 U.S. 139]</p>\n<p id=\"b775-13\">Government contractors. Contract employees play an important role in NASA\u2019s mission, and their duties are functionally equivalent to those performed by civil servants.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-14\">One NASA facility, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, is staffed exclusively by contract employees. NASA owns JPL, but the California Institute of Technology (Cal Tech) operates the facility under a Government contract. JPL is the lead NASA center for deep-space robotics and communications. Most of this country\u2019s unmanned space missions\u2014from the Explorer 1 satellite in 1958 to the Mars Rovers of today\u2014 have been developed and run by JPL. JPL scientists contribute to NASA earth-observation and technology-development projects. Many JPL employees also engage in pure scientific research on topics like \u201cthe star formation history of the universe\u201d and \u201cthe fundamental properties of quantum fluids.\u201d App. 64-65, 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-15\">Twenty-eight JPL employees are respondents here. Many of them have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>worked at the lab for decades, and none has ever been the subject of a Government background investigation. At the time when respondents were hired, background checks were standard only for federal civil servants. See Exec. Order No. 10450, 3 CFR 936 (1949-1953 Comp.). In some instances, individual contracts required background checks for the employees of federal contractors, but no blanket policy was in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">The Government has recently taken steps to eliminate this two-track approach to background investigations. In 2004, a recommendation by the 9/11 Commission prompted the President to order new, uniform identification standards for \u201c[federal employees,\u201d including \u201ccontractor employees.\u201d Homeland Security Presidential Directive/HSPD-12\u2014 Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors, Public Papers of the President, George W. Bush, Vol. 2, Aug. 27, p. 1765 (2007) (hereinafter HSPD-12), App. 127. The Department of Commerce implemented this [562 U.S. 140]</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">directive by mandating that contract employees with long-term access to federal facilities complete a standard background check, typically the National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI). National Inst, of Standards and Technology, Personal Identity Verification of Federal Employees &amp; Contractors, pp. iii-vi, 1-8, 6 (FIPS PUB 201-1, Mar. 2006) (hereinafter FIPS PUB 201-1), App. 131-150, 144-145.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">An October 2007 deadline was set for completion of these investigations. Memorandum from Joshua B. Bolten, Director, OMB, to the Heads of all Departments and Agencies (Aug. 5, 2005), App. 112. In January 2007, NASA modified its contract with Cal Tech to reflect the new background-check requirement. JPL management informed employees that anyone failing to complete the NACI process by October 2007 would be denied access to JPL and would face termination by Cal Tech.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">The NACI process has long been the standard background investigation for prospective civil servants. The process begins when the applicant or employee fills out a form questionnaire. Employees who work in \u201cnonsensitive\u201d positions (as all respondents here do) complete Standard Form 85 (SF\u201485). Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Standard Form 85, Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions, App. 88-95.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">[562 U.S. 141]</p>\n<p id=\"b776-11\">Most of the questions on SF-85 seek basic biographical information: name, address, prior residences, education, employment history, and personal and professional references. The form also asks about citizenship, selective-service registration, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>military service. The last question asks whether the employee has \u201cused, possessed, supplied, or manufactured illegal drugs\u201d in the last year. <em>Id., </em>at 94. If the answer is yes, the employee must provide details, including information about \u201cany treatment or counseling received.\u201d <em>Ibid- </em>A \u201ctruthful response,\u201d the form notes, cannot be used as evidence against the employee in a criminal proceeding. <em>Ibid. </em>The employee must certify that all responses on the form are true and must sign a release authorizing the Government to obtain personal information from schools, employers, and others during its investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">Once a completed SF-85 is on file, the \u201cagency check\u201d and \u201cinquiries\u201d begin. 75 Fed. Reg. 5359 (2010). The Government runs the information provided by the employee through FBI and other federal-agency databases. It also sends out form questionnaires to the former employers, schools, landlords, and references listed on SF-85. The particular form at issue in this case\u2014the Investigative Request for Personal Information, Form 42\u2014goes to the employee\u2019s former landlords and references. <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Form 42 is a two-page document that takes about five minutes to complete. See <em>ibid.. </em>It explains to the reference that \u201c[y]our name has been provided by\u201d a particular employee or applicant to help the Government determine that person\u2019s \u201csuitability for employment or a security clearance.\u201d App. 96-97. After several preliminary questions about the extent of the reference\u2019s associations with the employee, the form asks if the reference has \u201cany reason to question\u201d the</p>\n<p id=\"Afoa\">[562 U.S. 142]</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">employee\u2019s \u201chonesty or trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 97. It also asks if the reference knows of any \u201cadverse information\u201d concerning the employee\u2019s \u201cviolations of the law,\u201d \u201cfinancial integrity,\u201d \u201cabuse of alcohol and/or drugs,\u201d \u201cmental or emotional stability,\u201d \u201cgeneral behavior or conduct,\u201d or \u201cother matters.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>If \u201cyes\u201d is checked for any of these categories, the form calls for an explanation in the space below. That space is also available for providing \u201cadditional information\u201d (\u201cderogatory\u201d or \u201cpositive\u201d) that may bear on \u201csuitability for government employment or a security clearance.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">All responses to SF-85 and Form 42 are subject to the protections of the Privacy Act.  The Act authorizes the Government to keep records pertaining to an individual only when they are \u201crelevant and necessary\u201d to an end \u201crequired to be accomplished\u201d by law. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(e)(l). Individuals are permitted to access their records and request amendments to them. \u00a7\u00a7 552a(d)(l), (2). Subject to certain exceptions, the Government may not disclose records pertaining to an individual without that individual\u2019s written consent. \u00a7 552a(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">About two months before the October 2007 deadline for completing the NACI, respondents brought this suit, claiming, as relevant here, that the background-check process violates a constitutional right to informational privacy. App. 82 (Complaint for In-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>junctive and Declaratory Relief).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The District Court denied respondents\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, but the Ninth Circuit granted an injunction pending appeal, 506 F.3d 713 (2007), and later reversed the District Court\u2019s order. The court held that portions of both SF-85 and Form 42 are likely unconstitutional and should be preliminarily enjoined. 512 F.3d 1134, vacated and superseded, 530 F.3d 865 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">[562 U.S. 143]</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Turning first to SF-85, the Court of Appeals noted respondents\u2019 concession \u201cthat most of the questions\u201d on the form are \u201cunproblematic\u201d and do not \u201cimplicate the constitutional right to informational privacy.\u201d 530 F.3d, at 878. But the court determined that the \u201cgroup of questions concerning illegal drugs\u201d required closer scrutiny. <em>Ibid. </em>Applying Circuit precedent, the court upheld SF-85\u2019s inquiries into recent involvement with drugs as \u201cnecessary to further the government\u2019s legitimate interest\u201d in combating illegal-drug use. <em>Id., </em>at 879. The court went on to hold, however, that the portion of the form requiring disclosure of drug \u201ctreatment or counseling\u201d furthered no legitimate interest and was thus likely to be held unconstitutional. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Form 42, in the Court of Appeals\u2019 estimation, was even \u201cmore problematic.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The form\u2019s \u201copen-ended and highly private\u201d questions, the court concluded, were not \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d to meet the Government\u2019s interests in verifying contractors\u2019 identities and \u201censuring the security of the JPL.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 881, 880. As a result, the court held, these \u201copen-ended\u201d questions, like the drug-treatment question on SF-85, likely violate respondents\u2019 informational-privacy rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">[562 U.S. 144]</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">Over the dissents of five judges, the Ninth Circuit denied rehearing en banc. 568 F.3d 1028 (2009). We granted certiorari. 559 U.S. 990, 130 S. Ct. 1755, 176 L. Ed. 2d 211 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b778-11\">As noted, respondents contend that portions of SF-85 and Form 42 violate their \u201cright to informational privacy.\u201d Brief for Respondents 15. This Court considered a similar claim in <em>Whalen, </em>429 U.S. 589, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>2d 64, which concerned New York\u2019s practice of collecting \u201cthe names and addresses of all persons\u201d prescribed dangerous drugs with both \u201clegitimate and illegitimate uses.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 591, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64. In discussing that claim, the Court said that \u201c [t]he cases sometimes characterized as protecting \u2018privacy\u2019 \u201d actually involved \u201cat least two different kinds of interests\u201d: one, an \u201cinterest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters\u201d;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the other, an interest in \u201cmaking certain kinds of important decisions\u201d free from government interference.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>at 598-600. The patients who brought suit in</p>\n<p id=\"AF3v\">[562 U.S. 145]</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><em>Whalen </em>argued that New York\u2019s statute \u201cthreaten [ed] to impair\u201d both their \u201cnondisclosure\u201d interests and their interests in making healthcare decisions independently. <em>Id., </em>at 600, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64. The Court, however, upheld the statute as a \u201creasonable exercise of New York\u2019s broad police powers.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 598, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\"><em>Whalen </em>acknowledged that the disclosure of \u201cprivate information\u201d to the State was an \u201cunpleasant invasio[n] of privacy,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 602, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64, but the Court pointed out that the New York statute contained \u201csecurity provisions\u201d that protected against \u201c[plublic disclosure\u201d of patients\u2019 information, <em>id., </em>at 600-601, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64. This sort of \u201cstatutory or regulatory duty to avoid unwarranted disclosures\u201d of \u201caccumulated private data\u201d was sufficient, in the Court\u2019s view, to protect a privacy interest that \u201carguably ha[d] its roots in the Constitution.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 605-606, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64. The Court thus concluded that the statute did not violate \u201cany right or liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 606, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">Four months later, the Court referred again to a constitutional \u201cinterest in avoiding disclosure.\u201d <em>Nixon, </em>433 U.S., at 457, 97 S. Ct. 2777, 53 L. Ed. 2d 867 (internal quotation marks omitted). Former President Nixon brought a challenge to the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act, 88 Stat. 1695, note following 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111, a statute that required him to turn over his Presidential papers and tape recordings for archival review and screening. 433 U.S., at 455-465, 97 S. Ct. 2777, 53 L. Ed. 2d 867. In a section of the opinion entitled \u201cPrivacy,\u201d the Court addressed a combination of claims that the review required by this Act violated the former President\u2019s \u201cFourth and Fifth Amendmen[t]\u201d rights. <em>Id., </em>at 455, and n. 18, 458-459, 97 S. Ct. 2777, 53 L. Ed. 2d 867. The Court rejected those challenges after concluding that the Act at issue, like the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>statute in <em>Whalen, </em>contained protections against \u201cundue dissemination of private materials.\u201d 433 U.S., at 458, 97 S. Ct. 2777, 53 L. Ed. 2d 867. Indeed, the Court observed that the former President\u2019s claim was \u201cweaker\u201d than the one \u201cfound wanting . . . [in] <em>Whalen,\u201d </em>as the Government was required to return immediately all \u201cpurely private papers and recordings\u201d identified by the archivists.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">[562 U.S. 146]</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\"><em>Id., </em>at 458-459, 97 S. Ct. 2777, 53 L. Ed. 2d 867. Citing Fourth Amendment precedent, the Court also stated that the public interest in preserving Presidential papers outweighed any \u201clegitimate expectation of privacy\u201d that the former President may have enjoyed. <em>Id., </em>at 458, 97 S. Ct. 2777, 53 L. Ed. 2d 867 (citing <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 88 S. Ct. 507, 19 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1967); <em>Camara </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of City and County of San Francisco, </em>387 U.S. 523, 87 S. Ct. 1727, 18 L. Ed. 2d 930 (1967); and <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968)).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">The Court announced the decision in <em>Nixon </em>in the waning days of October Term 1976. Since then, the Court has said little else on the subject of an \u201cindividual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters.\u201d <em>Whalen, supra, </em>at 599, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64; <em>Nixon, supra, </em>at 457, 97 S. Ct. 2777, 53 L. Ed. 2d 867. A few opinions have mentioned the concept in passing and in other contexts. See <em>Department of Justice </em>v. <em>Reporters Comm. for Freedom of Press, </em>489 U.S. 749, 762-763, 109 S. Ct. 1468, 103 L. Ed. 2d 774 (1989); <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. 747, 759, n. 10, 102 S. Ct. 3348, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1113 (1982). But no other decision has squarely addressed a constitutional right to informational privacy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">[562 U.S. 147]</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">As was our approach in <em>Whalen, </em>we will assume for present purposes that the Government\u2019s challenged inquiries implicate a privacy interest of constitutional significance. 429 U.S., at 599, 605, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>64.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We hold, however, that, whatever the</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">[562 U.S. 148]</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">scope of this interest, it does not prevent the Government from asking reasonable questions of the sort included on SF-85 and Form 42 in an employment background investigation that is subject to the Privacy Act\u2019s safeguards against public disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">As an initial matter, judicial review of the Government\u2019s challenged inquiries must take into account the context in which they arise. When the Government asks respondents and their references to fill out SF-85 and Form 42, it does not exercise its sovereign power \u201cto regulate or license.\u201d <em>Cafeteria &amp; Restaurant Workers </em>v. <em>McElroy, </em>367 U.S. 886, 896, 81 S. Ct. 1743, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1230 (1961). Rather, the Government conducts the challenged background checks in its capacity \u201cas proprietor\u201d and manager of its \u201cinternal operation.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Time and again  our cases have recognized that the Government has a much freer hand in dealing \u201cwith citizen employees than it does when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>brings its sovereign power to bear on citizens at large.\u201d <em>Engquist </em>v. <em>Oregon Dept. of Agriculture, </em>553 U.S. 591, 598, 128 S. Ct. 2146, 170 L. Ed. 2d 975 (2008); <em>Waters </em>v. <em>Churchill, </em>511 U.S. 661, 674, 114 S. Ct. 1878, 128 L. Ed. 2d 686 (1994) (plurality opinion). This distinction is grounded on the</p>\n<p id=\"A5YLm\">[562 U.S. 149]</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">\u201ccommon-sense realization\u201d that if every \u201cemployment decision became a constitutional matter,\u201d the Government could not function. See <em>Connick </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138, 143, 103 S. Ct. 1684, 75 L. Ed. 2d 708 (1983); see also <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>426 U.S. 341, 350, 96 S. Ct. 2074, 48 L. Ed. 2d 684 (1976) (\u201cThe Due Process Clause ... is not a guarantee against incorrect or ill-advised personnel decisions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">An assessment of the constitutionality of the challenged portions of SF-85 and Form 42 must account for this distinction. The questions challenged by respondents are part of a standard employment background check of the sort used by millions of private employers. See Brief for Consumer Data Industry Association et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>2 (hereinafter CDIA Brief) (\u201c[M]ore than 88% of U. S. companies . . . perform background checks on their employees\u201d). The Government itself has been conducting employment investigations since the earliest days of the Republic. L. White, The Federalists: A Study in Administrative History 262-263 (1948); see OPM, Biography of An Ideal: History of the Federal Civil Service 8 (2002) (noting that President Washington \u201cset a high standard\u201d for federal office and finalized appointments only after \u201cinvestigating [candidates\u2019] capabilities and reputations\u201d).

Stat. \u00a7 1753, as amended, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301(2), and that Act appears to have been regarded as a codification of established practice.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Standard background investigations similar to those at issue here became mandatory for all candidates</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">[562 U.S. 150]</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">for the federal civil service in 1953. Exec. Order No. 10450, 3 CFR 936. And the particular investigations challenged in this case arose from a decision to extend that requirement to federal contract employees requiring long-term access to federal facilities. See HSPD-12, at 1765, App. 127; FIPS PUB 201-1, at iii-vi, 1-8, App. 131-150.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">As this long history suggests, the Government has an interest in conducting basic employment background checks. Reasonable investigations of applicants and employees aid the Government in ensuring the security of its facilities and in employing a competent, reliable work force. See <em>Engquist, supra, </em>at 598-599, 128 S. Ct. 2146, 170 L. Ed. 2d 975. Courts must keep those interests in mind when asked to go line by line through the Government\u2019s employment forms and to scrutinize the choice and wording of the questions they contain.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">Respondents argue that, because they are contract employees and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>civil servants, the Government\u2019s broad authority in managing its affairs should apply with diminished force. But  the Government\u2019s interest as \u201cproprietor\u201d in managing its operations, <em>Cafeteria &amp; Restaurant Workers, supra, </em>at 896, 81 S. Ct. 1743, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1230, does not turn on such formalities. See <em>Board of Comm\u2019rs, Wabaunsee Cty. </em>v. <em>Umbehr, </em>518 U.S. 668, 678, 679, 116 S. Ct. 2342, 135 L. Ed. 2d 843 (1996) (formal distinctions such as whether a \u201cservice provider\u201d has a \u201ccontract of employment or a contract for services\u201d with the government is a \u201cvery poor proxy\u201d for constitutional interests at stake). The fact that respondents\u2019 direct employment relationship is with Cal Tech\u2014which operates JPL under a Government contract\u2014says very little about the interests at stake in this case. The record shows that, as a \u201cpractical matter,\u201d there are no \u201c [r]el-evant distinctions\u201d between the duties performed by NASA\u2019s civil-service work force and its contractor work force. App. 221. The two classes of employees perform \u201cfunctionally equivalent duties,\u201d and the extent of employees\u2019 \u201caccess to NASA. . . facilities\u201d turns not on formal status but on the nature of \u201cthe jobs they perform.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">[562 U.S. 151]</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">At JPL, in particular, the work that contract employees perform is critical to NASA\u2019s mission.

This is important work, and all of it is funded with a multibillion-dollar investment from the American taxpayer. See NASA, JPL Annual Report 09, p. 35 (2010), online at http:// www.jpl.nasa.gov/annualreport/2009-report.pdf. The Government has a strong interest in conducting basic background checks into the contract employees minding the store at JPL.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AO_Ze\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">With these interests in view, we conclude that the challenged portions of both SF-85 and Form 42 consist of reasonable, employment-related inquiries that further the Government\u2019s interests in managing its internal operations. See <em>Engquist, </em>553 U.S., at 598-599, 128 S. Ct. 2146, 170 L. Ed. 2d 975; <em>Whalen, </em>429 U.S., at 597-598, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">[562 U.S. 152]</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">As to SF-85, the only part of the form challenged here is its request for information about \u201cany treatment or counseling received\u201d for illegal-drug use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>within the previous year. The \u201ctreatment or counseling\u201d question, however, must be considered in context. App. 94. It is a followup to SF-85\u2019s inquiry into whether the employee has \u201cused, possessed, supplied, or manufactured illegal drugs\u201d during the past year. <em>Ibid. </em>The Government has good reason to ask employees about their recent illegal-drug use. Like any employer, the Government is entitled to have its projects staffed by reliable, law-abiding persons who will \u201c \u2018efficiently and effectively\u2019 \u201d discharge their duties. See <em>Engquist, supra, </em>at 598-599, 128 S. Ct. 2146, 170 L. Ed. 2d 975. Questions about illegal-drug use are a useful way of figuring out which persons have these characteristics. See, <em>e.g., </em>Breen &amp; Matusitz, An Updated Examination of the Effects of Illegal Drug Use in the Workplace, 19 J. Human Behavior in the Social Environment 434 (2009) (illicit drug use negatively correlated with workplace productivity).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">In context, the followup question on \u201ctreatment or counseling\u201d for recent illegal-drug use is also a reasonable, employment-related inquiry. The Government, recognizing that illegal-drug use is both a criminal and a medical issue, seeks to separate out those illegal-drug users who are taking steps to address and overcome their problems. The Government thus uses responses to the \u201ctreatment or counseling\u201d question as a mitigating factor in determining whether to grant contract employees long-term access to federal facilities.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">[562 U.S. 153]</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">This is a reasonable, and indeed a humane, approach, and respondents do not dispute the legitimacy of the Government\u2019s decision to use drug treatment as a mitigating factor in its contractor credentialing decisions. Respondents\u2019 argument is that, if drug treatment is only used to mitigate, then the Government should change the mandatory phrasing of SF-85\u2014\u201cInclude [in your answer] any treatment or counseling received\u201d\u2014so as to make a response optional. App. 94. As it stands, the mandatory \u201ctreatment or counseling\u201d question is unconstitutional, in respondents\u2019 view, because it is \u201cmore intrusive than necessary to satisfy the government\u2019s objective.\u201d Brief for Respondents 26; 530 F.3d, at 879 (holding that \u201ctreatment or counseling\u201d question should be enjoined because the form \u201cappears to <em>compel </em>disclosure\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">We reject the argument that the Government, when it requests job-related personal information in an employment background check, has a constitutional burden to demonstrate that its questions are \u201cnecessary\u201d or the least restrictive means of furthering its interests. So exacting a standard runs directly contrary to <em>Whalen. </em>The patients in <em>Whalen, </em>much like respondents here, argued that New York\u2019s statute was unconstitutional because the State could not \u201cdemonstrate the necessity\u201d of its program. 429 U.S., at 596, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64. The Court quickly rejected that argument, concluding that New York\u2019s collection of patients\u2019 prescription information could \u201cnot be held unconstitutional simply because\u201d a court viewed it as \u201cunnecessary, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>whole or in part.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 596-597, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">That analysis applies with even greater force where the Government acts, not as a regulator, but as the manager of its internal affairs. See <em>Engquist, supra, </em>at 598-599, 128 S. Ct. 2146, 170 L. Ed. 2d 975. SF-85\u2019s \u201ctreatment or counseling\u201d question reasonably seeks to identify a subset of acknowledged drug users who are attempting to overcome their problems. The Government\u2019s considered position is that phrasing the question in more permissive terms would result in a lower response rate, and</p>\n<p id=\"Az1GB\">[562 U.S. 154]</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">the question\u2019s effectiveness in identifying illegal-drug users who are suitable for employment would be \u201cmaterially reduced.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioners 19. That is a reasonable position, falling within the \u201c \u2018wide latitude\u2019 \u201d granted the Government in its dealings with employees. See <em>Engquist, </em>553 U.S., at 600, 128 S. Ct. 2146, 170 L. Ed. 2d 975.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">The Court of Appeals also held that the broad, \u201copen-ended questions\u201d on Form 42 likely violate respondents\u2019 informational-privacy rights. Form 42 asks applicants\u2019 designated references and landlords for \u201cinformation\u201d bearing on \u201csuitability for government employment or a security clearance.\u201d App. 97. In a series of questions, the Government asks if the reference has any \u201cadverse information\u201d about the applicant\u2019s \u201chonesty or trustworthiness,\u201d \u201cviolations of the law,\u201d \u201cfinancial integrity,\u201d \u201cabuse of alcohol and/or drugs,\u201d \u201cmental or emotional stability,\u201d \u201cgeneral behavior or conduct,\u201d or \u201cother matters.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">These open-ended inquiries, like the drug-treatment question on SF-85, are reasonably aimed at identifying capable employees who will faithfully conduct the Government\u2019s business. See <em>Engquist, supra, </em>at 598-599, 128 S. Ct. 2146, 170 L. Ed. 2d 975. Asking an applicant\u2019s designated references broad, open-ended questions about job suitability is an appropriate tool for separating strong candidates from weak ones. It would be a truly daunting task to catalog all the reasons why a person might not be suitable for a particular job, and references do not have all day to answer a laundry list of specific questions. See CDIA Brief 6-7 (references \u201ctypically have limited time to answer questions from potential employers,\u201d and \u201copen-ended questions\u201d yield more relevant information than narrow inquiries). Form 42, by contrast, takes just five minutes to complete. 75 Fed. Reg. 5359.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">The reasonableness of such open-ended questions is illustrated by their pervasiveness in the public and private sectors. Form 42 alone is sent out by the Government over 1.8</p>\n<p id=\"AliC6\">[562 U.S. 155]</p>\n<p id=\"b785-12\">million times annually. <em>Ibid. </em>In addition, the use of open-ended questions in employment background checks appears to be equally commonplace in the private sector. See, <em>e.g., </em>S. Bock et al., Mandated Benefits 2008 Compliance Guide, Exh. 20.1, A Sample Policy on Reference Checks on Job Applicants (\u201cFollowing are the guidelines for conducting a telephone reference check: . . . Ask open-ended questions, then wait for the respondent to answer\u201d); M. Zweig, Human Resources Management 87 (1991) (\u201cAlso ask, \u2018Is there anything else I need to know about [candidate\u2019s name]?\u2019 This kind of open-ended question may turn up all kinds of information you wouldn\u2019t have gotten any other way\u201d). The use of similar open-ended questions by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>the Government is reasonable and furthers its interests in managing its operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Not only are SF-85 and Form 42 reasonable in light of the Government interests at stake, they are also subject to substantial protections against disclosure to the public. Both <em>Whalen </em>and <em>Nixon </em>recognized that  government \u201caccumulation\u201d of \u201cpersonal information\u201d for \u201cpublic purposes\u201d may pose a threat to privacy. <em>Whalen, supra, </em>at 605, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64; see <em>Nixon, </em>433 U.S., at 457-458, 462, 97 S. Ct. 2777, 53 L. Ed. 2d 867. But both decisions also stated that a \u201cstatutory or regulatory duty to avoid unwarranted disclosures\u201d generally allays these privacy concerns. <em>Whalen, supra, </em>at 605, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64; <em>Nixon, supra, </em>at 458-459, 97 S. Ct. 2777, 53 L. Ed. 2d 867. The Court in <em>Whalen, </em>relying on New York\u2019s \u201csecurity provisions\u201d prohibiting public disclosure, turned aside a challenge to the collection of patients\u2019 prescription information. 429 U.S., at 594, and n. 12, 600-601, 605, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64. In <em>Nixon, </em>the Court rejected what it regarded as an even \u201cweaker\u201d claim by the former President because the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act \u201c[n]ot only . . . mandate [d] regulations\u201d against \u201cundue dissemination,\u201d but also required immediate</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">[562 U.S. 156]</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">return of any \u201cpurely private\u201d materials flagged by the Government\u2019s archivists. 433 U.S., at 458-459, 97 S. Ct. 2777, 53 L. Ed. 2d 867.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">Respondents in this case, like the patients in <em>Whalen </em>and former President Nixon, attack only the Government\u2019s <em>collection </em>of information on SF-85 and Form 42. And here, no less than in <em>Whalen </em>and <em>Nixon, </em>the information collected is shielded by statute from \u201cunwarranted disclosur[e].\u201d See <em>Whalen, supra, </em>at 605, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64.  The Privacy Act, which covers all information collected during the background-check process, allows the Government to maintain records \u201cabout an individual\u201d only to the extent the records are \u201crelevant and necessary to accomplish\u201d a purpose authorized by law. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(e)(l). The Act requires written consent before the Government may disclose records pertaining to any individual. \u00a7 552a(b). And the Act imposes criminal liability for willful violations of its nondisclosure obligations. \u00a7 552a(i)(l). These requirements, as we have noted, give \u201cforceful recognition\u201d to a Government employee\u2019s interest in maintaining the \u201cconfidentiality of sensitive information ... in his personnel files.\u201d <em>Detroit Edison Co. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>440 U.S. 301, 318, n. 16, 99 S. Ct. 1123, 59 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1979). Like the protections against disclosure in <em>Whalen </em>and <em>Nixon, </em>they \u201cevidence a proper concern\u201d for individual privacy. <em>Whalen, supra, </em>at 605, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64; <em>Nixon, supra, </em>at 458-459, 97 S. Ct. 2777, 53 L. Ed. 2d 867.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b786-12\">Notwithstanding these safeguards, respondents argue that statutory exceptions to the Privacy Act\u2019s disclosure bar, see \u00a7\u00a7 552a(b)(l)-(12), leave its protections too porous to supply a meaningful check against \u201cunwarranted disclosures,\u201d <em>Whalen, supra, </em>at 605, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64. Respondents point in particular to what they describe as a \u201cbroad\u201d exception for \u201croutine use[s],\u201d defined as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>uses that are \u201ccompatible with the purpose for which the record was collected.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 552a(b)(3), (a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">Respondents\u2019 reliance on these exceptions rests on an incorrect reading of both our precedents and the terms of the</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">[562 U.S. 157]</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Privacy Act. As to our cases, the Court in <em>Whalen </em>and <em>Nixon </em>referred approvingly to statutory or regulatory protections against <em>\u201cunwarranted </em>disclosures\u201d and <em>\u201cundue </em>dissemination\u201d of personal information collected by the Government. <em>Whalen, supra, </em>at 605, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64; <em>Nixon, supra, </em>at 458, 97 S. Ct. 2777, 53 L. Ed. 2d 867. Neither case suggested that an ironclad disclosure bar is needed to satisfy privacy interests that may be \u201croot[ed] in the Constitution.\u201d <em>Whalen, supra, </em>at 605, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64. In <em>Whalen, </em>the New York statute prohibiting \u201c[p]ublic disclosure of the identity of patients\u201d was itself subject to several exceptions. 429 U.S., at 594-595, and n. 12, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64. In <em>Nixon, </em>the protections against \u201cundue dissemination\u201d mentioned in the opinion were not even before the Court, but were to be included in forthcoming regulations \u201cmandate [d]\u201d by the challenged Act. 433 U.S., at 458, 97 S. Ct. 2777, 53 L. Ed. 2d 867; see <em>id.., </em>at 437-439, 97 S. Ct. 2777, 53 L. Ed. 2d 867 (explaining that the Court was limiting its review to the Act\u2019s \u201cfacial validity\u201d and was not considering the Administrator\u2019s forthcoming regulations). Thus,  the mere fact that the Privacy Act\u2019s nondisclosure requirement is subject to exceptions does not show that the statute provides insufficient protection against public disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">Nor does the substance of the \u201croutine use\u201d exception relied on by respondents create any undue risk of public dissemination. None of the authorized \u201croutine use[s]\u201d of respondents\u2019 background-check information allows for release to the public. 71 Fed. Reg. 45859-45860, 45862 (2006); 60 Fed. Reg. 63084 (1995), as amended, 75 Fed. Reg. 28307 (2010). Rather, the established \u201croutine use[s]\u201d consist of limited, reasonable steps designed to complete the background-check process in an efficient and orderly manner. See <em>Whalen, supra, </em>at 602, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64 (approving disclosures to authorized New York Department of Health employees that were not \u201cmeaningfully distinguishable\u201d from routine disclosures \u201cassociated with many facets of health care\u201d). One routine use, for example, involves a limited disclosure to persons filling</p>\n<p id=\"ABMNx\">[562 U.S. 158]</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">out Form 42 so that designated references can \u201cidentify the individual\u201d at issue and can understand the \u201cnature and purpose of the investigation.\u201d App. 89. Authorized JPL employees also review each completed SF-85 to verify that all requested information has been provided. <em>Id.., </em>at 211. These designated JPL employees may not \u201cdisclose any information contained in the form to anyone else,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>and Cal Tech is not given access to adverse information uncovered during the Government\u2019s background check, <em>id., </em>at 207-208. The \u201cremote possibility\u201d of public disclosure created by these narrow \u201croutine use[s]\u201d does not undermine the Privacy Act\u2019s substantial protections. See <em>Whalen, </em>429 U.S., at 601-602, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64 (\u201cremote possibility\u201d that statutory security provisions will \u201cprovide inadequate protection against unwarranted disclosures\u201d not a sufficient basis for striking down statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Citing past violations of the Privacy Act,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> respondents note that it is possible that their personal information could be disclosed as a result of a similar breach. But data breaches are a possibility any time the Government stores information. As the Court recognized in <em>Whalen, </em> the mere possibility that security measures will fail provides no \u201cproper ground\u201d for a broad-based attack on government information-collection practices. <em>Ibid. </em>Respondents also cite a portion of SF-85 that warns of possible disclosure \u201c[t]o the news media or the general public.\u201d App. 89. By its terms, this exception allows public disclosure only where release is \u201cin the public interest\u201d and would not result in \u201can unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Respondents have not cited any example of such a disclosure, nor have they identified any plausible scenario in which</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">[562 U.S. 159]</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">their information might be unduly disclosed under this exception.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">In light of the protection provided by the Privacy Act\u2019s nondisclosure requirement, and because the challenged portions of the forms consist of reasonable inquiries in an employment background check, we conclude that the Government\u2019s inquiries do not violate a constitutional right to informational privacy. <em>Whalen, supra, </em>at 605, 97 S.

In this case, petitioners did not ask us to hold that there is no constitutional right to informational privacy, and respondents and their <em>amici </em>thus understandably refrained from addressing that issue in detail. It is undesirable for us to decide a matter of this importance in a case in which we do not have the benefit of briefing by the parties and in which potential <em>amici </em>had little notice that the matter might be decided.

But rather than reach this conclusion on the basis of the never-explained assumption that the Constitution requires courts to \u201cbalance\u201d the Government\u2019s interests in data collection against its contractor employees\u2019 interest in privacy, I reach it on simpler grounds. Like many other desirable things not included in the Constitution, \u201cinformational privacy\u201d seems like a good idea\u2014wherefore the People</p>\n<p id=\"ASjBC\">[562 U.S. 160]</p>\n<p id=\"b788-15\">have enacted laws at the federal level and in the States restricting government collection and use of information. But it is up to the People to enact those laws, to shape them, and, when they think it appropriate, to repeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>them. A federal constitutional right to \u201cinformational privacy\u201d does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">Before addressing the constitutional issues, however, I must observe a remarkable and telling fact about this case, unique in my tenure on this Court: Respondents\u2019 brief, in arguing that the Federal Government violated the Constitution, does not once identify which provision of the Constitution that might be. The \u201cTable of Authorities\u201d contains citations of cases from federal and state courts, federal and state statutes, Rules of Evidence from four States, two Executive Orders, a House Report, and even more exotic sources of law, such as two reports of the Government Accountability Office and an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission document concerning \u201cEnforcement Guidance.\u201d And yet it contains not a single citation of the sole document we are called upon to construe: the Constitution of the United States. The body of the brief includes a single, fleeting reference to the Due Process Clause, buried in a citation of the assuredly inapposite <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>539 U.S. 558, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 156 L. Ed. 2d 508 (2003), Brief for Respondents 42; but no further attempt is made to argue that NASA\u2019s actions deprived respondents of liberty without due process of law. And this legal strategy was not limited to respondents\u2019 filing in this Court; in the Ninth Circuit respondents asserted in a footnote that \u201ccourts have grounded the right to informational privacy in various provisions of the Constitution,\u201d Brief for Appellants in No. 07-56424, p. 25, n. 18, but declined to identify which ones applied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">To tell the truth, I found this approach refreshingly honest. One who asks us to invent a constitutional right out of whole cloth should spare himself and us the pretense of tying it to some words of the Constitution. Regrettably, this Lincolnesque honesty evaporated at oral argument, when counsel asserted, apparently for the first time in this litigation,</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">[562 U.S. 161]</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">that the right to informational privacy emerged from the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Tr. of Oral Arg. 28-29. That counsel invoked the infinitely plastic concept of \u201csubstantive\u201d due process does not make this constitutional theory any less invented.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">This case is easily resolved on the simple ground that the Due Process Clause does not \u201cgu\u00e1rante [e] certain (unspecified) liberties\u201d; rather, it \u201cmerely guarantees certain procedures as a prerequisite to deprivation of liberty.\u201d <em>Albright </em>v. <em>Oliver, </em>510 U.S. 266, 275, 114 S. Ct. 807, 127 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring). Respondents make no claim that the Government has deprived them of liberty without the requisite procedures, and their due process claim therefore must fail. Even under the formula we have adopted for identifying liberties entitled to protection under the faux \u201csubstantive\u201d component of the Due Process Clause\u2014that \u201cthe Due Process Clause specially protects those fundamental rights and liberties which are, objectively, deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition,\u201d <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S. 702, 720-721, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 117 S. Ct. 2302, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted)\u2014 respondents\u2019 claim would fail. Respondents do not even attempt to argue that the claim at issue in this case passes that test, perhaps recognizing the farcical nature of a contention that a right deeply rooted in our history and tradition bars the Govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>ment from ensuring that the Hubble Telescope is not used by recovering drug addicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">The absurdity of respondents\u2019 position in this case should not, however, obscure the broader point: Our due process precedents, even our \u201csubstantive due process\u201d precedents, do not support <em>any </em>right to informational privacy. First, we have held that a government act of defamation does not deprive a person \u201cof any \u2018liberty\u2019 protected by the procedural guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 709, 96 S. Ct. 1155, 47 L. Ed. 2d 405 (1976). We reasoned that stigma, standing alone, does not \u201csignificantly alte[r]\u201d a person\u2019s legal status so as to \u201cjustif[y] the invocation of procedural safeguards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">[562 U.S. 162]</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\"><em>Id., </em>at 708-709, 96 S. Ct. 1155, 47 L. Ed. 2d 405. If outright defamation does not qualify, it is unimaginable that the mere disclosure of private information does.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Second, respondents challenge the Government\u2019s <em>collection </em>of their private information. But the Government\u2019s collection of private information is regulated by the Fourth Amendment, and \u201c[w]here a particular Amendment provides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection against a particular sort of government behavior, that Amendment, not the more generalized notion of substantive due process, must be the guide for analyzing these claims.\u201d <em>County of Sacramento </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>523 U.S. 833, 842, 118 S. Ct. 1708, 140 L. Ed. 2d 1043 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original). Here, the Ninth Circuit rejected respondents\u2019 Fourth Amendment argument, correctly holding that the Form 42 inquiries to third parties were not Fourth Amendment \u201csearches\u201d under <em>United States </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>425 U.S. 435, 96 S. Ct. 1619, 48 L. Ed. 2d 71 (1976), and that the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the Government from asking questions about private information. 530 F.3d 865, 876-877 (2008). That should have been the end of the matter. Courts should not use the Due Process Clause as putty to fill up gaps they deem unsightly in the protections provided by other constitutional provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">In sum, I would simply hold that there is no constitutional right to \u201cinformational privacy.\u201d Besides being consistent with constitutional text and tradition, this view has the attractive benefit of resolving this case without resort to the Court\u2019s exegesis on the Government\u2019s legitimate interest in identifying contractor drug abusers and the comfortingly narrow scope of NASA\u2019s \u201croutine use\u201d regulations. I shall not fill the U. S. Reports with further explanation of the incoherence of the Court\u2019s \u201csubstantive due process\u201d doctrine in its many manifestations, since the Court does not play the substantive due process card. Instead, it states that it will \u201cassume, without deciding\u201d that there exists a right to informational privacy, <em>ante, </em>at 138, 178 L.

Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64 (1977), and <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Administrator of General Services, </em>433 U.S. 425, 97 S.

But <em>stare decisis </em>is simply irrelevant when the pertinent precedent assumed, without deciding, the existence of a constitutional right. <em>\u201cStare decisis </em>reflects a policy judgment that in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right.\u201d <em>State Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Khan, </em>522 U.S. 3, 20, 118 S. Ct. 275, 139 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIt is the preferred course because it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Here, however, there <em>is </em>no applicable rule of law that is settled. To the contrary, <em>Whalen </em>and <em>Nixon </em>created an uncertainty that the text of the Constitution did not contain and that today\u2019s opinion perpetuates.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">[562 U.S. 164]</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">A further reason <em>Whalen and Nixon </em>are not entitled to <em>stare decisis </em>effect is that neither opinion supplied any coherent reason why a constitutional right to informational privacy might exist. As supporting authority, <em>Whalen </em>cited <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>394 U.S. 557, 89 S. Ct. 1243, 22 L. Ed. 2d 542 (1969), a First Amendment case protecting private possession of obscenity; the deservedly infamous dictum in <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>381 U.S. 479, 483, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1965), concerning the \u201cpenumbra\u201d of the First Amendment; and three concurring or dissenting opinions, none of which remotely intimated that there might be such a thing as a substantive due process right to informational privacy. 429 U.S., at 599, n. 25, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64. <em>Nixon </em>provided even less support. After citing the observation in <em>Whalen </em>that \u201c[o]ne element of privacy has been characterized as the individual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters,\u201d <em>Nixon, supra, </em>at 457, 97 S. Ct. 2777, 53 L. Ed. 2d 867 (quoting <em>Whalen, supra, </em>at 599, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64; internal quotation marks omitted), it proceeded to conduct a straightforward <em>Fourth Amendment </em>analysis. It \u201cassume[d]\u201d that there was a \u201clegitimate expectation of privacy\u201d in the materials, and rejected the appellant\u2019s argument that the statute at issue was \u201cprecisely the kind of abuse that the Fourth Amendment was intended to prevent.\u201d <em>Nixon, supra, </em>at 457-458, 460, 97 S. Ct. 2777, 53 L. Ed. 2d 867. It is unfathomable why these cases\u2019 passing, barely explained reference to a right separate from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Fourth Amendment\u2014an unenumer-ated right that they held to be <em>not </em>applicable\u2014should be afforded <em>stare decisis </em>weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">At this point the reader may be wondering: \u201cWhat, after all, is the harm in being \u2018minimalist\u2019 and simply refusing to say that violation of a constitutional right of informational privacy can never exist? The outcome in this case is the same, so long as the Court holds that any such hypothetical right was not violated.\u201d Well, there is harm. The Court\u2019s never-say-never disposition does damage for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">1. It is in an important sense not actually minimalist. By substituting for one real constitutional question (whether there exists a constitutional right to informational privacy)</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">[562 U.S. 165]</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">a different constitutional question (whether NASA\u2019s background checks would contravene a right to informational privacy if such a right existed), the Court gets to pontificate upon a matter that is none of its business: the appropriate balance between security and privacy. If I am correct that there exists no right to informational privacy, all that discussion is an exercise injudicial <em>maximalism. </em>Better simply to state and apply the law forthrightly than to hold our view of the law <em>in pectore, </em>so that we can inquire into matters beyond our charter, and probably beyond our ken.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">If, on the other hand, the Court believes that there <em>is </em>a constitutional right to informational privacy, then I fail to see the minimalist virtues in delivering a lengthy opinion analyzing that right while coyly noting that the right is \u201cassumed\u201d rather than \u201cdecided.\u201d Thirty-three years have passed since the Court first suggested that the right may, or may not, exist. It is past time for the Court to abandon this Alfred Hitchcock line of our jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">2. It harms our image, if not our self-respect, because it makes no sense. The Court decides that the Government did not violate the right to informational privacy without deciding whether there <em>is </em>a right to informational privacy, and without even describing what hypothetical standard should be used to assess whether the hypothetical right has been violated. As I explained last Term in objecting to another of the Court\u2019s never-say-never dispositions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-11\">\u201c[The Court] cannot decide that [respondents\u2019] claim fails without first deciding what a valid claim would consist of. . . . [A]greeing to or crafting a <em>hypothetical </em>standard for a <em>hypothetical </em>constitutional right is sufficiently unappealing . . . that [the Court] might as well acknowledge the right as well. Or [it] could avoid the need to agree with or craft a hypothetical standard by <em>denying </em>the right. But embracing a standard while being coy about the right is, well, odd; and deciding this case while addressing <em>neither </em>the standard <em>nor </em>the right is quite</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ9Ep\">[562 U.S. 166]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-12\">impossible.\u201d <em>Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc. </em>v. <em>Florida Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>560 U.S. 702, 717-718, 130 S. Ct. 2592, 177 L. Ed. 2d 184 (2010) (plurality opinion) (joined by Alito, J.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-13\">Whatever the virtues of judicial minimalism, it cannot justify judicial incoherence.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-14\">The Court defends its approach by observing that \u201cwe have only the \u2018scarce and open-ended\u2019 guideposts of substantive due process to show us the way.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 147, n. 10, 178 L. Ed. 2d, at 679. I would have thought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>that this doctrinal obscurity should lead us to provide <em>more </em>clarity for lower courts; surely one vague opinion should not provide an excuse for another.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">The Court observes that I have joined other opinions that have assumed the existence of constitutional rights. <em>Ibid. </em>It is of course acceptable to reserve difficult constitutional questions, so long as answering those questions is unnecessary to coherent resolution of the issue presented in the case. So in <em>Cruzan </em>v. <em>Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, </em>497 U.S. 261, 279-280, 110 S. Ct. 2841, 111 L. Ed. 2d 224 (1990), we declined to decide whether a competent person had a constitutional right to refuse lifesaving hydration, because\u2014under a constitutional standard we laid out in detail\u2014such a right did not exist for an incompetent person. In <em>Herrera </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>506 U.S. 390, 417-418, 113 S. Ct. 853, 122 L. Ed. 2d 203 (1993), we declined to decide whether it would be unconstitutional to execute an innocent person, because Herrera had not shown that he was innocent. In <em>New York State Club Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>487 U.S. 1, 10-15, 108 S. Ct. 2225, 101 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1988), we declined to decide whether there was a constitutional right of private association for certain clubs, because the plaintiff had brought a facial challenge, which would fail if the statute was valid in many of its applications, making it unnecessary to decide whether an as-applied challenge as to some clubs could succeed. Here, however, the Court actually <em>applies </em>a constitutional informational privacy standard without giving a clue as to the rule of law it is applying.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">[562 U.S. 167]</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">3. It provides no guidance whatsoever for lower courts. Consider the sheer multiplicity of unweighted, relevant factors alluded to in today\u2019s opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-8\">\u2022 It is relevant that the Government is acting \u201cin its capacity \u2018as proprietor\u2019 and manager of its \u2018internal operation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 148, 178 L. Ed. 2d, at 679. Of course, given that we are told neither what the appropriate standard should be when the Government is acting as regulator nor what the appropriate standard should be when it is acting as proprietor, it is not clear <em>what </em>effect this fact has on the analysis; but at least we know that it is <em>something.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-9\">\u2022 History and tradition have some role to play, <em>ante, </em>at 149-150, 178 L. Ed. 2d, at 680-681, but how much is uncertain. The Court points out that the Federal Government has been conducting investigations of candidates for employment since the earliest days; but on the other hand it acknowledges that extension of those investigations to employees of contractors is of very recent vintage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-10\">\u2022 The contract employees are doing important work. They are not mere janitors and maintenance men; they are working on a $568 million observatory. Ante, at 151, 178 L. Ed. 2d, at 681. Can it possibly be that the outcome of today\u2019s case would be different for background checks of lower-level employees? In the spirit of minimalism we are never told.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-11\">\u2022 Questions about drug treatment are (hypothetically) constitutional because they are \u201creasonable,\u201d \u201cuseful,\u201d and \u201chumane.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 151-153, 178 L.

Ed. 2d, at 684-686. From the length of the discussion, I would bet that the Privacy Act is necessary to today\u2019s holding, but how much of it is necessary is a mystery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">4. It will dramatically increase the number of lawsuits claiming violations of the right to informational privacy. Rare will be the claim that is supported by none of the factors deemed relevant in today\u2019s opinion. Moreover, the utter silliness of respondents\u2019 position in this case leaves plenty of room for the possible success of future claims that are meritless, but slightly less absurd. Respondents claim that <em>even though </em>they are Government contractor employees, and <em>even though </em>they are working with highly expensive scientific equipment, and <em>even though </em>the Government is seeking only information about drug treatment and information from third parties that is standard in background checks, and <em>even though </em>the Government is liable for damages if that information is ever revealed, and <em>even though </em>NASA\u2019s Privacy Act regulations are very protective of private information, NASA\u2019s background checks are unconstitutional. Ridiculous. In carefully citing <em>all </em>of these factors as the basis for its decision, the Court makes the distinguishing of this case simple as pie.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">In future cases filed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in those circuits that recognize (rather than merely hypothesize) a constitutional right to \u201cinformational privacy,\u201d lawyers will always (and I mean <em>always) </em>find some way around today\u2019s opinion: perhaps the plaintiff will be a receptionist or a janitor, or the protections against disclosure will be less robust. And oh yes, the fact that a losing defendant will be liable not only for damages but also for attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988 will greatly encourage lawyers to sue, and defendants\u2014for</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">[562 U.S. 169]</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">whom no safe harbor can be found in the many words of today\u2019s opinion\u2014to settle.

Ed. 2d, at 679, the Court\u2019s failure to address whether there is a right to informational privacy cannot be blamed upon the Government\u2019s concession that such a right exists, and indeed the Government\u2019s startling assertion that <em>Whalen </em>and <em>Nixon </em>(which decided nothing on the constitutional point, and have not been so much as cited in our later opinions) were \u201cseminal\u201d\u2014seminal!\u2014decisions. Reply Brief for Petitioners 22. We are not bound by a litigant\u2019s concession on an issue of law. See, <em>e.g., Grove City College </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>465 U.S. 555, 562, n. 10, 104 S. Ct. 1211, 79 L. Ed. 2d 516 (1984). And it should not be thought that the concession by the United States is an entirely self-denying act. To be sure, it subjects the Executive Branch to constitutional limitations on the collection and use of information; but the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a (2006 ed. and Supp. IV), already contains extensive limitations not likely to be surpassed by constitutional improvisation. And because Congress\u2019s power under \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment extends to the full scope of the Due Process Clause, see <em>City of Boerne </em>v. <em>Flores, </em>521 U.S. 507, 117 S. Ct. 2157, 138 L. Ed. 2d 624 (1997), the United States has an incentive to give that Clause a broad reading, thus expanding the scope of federal legislation that it justifies. Federal laws preventing state disregard of \u201cinformational privacy\u201d may be a twinkle in the Solicitor General\u2019s eye.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b794-12\">Justice Thomas,</author>\n<p id=\"AZq3\">concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-13\">I agree with Justice Scalia that the Constitution does not protect a right to informational privacy. <em>Ante, </em>at 160, 178 L.
