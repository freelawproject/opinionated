Plaintiff below, petitioner here, Ortiz filed a complaint in federal court stating key facts on which she based claims for damages against superintending prison officers. On two consecutive nights during her one-year incarceration, Ortiz stated, she was sexually assaulted by a corrections officer. Although she promptly reported the first incident, she further</p>\n<p id=\"Atv7Y\">[562 U.S. 183]</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">alleged, prison authorities took no measures to protect her against the second assault. After that assault, Ortiz charged, and in retaliation for accounts she gave of the two episodes, prison officials placed her, shackled and handcuffed, in solitary confinement in a cell without adequate heat, clothing, bedding, or blankets. The treatment to which she was exposed, Ortiz claimed, violated her right, safeguarded by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, to reasonable protection from violence while in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">Principal defendants in the suit, Paula Jordan, a case manager at Ortiz\u2019s living unit, and Rebecca Bright, a prison investigator, moved for summary judgment on their pleas of \u201cqualified immunity,\u201d a defense that shields officials from suit if their conduct \u201cd[id] not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S. Ct. 2727, 73 L. Ed. 2d 396 (1982). Finding that the qualified immunity defense turned on material facts genuinely in dispute, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(a), the District Judge denied summary judgment. <em>Ortiz </em>v. <em>Voinovich, </em>211 F. Supp. 2d 917, 923-930 (SD Ohio 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-15\">The case then proceeded to trial, and the jury returned verdicts for Ortiz against both Jordan and Bright. The two officers appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, targeting, <em>inter alia, </em>the denial of their pretrial motion for summary judgment. \u201c[CJourts normally do not review the denial of a summary judgment motion after a trial on the merits,\u201d the Court of Appeals recognized. 316 Fed. Appx. 449, 453 (2009). Nevertheless, the court continued, \u201cdenial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity is an exception to this rule.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>versing the judgment entered on the jury\u2019s verdict, the appeals court held that both defendants were sheltered from Ortiz\u2019s suit by qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">We granted review, 559 U.S. 1092, 130 S. Ct. 2371, 176 L. Ed. 2d 767 (2010), to decide a threshold question on which the Circuits are split:  May a party, as</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">[562 U.S. 184]</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">the Sixth Circuit believed, appeal an order denying summary judgment after a full trial on the merits?<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Our answer is no.  The order retains its interlocutory character as simply a step along the route to final judgment. See <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 546, 69 S. Ct. 1221, 93 L. Ed. 1528 (1949). Once the case proceeds to trial, the full record developed in court supersedes the record existing at the time of the summary-judgment motion. A qualified immunity defense, of course, does not vanish when a district court declines to rule on the plea summarily. The plea remains available to the defending officials at trial; but at that stage, the defense must be evaluated in light of the character and quality of the evidence received in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">When summary judgment is sought on a qualified immunity defense, the court inquires whether the party opposing the motion has raised any triable issue barring summary adjudication. \u201c[Office trial has been had,\u201d however, \u201cthe availability of official immunity should be determined by the trial record, not the pleadings nor the summary judgment record.\u201d 15AC. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a73914.10, p. 684 (2d ed. 1992 and Supp. 2010). After trial, if defendants continue to urge qualified immunity, the decisive question, ordinarily, is whether the evidence favoring the party seeking relief is legally sufficient to overcome the defense. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 50(a), (b) (stating conditions on which judgment may be granted as a matter of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">In the case before us, the Court of Appeals, although purporting to review the District Court\u2019s denial of the prison</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">[562 U.S. 185]</p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">officials\u2019 pretrial summary-judgment motion, 316 Fed. Appx., at 453, several times pointed to evidence presented only at the trial stage of the proceedings, see <em>id., </em>at 453-454. The appeals court erred, but not fatally, by incorrectly placing its ruling under a summary-judgment headline. Its judgment was infirm, however, because Jordan\u2019s and Bright\u2019s failure to renew their motion for judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b) left the appellate forum with no warrant to reject the appraisal of the evidence by \u201cthe judge who saw and heard the witnesses and ha[d] the feel of the case which no appellate printed transcript can impart.\u201d <em>Cone </em>v. <em>West Virginia Pulp &amp; Paper Co., </em>330 U.S. 212, 216, 67 S. Ct. 752, 91 L. Ed. 849 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b811-13\">Michelle Ortiz, serving a sentence for aggravated assault against her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>husband,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> maintained that she was sexually assaulted on consecutive days by Corrections Officer Douglas Schultz. On Friday, November 8, 1996, Ortiz recounted, Schultz walked up behind her in the washroom of her living quarters and grabbed one of her breasts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ortiz fended off the assault, but Schultz returned later that day and threatened to \u201csee [her] tomorrow,\u201d Tr. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">The next day, Ortiz described the incident to Jordan. After assuring Ortiz that \u201cno one has the right to touch you,\u201d 316 Fed. Appx., at 451 (internal quotation marks omitted), Jordan told Ortiz that Schultz had been reassigned to another correctional facility and was serving his last day at the reformatory. Ortiz could file a written complaint, Jordan noted. She suggested, however, that Ortiz not do so, in view of Schultz\u2019s imminent departure. Jordan advised Ortiz that she \u201calways ha[d] the right to defend [her]self,\u201d Tr. 43,</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">[562 U.S. 186]</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">and counseled her to \u201c \u2018hang out with [her] friends\u2019 for the rest of the day so that Schultz would not have the chance to be alone with her,\u201d 316 Fed. Appx., at 451 (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">The day of her conversation with Ortiz, Jordan wrote an incident report describing her version of the encounter. In that account, Jordan stated that Ortiz had refused to name her assailant or provide any other information about the assault. Jordan did not immediately notify her superiors of the assault Ortiz reported and Ortiz\u2019s consequent fears about her safety. Taking the incident report home in her workbag, Jordan submitted it upon her return to work two days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">Ortiz endeavored to follow Jordan\u2019s advice about staying in the company of friends. But later in the day, feeling ill, she returned to her room and fell asleep. Three other inmates were in the room when Ortiz went to sleep. They were gone when she awoke to find Schultz standing over her, one hand fondling her left breast, the fingers of the other hand inside her underwear penetrating her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">Bright\u2019s investigation began two days after the second assault. During its course, Bright placed Ortiz in solitary confinement. Ortiz maintained that Bright isolated her in retaliation for her accusations against Schultz. Bright, however, testified that she segregated Ortiz because Ortiz continued to discuss the investigation with other inmates, disobeying Bright\u2019s repeated instructions to refrain from speaking about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">In her \u00a7 1983 action, Ortiz claimed that Jordan did nothing to ward off Schultz\u2019s second sexual assault, despite Jordan\u2019s awareness of the substantial risk of that occurrence. Bright, Ortiz charged, retaliated against her because she resisted Bright\u2019s efforts to induce her to retract her accounts of Schultz\u2019s assaults. (Schultz, having resigned from state employment, could not be found and served with process.) The District Court, noting multiple factual disputes material to Ortiz\u2019s claims and the officers\u2019 defense of qualified immunity,</p>\n<p id=\"b812-12\">[562 U.S. 187]</p>\n<p id=\"b812-13\">denied summary judgment to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>Jordan and Bright, 211 F. Supp. 2d, at 923-930;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> neither defendant appealed the District Court\u2019s denial of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">The case proceeded to trial, and a jury returned a verdict of $350,000 in compensatory and punitive damages against Jordan and $275,000 against Bright. Jordan and Bright sought judgment as a matter of law, pursuant to Rule 50(a), both at the close of Ortiz\u2019s evidence and at the close of their own presentation. But they did not contest the jury\u2019s liability finding by renewing, under Rule 50(b), their request for judgment as a matter of law. Nor did they request a new trial under Rule 59(a). The District Court entered judgment for Ortiz in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">On appeal, Jordan and Bright urged both that the District Court should have granted them summary judgment on their defense of qualified immunity and that the verdict was \u201cagainst the weight of the evidence.\u201d Final Brief for Defendants-Appellants in No. 06-3627 (CA6), pp. 21, 26. Appraising the parties\u2019 evidence under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review, the Court of Appeals \u201creverse[d] the denial of qualified immunity to both Bright and Jordan.\u201d 316 Fed. Appx., at 455.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict among the Circuits as to whether a party may appeal a denial of summary</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">[562 U.S. 188]</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">judgment after a district court has conducted a full trial on the merits. See n. 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b813-11\">The jurisdiction of a Court of Appeals under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 extends only to \u201cappeals from . . . final decisions of the district courts.\u201d  Ordinarily, orders denying summary judgment do not qualify as \u201cfinal decisions\u201d subject to appeal. Summary judgment must be denied when the court of first instance determines that a \u201cgenuine dispute as to [a] material fact\u201d precludes immediate entry of judgment as a matter of law. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(a). Such rulings, we have observed, are \u201cby their terms interlocutory.\u201d <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wetzel, </em>424 U.S. 737, 744, 96 S. Ct. 1202, 47 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-12\">Because a plea of qualified immunity can spare an official not only from liability but from trial, we have recognized a limited exception to the categorization of summary-judgment denials as nonappealable orders. <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 525-526, 105 S. Ct. 2806, 86 L. Ed. 2d 411 (1985). When summary judgment is denied to a defendant who urges that qualified immunity shelters her from suit, the court\u2019s order \u201cfinally and conclusively [disposes of] the defendant\u2019s claim of right not to stand trial.\u201d <em>Id.., </em>at 527, 105 S. Ct. 2806, 86 L. Ed. 2d 411 (emphasis deleted). Therefore, <em>Mitchell </em>held, an immediate appeal may be pursued. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-13\">We clarified in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>515 U.S. 304, 115 S. Ct. 2151, 132 L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Ed. 2d 238 (1995), that immediate appeal from the denial of summary judgment on a qualified immunity plea is available when the appeal presents a \u201cpurely legal issue,\u201d illustratively, the determination of \u201cwhat law was \u2018clearly established\u2019 \u201d at the time the defendant acted. <em>Id., </em>at 313, 115 S. Ct. 2151, 132 L. Ed. 2d 238. However, instant appeal is not available, <em>Johnson </em>held, when the district court determines that factual issues genuinely in dispute preclude summary adjudication. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Jordan and Bright sought no immediate appeal from the denial of their motion for summary judgment. In light of <em>Johnson, </em>that abstinence is unsurprising. Moreover, even</p>\n<p id=\"AFZk4\">[562 U.S. 189]</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">had instant appellate review been open to them, the time to seek that review expired well in advance of trial.  See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(1)(A) (notice of appeal must generally be filed \u201cwithin 30 days after the judgment or order appealed from\u201d). Nor did they avail themselves of  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b), which permits the entry, postverdict, of judgment for the verdict loser if the court finds that the evidence was legally insufficient to sustain the verdict. See Rule 50(a), (b). Absent such a motion, we have repeatedly held, an appellate court is \u201cpowerless\u201d to review the sufficiency of the evidence after trial. <em>Unitherm Food Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Swift-Eckrich, Inc., </em>546 U.S. 394, 405, 126 S. Ct. 980, 163 L. Ed. 2d 974 (2006); see <em>Cone, </em>330 U.S., at 218, 67 S. Ct. 752, 91 L. Ed. 849.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">[562 U.S. 190]</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">\u201c[Q]uestions going to the sufficiency of the evidence are not preserved for appellate review by a summary judgment motion alone,\u201d Jordan and Bright acknowledge; rather, challenges of that order \u201cmust be renewed post-trial under Rule 50.\u201d Brief for Respondents 11 (emphasis deleted). Jordan and Bright insist, however, in defense of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s judgment, that sufficiency of the evidence is not what is at stake in this case. A qualified immunity plea raising an issue of a \u201cpurely legal nature,\u201d they urge, <em>ibid., </em>is preserved for appeal by an unsuccessful motion for summary judgment, and need not be brought up again under Rule 50(b), <em>id., </em>at 11-12 (citing as pathmarking <em>Rekhi </em>v. <em>Wildwood In</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number><em>dustries, Inc., </em>61 F.3d 1313, 1318 (CA7 1995)). Unlike an \u201cevidence sufficiency\u201d claim that necessarily \u201chinge[s] on the facts adduced at trial,\u201d they maintain, a purely legal issue can be resolved \u201cwith reference only to undisputed facts.\u201d Brief for Respondents 16 (quoting <em>Mitchell, </em>472 U.S., at 530, n. 10, 105 S. Ct. 2806, 86 L. Ed. 2d 411).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">We need not address this argument, for the officials\u2019 claims of qualified immunity hardly present \u201cpurely legal\u201d issues capable of resolution \u201cwith reference only to undisputed facts.\u201d Cases fitting that bill typically involve contests not about what occurred, or why an action was taken or omitted, but disputes about the substance and clarity of pre-existing law. See <em>Behrens </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>516 U.S. 299, 313, 116 S. Ct. 834, 133 L. Ed. 2d 773 (1996); <em>Johnson, </em>515 U.S, at 317, 115 S. Ct. 2151, 132 L. Ed. 2d 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Here, however, the pre-existing law was not in controversy. See <em>Farmer </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 847, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 128 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1994) (prison official may be held liable for \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to a prisoner\u2019s Eighth Amendment right to protection against violence while in custody if the official \u201cknows that [the] inmat[e] facets] a substantial risk of serious harm and disregards that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Crawford-El </em>v. <em>Britton, </em>523 U.S. 574, 592, 118 S.

Disputed facts relevant to resolving the officials\u2019 immunity pleas included: Was Jordan adequately informed, after the first assault, of the identity of the assailant, see App. 4, and of Ortiz\u2019s fear of a further assault? What, if anything, could Jordan have done to distance Ortiz from the assailant, thereby insulating her against a second assault? See <em>id., </em>at 4-5.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Did Bright place and retain Ortiz in solitary confinement as a retaliatory measure or as a control needed to safeguard the integrity of the investigation?<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">In sum, the qualified immunity defenses asserted by Jordan and Bright do not present \u201cneat abstract issues of law.\u201d See <em>Johnson, </em>515 U.S., at 317, 115 S. Ct. 2151, 132 L. Ed. 2d 238 (quoting 15A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a73914.10, p. 644 (1992)). To the extent that the officials urge Ortiz has not proved her case, they were, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>their own account, obliged to raise that sufficiency-of-the-evidence issue</p>\n<p id=\"AHhio\">[562 U.S. 192]</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">by postverdict motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b). See Brief for Respondents 11. They did not do so.

Jordan and Bright contend that their failure to file a Rule 50(b) motion cannot be the basis for overturning the judgment of the Court of Appeals. Because Ortiz presented no argument about the absence of a Rule 50(b) motion in her brief to the Sixth Circuit or in her petition for certiorari, Jordan and Bright argue, she has forfeited the objection. Jordan and Bright are not well positioned to make this argument. They did not suggest that Ortiz had forfeited her Rule 50(b) objection, or argue that such an objection is forfeitable, until their merits brief to this Court.  Ordinarily we do not consider \u201ca nonjurisdictional argument not raised in a respondent\u2019s brief in opposition to a petition.\u201d <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Reese, </em>541 U.S. 27, 34, 124 S.

The arguments Jordan and Bright made in the Court of Appeals invited no such objection. Jordan and Bright urged on appeal that the jury\u2019s verdict was \u201cagainst the weight of the evidence.\u201d Final Brief for Defendants-Appellants in No. 06-3627 (CA6), pp. 21-43.  A plea that a verdict is \u201cagainst the weight of the evidence,\u201d of course, is not equivalent to a plea that the evidence submitted at trial was insufficient to warrant submission of the case to the jury. 11 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 2806, pp. 65-67 (2d ed. 1995 and Supp. 2010). A determination that a verdict is against the weight of the evidence may gain a new trial for the verdict loser, but never a final judgment in that party\u2019s favor. <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>311 U.S. 243, 250-251, 61 S. Ct. 189, 85 L. Ed. 147 (1940). Ortiz objected, accordingly, that Jordan and Bright had not asked the District Court for a new trial and were therefore \u201cbar[red] [from] appeal on this ground.\u201d Final Brief for Plaintiff-Appellee in No. 06-3627 (CA6), p. 23. Ortiz thus responded altogether appropriately to the arguments Jordan and Bright made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b815-10\">. The Court of Appeals held that Ortiz\u2019s complaint had not properly tied her claim against Bright to the First Amendment. 316 Fed. Appx., at 455.  \u201cWhen an issue not raised by the pleadings is tried by the parties\u2019 express or implied consent,\u2019\u2019 however, \u201cit must be treated in all respects as if raised in the pleadings.\u2019\u2019 Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(b)(2). Bright, like the District Court, recognized the First Amendment interests at stake in Ortiz\u2019s claim against her. See App. 11 (District Court, in ruling on Rule 50(a) motion, inquired into Bright\u2019s authority to \u201cregulat[e] speech of inmates\u2019\u2019); <em>id., </em>at 20 (Bright\u2019s counsel argued that Ortiz\u2019s segregation \u201cwould not have had a chilling effect\u2019\u2019 on her speech).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b815-11\">. Relevant to that matter, Bright testified at trial that, had Jordan \u201creported the first incident immediately, \u2018the proper people would have taken a role in protecting Mrs. Ortiz.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 316 Fed. Appx., at 457 (Daughtrey, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b815-12\">. Apart from Bright\u2019s testimony, the defense produced no evidence that Ortiz \u201ccontinually\u2019\u2019 talked about the assaults or in any other way interfered with the investigation. See Tr. 271, 397 (Bright\u2019s testimony acknowledging absence of any documentation regarding Ortiz\u2019s conduct during investigation).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b816-5\">SEPARATE OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b816-6\">Justice Thomas,</author>\n<p id=\"AouY\">with whom Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy join, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">We granted certiorari to decide the narrow question whether a party may appeal an order denying summary judgment after a full trial on the merits. I agree with the Court that the answer is no. See <em>ante, </em>at 183-184, 178 L. Ed. 2d, at 708-709. The Court also reaches beyond that question, however, to address the effect of Jordan and Bright\u2019s failure to renew their motion for judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b). I would limit our decision to the question presented and remand for consideration of any additional issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">As the Court concludes, a party ordinarily cannot appeal an order denying summary judgment after a full trial on the merits. See <em>ante, </em>at 188-189, 178 L. Ed. 2d, at 711-712. Most such orders are not appealable at all, because they neither qualify as \u201cfinal decisions\u201d capable of appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 nor come within the narrow class of appealable interlocutory orders under \u00a7 1292(a)(1). And for those that are appealable,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the time for filing an appeal will usually have run by the conclusion of the trial. See \u00a7 2107(a) (providing that a notice of</p>\n<p id=\"b816-13\">[562 U.S. 193]</p>\n<p id=\"b816-14\">appeal in a civil case generally must be filed \u201cwithin thirty days\u201d after entry of the relevant judgment or order); Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-16\">This case is the ordinary case. Even if the order denying summary judgment qualified under the collateral order doctrine as an appealable \u201cfinal decision\u201d under \u00a7 1291, the time for filing that appeal expired long before trial. <em>Ante, </em>at 188-189, 178 L. Ed. 2d, at 711-712. The Court of Appeals therefore lacked jurisdiction to review the order. I would reverse the judgment on that ground alone and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-17\">The majority proceeds to consider the additional question whether Jordan and Bright\u2019s failure to file a Rule 50(b) motion deprived the Court of Appeals of the \u201c \u2018powe[r]\u2019 \u201d to review the sufficiency of the trial evidence. See <em>ante, </em>at 185, 189, 178 L. Ed. 2d, at 709, 712 (quoting <em>Unitherm Food Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Swift-Eckrich, Inc., </em>546 U.S. 394, 405, 126 S. Ct. 980, 163 L. Ed. 2d 974 (2006)). The Court does so because it concludes that the Court of Appeals did not confine itself to the pretrial record and instead reviewed the trial evidence. <em>Ante, </em>at 184-185, 178 L. Ed. 2d, at 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-18\">I do not think it necessary to reach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>beyond the question presented. It is clear from the opinion that the appeals court reviewed the order denying summary judgment, and that was error. The Court of Appeals explained that \u201c[although courts normally do not review the denial of a summary judgment motion after a trial on the merits,\u201d this case \u201cis an exception to th[at] rule.\u201d 316 Fed. Appx. 449, 453 (CA6 2009). And to support that conclusion, the court cited <em>Goff </em>v. <em>Bise, </em>173 F.3d 1068 (1999), in which the Eighth Circuit reviewed an order denying summary judgment. Finally, the Court of Appeals equated its review in this case to the review of an \u201cinterlocutory appea[l] of qualified immunity,\u201d which suggests that the court saw itself as reviewing the interlocutory order denying summary judgment. 316 Fed. Appx., at 453. Whether, in erroneously reviewing the order denying summary judgment, the Court of Appeals considered the pretrial or full trial record is beside the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">[562 U.S. 194]</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">I also think it unwise to reach the Rule 50 issue and the questions that follow. Ortiz\u2019s opening brief at the merits stage focused on the question presented\u2014whether the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to review an order denying summary judgment. It was not until Jordan and Bright\u2019s response brief in this Court, in which they argued that they had not actually appealed the order denying summary judgment, that the Rule 50 issues were addressed at any length. This Court normally proceeds more cautiously. Moreover, the Court of Appeals did not address these issues at all, and we are ordinarily \u201ca court of final review and not first view.\u201d <em>Adarand Constructors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mineta, </em>534 U.S. 103, 110, 122 S. Ct. 511, 151 L. Ed. 2d 489 (2001) <em>(per curiam) </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). This seems a good rule to follow in a case like this, which raises difficult and far-reaching questions of civil procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">For these reasons, I would resolve only the question on which we granted certiorari. I concur in the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b816-9\"> See <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 524-530, 105 S. Ct. 2806, 86 L.
