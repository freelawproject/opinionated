The regulation also imposes \u201c[s]ubse-quent disclosure requirements,\u201d including notice to cardholders \u201c[whenever any term required to be disclosed under \u00a7 226.6 is changed.\u201d \u00a7 226.9(c)(1). This case presents the question whether Regulation Z requires an issuer to notify a cardholder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>of an interest-rate increase instituted pursuant to a provision of the cardholder agreement giving the issuer discretion to increase the rate, up to a stated maximum, in the event of the cardholder\u2019s delinquency or default. We conclude that the version of Regulation Z applicable in this case does not require such notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">[562 U.S. 198]</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Congress passed TILA to promote consumers\u2019 \u201cinformed use of credit\u201d by requiring \u201cmeaningful disclosure of credit terms,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601(a), and granted the Board the authority to issue regulations to achieve TILA\u2019s purposes, \u00a7 1604(a). Pursuant to this authority, the Board promulgated Regulation Z, which requires credit card issuers to disclose certain information to consumers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Two provisions of Regulation Z are at issue in this case. The first,  12 CFR \u00a7 226.6, explains what information credit card issuers are obliged to provide to cardholders in the \u201c [i]nitial disclosure statement,\u201d including \u201ceach periodic rate that may be used to compute the finance charge.\u201d \u00a7 226.6(a)(2). The second, \u00a7 226.9, imposes upon issuers certain \u201c[s]ubsequent disclosure requirements,\u201d including a requirement to provide notice \u201c[w]henever any term required to be disclosed under \u00a7 226.6 is changed.\u201d \u00a7 226.9(c)(1). As a general matter, notice of a change in terms has to be provided 15 days in advance of the effective date of the change. <em>Ibid. </em>When \u201ca periodic rate or other finance charge is increased because of the consumer\u2019s delinquency or default,\u201d however, notice only need be given \u201cbefore the effective date of the change.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Regulation Z also explains that no notice is required under \u00a7 226.9 when the change in terms \u201cresults from . . . the consumer\u2019s default or delinquency (other than an increase in the periodic rate or other finance charge).\u201d \u00a7 226.9(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">The official interpretation of Regulation Z (Official Staff Commentary or Commentary) promulgated by the Board explains these requirements further: Section 226.9(c)(1)\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"AsVYV\">[562 U.S. 199]</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">notice-of-change requirement does not apply \u201cif the specific change is set forth initially, such as ... an increase that occurs when the consumer has been under an agreement to maintain a certain balance in a savings account in order to keep a particular rate and the account balance falls below the specified minimum.\u201d 12 CFR pt. 226, Supp. I, Comment 9(c)\u20141, p. 506 (2008) (hereinafter Comment 9(c)\u20141). On the other hand, the Commentary explains, \u201cnotice must be given if the contract allows the creditor to increase the rate at its discretion but does not include specific terms for an increase (for example, when an increase may occur under the creditor\u2019s contract reservation right to increase the periodic rate).\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>As to the timing requirements, the Commentary states: \u201c[A] notice of change in terms is required, but it may be mailed or delivered as late as the effective date of the change . . . [i]f there is an increased periodic rate or any other finance charge attributable to the consumer\u2019s delinquency or default.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Comment 9(c)(1)\u20143, at 507 (hereinafter Comment 9(c)(1)\u20143).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>At least as early as 2004, the Board began considering revisions to Regulation Z. The new regulations the Board eventually issued do not apply to the present case, but the details of their promulgation provide useful background in considering the parties\u2019 arguments with respect to the version of Regulation Z we address here. In 2004, the Board issued an advance notice of proposed rulemak-ing announcing its intent to consider revisions. 69 Fed. Reg. 70925 (2004). In so doing, the Board described how it understood the notice requirements to function at that time:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-4\">\u201c[AJdvance notice is not required in all cases. For example, if the interest rate or other finance charge increases due to a consumer\u2019s default or delinquency, notice is required, but need not be given in advance. 12 CFR 226.9(c)(1); comment 9(c)(1)-3. And no change-in-terms notice is required if the creditor specifies in advance the circumstances under which an increase to the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-5\">[562 U.S. 200]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-6\">finance charge or an annual fee will occur. Comment 9(c)\u20141. For example, some credit card account agreements permit the card issuer to increase the interest rate if the consumer pays late .... Under Regulation Z, because the circumstances are specified in advance in the account agreement, the creditor need not provide a change-in-terms notice 15 days in advance of the increase; the new rate will appear on the periodic statement for the cycle in which the increase occurs.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 70931-70932.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">The Board asked for public comment on whether these \u201cexisting disclosure rules\u201d were \u201cadequate to enable consumers to make timely decisions about how to manage their accounts.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 70932.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">Subsequently, in 2007, the Board published proposed amendments to Regulation Z and the Commentary. 72 Fed. Reg. 32948. One amendment would have required 45 days\u2019 advance written notice when \u201c(i) [a] rate is increased due to the consumer\u2019s delinquency or default; or (ii) [a] rate is increased as a penalty for one or more events specified in the account agreement, such as making a late payment or obtaining an extension of credit that exceeds the credit limit.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 33058 (proposed 12 CFR \u00a7 226.9(g)). The Board explained that, under the amendments, \u201ccreditors would no longer be permitted to provide for the immediate application of penalty pricing upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the contract.\u201d 72 Fed. Reg. 33012.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">In January 2009, the Board promulgated a final rule implementing many of the proposed changes, scheduled to be effective July 1, 2010. 74 Fed. Reg. 5244. Most saliently, the Board included a new provision, \u00a7 226.9(g), which requires 45 days\u2019 advance notice of increases in rates due to cardholder delinquency or default, or as a penalty, including penalties for \u201cevents specified in the account agreement, such as making a late payment. . . .\u201d 12 CFR \u00a7 226.9(g) (2010). In May 2009, Congress enacted the Credit Card Accountability</p>\n<p id=\"A9mG\">[562 U.S. 201]</p>\n<p id=\"b824-11\">Responsibility and Disclosure Act (Credit CARD Act or Act), 123 Stat. 1734. The Act amended TILA, in relevant part, to require 45 days\u2019 advance notice of most increases in credit card annual percentage rates. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1637(i) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). Because the Credit CARD Act\u2019s notice requirements with respect to interest-rate increases largely mirror the requirements in the new version of the regulation, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>Board changed the effective date of those requirements to August 20, 2009, to coincide with the statutory schedule. See 74 Fed. Reg. 36077-36079. The transactions giving rise to the dispute at issue in this case, however, arose prior to enactment of the Act and the promulgation of the new regulatory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Respondent James A. McCoy brought this action in the Superior Court of Orange County, California, on behalf of himself and others similarly situated against petitioner Chase Bank USA, N. A.; Chase removed the action to the United States District Court for the Central District of California under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441. At the time of the transactions at issue, McCoy was the holder of a credit card issued by Chase. The cardholder agreement between the parties (Agreement) provides, in relevant part, that McCoy is eligible for \u201cPreferred rates,\u201d but that to keep such rates he has to meet certain conditions, including making \u201cat least the required minimum payments when due on [his] Account and on all other loans or accounts with [Chase] and [his] other creditors.\u201d Brief for Respondent 8, n. 2; see also 559 F.3d 963, 972, n. 1 (CA9 2009) (Cudahy, J., dissenting). If any of the conditions in the Agreement are not met, Chase reserves the right to \u201cchange [McCoy\u2019s] interest rate and impose a Non-Preferred rate up to the maximum Non-Preferred rate described in the Pricing Schedule\u201d and to apply any changes \u201cto existing as well as new balances . . . effective with the billing cycle ending on the review date.\u201d Brief for Respondent 8, n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">[562 U.S. 202]</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">McCoy\u2019s complaint alleges that Chase increased his interest rate due to his delinquency or default, and applied that increase retroactively. McCoy asserts that the rate increase violates Regulation Z because, pursuant to the Agreement, Chase did not notify him of the increase until after it had taken effect.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court dismissed McCoy\u2019s complaint, holding that because the increase did not constitute a \u201cchange in terms\u201d as contemplated by 12 CFR \u00a7 226.9(c), Chase was not required to notify him of the increase before implementing it. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 37a-47a.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in relevant part, holding that Regulation Z requires issuers to provide notice of an interest-rate increase prior to its effective date. See 559 F.3d, at 969. Concluding that the text of Regulation Z is ambiguous and that the agency commentary accompanying the 2004 request for comments and the 2007 proposed amendments favors neither party\u2019s interpretation, the court relied primarily on the Official Staff Commentary; in particular, the court noted that Comment 9(c)\u20141 requires no notice of a change in terms if the \u201cspecific change\u201d at issue is set forth in the initial agreement. See <em>id., </em>at 965-967. The court found, however, that because the Agreement vests Chase with discretion to impose any nonpre-ferred rate it chooses (up to the specified maximum) upon McCoy\u2019s default, the Agreement \u201cprovides McCoy with no basis for predicting in advance what retroactive interest rate Chase will choose to charge him if he defaults.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 967. Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>court held that because the Agreement does not alert McCoy to the \u201cspecific change\u201d that will occur if he defaults, Chase</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">[562 U.S. 203]</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">was obliged to give notice of that change prior to its effective date. <em>Ibid. </em>Relying primarily on the 2004 notice of proposed rulemak-ing and the 2007 proposed amendments, the dissentingjudge concluded that Regulation Z does not require notice of an interest-rate increase in the circumstances of this case. See <em>id., </em>at 972-979 (opinion of Cudahy, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">After the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit decided the same question in Chase\u2019s favor. See <em>Shaner </em>v. <em>Chase Bank USA, N. A., </em>587 F.3d 488 (2009). The First Circuit relied in part on an <em>amicus </em>brief submitted by the Board at the court\u2019s request, in which the agency advanced the same interpretation of Regulation Z that it now does before this Court. <em>Id., </em>at 493. We granted certiorari to resolve this division in authority.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 561 U.S. 1005, 130 S. Ct. 3451, 177 L. Ed. 2d 1054 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">In order to decide this case, we must determine whether an interest-rate increase constitutes a \u201cchange in terms\u201d under Regulation Z, when the change is made pursuant to a provision in the cardholder agreement allowing the issuer to increase the rate, up to a stated maximum, in the event of the cardholder\u2019s delinquency or default. Accordingly, this case calls upon us to determine the meaning of a regulation promulgated by the Board under its statutory authority. The parties dispute the proper interpretation of the regulation itself, as well as whether we should accord deference to the Board\u2019s interpretation of its regulation. As explained below, we conclude that the text of the regulation is ambiguous, and that deference is warranted to the interpretation of that text advanced by the Board in its <em>amicus </em>brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-10\">[562 U.S. 204]</p>\n<p id=\"b826-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b826-12\">Our analysis begins with the text of Regulation Z in effect at the time this dispute arose. First, \u00a7 226.6 (2008) requires an \u201c [i]nitial disclosure statement\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-13\">\u201cThe creditor shall disclose to the consumer, in terminology consistent with that to be used on the periodic statement, each of the following items, to the extent applicable:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-14\">\u201c(a) <em>Finance charge. </em>The circumstances under which a finance charge will be imposed and an explanation of how it will be determined, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAMy5E\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"29\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAlIAAAAdAQAAAABJNb9OAAAAX0lEQVR4nO3UsQ2AMAxE0R8a1mI0JJZhjLADPWwAGxwNlUvjjnP5LT1FKdxE1WxDGQW2bNn6bJ2xJcL9WmtcJMIOgDQqTCIsknrxf82xJcIEgHTEByfCJak332hbP7QeLdOd2VehHZ8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"594\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-15\">\u201c(2) A disclosure of each periodic rate that may be used to compute the finance charge, the range of balances to which it is applicable, and the corresponding annual percentage rate. When different periodic rates apply to different types of transactions, the types of transactions to which the periodic rates apply shall also be disclosed.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-16\">Second, \u00a7 226.9(c) requires certain \u201c [subsequent disclosure requirements\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-17\"><em>\u201cChange in </em>terms\u2014(1) <em>Written notice required. </em>Whenever any term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>required to be disclosed under \u00a7 226.6 is changed or the required minimum periodic payment is increased, the creditor shall mail or deliver written notice of the change to each consumer who may be affected. The notice shall be mailed or delivered at least 15 days prior to the effective date of the change. The 15-day timing requirement does not apply if the change has been agreed to by the consumer, or if a periodic rate or other finance charge is increased because of the consumer\u2019s delinquency or default; the notice shall be given, however, before the effective date of the change.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-4\">[562 U.S. 205]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-5\">\u201c(2) <em>Notice not required. </em>No notice under this section is required when the change . . . results from . . . the consumer\u2019s default or delinquency (other than an increase in the periodic rate or other finance charge).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">The question is whether the increase in McCoy\u2019s interest rate constitutes a change to a \u201cterm required to be disclosed under \u00a7 226.6,\u201d requiring a subsequent disclosure under \u00a7 226.9(c)(1). One of the initial terms that must be disclosed under \u00a7 226.6 is \u201ceach periodic rate that may be used to compute the finance charge . . . and the corresponding annual percentage rate.\u201d \u00a7 226.6(a)(2). McCoy argues that, because an increase in the interest rate increases the \u201cperiodic rate\u201d applicable to his account, such an increase constitutes a change in terms within the meaning of \u00a7 226.9(c)(1). As further support, McCoy points to two provisions in \u00a7 226.9(c): first, that notice of an increase in the interest rate must be provided \u201cbefore the effective date of the change\u201d when the increase is due to \u201cthe consumer\u2019s delinquency or default,\u201d \u00a7 226.9(c)(1); and second, that no notice is required of a change resulting \u201cfrom the consumer\u2019s default or delinquency (other than an increase in the periodic rate or other finance charge),\u201d \u00a7 226.9(c)(2). Accordingly, because \u00a7 226.9(c) includes interest-rate increases due to delinquency or default, McCoy argues that the plain text of the regulation indicates that a change in the periodic rate due to such default is a \u201cchange in terms\u201d requiring notice under \u00a7 226.9(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">We recognize that McCoy\u2019s argument has some force; read in isolation, the language quoted above certainly suggests that credit card issuers must provide notice of an interest-rate increase imposed pursuant to cardholder delinquency or default. But McCoy\u2019s analysis begs the key question: whether the increase actually changed a \u201cterm\u201d of the Agreement that was \u201crequired to be disclosed under \u00a7 226.6.\u201d If not, \u00a7 226.9(c)\u2019s subsequent notice requirement with respect to a \u201cchange in terms\u201d does not apply. Chase argues</p>\n<p id=\"AO2Vj\">[562 U.S. 206]</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">precisely this: The increase did not change a term in the Agreement, but merely implemented one that had been initially disclosed, as required. This interpretation, though not commanded by the text of the regulation, is reasonable. Section 226.6(a)(2) requires initial disclosure of \u201ceach periodic rate that may be used to compute the finance charge.\u201d The Agreement itself discloses both the initial rate (preferred rate) and the maximum rate to be imposed in the event of default (nonpreferred rate). See Brief for Respondent 8, n. 2; Brief for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>Petitioner 13-14.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, it is plausible to understand the Agreement to initially disclose \u201ceach periodic rate\u201d to be applied to the account, and Chase arguably did not \u201cchange\u201d those rates as a result of McCoy\u2019s default. Instead, Chase merely implemented the previously disclosed term specifying the nonpreferred rate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">This reading still leaves the question why \u00a7 226.9(c)(1) refers to interest-rate increases resulting from delinquency or default if such increases do not constitute a \u201cchange in terms.\u201d One reasonable explanation Chase offers is that \u00a7 226.9(c)(1) refers to interest-rate increases that were not specifically outlined in the agreement\u2019s initial terms (unlike those in the present Agreement). For example, credit card agreements routinely include a \u201creservation of rights\u201d provision</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">[562 U.S. 207]</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">giving the issuer discretion to change the terms of the contract, often as a means of responding to events that raise doubts about the cardholder\u2019s creditworthiness. An issuer may exercise this general contract-modification authority and raise the interest rate applicable to the account to address any heightened risk. See Brief for Petitioner 6. In such a case, \u00a7 226.9(c)(1) is best read to require that notice must be given prior to the effective date of the increase, because the unilateral increase instituted by the issuer actually changed a term\u2014the interest rate\u2014in a manner not specifically contemplated by the agreement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See Comment 9(c)\u20141 (providing that notice is required if the agreement \u201cdoes not include specific terms for an increase (for example, when an increase may occur under the creditor\u2019s contract reservation right to increase the periodic rate)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">In short, Regulation Z is unclear with respect to the crucial interpretive question: whether the interest-rate increase at issue in this case constitutes a \u201cchange in terms\u201d requiring notice. We need not decide which party\u2019s interpretation is more persuasive, however; both are plausible, and the text alone does not permit a more definitive reading. Accordingly, we find Regulation Z to be ambiguous as to the question presented, and must therefore look to the Board\u2019s own interpretation of the regulation for guidance in deciding this case. See <em>Coeur Alaska, Inc. </em>v. <em>Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, </em>557 U.S. 261, 278, 129 S. Ct. 2458, 174 L.

Because the interpretation the Board presents in its brief is consistent with the regulatory text, we need look no further in deciding this case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">In its brief to this Court, the Board explains that the Ninth Circuit \u201cerred in concluding that, at the time of the transactions at issue in this case, Regulation Z required credit card issuers to provide a change-in-terms notice before implementing a contractual default-rate provision.\u201d See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>11; see also <em>ibid, </em>(stating that when a term of an agreement authorized the credit provider \u201cto increase a consumer\u2019s interest rate if the consumer failed to make timely payments . . . any resulting rate increase did not represent a \u2018change in terms,\u2019 but rather the implementation of terms already set forth in the</p>\n<p id=\"AJ52\">[562 U.S. 209]</p>\n<p id=\"b829-10\">initial disclosure statement\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 15-16 (stating that \u201c[w]hen a cardholder agreement identifies a contingency that triggers a rate increase, and the maximum possible rate that the issuer may charge if that contingency occurs,\u201d then \u201cno change-in-terms notice is required\u201d under Regulation Z).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under the principles set forth in <em>Auer, </em>we give deference to this interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-11\">In <em>Auer, </em>we deferred to the Secretary of Labor\u2019s interpretation of his own regulation, presented in an <em>am-icus </em>brief submitted by the agency at our invitation. 519 U.S., at 461-462, 117 S. Ct. 905, 137 L. Ed. 2d 79. Responding to the petitioners\u2019 objection that the agency\u2019s interpretation came in a legal brief, we held that this fact did not, \u201cin the circumstances of this case, make it unworthy of deference.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 462, 117 S. Ct. 905, 137 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>L. Ed. 2d 79. We observed that \u201c[t]he Secretary\u2019s position is in no sense a <em>\u2018post hoc </em>rationalizatio[n]\u2019 advanced by an agency seeking to defend past agency action against attack.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Georgetown Univ. Hospital, </em>488 U.S. 204, 212, 109 S. Ct. 468, 102 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1988)). We added: \u201cThere is simply no reason to suspect that the interpretation does not reflect the agency\u2019s fair and considered judgment on the matter in question.\u201d <em>Auer, </em>519 U.S., at 462, 117 S. Ct. 905, 137 L. Ed. 2d 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">The brief submitted by the Board in the present case, at our invitation, is no different. As in <em>Auer, </em>there is no reason to believe that the interpretation advanced by the Board is a <em>\u201cpost hoc </em>rationalization\u201d taken as a litigation position. The Board is not a party to this case. And as is evident from our discussion of Regulation Z itself, see Part II-A, <em>supra,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">[562 U.S. 210]</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">the Board\u2019s interpretation is neither \u201cplainly erroneous\u201d nor \u201cinconsistent with\u201d the indeterminate text of the regulation. In short, there is no reason to suspect that the position the Board takes in its <em>amicus </em>brief reflects anything other than the agency\u2019s fair and considered judgment as to what the regulation required at the time this dispute arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">McCoy may well be correct in asserting that it is better policy to oblige credit card issuers to give advance notice of a rate increase; after all, both Congress and the Board have recently indicated that such a requirement is warranted. See Credit CARD Act, \u00a7 101(a)(1), 123 Stat. 1735-1736; 12 CFR \u00a7 226.9(g) (2009). That Congress and the Board may currently hold such views does not mean, however, that deference is not warranted to the Board\u2019s different understanding of what the pre-2009 version of Regulation Z required. To the contrary, the interpretation the Board advances in its <em>amicus </em>brief is entirely consistent with its past views. The 2004 notice of rulemaking and the 2007 proposed amendments to Regulation Z make clear that, prior to 2009, the Board\u2019s fair and considered judgment was that \u201cno change-in-terms notice is required if the creditor specifies in advance the circumstances under which an increase . . . will occur,\u201d 69 Fed. Reg. 70931, and \u201cimmediate application of penalty pricing upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the contract\u201d was permissible, 72 Fed. Reg. 33012.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">Under <em>Auer, </em>therefore, it is clear that deference to the interpretation in the Board\u2019s <em>amicus </em>brief is warranted. The cases McCoy cites in which we declined to apply <em>Auer </em>do not suggest that deference is unwarranted here. In <em>Gonzales </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>546 U.S. 243, 126 S. Ct. 904, 163 L. Ed. 2d 748 (2006), we declined to defer because\u2014in sharp contrast to the present case\u2014the regulation in question did \u201clittle more than restate the terms of the statute\u201d pursuant to which the regulation was promulgated. <em>Id., </em>at 257, 126 S. Ct. 904, 163 L. Ed. 2d 748. Accordingly, no deference was warranted to an agency interpretation of what were, in fact, Congress\u2019 words.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">[562 U.S. 211]</p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\"><em>Ibid. </em>In contrast, at the time of the transactions in this case, TILA itself included no requirements with respect to the disclosure of a change in credit terms. In <em>Christensen </em>v. <em>Harris County, </em>529 U.S. 576, 120 S. Ct. 1655, 146 L. Ed. 2d 621 (2000), we declined to apply <em>Auer </em>deference because the regulation in question was unambiguous, and adopting the agency\u2019s contrary interpretation would \u201cpermit the agency, under the guise of interpreting a regulation, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>create <em>de facto </em>a new regulation.\u201d 529 U.S., at 588, 120 S. Ct. 1655, 146 L. Ed. 2d 621. In light of Regulation Z\u2019s ambiguity, there is no such danger here. And our statement in <em>Christensen </em>that \u201cdeference is warranted only when the language of the regulation is ambiguous,\u201d <em>ibid.., </em>is perfectly consonant with <em>Auer </em>itself; if the text of a regulation is unambiguous, a conflicting agency interpretation advanced in an <em>amicus </em>brief will necessarily be \u201cplainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation\u201d in question. <em>Auer, </em>519 U.S., at 461, 117 S. Ct. 905, 137 L. Ed. 2d 79 (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, under our precedent deference to the Board\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation, as presented in the agency\u2019s <em>amicus </em>brief, is wholly appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">McCoy further argues that deference to a legal brief is inappropriate because the interpretation of Regulation Z in the Official Staff Commentary commands a different result. To be sure, the Official Staff Commentary promulgated by the Board as an interpretation of Regulation Z may warrant deference as a general matter. See <em>Anderson Bros. Ford </em>v. <em>Valencia, </em>452 U.S. 205, 219, 101 S. Ct. 2266, 68 L. Ed. 2d 783 (1981) (holding that \u201cthe Board\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation\u201d should generally \u201cbe accepted by the courts\u201d); <em>Milhollin, </em>444 U.S., at 565, 100 S. Ct. 790, 63 L. Ed. 2d 22 (\u201cUnless demonstrably irrational, Federal Reserve Board staff opinions construing [TILA] or Regulation [Z] should be dispositive\u201d). We find, however, that the Commentary at issue here largely replicates the ambiguity present in the regulatory text, and therefore it offers us nothing to which we can defer with respect to the precise interpretive question before</p>\n<p id=\"A7_6\">[562 U.S. 212]</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">us.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>City of Jackson, </em>544 U.S. 228, 248, 125 S. Ct. 1536, 161 L. Ed. 2d 410 (2005) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (noting that deference is not warranted when \u201cthere is no reasoned agency reading of the text to which we might defer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">The Ninth Circuit relied primarily on Comment 9(c)( 1)\u20143, which states in relevant part that \u201ca notice of change in terms is required, but it may be mailed or delivered as late as the effective date of the change . . . [i]f there is an increased periodic rate or any other finance charge attributable to the consumer\u2019s delinquency or default.\u201d This exposition of the regulation does not add any clarity to the regulatory text, which expresses the same requirement. See \u00a7 226.9(c)(1) (2008) (\u201c[I]f a periodic rate or other finance charge is increased because of the consumer\u2019s delinquency or default . . . notice shall be given . . . before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>effective date of the change\u201d). And like \u00a7 226.9(c), Comment 9(c) is entitled \u201cChange in terms.\u201d Accordingly, Chase\u2019s plausible interpretation of \u00a7 226.9(c)(1) is equally applicable to Comment 9(c)( 1)\u20143: On Chase\u2019s view, because the interest-rate increase at issue in this case did not constitute a \u201cchange in terms,\u201d the disclosure requirements in the regulation and Commentary simply do not come into play. See <em>supra, </em>at 206-207, 178 L. Ed. 2d, at 725-726.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">[562 U.S. 213]</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Comment 9(c)\u20141 is also ambiguous, though the most plausible reading supports Chase\u2019s position more than it does McCoy\u2019s. The Comment begins: \u201cNo notice of a change in terms need be given if the specific change is set forth initially\u201d in the agreement. We do not find that the Comment\u2019s addition of the modifier \u201cspecific\u201d to the word \u201cchange\u201d enables us to determine, any more than we could in light of the text of the regulation, see <em>supra, </em>at 207, 178 L. Ed. 2d, at 726, whether the interest-rate increase at issue in this case was a \u201cchange in terms\u201d requiring notice. According to Chase, as long as the agreement explains that delinquency or default might trigger an increased interest rate and states the maximum level to which the rate could be increased, the \u201cspecific change\u201d that ensues upon default has been set forth initially and no additional notice is required before implementation. McCoy argues to the contrary: Under Comment 9(c)\u20141, any new rate imposed after delinquency or default must be disclosed prior to the effective date, if the particular rate (rather than the maximum rate) was not specifically mentioned in the agreement. On the whole, then, the Official Staff Commentary\u2019s explanation of Regulation Z does not resolve the uncertainty in the regulatory text, and offers us no reason to disregard the interpretation advanced in the Board\u2019s <em>amicus </em>brief.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">[562 U.S. 214]</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">McCoy further contends that our reliance here on an agency interpretation presented outside the four corners of the Official Staff Commentary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>will require future litigants, as well as the Board, to expend time and resources \u201cto comb through . . . correspondence, publications, and the agency\u2019s website to determine the agency\u2019s position.\u201d Brief for Respondent 37-38. We are not convinced. McCoy may be correct that the Board established the Official Staff Commentary so as to centralize its opin-ionmaking process and avoid \u201coverburdening the industry with excessive detail and multiple research sources.\u201d 46 Fed. Reg. 50288. But his suggestion that, if we accord deference to an <em>amicus </em>brief, all other \u201cunofficial\u201d sources will be fair game is of no moment. Today we decide only that the <em>amicus </em>brief submitted by the Board is entitled to deference in light of \u201cthe circumstances of this case.\u201d <em>Auer, </em>519 U.S., at 462, 117 S. Ct. 905, 137 L. Ed. 2d 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that, at the time of the transactions at issue in this case, Regulation Z did not require Chase</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">[562 U.S. 215]</p>\n<p id=\"AGJo\">to provide McCoy with a change-in-terms notice before it implemented the Agreement term allowing it to raise his interest rate following delinquency or default.</p>\n<p id=\"pA6XC\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"47\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAARUAAAAuAQAAAAAuX7CVAAAAk0lEQVR4nO3UsQ3CMBhE4eejgJKCATJIBmAPFmAE2C0l7JCCAWgtJJvSv8RJTkGDiLvv6WQ5TVKld7K6E1g3v7cpMRgIeMVs8MX31Ouj2UFQpvhKA4HmOdxrIEjnW8sOAk7PcL9BqpC3IX8iC7hfQjYQcNyFbCCo+7FVB0EZhpYdBJvx0LLD0u/qnSWbtP5//nLzBj0YOvdgPIJMAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"277\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b823-12\">. As discussed more fully below, see <em>infra, </em>at 200-201, 178 L. Ed. 2d, at 722-723, in 2009 the Board amended Regulation Z, such that the provisions discussed in this opinion are no longer in effect. However, because the pre-2009 provisions are the ones applicable to the case before us, we will refer to them in the present tense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b825-9\">. McCoy also asserted various state-law claims that are not before us. We note that McCoy\u2019s complaint provides little detail regarding the transactions at issue in this case. The parties, however, are in agreement as to the essential facts alleged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b826-18\">. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has also rejected the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit, though on a different question than the one presented in this case. See <em>Swanson </em>v. <em>Bank of America, N. A., </em>559 F.3d 653, reh\u2019g denied, 563 F.3d 634 (2009) (disagreeing with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of Regulation Z).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b828-9\">. The pricing schedule referred to in the Agreement is not contained in the case record, nor are its contents apparent from the parties\u2019 briefs, but neither side disputes that it specified a maximum nonpreferred rate applicable to the Agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b828-10\">. We are not persuaded by McCoy\u2019s argument that, although Chase did not change a \u201ccontract term\u2019\u2019 when it raised his interest rate pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, it changed a \u201ccredit term,\u2019\u2019 thereby triggering \u00a7 226.9(c)\u2019s notice requirement. The relevant text of Regulation Z does not refer to, let alone distinguish between, \u201ccontract terms\u2019\u2019 and \u201ccredit terms,\u2019\u2019 and McCoy\u2019s repeated citations to TILA\u2019s broad policy statement do not convince us that such a distinction is warranted. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601(a) (\u201cIt is the purpose of this subchapter to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit\u2019\u2019).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b828-11\">. The Government offers an alternative example. Assume that the agreement is similar to the one at issue here, with a specified maximum level to which the interest rate can be increased if the cardholder defaults. If default occurs but the issuer raises the rate above the contractual maximum, notice must be given prior to the effective date because the issuer actually changed the term of the contract initially specifying the maximum rate possible. See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>14-15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b829-12\">. We note that, in reaching its decision, the Ninth Circuit did not have the benefit of briefing from the Board. The Ninth Circuit apparently did not solicit the views of the Board in the proceedings below, see Brief for Petitioner 16, and the First Circuit did not solicit the Board\u2019s views in <em>Shaner </em>v. <em>Chase Bank USA, N. A., </em>587 F.3d 488 (2009), until after the Ninth Circuit issued its opinion in this case, see Order in No. 09-1157 (CA1, Aug. 4, 2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b829-13\">. This is consistent with the view the Board advanced in its <em>amicus </em>brief to the First Circuit, in which the Board noted that it \u201chas interpreted the applicable provisions of Regulation Z not to require a pre-effective date change-in-terms notice for an increase in annual percentage rate when the contingency that will trigger a rate increase and the specific consequences for the consumer\u2019s rate are set forth in the initial card member agreement.\u2019\u2019 App. to Brief for United States 2a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b831-9\">. We are not persuaded by McCoy\u2019s argument that the Board\u2019s own regulations make the Official Staff Commentary \u201cthe <em>exclusive </em>source of authorized staff opinion.\u2019\u2019 Brief for Respondent 36 (emphasis added). In the regulations McCoy cites the Board has indicated only that the central purpose of the Commentary is to present agency interpretations that, if relied upon, provide the basis for invoking the good-faith defense to liability under TILA. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(f) (precluding liability for \u201cany act done or omitted in good faith in conformity . . . with any interpretation ... by an official or employee . . . duly authorized by the Board to issue such interpretations . . . under such procedures as the Board may prescribe\u2019\u2019); 12 CFR pt. 226, App. C (2008) (\u201c[0]fficial staff interpretations of this regulation . . . provide the protection afforded under [ \u00a7 1640(f)]\u2019\u2019); <em>id., </em>Supp. I, Introduction \u00b61, p. 451 (same); 46 Fed. Reg. 50288 (1981) (same). McCoy cites no authority indicating that, in promulgating the Commentary and establishing certain statutory safe harbors, the Board intended to limit its ability to issue authoritative interpretations for other purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b832-9\">. In concluding otherwise, the Ninth Circuit focused on the examples Comment 9(c)-l provides of changes that, if set forth initially, require no further disclosure when put into effect: \u201cNo notice of a change in terms need be given if the specific change is set forth initially, such as: Rate increases under a properly disclosed variable-rate plan, a rate increase that occurs when an employee has been under a preferential rate agreement and terminates employment, or an increase that occurs when the consumer has been under an agreement to maintain a certain balance in a savings account in order to keep a particular rate and the account balance falls below the specified minimum.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">The Ninth Circuit concluded that, in contrast to each of these three examples, \u201cthe increase here occurs at Chase\u2019s discretion.\u2019\u2019 559 F.3d 963, 966 (2009). That is, once the triggering event\u2014McCoy\u2019s default\u2014occurred, Chase had the latitude to increase the interest rate as it saw fit (up to the limit specified in the Pricing Schedule).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\">We are not persuaded by the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning. Certainly, under a \u201cvariable-rate\u2019\u2019 plan the interest rate fluctuates according to an external variable easily discemable by the cardholder (like the federal prime rate), and the issuer has no discretion. See <em>ibid. </em>But the Comment\u2019s second and third examples do not appear to be significantly different from this case: The agreement contains a preset rate, but it also provides that, on the occurrence of a predefined event (terminating employment or a low account balance), the rate will increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-12\">Moreover, Comment 9(c)-1 further states that notice is needed \u201cif the contract allows the creditor to increase the rate at its discretion but does not include specific terms for an increase\u2019\u2019\u2014for example, \u201cwhen an increase may occur under the creditor\u2019s contract reservation right to increase the periodic rate.\u2019\u2019 It would seem that the narrower latitude Chase had under the Agreement to set the precise new rate within a specified range after McCoy defaulted is not the kind of \u201cdiscretion\u201d the last example of Comment 9(c)-1 contemplates. In short, analogizing to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Comment\u2019s examples suggests that Chase\u2019s action in setting a new rate was most likely a \u201cspecific change\u2019\u2019 that the Agreement itself contemplated, and subsequent disclosure was not clearly required.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
