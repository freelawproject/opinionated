Because that decision cannot be reconciled with the Antiter-rorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), and gives short shrift to a venerable common-law practice, I would grant the petition for writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">After they learned that Eugene and Deanna S. had won some money at a casino, respondent Anthony Smith and codefendant James Hinex drove to the couple\u2019s Sacramento home, burglarized it, and robbed both victims at gunpoint. During the robbery, one of the defendants put a gun to the head of Mrs. S. and forced her to perform oral copulation. Both Smith and Hinex were arrested and charged under California law with one count of residential burglary and two counts of residential robbery. Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 459 (West 2010), 211 (West 2008). Smith was also charged with forcible oral copulation. \u00a7 288a(c) (West 2008). At trial, the jury deliberated for a little over two days before convicting both defendants on the burglary and robbery counts. The jury had a more difficult time reaching agreement on the oral-copulation count. Tests showed that semen recovered from the crime scene matched Smith\u2019s DNA, but Mrs. S. had originally identified Hinex as her attacker.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">On the fourth day of deliberations, one juror sent the judge a note stating that he was unable to vote to convict Smith on the oral-copulation count because he thought the DNA evidence was unreliable. The trial judge then gave the jury a modified version of an <em>Allen </em>charge. See <em>Allen </em>v. <em>United States, </em>164 U.S. 492, 17 S. Ct. 154, 41 L. Ed. 528 (1896). When further deliberations proved fruitless, the judge decided to exercise the judicial authority, as recognized by the State Constitution, to \u201ccomment on the evidence.\u201d See Cal. Const., Art. VI, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">At the outset, the judge reminded the jurors that they were the \u201c \u2018exclusive judges of the facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Curry, </em>580 F.3d 1071, 1077 (CA9 2009). He explained that his comments were not intended \u201c \u2018to impose [his] will\u2019 \u201d on the jury, but only to review \u201ccertain evidence\u201d that they \u201c \u2018may not have considered.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The judge thought it \u201c \u2018important\u2019 \u201d for the jury to consider the statements Smith and Hinex \u201c \u2018made to law enforcement following their arrests,\u2019 \u201d particularly the \u201c \u2018consistencies and inconsistencies\u2019 \u201d between those statements. <em>Ibid. </em>The judge pointed out that Smith told police that both he and Hinex entered the house. Smith stated that he found Mrs. S. in a back bedroom, that Smith was armed at the time, and that Mrs. S. gave Smith a $100 bill. <em>Id., </em>at 1077-1078. The judge noted that Hinex also \u201c \u2018said Smith went to the back of the house . . . and closed the door.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1077. But Hinex denied going inside the house himself. The judge played the tapes of both defendants\u2019 statements for the jury. He told them to consider and discuss the statements during deliberations. Finally, the judge reiterated that his \u201c \u2018comments [were] advisory only\u2019 \u201d and that the jurors remained \u201c \u2018the exclusive judges\u2019 \u201d of the facts and the \u201c \u2018credibility of witnesses.\u2019 <em>\u201d Id., </em>at 1078. The jury continued their deliberations; a short time later, they returned a guilty verdict against Smith on the oral-copulation count.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">Smith argued on appeal that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>judge\u2019s comments coerced the jury\u2019s verdict. A California intermediate appellate court rejected that claim. The California Supreme Court denied review. Smith then filed a federal petition for writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, which the District Court granted. A split Ninth Circuit panel affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-3\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">Smith\u2019s claim on federal habeas is that the California appellate court unreasonably applied this Court\u2019s clearly established law forbidding coercive jury instructions. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); see Brief in Opposition 12. \u201c[CJlearly established\u201d law under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) consists of \u201cthe holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Court\u2019s\u201d cases. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 412, 412, 120 S. Ct. 1495, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389 (2000). An \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of that law involves not just an erroneous or incorrect decision, but an objectively unreasonable one. <em>Renico </em>v. <em>Lett, </em>559 U.S. 766, 130 S. Ct. 1855, 176 L. Ed. 2d 678 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The clearly established law relevant to this case is sparse. Just one of this Court\u2019s decisions, <em>Lowenfield </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>484 U.S. 231, 108 S. Ct. 546, 98 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1988), has addressed the constitutional rule against coercive jury instructions. And <em>Lowenfield </em>held only that, on the totality of the circumstances present there, no unconstitutional coercion resulted. <em>Id., </em>at 241, 108 S. Ct. 546, 98 L. Ed. 2d 568. The Court has also decided several cases on the specific practice of judicial comment on the evidence. <em>E.g., Quercia </em>v. <em>United States, </em>289 U.S. 466, 53 S. Ct. 698, 77 L. Ed. 1321 (1933). But all of those cases arose under this Court\u2019s supervisory power over federal courts; they set no clearly established constitutional limits under AEDPA. See <em>Early </em>v. <em>Packer, </em>537 U.S. 3, 10, 123 S. Ct. 362, 154 L. Ed. 2d 263 (2002) <em>(per curiam). </em>As a result, the clearly established law in this area provides very little specific guidance. About all that can be said is that coercive instructions are unconstitutional, coerciveness must be judged on the totality of the circumstances, and the facts of <em>Lowenfield </em>(polling a deadlocked jury and reading a slightly modified <em>Allen </em>charge) were not unconstitutionally coercive. See 484 U.S., at 237-241, 108 S. Ct. 546, 98 L. Ed. 2d 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">A general standard such as this gives state courts wide latitude for reasonable decisionmaking under AE-DPA. <em>Yarborough </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>541 U.S. 652, 664, 664, 124 S. Ct. 2140, 158 L. Ed. 2d 938 (2004) (\u201cThe more general the rule, the more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations\u201d). That latitude is wider still in this case, as no constitutional decision of this Court has ever explained how the general rule against \u201ccoercion\u201d applies to the traditional practice of judicial comment on the evidence. Cf. <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Musladin, </em>549 U.S. 70, 76, 127 S. Ct. 649, 166 L. Ed. 2d 482 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">For centuries, trial judges have enjoyed authority to comment on the evidence. At common law, the judge was empowered to \u201cweig[h] the evidence\u201d and share an \u201copinion\u201d with the jury, even \u201cin matter of fact.\u201d 2 M. Hale, History of the Common Law of England 147 (5th ed. 1794) (hereinafter Hale).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The practice is well established in this Court\u2019s cases as well. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>The Court has recognized that a trial judge has \u201cdiscretion\u201d to \u201ccomment upon the evidence,\u201d to call the jury\u2019s \u201cattention to parts of it which he thinks important,\u201d and to \u201cexpress his opinion upon the facts.\u201d <em>Vicksburg &amp; Meridian R. Co. </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>118 U.S. 545, 553, 7 S. Ct. 1, 30 L. Ed. 257 (1886); <em>Quercia, supra, </em>at 469, 53 S. Ct. 698, 77 L. Ed. 1321.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">To be sure, the practice has for many years been on the wane. Comment on the evidence has always been more popular in Britain than it ever was in this country. See 9 Wigmore \u00a7 2551, at 666. That said, federal courts and several States continue to recognize judicial authority to comment on the evidence, and California expressly protects the practice in its State Constitution. Cal. Const., Art. VI, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">This long tradition, combined with the complete absence of constitutional precedent on how to apply <em>Lovoen-field\u2019s </em>anticoercion principle in this context, shows that federal courts should tread lightly when faced with a claim that judicial comment on the evidence runs afoul of clearly established federal law. Outside of extreme cases, most decisions approving traditional uses of this common-law practice should fall within the bounds of reasonable decisionmaking under AE-DPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Here, the California appellate court did not unreasonably apply this Court\u2019s clearly established law. The trial judge, before commenting on the evidence, made clear that the jurors remained the exclusive judges of the facts and that the judge\u2019s comments were advisory only. 580 F.3d, at 1077. The judge then directed the jurors to particular evidence\u2014the defendants\u2019 initial statements to police\u2014and highlighted for them certain \u201c \u2018consistencies and inconsistencies\u2019 \u201d between those statements. <em>Ibid. </em>This practice of drawing the jury\u2019s \u201cattention to parts\u201d of the evidence that the judge thinks \u201c \u2018important\u2019 \u201d lies at the recognized core of the common-law power to comment on the evidence. See <em>Vicksburg, supra, </em>at 553, 7 S. Ct. 1, 30 L. Ed. 257; Hale 147 (The judge \u201cis able, ... in matters of fact, to give [the jury] great light and assistance, by . . . observing where the question and knot of the business lies; and by showing them his opinion even in matter of fact\u201d (some capitalization omitted)). Neither the trial judge\u2019s decision to employ the practice here nor the state appellate court\u2019s approval of the instruction ran afoul of clearly established federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">The Ninth Circuit\u2019s contrary decision rested in large measure on its concern that the comments \u201cpointed the jury to evidence leading to a particular verdict,\u201d while omitting to mention other evidence favorable to Smith. 580 F.3d, at 1081, 1083. But the common-law privilege to comment on the evidence has never required a compendious summary. Rather, the judge has traditionally enjoyed the power to focus on the particular evidence the <em>judge </em>thinks important, and to share with the jury an opinion on that evidence. <em>Vicksburg, supra, </em>at 553, 7 S. Ct. 1, 30 L. Ed. 257; <em>Quercia, </em>289 U.S., at 469, 53 S. Ct. 698, 77 L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Ed. 1321. It was not unreasonable under this Court\u2019s clearly established law for the California appellate court to approve that practice here.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-3\">The Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinion also suggests that, when a jury is \u201cdeadlocked,\u201d the judge may provide only \u201cappropriate encouragement ... to deliberate,\u201d and must refrain from providing the \u201cjudge\u2019s selective view of the evidence.\u201d 580 F.3d, at 1080. None of this Court\u2019s constitutional cases establish such a rule. And this Court\u2019s supervisory-power cases (which, if anything, set a more demanding standard than the constitutional minimum) have specifically upheld judicial comments that provide a particular \u201cview of the evidence\u201d to an apparently deadlocked jury. See <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>142 U.S. 148, 155, 12 S. Ct. 171, 35 L. Ed. 968 (1891) (no error where judge denied deadlocked jury\u2019s request to be discharged and told them \u201cthat he regarded the testimony as convincing\u201d). Nothing in this Court\u2019s clearly established law prohibits the trial judge from offering an opinion to a jury that is struggling to reach a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">The Ninth Circuit was also troubled that the trial judge\u2019s comments appeared to be designed to address the concerns of the holdout juror. 580 F.3d, at 1082. And the panel majority disapproved of the trial judge\u2019s \u201cmandatory language\u201d directing the jury to \u201c \u2018consider and discuss\u2019 \u201d the evidence highlighted by the court. <em>Id., </em>at 1082-1083. Whatever potential for coercion these comments caused, the California appellate court\u2019s decision upholding them \u201cwas clearly <em>not </em>unreasonable\u201d under the general <em>Lowenfield </em>standard. See <em>Renico, </em>559 U.S., at 779, 130 S. Ct. 1855, 176 L. Ed. 2d 678. I would grant certiorari in this case and correct the Ninth Circuit\u2019s error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b507-9\"> See J.
