Nearly all Americans who work for wages pay taxes on those wages un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>der the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), which Congress enacted to collect funds for Social Security. The question presented in this case is whether doctors who serve as medical residents are properly viewed as \u201cstudent[s]\u201d whose service Congress has exempted from FICA taxes under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3121(b)(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Most doctors who graduate from medical school in the United States pursue additional education in a specialty to become board certified to practice in that field. Petitioners Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, Mayo Clinic, and the Regents of the University of Minnesota (collectively Mayo) offer medical residency programs that provide</p>\n<p id=\"AlLlq\">[562 U.S. 48]</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">such instruction. Mayo\u2019s residency programs, which usually last three to five years, train doctors primarily through hands-on experience. Residents often spend between 50 and 80 hours a week caring for patients, typically examining and diagnosing them, prescribing medication, recommending plans of care, and performing certain procedures. Residents are generally supervised in this work by more senior residents and by faculty members known as attending physicians. In 2005, Mayo paid its residents annual \u201cstipends\u201d ranging between $41,000 and $56,000 and provided them with health insurance, malpractice insurance, and paid vacation time.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">Mayo residents also take part in \u201ca formal and structured educational program.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 5 (internal quotation marks omitted). Residents are assigned textbooks and journal articles to read and are expected to attend weekly lectures and other conferences. Residents also take written exams and are evaluated by the attending faculty physicians. But the parties do not dispute that the bulk of residents\u2019 time is spent caring for patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">Through the Social Security Act and related legislation, Congress has created a comprehensive national insurance system that provides benefits for retired workers, disabled workers, unemployed workers, and their families. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>455 U.S. 252, 254, 258, and nn. 1, 7, 102 S. Ct. 1051, 71 L. Ed. 2d 127 (1982). Congress funds Social Security by taxing both employers and employees under FICA on the wages employees earn. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101(a) (tax on employees); \u00a7 3111(a) (tax on employers). Congress has defined \u201cwages\u201d broadly, to encompass \u201call remuneration for employment.\u201d \u00a7 3121(a) (2006 ed. and Supp. III). The term \u201cemployment\u201d has a similarly broad reach, extending to \u201cany service, of whatever nature, performed ... by an employee for the person employing him.\u201d \u00a7 3121(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">[562 U.S. 49]</p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">Congress has, however, exempted certain categories of service and individuals from FICA\u2019s demands. As relevant here, Congress has excluded from taxation \u201cservice performed in the employ of . . . a school, college, or university ... if such service is performed by a student who is enrolled and regularly attending classes at such school, college, or university.\u201d \u00a7 3121(b)( 10) (2006 ed.). The Social Security Act, which governs workers\u2019 eligibility for benefits, contains a corresponding student exception materially identical to \u00a7 3121(b)(10). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 410(a)(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Since 1951, the Treasury Department has applied the student exception to exempt from taxation students who work for their schools \u201cas an incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study\u201d there. 16 Fed. Reg. 12474 (adopting Treas. Regs. 127, \u00a7 408.219(c)); see Treas. Reg. \u00a7 31.3121(b)(10)-2(d), 26 CFR \u00a7 31.3121(b)(10)-2(d) (2010). Until 2005, the Department determined whether an individual\u2019s work was \u201cincident to\u201d his studies by performing a case-by-case analysis. The primary considerations in that analysis were the number of hours worked and the course load taken. See, <em>e.g., </em>Rev. Rul. 78-17, 1978-1 Cum. Bull. 307 (services of individual \u201cemployed on a full-time basis\u201d with a part-time course load are \u201cnot incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">For its part, the Social Security Administration (SSA) also articulated in its regulations a case-by-case approach to the corresponding student exception in the Social Security Act. See 20 CFR \u00a7 404.1028(c) (1998). The SSA has, however, \u201calways held that resident physicians are not students.\u201d SSR 78-3, Cum. Bull. 1978, pp. 55-56. In 1998, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that the SSA could not categorically exclude residents from student status, given that its regulations provided for a case-by-case approach. See <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Apfel, </em>151 F.3d 742, 747-748. Following that decision, the Internal Revenue Service received more than 7,000 claims seeking FICA tax refunds on</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">[562 U.S. 50]</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">the ground that medical residents qualified as students under \u00a7 3121(b)( 10) of the Internal Revenue Code. 568 F.3d 675, 677 (CA8 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Facing that flood of claims, the Treasury Department \u201cdetermined that it [wa]s necessary to provide additional clarification of the ter[m]\u201d \u201cstudent\u201d as used in \u00a7 3121(b)( 10), particularly with respect to individuals who perform \u201cservices that are in the nature of on the job training.\u201d 69 Fed. Reg. 8605 (2004). The Department proposed an amended rule for comment and held a public hearing on it. See <em>id., </em>at 76405.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">On December 21, 2004, the Department adopted an amended rule prescribing that an employee\u2019s service is \u201cincident\u201d to his studies only when \u201c [t]he educational aspect of the relationship between the employer and the employee, as compared to the service aspect of the relationship, [is] predominant.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 76408; Treas. Reg. \u00a7 31.3121(b)(10)-2(d)(3)(i), 26 CFR \u00a7 31.3121(b)(10)-2(d)(3)(i) (2005). The rule categorically provides that \u201c [t]he services of a full-time employee\u201d\u2014as defined by the employer\u2019s policies, but in any event including any employee normally scheduled to work 40 hours or more per week\u2014\u201care not incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study.\u201d 69 Fed. Reg. 76408; Treas. Reg. \u00a7 31.3121(b)(10)-2(d)(3)(iii), 26 CFR \u00a7 31.3121(b)(10)-2(d)(3)(iii) (the full-time employee rule). The amend ed provision clarifies that the Department\u2019s analysis \u201cis not affected by the fact that the services performed . . . may have an educational, instructional, or training aspect.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The rule also includes as an example the case of \u201cEmployee E,\u201d who is employed by \u201cUniversity V\u201d as a medical resident. 69 Fed. Reg. 76409; Treas. Reg. \u00a7 31.3121(b)(10)-2(e), 26 CFR \u00a7 31.3121(b)(10)-2(e) (Example 4). Because Employee E\u2019s \u201cnormal work schedule calls for [him] to perform services 40 or more hours per week,\u201d the rule provides that his service is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>\u201cnot incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study,\u201d and he accordingly is not an exempt \u201cstudent\u201d under \u00a7 3121(b)( 10).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">[562 U.S. 51]</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">69 Fed. Reg. 76409, 76410; Treas. Reg. \u00a7 31.3121(b)(10)-2(e), 26 CFR \u00a7 31.3121(b)( 10)\u20142(e) (Example 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">After the Department promulgated the full-time employee rule, Mayo filed suit seeking a refund of the money it had withheld and paid on its residents\u2019 stipends during the second quarter of 2005. 503 F. Supp. 2d 1164, 1166-1167 (Minn. 2007); <em>Regents of Univ. of Minn. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>Civ. No. 06-5084 (D Minn., Apr. 1, 2008), App. to Pet. for Cert. 47a. Mayo asserted that its residents were exempt under \u00a7 3121(b)( 10) and that the Treasury Department\u2019s full-time employee rule was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">The District Court granted Mayo\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court held that the full-time employee rule is inconsistent with the unambiguous text of \u00a7 3121, which the court understood to dictate that \u201can employee is a \u2018student\u2019 so long as the educational aspect of his service predominates over the service aspect of the relationship with his employer.\u201d 503 F. Supp. 2d, at 1175. The court also determined that the factors governing this Court\u2019s analysis of regulations set forth in <em>National Muffler Dealers Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>440 U.S. 472, 99 S. Ct. 1304, 59 L. Ed. 2d 519 (1979), \u201cindicate that the full-time employee exception is invalid.\u201d 503 F. Supp. 2d, at 1176; see App. to Pet. for Cert. 54a.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">The Government appealed, and the Court of Appeals reversed. 568 F.3d 675. Applying our opinion in <em>Chevron U. S. A. Inc. </em>v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984), the Court of Appeals concluded that \u201cthe statute is silent or ambiguous on the question whether a medical resident working for the school full-time is a \u2018student\u2019 \u201d for purposes of \u00a7 312l(b)( 10), and that the Department\u2019s amended regulation \u201cis a permissible interpretation of the statut[e].\u201d 568 F.3d, at 679-680, 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-13\">We granted Mayo\u2019s petition for certiorari. 560 U.S. 938, 130 S. Ct. 3353, 176 L. Ed. 2d 1244 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-14\">[562 U.S. 52]</p>\n<p id=\"b698-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b698-16\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b698-17\">We begin our analysis with  the first step of the two-part framework announced in <em>Chevron, supra, </em>at 842-843, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694, and ask whether Congress has \u201cdirectly addressed the precise question at issue.\u201d We agree with the Court of Appeals that Congress has not done so. The statute does not define the term \u201cstudent,\u201d and does not otherwise attend to the precise question whether medical residents are subject to FICA. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3121(b)(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-18\">Mayo nonetheless contends that the Treasury Department\u2019s full-time employee rule must be rejected under <em>Chevron </em>step one. Mayo argues that the dictionary definition of \u201cstudent\u201d\u2014one \u201cwho engages in \u2018study\u2019 by applying the mind \u2018to the acquisition of learning, whether by means of books, observation, or experiment\u2019 \u201d\u2014 plainly encompasses residents. Brief for Petitioners 22 (quoting Oxford Universal Dictionary 2049-2050 (3d ed. 1955)). And, Mayo adds, residents are not excluded from that category by the only limitation on students Congress has imposed under the statute\u2014that they \u201cbe \u2018enrolled and regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>larly attending classes at [a] school.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Petitioners 22 (quoting \u00a7 3121(b)( 10)).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">Mayo\u2019s reading does not eliminate the statute\u2019s ambiguity as applied to working professionals. In its reply brief, Mayo acknowledges that a full-time professor taking evening classes\u2014a person who presumably would satisfy the statute\u2019s class-enrollment requirement and apply his mind to learning\u2014could be excluded from the exemption and taxed because he is not \u201c \u2018predominantly]\u2019 \u201d a student. Reply Brief for Petitioners 7. Medical residents might likewise be excluded on the same basis; the statute itself does not resolve the ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The District Court interpreted \u00a7 3121(b)( 10) as unambiguously foreclosing the Department\u2019s rule by mandating that</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">[562 U.S. 53]</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">an employee be deemed \u201ca \u2018student\u2019 so long as the educational aspect of his service predominates over the service aspect of the relationship with his employer.\u201d 503 F. Supp. 2d, at 1175. We do not think it possible to glean so much from the little that \u00a7 3121 provides. In any event, the statutory text still would offer no insight into how Congress intended predominance to be determined or whether Congress thought that medical residents would satisfy the requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">To the extent Congress has specifically addressed medical residents in \u00a73121, moreover, it has expressly excluded these doctors from exemptions they might otherwise invoke. See  \u00a7\u00a7 3121(b)(6)(B), (7)(C)(ii) (excluding medical residents from exemptions available to employees of the District of Columbia and the United States). That choice casts doubt on any claim that Congress specifically intended to insulate medical residents from FICA\u2019s reach in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">In sum, neither the plain text of the statute nor the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the exemption \u201cspeak[s] with the precision necessary to say definitively whether [the statute] applies to\u201d medical residents. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Eurodif S. A., </em>555 U.S. 305, 319, 129 S. Ct. 878, 172 L. Ed. 2d 679 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b699-12\">In the typical case, such an ambiguity would lead us inexorably to  <em>Chevron </em>step two, under which we may not disturb an agency rule unless it is \u201c \u2018arbitrary or capricious in substance, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Household Credit Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pfennig, </em>541 U.S. 232, 242, 124 S. Ct. 1741, 158 L. Ed. 2d 450 (2004) (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mead Corp., </em>533 U.S. 218, 227, 121 S. Ct. 2164, 150 L. Ed. 2d 292 (2001)). In this case, however, the parties disagree over the proper framework for evaluating an ambiguous provision of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-13\">Mayo asks us to apply the multifactor analysis we used to review a tax regulation in <em>National Muffler, supra. </em>There we explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b699-14\">[562 U.S. 54]</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-15\">\u201cA regulation may have particular force if it is a substantially contemporaneous construction of the statute by those presumed to have been aware of congressional intent. If the regulation dates from a later period, the manner in which it evolved merits inquiry. Other relevant considerations are the length of time the regulation has been in effect, the reliance placed on it, the consistency of the Commissioner\u2019s inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>pretation, and the degree of scrutiny Congress has devoted to the regulation during subsequent reenactments of the statute.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 477, 99 S. Ct. 1304, 59 L. Ed. 2d 519.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">The Government, on the other hand, contends that the <em>National Muffler </em>standard has been superseded by <em>Chevron. </em> The sole question for the Court at step two under the <em>Chevron </em>analysis is \u201cwhether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d 467 U.S., at 843, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Since deciding <em>Chevron, </em>we have cited both <em>National Muffler </em>and <em>Chevron </em>in our review of Treasury Department regulations. See, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., </em>532 U.S. 200, 219, 121 S. Ct. 1433, 149 L. Ed. 2d 401 (2001) (citing <em>National Muffler); Cottage Savings Assn. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>499 U.S. 554, 560-561, 111 S. Ct. 1503, 113 L. Ed. 2d 589 (1991) (same); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Boyle, </em>469 U.S. 241, 246, n. 4, 105 S. Ct. 687, 83 L. Ed. 2d 622 (1985) (citing <em>Chevron); </em>see also <em>Atlantic Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>523 U.S. 382, 387, 389, 118 S. Ct. 1413, 140 L. Ed. 2d 542 (1998) (citing <em>Chevron </em>and <em>Cottage Savings).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Although we have not thus far distinguished between <em>National Muffler </em>and <em>Chevron, </em>they call for different analyses of an ambiguous statute. Under <em>National Muffler, </em>for example, a court might view an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute with heightened skepticism when it has not been consistent over time, when it was promulgated years after the relevant statute was enacted, or because of the way in which the regulation evolved. 440 U.S., at 477, 99 S. Ct. 1304, 59 L. Ed. 2d 519. The District Court in this case cited each of these factors in rejecting the Treasury Department\u2019s rule, noting in particular that the regulation had been promulgated after an adverse judicial</p>\n<p id=\"ARnhj\">[562 U.S. 55]</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">decision. See 503 F. Supp. 2d, at 1176; see also Brief for Petitioners 41-44 (relying on the same considerations).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">Under <em>Chevron, </em>in contrast, deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of an ambiguous statute does not turn on such considerations. We have repeatedly held that  \u201c[algency inconsistency is not a basis for declining to analyze the agency\u2019s interpretation under the <em>Chevron </em>framework.\u201d <em>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn. </em>v. <em>Brand X Internet Services, </em>545 U.S. 967, 981, 125 S. Ct. 2688, 162 L. Ed. 2d 820 (2005); accord, <em>Eurodif S. A., supra, </em>at 316, 129 S. Ct. 878, 172 L. Ed. 2d 679. We have instructed that \u201cneither antiquity nor contemporaneity with [a] statute is a condition of [a regulation\u2019s] validity.\u201d <em>Smiley </em>v. <em>Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., </em>517 U.S. 735, 740, 116 S. Ct. 1730, 135 L. Ed. 2d 25 (1996). And we have found it immaterial to our analysis that a \u201cregulation was prompted by litigation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 741, 116 S. Ct. 1730, 135 L. Ed. 2d 25. Indeed, in <em>United Dominion Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>532 U.S. 822, 838, 121 S. Ct. 1934, 150 L. Ed. 2d 45 (2001), we expressly invited the Treasury Department to \u201camend its regulations\u201d if troubled by the consequences of our resolution of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">Aside from our past citation of <em>National Muffler, </em>Mayo has not advanced any justification for applying a less deferential standard of review to Treasury Department regulations than we apply to the rules of any other agency. In the absence of such justification, we are not inclined to carve out an approach to administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>tive review good for tax law only. To the contrary, we have expressly \u201c[r]ec-ogniz[ed] the importance of maintaining a uniform approach to judicial review of administrative action.\u201d <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Zurko, </em>527 U.S. 150, 154, 119 S. Ct. 1816, 144 L. Ed. 2d 143 (1999). See, <em>e.g., Skinner </em>v. <em>Mid-America Pipeline Co., </em>490 U.S. 212, 222-223, 109 S. Ct. 1726, 104 L. Ed. 2d 250 (1989) (declining to apply \u201ca different and stricter nondelegation doctrine in cases where Congress delegates discretionary authority to the Executive under its taxing power\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">The principles underlying our decision in <em>Chevron </em>apply with full force in the tax context. <em>Chevron </em>recognized that \u201c[t]he power of an administrative agency to administer a congressionally</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">[562 U.S. 56]</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">created . . . program necessarily requires the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill any gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress.\u201d 467 U.S., at 843, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (internal quotation marks omitted). It acknowledged that the formulation of that policy might require \u201cmore than ordinary knowledge respecting the matters subjected to agency regulations.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 844, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (internal quotation marks omitted). Filling gaps in the Internal Revenue Code plainly requires the Treasury Department to make interpretive choices for statutory implementation at least as complex as the ones other agencies must make in administering their statutes. Cf. <em>Bob Jones Univ. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>461 U.S. 574, 596, 103 S. Ct. 2017, 76 L. Ed. 2d 157 (1983) (\u201cIn an area as complex as the tax system, the agency Congress vests with administrative responsibility must be able to exercise its authority to meet changing conditions and new problems\u201d). We see no reason why our review of tax regulations should not be guided by agency expertise pursuant to <em>Chevron </em>to the same extent as our review of other regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">As one of Mayo\u2019s <em>amici </em>points out, however, both the full-time employee rule and the rule at issue in <em>National Muffler </em>were promulgated pursuant to the Treasury Department\u2019s general authority under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7805(a) to \u201cprescribe all needful rules and regulations for the enforcement\u201d of the Internal Revenue Code. See Brief for Carlton M. Smith 4-7. In two decisions predating <em>Chevron, </em>this Court stated that \u201cwe owe the [Treasury Department\u2019s] interpretation less deference\u201d when it is contained in a rule adopted under that \u201cgeneral authority\u201d than when it is \u201cissued under a specific grant of authority to define a statutory term or prescribe a method of executing a statutory provision.\u201d <em>Rowan Cos. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>452 U.S. 247, 253, 101 S. Ct. 2288, 68 L. Ed. 2d 814 (1981); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vogel Fertilizer Co., </em>455 U.S. 16, 24, 102 S. Ct. 821, 70 L. Ed. 2d 792 (1982) (quoting <em>Rowan).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">Since <em>Rowan </em>and <em>Vogel </em>were decided, however, the administrative landscape has changed significantly. We have held</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">[562 U.S. 57]</p>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">that  <em>Chevron </em>deference is appropriate \u201cwhen it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.\u201d <em>Mead, </em>533 U.S., at 226-227, 121 S. Ct. 2164, 150 L. Ed. 2d 292. Our inquiry in that regard does not turn on whether Congress\u2019s delegation of authority was general or specific. For example, in <em>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn., supra, </em>we held that the Federal Communications Commission was del<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>egated \u201cthe authority to promulgate binding legal rules\u201d entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference under statutes that gave the Commission \u201cthe authority to \u2018execute and enforce,\u2019 \u201d and \u201cto \u2018prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary in the public interest to carry out the provisions\u2019 of,\u201d the Communications Act of 1934. 545 U.S., at 980-981, 125 S. Ct. 2688, 162 L. Ed. 2d 820 (quoting 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151, 201(b)). See also <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Everhart, </em>494 U.S. 83, 87, 88-89, 110 S. Ct. 960, 108 L. Ed. 2d 72 (1990) (applying <em>Chevron </em>deference to rule promulgated pursuant to delegation of \u201cgeneral authority to \u2018make rules and regulations and to establish procedures, not inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter, which are necessary or appropriate to carry out such provisions\u2019 \u201d (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(a) (1982 ed.))).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">We believe <em>Chevron </em>and <em>Mead, </em>rather than <em>National Muffler </em>and <em>Rowan, </em>provide the appropriate framework for evaluating the full-time employee rule.  The Department issued the full-time employee rule pursuant to the explicit authorization to \u201cprescribe all needful rules and regulations for the enforcement\u201d of the Internal Revenue Code. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7805(a) (2006 ed.). We have found such \u201cexpress congressional authorizations to engage in the process of rulemaking\u201d to be \u201ca very good indicator of delegation meriting <em>Chevron </em>treatment.\u201d <em>Mead, supra, </em>at 229, 121 S. Ct. 2164, 150 L. Ed. 2d 292. The Department issued the full-time employee rule only after notice-and-comment procedures, 69 Fed. Reg. 76405, again a consideration identified in our precedents as a \u201csignificant\u201d sign that a rule merits</p>\n<p id=\"AVOjf\">[562 U.S. 58]</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\"><em>Chevron </em>deference. <em>Mead, supra, </em>at 230-231, 121 S. Ct. 2164, 150 L. Ed. 2d 292; see, <em>e.g., Long Island Care at Home, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Coke, </em>551 U.S. 158, 173-174, 127 S. Ct. 2339, 168 L. Ed. 2d 54 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">We have explained that  \u201cthe ultimate question is whether Congress would have intended, and expected, courts to treat [the regulation] as within, or outside, its delegation to the agency of \u2018gap-filling\u2019 authority.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 173, 127 S. Ct. 2339, 168 L. Ed. 2d 54 (emphasis deleted). In the <em>Long Island Care </em>case, we found that <em>Chevron </em>provided the appropriate standard of review \u201c[w]here an agency rule sets forth important individual rights and duties, where the agency focuses fully and directly upon the issue, where the agency uses full notice-and-comment procedures to promulgate a rule, [and] where the resulting rule falls within the statutory grant of authority.\u201d 551 U.S., at 173, 127 S. Ct. 2339, 168 L. Ed. 2d 54. These same considerations point to the same result here. This case falls squarely within the bounds of, and is properly analyzed under, <em>Chevron </em>and <em>Mead,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">\n<em>C</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">The full-time employee rule easily satisfies the second step of <em>Chevron, </em>which asks whether the Department\u2019s rule is a \u201creasonable interpretation\u201d of the enacted text. 467 U.S., at 844, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694. To begin, Mayo accepts that \u201cthe \u2018educational aspect of the relationship between the employer and the employee, as compared to the service aspect of the relationship, [must] be predominant\u2019 \u201d in order for an individual to qualify for the exemption. Reply Brief for Petitioners 6-7 (quoting Treas. Reg. \u00a7 31.3121(b)( 10)-2(d)(3)(i), 26 CFR \u00a7 31.3121(b)( 10)-2(d)(3)(i)). Mayo objects, however, to the Department\u2019s conclusion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>residents who work more than 40 hours per week categorically cannot satisfy that requirement. Because residents\u2019 employment is itself educational, Mayo argues, the hours a resident spends working make him \u201cmore of a student, not less of one.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioners 15, n. 3 (emphasis deleted). Mayo contends that the Treasury Department should be required to engage in a case-by-case</p>\n<p id=\"A1S1\">[562 U.S. 59]</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">inquiry into <em>\u201cwhat </em>[each] employee does [in his service] and why\u201d he does it. <em>Id., </em>at 7. Mayo also objects that the Department has drawn an arbitrary distinction between \u201chands-on training\u201d and \u201cclassroom instruction.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">We disagree. Regulation, like legislation, often requires drawing lines. Mayo does not dispute that the Treasury Department reasonably sought a way to distinguish between workers who study and students who work, see IRS Letter Ruling 9332005 (May 3, 1993). Focusing on the hours an individual works and the hours he spends in studies is a perfectly sensible way of accomplishing that goal. The Department explained that an individual\u2019s service and his \u201ccourse of study are separate and distinct activities\u201d in \u201cthe vast majority of cases,\u201d and reasoned that \u201c[e]mployees who are working enough hours to be considered full-time employees . . . have filled the conventional measure of available time with work, and not study.\u201d 69 Fed. Reg. 8607. The Department thus did not distinguish classroom education from clinical training but rather education from service. The Department reasonably concluded that its full-time employee rule would \u201cimprove administrability,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 76405, and it thereby \u201chas avoided the wasteful litigation and continuing uncertainty that would inevitably accompany any purely case-by-case approach\u201d like the one Mayo advocates, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cornell, </em>389 U.S. 299, 302, 88 S. Ct. 445, 19 L. Ed. 2d 537 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">As the Treasury Department has explained, moreover, the full-time employee rule has more to recommend it than administrative convenience. The Department reasonably determined that taxing residents under FICA would further the purpose of the Social Security Act and comport with this Court\u2019s precedent. As the Treasury Department appreciated,  this Court has understood the terms of the Social Security Act to \u201c \u2018import a breadth of coverage,\u2019 \u201d 69 Fed. Reg. 8605 (quoting <em>Social Security Bd. </em>v. <em>Nierotko, </em>327 U.S. 358, 365, 66 S. Ct. 637, 90 L. Ed. 718 (1946)), and we have instructed that \u201cexemptions from</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">[562 U.S. 60]</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">taxation are to be construed narrowly,\u201d <em>Bingler </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>394 U.S. 741, 752, 89 S. Ct. 1439, 22 L. Ed. 2d 695 (1969). Although Mayo contends that medical residents have not yet begun their \u201cworking lives\u201d because they are not \u201cfully trained,\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioners 13 (internal quotation marks omitted), the Department certainly did not act irrationally in concluding that these doctors\u2014 \u201cwho work long hours, serve as highly skilled professionals, and typically share some or all of the terms of employment of career employees\u201d\u2014 are the kind of workers that Congress intended to both contribute to and benefit from the Social Security system, 69 Fed. Reg. 8608.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">The Department\u2019s rule takes into account the SSA\u2019s concern that exempting residents from FICA would deprive residents and their families of vital disability and survivorship benefits that Social Security provides. <em>Id., </em>at 8605. Mayo wonders whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>full-time employee rule will result in residents being taxed under FICAbut denied coverage by the SSA. The Government informs us, however, that the SSA continues to adhere to its longstanding position that medical residents are not students and thus remain eligible for coverage.

Because it is one to which Congress has not directly spoken, and because the Treasury Department\u2019s rule is a reasonable construction of what Congress has said, the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
