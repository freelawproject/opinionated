Similar transactions had previously occurred, and the defendant had paid Elliott the amounts so disbursed by him. It was clearly proved that the debt paid for the defendant company to its workmen was due and was just. The only defence attempted was a mere technicality.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-15\">: At the trial the District Court ordered the state of demand amended so that it would show that the plaintiff was the assignee of claims of one Robert A. Elliott. It is objected that this was error. This amendment in nowise changed the defence which the defendant had in the action, and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>clearly within the power of the court, under the District Court act and the decisions of this state. <em>Pamph.
