Stat., p. </em>1644, \u00a7 49; <em>Gen. Stat., p. </em>1642, \u00a7 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">Powers conferred for the preservation of the public health should receive a liberal construction so that they may be rendered effective. <em>Morford </em>v. <em>Board of Health, </em>32 <em>Vroorn </em>386; <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>40 <em>N.

Stat., p. </em>1638, \u00a7 16.</p>\n<p id=\"AAy\">It was adopted on the. 23d of December, 1903, and-by its terms was to take effect on the 1st day of January, 1904.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-16\"><em>Gen.
