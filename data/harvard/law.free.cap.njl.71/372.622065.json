In this contract the defendant agreed to pay a commission of two per cent, on any selling price agreed to between the defendant and a purchaser in case plaintiffs procured such purchaser. The hotel was sold and conveyed 'by the defendant to one Core for $30,000. Whether Core had been procured as a purchaser by the plaintiffs was a question of fact upon which the testimony was conflicting. The plaintiffs\u2019 testimony, if believed by the jury, was sufficient to establish their right to the commission on $30,000. The pertinent questions were properly left to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>The plaintiffs declared upon the common counts. The commission, having been earned, could be recovered under this declaration. <em>Hinds </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>7 <em>Vroom </em>328, relied upon by the defendant\u2019s counsel, was a case in which the plaintiff was a volunteer, who had no agreement with the defendant, express or implied (at <em>p. </em>331), and the sale itself fell through without default on the part of the defendant (at <em>p. </em>335). The case has no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The common counts charge a general right to recover money based upon something that had been <em>done </em>\u2014 i. fully performed \u2014 so that nothing remains but the payment of the money so earned. In such case, if a simple contract exists, the plaintiff is not required to declare upon it, but may put it in evidence in proof of the particulars of such general right. 4 <em>Am. &amp; Eng. Encycl. L. </em>328; <em>Weart </em>v. Hoagland, 2 <em>Zab. </em>517.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">The circumstance that the contract was one required by the statute of frauds to be in writing, does not take the case out of this rule. <em>Wilkinson</em>\u2014Gaddis <em>Company </em>v. <em>Van </em>Riper, 34 <em>Vroom </em>394.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">The defendant\u2019s rule is discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
