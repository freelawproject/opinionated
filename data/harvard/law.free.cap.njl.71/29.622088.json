It appears that a dispute arose between the defendant and Pfeiffer as to their rights under the contract between them dated August 30th, 1901, their difference being thus described by the defendant\u2019s chief engineer, Mr. Ledoux: \u25a0\u201cI interpreted the contract according to the quantities in the contract itself and the prices in the contract itself. Senator Pfeiffer claimed that his bid was based on some other quantities which he ought to have had put into the contract, but which he made a mistake in not having put in.\u201d To settle that dispute the present order and acceptance were given, and its terms cover sirch sum, not exceeding $4,918.06, as, when added, to \u201cwhatever amount may he due to him [Pfeiffer] under vo-ur [the defendant\u2019s] present construction and interpretation of the contract,\u201d would make the sum of $56,651.15. Hence the inquiry is not what came due or was paid on the contract, but what came due on the defendant\u2019s construction \u25a0of the contract. Respecting this the testimony offered by the defendant is clear. Mr. Ledoux testified that he never changed his interpretation of the contract, but that as the basis of settlement he allowed \u201cthe full amount of the contract price and also the amount of that agreement,\u201d meaning the order in suit. His final estimate, an exhibit in the cause, states as the amount due on the contract the sum of $51,-792.51, and \u201cby agreement made March 3d, 1902, $4,918.06,\u201d making a total of $56,710.57. The difference between this and the limit set in the order ($56,651.15) has not been the subject of comment, and need not be further noticed by us. Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Hodge, the defendant\u2019s secretary and. assistant treasurer, also testified that the sum paid to Pfeiffer included what was due under the order. This evidence makes it plain that $4,918.06' came due <em>on the </em>order, and hence, under Pfeiffer\u2019s transfer, belonged to the plaintiff. Consequently, if the defendant was notified of the plaintiff\u2019s title before the money was paid to Pfeiffer, the defendant became bound to- pay the plaintiff that sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Pfeiffer claims that there is still owing to- him from the defendant about $5,500, but the defendant insists that it made a final settlement with him about July 21st, 1902, when hp was paid about $13,000. In either case, notice given before July, 1902, would bind the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Pfeiffer testified that he told the defendant\u2019s president, assistant treasurer and chief engineer of the assignment a few days after it was made, and one of those officers swore that no such information was given to- him and the other two swore that they had no recollection of it. In response to a special interrogatory submitted to- the jury by the trial justice, the jury returned a finding that notice of the assignment was given before the second week of March, 1902. We think the nature of the evidence would not justify us in overturning this conclusion, of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Counsel for defendant ftj.rtb.er insist that even if they were obliged to pay the plaintiff, yet Pfeiffer, by his own evidence, is shown to have been authorized by the plaintiff to receive the money for it, and hence the payment to- him about July 21st, 1902, satisfied the present claim.. But Pfeiffer\u2019s evidence on- this point clearly refers to a time after that date, and to a demand for payment, which was refused. The payments made up to and including that date were certainly not made to nor received on behalf of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Lastly, it is urged that tire order and acceptance were void for want of consideration. But there manifestly was a legal consideration. The settlement of the dispute, Pfeiffer\u2019s consent to- go- on with the work, which he had avowed a determination to- abandon unless adjustment was made, were valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>grounds for a modification of the contract, if this order introduced any, modification; and, if it did not, the contract itself was sufficient consideration for this instrument. It is not shown that Pfeiffer\u2019s contention as to the real bargain was set up in bad faith, and he might have resorted to a suit in equity for reformation of the written contract. The law afforded the defendant no means of compelling Pfeiffer to prosecute the work on the terms of the writing; it could only give a pecuniary compensation for refusal, and, under these, circumstances, for the parties to settle their controversy by mutual concessions was clearly lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The rule to show cause should be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
