ATLANTIC CITY RAILROAD COMPANY.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b443-8\">Argued June 8, 1904</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Avc\">Decided November 7, 1904.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b443-9\">This court will not, upon a rule to show cause, grant a new trial merely because of a variance between the negligence alleged and the negligence proved, when the variance was not brought to the attention of the trial judge, and might have been cured by an amendment.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-10\">On rule to show cause.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b443-11\">Before Gusemere, Chief Justice, and Justices Garrison and Sivayze.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b443-12\">For the plaintiff, <em>Ralph W.

The question was not, however, presented to the trial court, as will appear from the grounds of the motion as stated by counsel and quoted <em>verbatim </em>above. We ought not, therefore, to review its action. The well-established rule as to bills of exception has been held applicable to a review upon a rule to show cause. <em>Jackson, Administrator, </em>v. <em>Consolidated Traction Co., </em>30 <em>Vroom </em>25. And this case has been cited with approval in the Court of Errors and Appeals, in <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Leber, </em>36 <em>Id. </em>195, 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">The rule should be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
