Also the evidence of the circumstances under which the alleged letting took place should have been submitted to the jury to determine whether P. or his clerk was authorized to let the rooms to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-14\">The judgment below will be reversed and a <em>venire de novo </em>ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
