The city appealed and received a hearing de novo before the superior court. RSA 281:3V I (Supp. 1972). The trial court found for Huard and in a subsequent hearing denied the city\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict. All exceptions were reserved and transferred by <em>Perkins, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">Officer Huard, a regular Manchester policeman, volunteered to fill in for another officer on an off-duty assignment as a guard at Mrs. Bea\u2019s restaurant on March 20, 1971. The restaurant cook instructed him on the area he was to guard. While performing this function, the officer arrested a restaurant patron for drunkeness, whereupon six other patrons assaulted and seriously injured him. Officers performing extra duty of this nature wear their full uniform and equipment as did Officer Huard, except that he did not have his walkie-talkie radio because of a shortage of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">Assaults caused by or resulting from working conditions or the conditions and obligations of employment are compensable under the statutory language \u201carising out of and in the course of employment.\u201d RSA 281:2 V (Supp. 1972); <em>Newell v. Moreau, </em>94 N.H. 439, 55 A.2d 476 (1947); <em>LaBonte v. National Gypsum Company, </em>110 N.H. 314, 269 A.2d 634 (1970). The obligations of a policeman\u2019s employment, either as a regular policeman or as guard at a restaurant, encompass making arrests for drunkenness.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">The issue is whether the officer was an employee of the city at the time of the injury under the then applicable statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>tory language, \u201cEmployee, with respect to public employment, means every person in the service of the state, ... or of any political subdivision. .. thereof,. . ., under any contract of hire, express or implied, and every official or officer thereof, whether elected or appointed, while performing his official duties.\u201d Laws 1967, 403:1, <em>as amended, </em>RSA 281:2 IV (Supp. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The city argues that when the officer took the special employment with Mrs. Bea\u2019s, he became an employee solely of this new special employer. The officer contends that the peace-preserving nature of his employment with Mrs. Bea\u2019s still constituted part of his general employment with the city. Huard was an employee of the city for the purposes of workmen\u2019s compensation liability if (1) there was a contract for hire with the city, (2) the work he was doing was of the nature he was employed to do for the city, and (3) the city had a right to control the details of the work. 1A Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 48.00 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">In this case, there is no question but that Huard was a regular police officer hired by the city. In making an arrest, he was performing the functions and duties of a police officer. <em>Mathurin v. Putnam, </em>136 Conn. 361, 71 A.2d 599 (1950). His action related as much to preserving the general public safety as it did to the benefit of Mrs. Bea\u2019s. The city had a sufficient continuing interest in what he was doing to make it liable for the injuries he received while he was doing it. 1A Larson, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 48.22. The city had a duty to preserve order and the use of police officers for off-duty jobs such as this merely shifted the financial burden to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The fact that the officer was paid by Mrs. Bea\u2019s and was instructed on the area to guard does not preclude Huard from being an employee of the city. In carrying out the special assignment Huard was still governed by police regulations and the evidence shows that police superiors checked on off-duty officers and disciplined them for poor performance. It appears that the procedures used in making the arrest in this case conformed to those used by officers on regular duty rather than those followed by private guards. The evidence warrants a finding that the details of Huard\u2019s work at Mrs. Bea\u2019s were under the supervision and direction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>the police department so as to bring him within the city\u2019s employ at the time of the injury. <em>Cf. Bisson v. Winnipesaukee Air Service, Inc., </em>91 N.H. 73, 13 A.2d 821 (1940); <em>Currier v. Abbott, </em>104 N.H. 299, 185 A.2d 263 (1962). Huard was where he was and doing what he was doing only because he was a police officer. <em>Henderson v. Sherwood Motor Hotel Inc., </em>105 N.H. 443, 201 A.2d 891 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-3\">The finding of the trial court must stand since it could be reasonably made from the evidence. <em>Walter v. Hagianis, </em>97 N.H. 314, 87 A.2d 154 <em>(1952); Jackson v. Emile J. Legere, Inc., </em>110 N.H. 252, 265 A.2d 18 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b144-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
