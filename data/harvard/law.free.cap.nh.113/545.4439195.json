His claim is based on certain alleged technical defects in notice and other aspects of the tax sale. After trial by the court, the petition was denied and the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions were transferred by <em>Grant, </em>J. We have examined the plaintiff\u2019s claims and find them to be without merit as there was substantial compliance with the requirements of a valid tax sale. <em>Coleman v.
