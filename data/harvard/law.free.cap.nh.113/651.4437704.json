Swenson, </em>by brief, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b711-7\"><em>Winer, Lynch, Pillsbury &amp; Howorth, </em>by brief, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b711-8\">Griffith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar0K\">Plaintiff drilled a well for the defendant and brought this action to recover the balance claimed due for the work performed. Defendant claimed that the plaintiff had agreed to drill the well for $1000 which he had paid. Plaintiff claimed he was to be paid at the rate of $6 per foot and that since the well was 700 feet deep he was entitled to $3200 in addition to the $1000 received from the defendant. The sole issue between the parties was whether the oral contract was for a flat rate of $1000 or that the well was to be paid for at the rate of $6 per foot. Trial by the Court, <em>Loughlin, </em>J., resulted in a verdict of $3200 for the plaintiff. Defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict was denied by the trial court who reserved and transferred defendant\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">Defendant excepted to the trial court\u2019s permitting plaintiff to testify that he had never drilled a well on a flat rate basis. Testimony of habit or custom of a party is generally admissible on the issue of his intent or action in the situation in dispute. <em>Buxton v. Langan, </em>90 N.H. 13, 3 A.2d 647 (1939); <em>U.S. Fidelity &amp;c. Co. v. Dunn, </em>90 N.H. 236, 7 A.2d 246 (1939); <em>State v. Cornwell, </em>97 N.H. 446, 91 A.2d 456 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">The only other exception briefed by the defendant is to the denial of his motion to set aside the verdict. He argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>that the evidence required a finding that the oral contract between the parties was for a flat rate of $1000. There were three witnesses who testified in the case. The plaintiff testified he agreed with the defendant to drill the well for $6 per foot. Defendant testified that plaintiff agreed to drill the well for a flat rate of $1000. Defendant\u2019s wife testified that she heard part of the conversation on the agreement and supported her husband\u2019s version. The $1000 was paid before the well was completed and the receipt given by the plaintiff read: \u201cReceived $1000.00, in payment on a well on Wiley Hill Road, Londonderry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">It is the function of the trier of fact to determine contradictions in testimony and since there is evidence to support the verdict it will not be disturbed on appeal. <em>Anderson-Nichols Company, Inc. v. Page, </em>113 N.H. 445, 309 A.2d 148 (1973); <em>Kalman v. Hutcheson, </em>111 N.H. 36, 276 A.2d 260 (1971); <em>Guy v.
