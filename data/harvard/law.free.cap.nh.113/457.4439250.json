In this connection it may be noted that the duties of the board and its members are not restricted solely to public schools (RSA 186:11 XXIX (Supp. 1972)) or elementary and secondary schools. RSA 186:13-a (Supp. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">The applicable restrictive provisions of RSA 186:1 as to the membership of the State board of education appeared in Laws 1919, 106:1 by which the State board of education was first established. The statutory exclusion of \u201ctechnical educators\u201d and persons \u201cprofessionally engaged in school work\u201d was specifically recommended by a report to the legislature of a distinguished advisory committee. The following significant language pertaining to the powers and membership of the board appears in the committee report: \u201cSuch powers cannot wisely be given to a single official nor to a body composed exclusively of persons occupying educational posts and subject to the blinding influence of special theories of education. If this view of the matter is sound, the necessary power should be given to a board composed of practical citizens of wisdom and prudence who, while possessing such knowledge of educational matters as will enable them to arbitrate questions of educational principles and policy with good judgment and sagacity, can be trusted at the same time to steer clear of the vagaries and extravagances inherent in many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>educational theories. In short, there should be a governing board composed of practical persons and an executive department composed of educational experts; for while our schools must be carried on under expert direction, this direction should be exercised with due consideration for prevailing economic and social conditions and in such a way as to exclude costly educational experiments.\u201d N.H. State Board of Education Report 1919-1920, at 19-20 (1920).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b520-8\">Governor Meldrim Thomson, Jr., by his legal counsel. Charles G. Douglas III, for an affirmative answer.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">In view of the specific language of RSA 186:1, its origin, and its legislative history, we are of the opinion that it was the legislative purpose then and now that the State board of education should not be composed of \u201ctechnical educators\u201d or persons \u201cprofessionally engaged in school work\u201d regardless of the character or type of school involved. Accordingly the answer to your question is \u201cNo\u201d, a member of the State board of education may not engage in classroom teaching for a private, four-year, post-secondary educational institution without violating the provisions of RSA 186:1.</p>\n<judges id=\"b520-6\">Frank R.
