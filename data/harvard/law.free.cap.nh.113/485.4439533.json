A trial by the court resulted in a verdict for the plaintiffs for $600. The defendant's exceptions were reserved and transferred by <em>Keller, </em>C.J.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>The plaintiff Wilson testified that he agreed to install two separate septic tank systems with leach fields and fills for the service of the defendant\u2019s apartments, at a price of $2400, and that he fulfilled this contract. It is undisputed that he has been paid $1800. The defendant claimed that the plaintiffs also agreed to make connections between the apartments and the tanks. This the plaintiffs denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The contradictions between the parties, who were the only witnesses, were severe, but as we have repeatedly held, such conflicts were for the trial court to resolve. <em>Clover &amp;c. Co. v. Smith Co., </em>96 N.H. 491, 79 A.2d 8 (1951); <em>Streeter v. New England Box Co., </em>106 N.H. 146, 148, 207 A.2d 423, 424 (1965).
