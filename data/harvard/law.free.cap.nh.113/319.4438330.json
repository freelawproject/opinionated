Hamanne. All questions of law raised by the pleadings and an agreed statement of facts were reserved and transferred by <em>King, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Blanche C. Hamanne for several years prior to February 12, 1969, owned and operated the Gosselin Paint Store in Berlin. The store sold paint, oils, wallpapers and related products. For a number of years the store had owned a gas-powered machine for removing wallpaper by means of steam. This machine was rented to customers and on February 12, 1969, was rented to Richard Parent, the son of defendant Jennie Parent, for use in removing wallpaper at Jennie Parent\u2019s house in Berlin. The machine was used on February 12, 1969, in the Parent house and a fire occurred resulting in damage to the house and personal property of Jennie Parent and damage to certain personal property of Anna Sanschagrin, a tenant of Jennie Parent. Suits have been brought against defendant Hamanne by Parent and Sanschagrin for the fire damage based upon a claim that the fire was caused by the defective condition of the wallpaper machine and that its defective condition was due to the negligence of the defendant Hamanne.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Sun Insurance agrees that its policy was in effect on February 12, 1969, but denies that it is required by the terms of the policy to defend the suits brought by Parent and Sanschagrin. The sole issue in the case is whether the policy by its terms provides liability coverage for the rental use of the wallpaper-removing machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The insurance policy in question is in a form called \u201cGeneral Liability-Automobile Policy\u201d. This is a standard form referred to as a jacket, including general definitions, conditions, and other provisions generally found in liability policies. \u201cThe Jacket is then assembled with standard inserts called Coverage Parts to form a complete policy. These inserts provide the specific insurance coverage desired by the insured such as Comprehensive General Liability, Manufacturers\u2019 and Contractors\u2019 Liability and Owners\u2019, Landlords\u2019, and Tenants\u2019 Liability.\u201d Henderson, <em>Insurance Protection for Products Liability and Completed Operations </em>- <em>What Every Lawyer Should Know, </em>50 Neb. L. Rev. 415, 418 (1971) [hereinafter cited a; Henderson].</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The inserts in the jacket here provide Owners\u2019, Landlords\u2019 and Tenants\u2019 Liability insurance for premises of Blanche Hamanne including \u201cStores \u2014 Paints \u2014 Rated as Hardware <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Store \u2014 Retail\u201d. The insurance agreement insert provides coverage for damages the insured may become legally obligated to pay for bodily injury or property damage \u201ccaused by an occurrence and arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the insured premises and all operations necessary or incidental thereto</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Sun Insurance denies that the insurance agreement requires them to defend the suits arising out of the use of the rental machine. They argue that since the insured did not purchase \u201ccompleted operations\u201d or \u201cproducts hazard\u201d coverage, they are not required to defend in an occurrence resulting from use of a rented machine away from the Hamanne store. It is clear that the insured here did not purchase either \u201ccompleted operations\u201d or \u201cproducts hazard\u201d coverage and that if coverage for the accident with the rented machine were sought within either of these provisions there would be no coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">It is well settled that the interpretation of an insurance policy is for this court and that the test in this jurisdiction is what a reasonable person in the position of the insured would understand the policy to mean. <em>McCaffery v. St. Paul Fire Ins. Co., </em>108 N.H. 373, 236 A.2d 490 (1967); <em>Aetna Ins. Co. v. State Motors, </em>109 N.H. 120, 244 A.2d 64 (1968). In any event the policy is to be read \u201cin the light of what more than a casual reading of the policy would reveal to an ordinary intelligent insured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125, 244 A.2d at 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Both <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company v. Pattee, </em>108 N.H. 298, 234 A.2d 537 (1967), and <em>Peerless Insurance Company v. Clough, </em>105 N.H. 76, 193 A.2d 444 (1963), dealt with a completed operation exclusion joined with product hazard in a single provision. However, in 1966, these provisions were revised and the standard policy now contains the completed operations clause and the products hazard clause as separate and distinct coverages. Henderson, <em>supra </em>at 425. Since the rental of the machine contemplated its return and no performance of operations by or on behalf of the named insured, it was neither an operation nor completed within the definition of \u201ccompleted operations hazard\u201d appearing on the jacket of the policy here.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>The products hazard definitions on the jacket read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">\u201c \u2018Products hazard\u2019 includes bodily injury andproperty damage arising out of the named insured\u2019s products or reliance upon or representation or warranty made at any time with respect thereto, but only if the bodily injury or property damage occurs away from the premises owned by or rented to the named insured and after physical possession of such products has been relinquished to others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">\u201c\u2018Named insured\u2019s products\u2019 means goods or products manufactured, sold, handled or distributed by the named insured or by others trading under his name including any container thereof (other than a vehicle), but <em>named insured\u2019s products shall not include </em>a vending machine or <em>any property </em>other than such container, <em>rented to, </em>or located for use of others but not sold.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Sun Insurance argues that the word \u201chandled\u201d as used in this definition includes rented products but this extended interpretation of the word has been rejected and we think correctly so. <em>Smedley Co. v. Employers Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., </em>143 Conn. 510, 123 A.2d 755 (1956); <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Hercules Powder Co., </em>224 F.2d 293 (3d Cir. 1955). In any event the language of the definition specifically excludes rented products.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">\u201cThe 1966 revised standard policies carry forward this exception [rented equipment] by using the language <em>\u2018named insured\u2019s products </em>shall not include a vending machine or any property.. . rented to or located for use of others but not sold.\u2019 Thus, even though the courts have held that persons engaged in the equipment rental or leasing business are subject to products liability actions, the products hazard coverage is not what such a person should purchase for protection. He would be protected under a premises and operations provision and this is what he should buy.\u201d Henderson, <em>supra </em>at 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">The insurance agreement here carries the title \u201cCoverage For Designated Premises And Related Operations In Progress Other Than Structural Alterations, New Construction And Demolition.\u201d The agreement insures against liability for occurrences \u201carising out of the ownership, maintenance or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>use of the insured premises and all operations necessary or incidental thereto . . . A hardware store dealing in paint and wallpaper would commonly rent equipment for the removal of wallpaper and a reasonable person in the position of the insured would assume such rental is incidental to the operation of the store. The only policy coverage available was provided by the insurance purchased here. <em>See Insurance Co. of North America v. Electronic Purification Co., 67 </em>Cal. 2d 679, 433 P.2d 174, 63 Cal. Rptr. 382 (1967); <em>Aetna Ins. Co. v. Loxahatchee Marina, Inc., </em>236 So. 2d 12 (Fla. Ct. App. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">The Sun Insurance Company is required by the terms of its policy to provide liability coverage for the accident of February 12, 1969, involving the rental wallpaper machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b383-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
