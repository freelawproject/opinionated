Manoly, </em>110 N.H. 434, 437, 270 A.2d 611, 613 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">The resolution of this question depends upon the facts. Among others, a circumstance not to be ignored is that Stone is a veteran of many years\u2019 experience in our criminal courts. He has been convicted or pleaded guilty and has been sentenced on numerous occasions for a wide variety of crimes. He has also been repeatedly paroled and, upon breaking his parole, resentenced as a parole violator. RSA 607:47, 48 (Supp. 1972). In the negotiations leading up to his guilty plea, he was represented by capable counsel. Before changing his plea from not guilty to guilty, the defendant signed an \u201cAcknowledgement of Rights\u201d statement, the salient portions of which are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-10\">\u201cI, Harry F. Stone, of Woonsocket, R.I., my attorney being Joseph T. Cristiano, do hereby state The statements made below shall apply to each and every indictment, if there be more than one, to which I intend to plead GUILTY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>I have discussed this present plea of GUILTY to the charge in the indictment with my attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">I know the full meaning of this indictment of which I stand accused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">I understand that I am under no obligation to plead GUILTY and that I am entitled to a trial by jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">I understand that by pleading GUILTY to the indictment I am waiving a trial by jury and the right to confront my accusers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-8\">No force has been used upon me, nor have any threats been made to me, by any member of the Prosecutor\u2019s Office or anyone else in an effort to have me enter this plea of GUILTY to the indictment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-9\">No promises have been made to me by any member of the Prosecutor\u2019s Office or anyone else in an effort to have me enter this plea of GUILTY to the indictment, except as to what may be the Prosecutor\u2019s recommendation as to sentence. However, I understand that the Court is not bound by the Prosecutor\u2019s recommendation as to sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-10\">I understand as a consequence of my plea of GUILTY that the Court may impose such sentence as in his discretion he considers appropriate, subject, however, to those limits prescribed by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-11\">My attorney, with whose services I am satisfied, has advised me of the penalties that the Court can impose for the crime to which I have pleaded guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-12\">In connection with this, the record discloses that the defendant\u2019s lawyer \u201cwent over that Acknowledgement of Rights verbatim with Mr. Stone,\u201d and that the time the defendant might have to serve because of his parole violation was discussed. RSA 607:47, 48 (Supp. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-13\">It is also undisputed that the county attorney faithfully executed his agreement with the defendant\u2019s lawyer to recommend a two to four-year sentence to run concurrently with any sentence imposed for parole violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>In the light of these facts, the situation before us is clearly distinguishable from that in <em>State v. Manoly, </em>110 N.H. 434, 270 A.2d 611 (1970), where the defendant was not informed that the court was not bound to follow the county attorney\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">In short, Stone, fully understanding his rights and the possible consequences of his act, voluntarily chose to plead guilty. Now, because, as his counsel stated, \u201c[H]e is not satisfied\u201d with the court\u2019s sentence, he wishes to withdraw his plea of guilty, reenter a plea of not guilty, and have his case tried by a jury. His motion to withdraw his plea of guilty was properly denied.
