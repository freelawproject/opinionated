The time for filing memoranda on the submitted question by interested parties or any member of the public was May 21, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The primary question submitted is whether a county, in the absence of express statutory authority exempting it from the provisions of a city zoning ordinance, may construct a courthouse on county land in an area where such construction is prohibited by the ordinance. Under the provisions of House bill 711 Cheshire County is authorized to construct a new courthouse \u201cnotwithstanding any present or future zoning ordinances enacted by the city of Keene to the contrary.\u201d A secondary question is whether this statute is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">While there is some conflict among the cases, it is a general rule supported by a majority of jurisdictions and by the commentators that municipal ordinances do not control county construction, particularly where the county is performing an essential function of government, such as the construction of a courthouse. \u201cMunicipal corporations will ordinarily not be able to apply their zoning controls to the counties in which they are located, absent statute clearly authorizing the same. Illustratively, the Wisconsin court has held that a city could not regulate by zoning ordinance the location and construction of a county jail.\u201d 1 Antieau, Municipal Corporation Law \u00a7 7.86, at 490.90 (1968), citing <em>Green County v. Monroe, </em>3 Wis. 2d 196, 87 N.W.2d 827 (1958). The same legal proposition has been stated in 8 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations \u00a7 25.15, at 45 (rev. ed. 1965) as follows: \u201cMunicipal zoning regulations or restrictions usually do not apply to the state or any of its subdivisions or agencies, unless the legislature has clearly manifested a contrary intent. Thus, properties and the uses thereof may be immune or exempt from the operation of municipal zoning regulations where owned or controlled by counties .. ..\u201d To the same effects 2 Yokley, Zoning Law Practice \u00a7 21-5 (3d ed. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">In this State we have no express statute which provides that counties are or are not subject to municipal zoning laws. The fact that the legislature has provided that housing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>authorities are subject to municipal zoning laws is some evidence, although not conclusive, that express legislative authority is required if city zoning ordinances are applicable to other governmental units. <em>See </em>RSA 203:13. In <em>Sherman v. </em>Brentwood, 112 N.H. 122, 123, 290 A.2d 47, 48 (1972), the question was raised but not decided as to whether counties are subject to local zoning ordinances. In that case it was stated that there may be merit in the position that counties were not subject to local zoning ordinances.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b279-6\">Edward J. O\u2019Brien, of Keene, for a negative answer.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b279-3\">The house of representatives is advised that New Hampshire adopts the majority rule that a county is not required to comply with a city zoning ordinance in the erection and construction of a courthouse. Annot., 61 A.L.R.2d 970 (1958); <em>County of Westchester v. Village of Mamaroneck, </em>41 Misc. 2d 811, 246 N.Y.S.2d 770, <em>aff'd, </em>22 App. Biv. 2d 143, 255 N.Y.S.2d 290 (1964), <em>aff'd, </em>16 N.Y.2d 940,212 N.E.2d 442, 264 N.Y.S.2d 925 (1965); <em>see Appelbaum v. St. Louis County, </em>451 S.W.2d 107 (Mo. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">In view of our answer it is unnecessary for the legislature to enact House bill 711, \u201cAn Act relative to the location of the proposed Cheshire county courthouse\u201d, although enactment of this statute might be of assistance to the county in the issuance of any bonds therefor.</p>\n<judges id=\"b279-5\">Frank R.
