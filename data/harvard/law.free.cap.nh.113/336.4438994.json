The policy coverage applied to the workmen\u2019s compensation law of Massachusetts. Skyline obtained a painting contract with Pease Air Force Base in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and Travelers issued a certificate of insurance to Pease Air Force Base on the contract. This certificate applied within Massachusetts and elsewhere but \u201conly for employees subject to the Massachusetts Work-omen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d. Four of the seven men on the Pease job were New Hampshire residents hired in New Hampshire by Skyline for that job through the Portsmouth Painters Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">George P. Seale, one of the New Hampshire employees, injured his knee while working on the Pease job. Travelers denied coverage under the policy. Seale proceeded against Skyline under RSA 281:10 for failing to obtain workmen\u2019s compensation coverage as required by RSA 281:9. After a hearing, the labor commissioner held Skyline to be an employer under RSA 281:2 I that had failed to secure payment of compensation for its employees under RSA 281:9 and awarded compensation to Seale under RSA 281:10.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Skyline filed a petition for declaratory judgment in the superior court to determine whether the accident to Seale was covered by the terms of the Travelers workmen\u2019s compensation policy and the terms of certificate of insurance issued by Travelers to Pease Air Force Base. The Superior Court <em>(Cann, </em>J.) reserved and transferred with an agreed statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>of facts the question \u201cDoes the policy provide coverage for this accident where the claim is filed with the New Hampshire Labor Commission?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The policy and the certificate of insurance both apply coverage only to claims by employees who are subject to the workmen\u2019s compensation law of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Those Massachusetts cases which have held the Massachusetts act applicable to employees injured outside of Massachusetts have done so on the basis that the place of hiring was in Massachusetts: <em>McLaughlin\u2019s Case, </em>274 Mass. 217, 174 N.E. 338 (1931); <em>Armburg v. Boston &amp; Me. R.R., </em>276 Mass. 418, 177 N.E. 655 (1931); <em>Lynch\u2019s Case, </em>281 Mass. 454, 183 N.E. 834 (1933); <em>Migues Case, </em>281 Mass. 373, 183 N.E. 847 (1933); <em>Wright\u2019s Case, </em>291 Mass. 334, 197 N.E. 5 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The question whether or not the Massachusetts act applies to injuries suffered by employees outside the State when the contract for hire was not made in Massachusetts has not been directly decided by the courts of that Commonwealth. However, in <em>Zarski v. Creamer, </em>317 Mass. 744, 59 N.E.2d 704 (1945), involving an action brought in Massachusetts in which the defense raised the fellow servant doctrine, the court said that the Massachusetts workmen\u2019s compensation statute does not apply when the accident occurred in New Hampshire and there was no evidence that the plaintiff was hired in Massachusetts. The statement of the court in <em>Zarski </em>suggests that the Massachusetts court would hold that Seale was not subject to the workmen\u2019s compensation act of that Commonwealth. Consequently, our answer to the question transferred is \u201cNo\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Because we hold that Seale was not subject to the Massachusetts act, we need not decide whether the policy and certificate would provide coverage for that amount of a New Hampshire award which an employee would have been entitled to recover under the Massachusetts act.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b398-10\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
