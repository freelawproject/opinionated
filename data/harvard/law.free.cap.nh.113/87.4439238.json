CONST, pt. II, art. 74 are limited to advice upon important legal questions pending in the body entitled to the advice and awaiting consideration and action in the course of its duty. <em>See Opinions of the Justices, </em>98 N.H. 537, 104 A.2d 208 (1954), and 93 N.H. 474, 37 A.2d 478 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-15\">RSA 9:2, cited in your first question, relates to the budget required to be submitted by the Governor to the legislature at the beginning of each biennial session. While the occasion for action by the Governor and Council with respect to the Governor\u2019s budget is not stated by your resolution, since the budget pertains to the administration of fiscal affairs of the State and the Council is established to advise the Governor in such matters (N.H. CONST, pt. II, art. 60), we assume that the Governor and Council have jointly determined to seek our advice because of mutual doubt as to the questions presented. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>74 N.H. 606, 607, 68 A. 873, 874 (1907); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>101 N.H. 549, 559, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>137 A.2d 726, 733 (1958); <em>see Opinion of the Justices, </em>110 N.H. 117, 122, 262 A.2d 290, 294 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Your first question is whether the Governor may by footnote in his budget \u201cprovide . . . for State funds to be returned to homeowners only and not all property taxpayers.\u201d It is our opinion that the answer to this question is \u201cNo\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The Governor by his budget may propose appropriations, and this is evidently his purpose, since we are advised by memorandum filed on his behalf that his budget will provide for an appropriation of $4,000,000 in each year of the biennium as a \u201cLocal Tax Relief Fund\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">A \u201creturn\u201d of State funds to \u201chomeowners\u201d, as such, would not be a public purpose. However, as pointed out in an opinion returned to a recent session of the legislature: \u201cPublic assistance, afforded in a limited way and without discrimination, to persons eligible therefor by reason of lack of means of their own, is a recognized exercise of the protective power.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>111 N.H. 136, 142, 276 A.2d 821, 824 (1971). <em>See also Opinion of the Justices, </em>112 N.H. 32, 34, 287 A.2d 756, 758 (1972); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>110 N.H. 206, 266 A.2d 111 (1970). Classification to be valid must reasonably promote some proper object of public welfare or interest and may not be sustained when the selection and grouping is so arbitrary as to serve no useful purpose of a public nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Recent opinions have emphasized that taxpayers may not constitutionally be classified as taxable or nontaxable, and that taxes are required to be assessed uniformly, and upon individual and corporate property owners alike <em>(Opinion of the Justices, </em>111 N.H. 206, 208, 209, 278 A.2d 348, 349, 350 (1971)), although reasonable exemptions, for which just reason exists may be provided. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>112 N.H. 32, 34, 287 A.2d 756, 758 (1972); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>110 N.H. 206, 208, 266 A.2d 111, 113 (1970). A rebate out of public funds to some taxpayers but not others would clearly constitute discrimination unless sustainable upon grounds of reasonable classification. No criteria which would be employed to govern the return of public funds to homeowners are disclosed by either your resolution or the proposed budget. <em>Cf Opinion of the Justices, </em>111 N.H. 136, 141-43, 276 A.2d 821, 824 (1971).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b150-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Governor Meldrim Thomson, Jr., by his legal counsel, Charles G. Douglas III, for affirmative answer.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b150-3\">The answer to your second question is \u201cNo, such a classification would not be constitutional.\u201d</p>\n<judges id=\"b150-4\">Frank R.
