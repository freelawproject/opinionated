Ruth Stewart. The will of J. Ruth Stewart left the residue of her estate to Florence M. Coleman, a friend who was unrelated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>to the testatrix. Florence M. Coleman predeceased the testatrix leaving no issue but survived by four nephews and a niece. The heirs at law of the testatrix were two sisters, a brother, and the daughter of a deceased brother. The will contained the following provision: \u201cAnd it be understood that Florence M. Coleman is not to assign any interest she may take in this will to any of my relatives <em>.\u2019\u2019Jones, </em>J., reserved and transferred the following question: \u201cAre the heirs at law of Florence M. Coleman entitled to the residue or are the heirs at law of Julia Ruth Stewart entitled to said residue?\u201d The provision in the will negating any bequest in addition to the one dollar bequeathed each heir at law of the testator does not prevent their taking as heirs at law in the event of intestacy of part of the estate. <em>In re Gibbs Estate, 110 N.H. </em>185, 186, 263 A.2d 667, 668 (1970); <em>Burpee v. Pickard, </em>94 N.H. 307, 52 A.2d 286 (1947); <em>Wells v.

In the present case Florence M. Coleman was not survived by any heirs in the descending line and the residuary bequest to her lapsed. <em>Loveren v. Donaldson, </em>69 N.H. 639, 45 A. 715 (1899); 6 Page, Wills \u00a7 50:13 (Bowe-Parker rev. 1962); Annot., 115 A.L.R. 444, 450 (1938); Annot., 63 A.L.R.2d 1195, 1200 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The residuary legacy having lapsed the answer to the question transferred is that the heirs at law of the testatrix J. Ruth Stewart are entitled to the residue of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b240-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
