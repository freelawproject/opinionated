There was evidence that alternative sites were not available and that appropriate screening would be provided. The defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the action was denied by the Superior Court <em>(Mullavey, </em>J.) subject to defendant\u2019s exception. Following a further hearing, the presiding justice found and ruled that the proposed construction is a governmental function, and in violation of the Manchester zoning ordinance, and transferred to this court without ruling the question \u201cas to whether or not the City is bound by the terms of the ordinance . . . .\u201d To this order the plaintiffs seasonably excepted, and all questions presented by the exceptions of the parties were reserved and transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">In a recent <em>Opinion of the </em>Justices, 113 N.H. 217, 304 A.2d 872 (1973), the justices of this court advised the house of representatives that \u201cNew Hampshire adopts the majority rule that a county is not required to comply with a city zoning ordinance in the erection and construction of a courthouse\u201d a project which is an essential function of government.. The same majority rule supports the view that a city is not bound by its own zoning ordinance in the performance of its governmental functions absent any statutory provision to the contrary. 8 E. McQuillin, Municipal Corporations \u00a7 25.15 (1965 rev. vol.); 2 R. Anderson, American Law of Zoning \u00a7 9.03 (1968); 2 A. Rathkopf, The Law of Zoning and Planning 53-1 to 53-6 (1960). The extent to which any governmental unit shall be immune from zoning requirements is a matter within legislative control; but our enabling act is silent upon the subject. RSA 31:60-89; <em>see </em>Note, <em>Zoning.Immunity, </em>84 Harv. L. Rev. 869, 879-83 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>We recognize, as plaintiffs point out, that the act contains a special provision relating to structures of public utilities. RSA 31:62; <em>see In re Monmouth Consolidated Water Co., </em>47 N.J. 251, 259-60, 220 A.2d 189, 193 (1966). Similarly the Manchester ordinance contains provisions relating to recreational areas and \u201cessential public services\u201d, such as facilities of electric power and telephone companies. Since such uses are commonly privately owned and operated, no purpose to authorize the regulation of governmental activities and uses is reasonably to be implied therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">It is established in this jurisdiction that the control of fires is a governmental function <em>(Reynolds v. Nashua, </em>93 N.H. 28, 35 A.2d 194 (1943); <em>Shea v. Portsmouth, </em>98 N.H. 22, 94 A.2d 902 (1953)), as is the operation and maintenance of public parks and recreational areas. <em>Piasecny v. Manchester, </em>82 N.H. 458, 136 A. 357 (1926); <em>Harkinson v. Manchester, </em>90 N.H. 554, 5 A.2d 721 (1939). Thus the finding and ruling of the trial court that the construction proposed by the city in this case is a governmental function is supported by the law and the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">In these circumstances, the conclusion follows that the city is not bound to comply with the zoning ordinance, but may construct the building in furtherance of its governmental functions without regard thereto. <em>Nehrbas v. Lloyd Harbor, </em>2 N.Y.2d 1, 90, 140 N.E.2d 241, 159 N.Y.S.2d 145, 61 A.L.R.2d 965, 970 (1951). <em>See also Stiger v. Village of Hewlett, </em>283 App. Div. 827, 129 N.Y.S.2d 38 (1954); <em>Kedroff v. Springfield, </em>127 Vt. 624, 256 A.2d 457 (1969); Annot., 61 A.L.R.2d 970 (1968). We hold that in the construction and use of the proposed building, the city is not bound by the terms of its zoning ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled; remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b417-8\">Kenison, C.
