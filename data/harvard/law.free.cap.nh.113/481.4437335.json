The case reaches us upon an agreed statement of facts which discloses that the plaintiff was arrested and charged with driving a motor vehicle at Derry on February 19, 1971, while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The parties disagree as to whether the arresting officer informed the plaintiff of the implied consent law (RSA 262-A:69-e as amended by Laws 1969, 119:3) but it is agreed that the officer \u201cfiled the appropriate sworn statement report with the Director\u201d as required by section 69-e and that the director thereupon notified the plaintiff that his license was revoked for 90 days, and that he was entitled to a hearing before the director if requested within 30 days. RSA 262-A:69-f. The plaintiff requested an immediate hearing, but after this action was brought, the parties agreed that further administrative proceedings would be stayed pending disposition of the transferred case.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">The Superior Court <em>(Loughlin, </em>J.) issued a temporary injunction, and transferred to this court without ruling, the question of whether the court \u201chas jurisdiction or should exercise jurisdiction\u201d to enjoin suspension of the plaintiff\u2019s license \u201cpending administrative and judicial review of said revocation under RSA 262-A:69-f and 69-g respectively.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AVo\">The jurisdiction of the superior court in the matter appears not to be in issue, but the propriety and constitutionality of revocation without prior notice and hearing is vigorously questioned by the plaintiff. He calls attention to. the statement in <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>102 N.H. 183, 186, 152 A.2d 870, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>872 (1959), that a license to operate a motor vehicle \u201cmay be more than a privilege\u201d, and relies extensively upon <em>Wall v. King, </em>206 F.2d 878 (1st Cir. 1953), for the proposition that a license is a fundamental liberty within the meaning of the fourteenth amendment. Finally he urges that recent decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States establish the right to notice and hearing as a requirement of due process of law before essential rights may be curtailed. <em>Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 25 L. Ed. 2d 287, 90 S. Ct. 1011 (1970); <em>Wheeler v. Montgomery, </em>397 U.S. 280, 25 L. Ed. 2d 307, 90 S. Ct. 1026 (1970). <em>See also Sniadach v. Family Fin. Carp. </em>395 U.S. 337, 23 L. Ed. 2d 349, 89 S. Ct. 1820 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">More closely allied to the case before us is <em>Bell v. Burson, </em>402 U.S. 535, 29 L. Ed. 2d 90, 91 S. Ct. 1586 (1971), in which the Court pointed out that suspension of operators\u2019 licenses \u201cadjudicates important interest\u201d, and calls for \u201cthat procedural due process required by the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 539, 29 L. Ed. 2d at 94, 91 S. Ct. at 1589. In holding that a license could not be suspended without prior hearing solely because of involvement in a motor vehicle accident, the Court recognized that prior hearing may be dispensed with \u201cin emergency situations\u201d, citing <em>Fahey v. Maltones, </em>332 U.S. 245, 91 L. Ed. 2030, 67 S. Ct. 1552 (1947), and <em>Ewing v. Mytinger &amp; Casselberry, </em>339 U.S. 594, 94 L. Ed. 1088, 70 S. Ct. 870 (1950). <em>Bell v. Burson, supra </em>at 542 <em>8c </em>n.5, 29 L. Ed. 2d at 96 <em>8c </em>n.5, 91 S. Ct. at 1591 &amp; n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Again in <em>Fuentes v. Shevin, </em>407 U.S. 67, 90, 32 L. Ed. 2d 556, 575, 92 S. Ct. 1983, 1999 (1972), the opinion of the Court recognized that there are \u2018\u201cextraordinary situations\u2019 that justify postponing notice and an opportunity for a hearing\u201d and elaborated upon the requirements of these situations as being first, necessity \u201cto secure an important governmental interest or general public interest\u201d, second, the existence of a \u201cspecial need for very prompt action\u201d and third, that \u201cthe person initiating the seizure has been a government official responsible for determining under the standards of a narrowly drawn statute, that it was necessary and justified in the particular instance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90-91, 32 L. Ed. 2d at 575-76, 92 S. Ct. at 1999-2000. The Court again cited the <em>Fahey </em>and <em>Ewing </em>cases, adding <em>North American Storage Co. v. Chicago, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>211 U.S. 306, 53 L. Ed. 195, 29 S. Ct. 101 (1908). <em>Fuentes, </em>407 U.S. at 92 nn.26-28, 32 L. Ed. 2d at 576-77 nn.26-28, 92 S. Ct. at 2000 nn.26-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">We consider that the case before us answers the requirements justifying brief postponement of hearing until after revocation of the plaintiff\u2019s license. The statute requires sworn evidence, in the form of a report by the arresting officer, for the consideration of a neutral State official in the person of the defendant director, before revocation shall be ordered. It also provides for immediate notice that a hearing may be had within 10 days of a request therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The plaintiff suggests that the director is \u201ccompelled\u201d under the statute to revoke a license upon receipt of the officer\u2019s report. On the contrary, the requirement that the sworn report contain the \u201cfacts upon which the reasonable grounds to believe [that the arrested person had been driving while under the influence] are based\u201d, and the fact that the accused refused to submit to a test in the face of information that refusal would result in revocation, implies that the defendant has the duty to make a preliminary determination whether revocation is \u201cnecessary and justified in the particular instance.\u201d <em>Fuentes, </em>407 U.S. at 91, 32 L. Ed. 2d at 576, 92 S. Ct. at 2000; <em>see Application of Grimshaw, </em>165 N.Y.S.2d 263 (Sup. Ct. 1957); <em>Lashway v. Hults, </em>234 N.Y.S.2d 47 (Sup. Ct. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">That the operation of motor vehicles by persons under the influence of intoxicating liquor calls for \u201cvery prompt action\u201d, to \u201csecure an important general public interest\u201d needs no elaboration. <em>See State v. Gallagher, </em>102 N.H. 335, 338, 156 A.2d 765, 768 (1959); <em>State v. Gallant, </em>108 N.H. 72, 76, 227 A.2d 597, 599 (1967); <em>State v. Severance, </em>108 N.H. 404, 237 A.2d 683 (1968); Annot., 88 A.L.R.2d 1064 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">We do not agree with plaintiff\u2019s suggestion that no public interest will be furthered because the person whose license is revoked may nevertheless continue to drive without a license. <em>See </em>RSA 262:27-b (Supp. 1972), <em>as amended, </em>Laws 1973, ch. 248; Comment, 70 W. Va. L. Rev. 408-09 (1968); Comment, 51 Mich. L. Rev. 1195, 1197 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">We conclude that the statute is constitutional, and that the director should not be enjoined from revoking the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>tiff\u2019s license pending administrative hearing and judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">\n<em>Remanded; certificate to issue October 10, 1973;</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\n<em>administrative hearing to be held within ten days thereafter.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b545-6\">Grimes, J., dissented; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b545-7\">Grimes, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Avu\">dissenting: In my view a contrary result is dictated by the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States cited in the court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
