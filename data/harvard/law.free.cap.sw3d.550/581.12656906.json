Graves appeals from the trial court's judgment denying his motion to modify the child custody provisions of a dissolution judgment so as to give him sole legal and physical custody of his son. Graves argues that the trial court erred in concluding that there was no substantial change of circumstances to warrant a change of custody. Finding no error, we affirm. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
