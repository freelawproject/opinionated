State\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6777509\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/495/773/#p774\">\n    495 S.W.3d 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 774 (Mo. App. S.D. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Schwertz's trial theory was that he shot Victim accidentally, after they had been arguing about an engagement ring Victim refused to return to Schwertz when she broke off the engagement. When Victim refused to give back the ring, Schwertz became \"aggravated.\" Schwertz then made \"the worst decision I've ever made in my entire life[,]\" and retrieved a silver Bryco Jennings Model 9 semi-automatic pistol in order to scare Victim into giving back the ring. When Victim still refused to return the ring, Schwertz loaded a round into the chamber. Victim then told him to put the gun down, they would talk, and she would give him the ring. Schwertz put the gun down on a countertop, but when Victim lunged for the gun, he \"grabbed the gun\" and \"the gun went off.\" Schwertz admitted his finger was on the trigger, but denied it was his intention to shoot Victim, and that it was an accident. Schwertz then called his father, telling him he had shot Victim, and asking him to call 911. Schwertz also told law enforcement that he had shot Victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Schwertz stated that after Victim was shot, the gun jammed. He tilted the gun sideways, shook the slide, and two cartridges fell out. He did it again, and two more cartridges fell out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defense called Kathleen Green (\"Green\"), a 23-year firearms examiner for the Missouri State Highway Patrol Crime Lab, who testified that she examined\n   Schwertz's gun and it \"malfunctioned\" in that \"it did not chamber the cartridges consistently like it should[,]\" and did not \"eject the expended cartridge cases like it consistently should after each shot.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The jury found Schwertz guilty of first-degree murder and armed criminal action, and the trial court sentenced Schwertz to concurrent terms of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, and forty years' imprisonment, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This Court affirmed Schwertz's convictions and sentences on direct appeal in a written statement.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State v. Schwertz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , SD32902. Mandate issued on December 24, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Schwertz timely filed his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   Rule 29.15 motion on March 17, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 7, 2015, post-conviction counsel timely filed an amended motion. The amended motion alleged that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to \"investigate, research, present evidence and argue that the weapon involved in this case is known to be defective in numerous ways including discharging without having the trigger pulled.\" Schwertz asserted that \"[e]vidence demonstrating numerous examples of accidental discharges of this make and model of weapon would have supported [Schwertz]'s theory of accident in this case and there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different.\" In support, Schwertz cited two articles published in\n   <em>\n    The Association of Firearm and Tool Mark Examiners Journal\n   </em>\n   (\"AFTE Journal\"), which he asserted showed that the model of Schwertz's gun was \"prone to accidental discharge under various conditions.\" Schwertz also asserted that the manufacturer of the gun was forced into bankruptcy following a product liability suit. Schwertz concluded that such evidence could have been presented through Green, the firearms examiner who testified at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 28, 2016, the motion court held an evidentiary hearing on the amended motion, at which Green, trial counsel, Schwertz's parents, and Schwertz testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Green testified she test-fired Schwertz's gun three times. The gun never fired without a trigger pull during the two years it was in the evidence locker at the Missouri Highway Patrol Crime Lab. Her analysis determined that the trigger pull of Schwertz's gun was eight and a half to nine pounds, which was normal for that gun and not considered a \"hair trigger.\" A \"hair trigger\" usually indicated a trigger pull of a pound or less. Green found no reason to conduct accidental discharge testing on the gun. Green had examined the same make and model of Schwertz's gun many times before, and denied ever seeing one fire without its trigger being pulled. Green denied that the make and model of Schwertz's gun was known to discharge without having its trigger pulled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Green also testified she was a member of The Association of Firearm and Toolmark Examiners, and had received copies of the AFTE Journal since beginning her employment at the crime lab. Green stated the AFTE Journal was \"the journal for experts in my field[,]\" and that experts in her field reasonably relied on the journal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Green testified that the first article cited by Schwertz, published in the summer 1999, concerned a different model than Schwertz's gun. While that article described a failure of the gun's magazine safety, the gun at issue still required a trigger pull in order to fire. The second article relied on by Schwertz, published in the spring 2001, was in regard to the same make and model as Schwertz's gun, but that article described a worn or damaged sear in two guns that caused them to function as fully automatic weapons upon a trigger pull. This defect was specific to these two particular guns, rather than a problem widely associated with the model, and that damage to the sear is often the result of having been filed down or other purposeful damage caused by the owner. Schwertz's gun was not similarly damaged, based on the fact that Green had loaded the gun with three cartridges while test-firing and \"at no time did it go full auto.\" The lawsuit that bankrupted the manufacturer of Schwertz's gun concerned an accidental discharge of a different model than Schwertz's gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Trial counsel testified Schwertz told him that the shooting was an accident; Schwertz had no doubt that his finger was on the trigger, but that he accidentally shot Victim; and that Schwertz's testimony at trial was generally consistent with what he had told trial counsel. Trial counsel never investigated whether Schwertz's gun was prone to firing without its trigger being pulled because that was \"never [Schwertz]'s story[;]\" Green's report did not provide him with any basis to believe Schwertz's gun was prone to accidental discharge, but rather the gun's trigger pressure was within the normal range; and Schwertz never asked him to investigate the history of the model of Schwertz's gun. Trial counsel also had concerns about the relevance of evidence concerning issues with guns other than Schwertz's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Schwertz testified he told trial counsel at their first meeting to investigate potential issues with his model of gun being prone to accidental discharge because it \"just went off.\" Schwertz admitted he did not have any specific information regarding potential accidental discharge issues with his gun until after the conclusion of his direct appeal. Schwertz never disputed the possibility that the gun had fired due to his finger having been on the trigger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On September 20, 2016, the motion court denied Schwertz's post-conviction motion. The motion court noted that: (1) \"[t]rial counsel cannot be ineffective for failing to raise a meritless issue[ ]\"; (2) Green's testimony was credible in that the model of Schwertz's gun was \"\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   \" known in the firearms community to fire without the trigger being pulled; (3) the journal articles cited by Schwertz did not support his claim as they involved different models than Schwertz's gun, involved guns that still required the triggers to be pulled in order to fire, or concerned issues with \"specific guns\" rather than a general model defect; (4) evidence regarding a general defect of the model of Schwertz's gun would have been irrelevant because no evidence showed that Schwertz's gun actually suffered from such a defect; and (5) trial counsel's testimony was credible in that he had no basis to investigate the possibility that Schwertz's gun was prone to accidental discharge, either as the result of Green's report or at Schwertz's direction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In contrast, the motion court found Schwertz's testimony was not credible because he had told \"witnesses, trial counsel, and the jury that he did pull the trigger and shoot the victim.\" The motion court concluded that Schwertz failed to prove that a witness existed at the time of trial who would have testified in accordance with Schwertz's claim, or that such testimony\n   would have been beneficial to his defense. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In one point, Schwertz asserts the motion court erred in denying his Rule 29.15 motion because Schwertz established that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to investigate, research, present evidence and argue that the gun involved was a model known to be defective and to accidentally discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Appellate review under Rule 29.15 is limited to a determination of whether the findings and conclusions of the motion court are clearly erroneous.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Williams v.

App. W.D. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Trial counsel's theory of the case was that Schwertz had pulled the trigger of the gun by accident, without meaning to shoot Victim. Trial counsel's credited testimony at the post-conviction hearing was that he did not investigate whether the gun had a \"hair trigger\" or could fire without the trigger being pulled, because this was \"never [Schwertz]'s story[.]\" Rather, Schwertz had told trial counsel that he had gotten the gun out to scare Victim into giving his engagement ring back, that he and Victim reached for the gun at the same time, and that he shot Victim when he \"pulled the trigger by accident[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The credited testimony at the motion hearing demonstrates that the issue of \"the gun going off by itself or having [a] hair trigger,\" never came up in trial counsel's investigation of the case or discussions with Schwertz. Schwertz never told trial counsel that he did not pull the trigger. In fact, Schwertz called his father after the shooting and said he had shot Victim; he also told police he had shot Victim; and he testified at trial that \"there was no doubt he had shot [Victim,]\" and that his finger had been on the trigger. The motion court found trial counsel's testimony credible, noting that Schwertz had told \"witnesses, trial counsel, and the jury that he did pull the trigger and shoot the victim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Trial counsel put Green on the stand to corroborate Schwertz's story that he had problems with the gun after Victim was shot. When Green tested Schwertz's gun, it \"malfunctioned\" in that \"it did not chamber the cartridges consistently like it should[,]\" and did not \"eject the expended cartridge cases like it consistently should after each shot.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Trial counsel did not investigate whether the gun had a \"hair trigger\" or went off without the trigger being pulled because nothing in Schwertz's version of events or Green's report indicated that this would be helpful. Trial counsel's strategic decision to pursue an investigation and defense based on Schwertz accidentally pulling the trigger, as opposed to the gun having a defective \"hair trigger\" or firing spontaneously, was not unreasonable, and was not ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Tisius\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12381876\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/519/413/#p425\">\n    519 S.W.3d at 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Further, as the motion court correctly indicated, Schwertz failed to demonstrate that the investigation of such a defense would have been helpful:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   22. Kathleen Green testified that the Bryco Jennings Model Nine is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   known in the firearms community to fire without the trigger being pulled. She testified that she had seen and tested many Bryco Jennings Model Nine handguns in her lab and had\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   seen one fire without the trigger having been pulled. She testified that most of the time the Model Nines function without complication, but on occasion they fail to properly\n   <em>\n    chamber\n   </em>\n   rounds. This Court found her testimony credible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   23. The articles to which [Schwertz] cites for the proposition that Model Nines are known to discharge without the trigger being, pulled, the AFTE Journals for Summer 1999 and Spring 2001, do not support his claim. The Summer 1999 article regards a Model 59, a different weapon than the one used in this case. That article was about a malfunction on the magazine safety and the trigger would still need to be pulled to make the gun fire. While the Spring 2001 article is about the Model Nine, it discusses two specific guns with a combination of a worn sear and another problem. Even in the case of the two specific guns discussed, the trigger would still need to be pulled to make the gun fire. The 2003 product liability suit to which [Schwertz] refers is also irrelevant, as\n   the gun at issue in that case was a Model 38.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   24. Even if the Model Nine was known to be defective and even if that defect caused the weapon to discharge without the trigger being pulled, evidence of such a defect would\n   <em>\n    still\n   </em>\n   be irrelevant to this case, as the murder weapon was seized and tested. This gun never, in the two years it was in possession of the lab, fired without the trigger being pulled and, in fact, struggled to chamber rounds and eject casings. Kathleen Green found the trigger pull on the murder weapon to be 8.5 to 9 pounds, which is within the normal range for the weapon and by no means qualified as a 'hair trigger.'
