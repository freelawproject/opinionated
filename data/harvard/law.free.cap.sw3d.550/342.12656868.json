Appellants Peter Schmitz, Sean Pollock, Larry LaDuke, and Becky LaDuke (collectively, Appellants) filed motions for rehearing and for en banc reconsideration. Appellee Denton County Cowboy Church (the Church) also filed a motion for rehearing. After requesting responses to the rehearing motions, we now grant Appellants' motion for rehearing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   grant the Church's motion for rehearing, withdraw our August 31, 2017 opinion and judgment, and issue the following memorandum opinion on rehearing without rebriefing or further argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. R. App. P. 49.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In this appeal we are asked whether the trial court abused its discretion by denying Appellants' request for a temporary injunction or erred by granting the pleas to the jurisdiction filed by the Church and appellee The Town of Ponder, Texas (the Town) in the context of Appellants' suit for a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, civil-rights violations, and nuisance injuries arising from the Town's facilitation of and the Church's activities at its current and future rodeo arenas. Other than Appellants' declaratory- and injunctive-relief claims directed to the Town's alleged violations of the Texas Open Meetings Act (TOMA), Appellants failed to raise a clear and unequivocal waiver of the Town's governmental immunity. The Church established that Appellants did not have standing\n   to enforce the Town's zoning scheme through declaration or injunction; however, Schmitz demonstrated his standing to seek redress from the Church for his private-nuisance injuries. Finally, Appellants failed to establish on appeal that the trial court clearly abused its discretion by denying their request for a temporary injunction. Therefore, we affirm in part and reverse in part the trial court's orders and remand limited portions of this case to the trial court for further, consistent proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. SPECIAL-USE PERMIT AND ZONING CHANGE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2008, the Church bought a seven-acre tract of land (the original tract) located in the Town, which is incorporated as a Type-A, general-law municipality.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%205.001\">\n    Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. \u00a7 5.001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (West 2008). At that time, the original tract was zoned as SF-2-\"Single-Family Residential District-2\"-which \"provides for a minimum residential building site of 8,000 square feet and a minimum living area of 1,200 square feet.\" Ponder, Tex., Code of Ordinances tit. XV, chap. 154, \u00a7 154.03 (2017). This equates to approximately four to five single-family homes per acre.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Church began conducting weekly \"rodeo events\" in an outdoor rodeo arena that the Church built on the original tract in 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 31, 2014, the Church bought an SF-2, 12-acre tract (the new tract) that adjoined the original tract and was directly north of Appellants' homes, which are similarly located in an area zoned for low-density residences. In 2015, the Church began constructing on the new tract \"a 350-foot x 175-foot arena,\" which would be a building consisting of \"over 61,000 square feet.\" After starting construction, the Church applied for a commercial-building permit, which the Town issued on July 13, 2015. The permit allowed the Church to construct an \"OPEN ARENA ON 3 SIDES. FULL CON[C]ESSION-REST ROOM AREA.\" On July 21, 2015, Appellants by letter requested that the Town revoke the commercial-building permit and that the Town notify the Church to stop construction on the new tract. On August 5, 2015, the Church filed an application for a specific-use permit for a multi-use event center on the new tract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Town sent a public-hearing notice to all property owners within 200 feet of the new tract and informed the property owners that the Town's council, acting as its planning and zoning commission,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   would conduct a public hearing on August 24, 2015, to \"consider recommendations regarding a specific use permit request\" by the Church to build a \"Multi Use Event Center\" on the new tract:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The Event Center would be used to house among other things, youth ministry, fellowship, and sermons as well as cowboy related rodeo type events, which currently occur and have been occurring for the past several years on [the original tract] in the outdoors, uncovered and uncontained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The Event Center would be fully enclosed on the South end to shield the adjacent residential neighborhood from nuisances such as bright lights, loud\n   speakers and dust. The West side will have a 4ft bottom \"skirt\" and open the remaining 10ft. The East side will also have a 4ft bottom \"skirt\", and additionally will contain a full concession, lounge, and restroom facility. The North end will be fully enclosed to help shield against the elements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   All of the event lighting would be contained within the Event Center, whereas currently in the open air arena that is being used, the lighting spills out into the neighboring community.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The sounds emanating from the speakers can be turned down inside the Event Center and will be muted and more contained, whereas now in the open air arena that is being used, the sounds spill out into the neighboring community.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The Event Center would contain much more of the dust and dirt kicked up at events, whereas currently in the open air arena being used, the dust is stirred up and carried far and wide, including into the neighboring community.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Town also notified the property owners that the hearing was for the additional purpose of deciding the Town's recommendation and request for a \"zoning change [of the new tract] to AG (Agricultural).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ponder, Tex., Code of Ordinances tit. XV, ch. 154, \u00a7 154.58(C)(2) (2017). In the zoning-change notice, the Town recognized that the \"surrounding properties to the North, and West [of the new tract] are currently zoned AG\" and that the change to the new tract \"would be in keeping with rural location and allow for agricultural uses of the property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Town then posted a notice that the council would immediately convene in special session after meeting as the commission on August 24, 2015. On its posted agenda, the council stated that it would consider and act on the Church's application for a specific-use permit and that \"[t]he event center is considered to be part of the church and should be allowed under the Federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act\" (RLUIPA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At the noticed meeting, Appellants' attorney and seven adjacent homeowners-including Schmitz, Larry LaDuke, and Pollock-spoke against the zoning change. A Church representative urged the commission to recommend approval of the zoning change to Agricultural. The recommendation to rezone the new tract failed after a two-to-two vote with one abstention.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The commission then considered the Church's specific-use permit request. Three citizens spoke against the permit, and the Church's representative addressed some of their concerns. The commission then recommended, by a three-to-one vote with one abstention, \"to allow for a specific use permit\" for the new tract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At the conclusion of the commission's meeting, the Town's council opened its meeting and considered the zoning change to the new tract and the Church's request for a specific-use permit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two residents\n   again spoke against the zoning request, and the Church's representative stated that the Church would attempt to address the surrounding neighbors' concerns with the proposed arena on the new tract. The five-member council then unanimously voted to adjourn into \"executive session\" to \"Consult[ ] with Attorney,\" citing section 551.071 of the government code-part of TOMA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20551.071\">\n    Tex. Gov't Code Ann. \u00a7 551.071\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (West 2017). When the council reconvened on the issue, Appellants' attorney spoke against the zoning change and the Church's representative again urged its approval. Schmitz pointed out to the council that of the notified residents who responded in writing to the notices of the proposed zoning change and specific-use permit, one was unopposed and eight were opposed to their approval. By a three-to-one vote with one abstention, the council approved \"the zoning change from SF-2 to AG\" for the new tract. The council then voted to approve, by the same vote margin, the requested special-use permit for the Church to build a multi-use event center on the new tract with the following provision: \"That the arena be constructed according to the approved plans, designed to mitigate nuisance caused by noise, dust and lighting and that all activities conducted thereon adhere to all existing codes of ordinances.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On September 14, 2015, Appellants filed a protest with the Town, arguing that the special-use permit should be revoked because it was issued in violation of the Town's ordinances. The Church sought a new commercial-building permit for the proposed arena on the new tract, which the Town issued on October 5, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. LITIGATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Before the Town held its August 24, 2015 meeting on the Church's permit request and zoning change, Appellants filed suit against the Church and the Town. In their petition,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellants requested declarations under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (the UDJA) that the Church's construction of the arena on the new tract violated the Town's ordinances in several respects and that the Town violated its own ordinances and TOMA by allowing the construction, rendering the Town's actions void. Appellants also raised a claim under \u00a7 1983 arguing that the Town's zoning change from SF-2 to AG was impermissible spot zoning. Finally, Appellants raised a claim against the Church and the Town seeking legal relief for their private-nuisance injuries and requested a temporary and permanent injunction of construction of the proposed arena on the new tract and of the operation of the open-air arena on the original tract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Town filed a plea to the jurisdiction and asserted that the trial court did not have subject-matter jurisdiction over Appellants' claims because it was entitled to governmental immunity. The Church also filed a plea to the jurisdiction arguing that Appellants lacked standing to seek enforcement of the Town's ordinances\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that Appellants' nuisance injuries were not ripe, were speculative, and were time-barred to the extent they were based on the original tract's open-air arena.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The trial court held an evidentiary hearing on Appellant's temporary-injunction request and on the pleas to the jurisdiction. The trial court denied Appellants' request for a temporary injunction and granted the pleas, dismissing Appellants' claims against the Town and the Church.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   After Appellants timely requested findings of fact and conclusions of law and notified the trial court that they were past due, the trial court entered findings and concluded that Appellants did not have standing to enforce the Town's zoning ordinances and that their nuisance claims were not ripe.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. R. Civ. P. 296 - 97. It further concluded that a decision in favor of Appellants would constitute a substantial burden on the Church's religious exercise, violating RLUIPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000cc (West 2012). The trial court also denied Appellants' motion for new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Appellants now appeal and argue that the trial court erred by concluding it did not have subject-matter jurisdiction over their request for a declaratory judgment, their \u00a7 1983 claim, their claim asserting nuisance injuries, and their request for injunctive relief. They also contend that the trial court abused its discretion by denying their request for a temporary injunction pending trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

STANDARD AND SCOPE OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A plea to the jurisdiction is a dilatory plea that is unconcerned with the merits of the asserted claims and that challenges the trial court's power to adjudicate a case.\n   <em>\n    Mission Consol.

In their allegations of nuisance, Appellants contended that the Church knew or should have known that constructing an event center on the new tract so close to their homes \"will adversely affect the fair market value of [Appellants'] properties and interfere with their quiet use and enjoyment of same\" arising from the \"offensive odors, noise from rodeo arena events and patrons, and lights from rodeo arena events and patrons.\" Similarly, the factual allegations supporting their injunction claim, which were incorporated into their nuisance-injury claim, stated that the arena on the new tract would result in harm-\"damages from biological hazards from animal waste, loss of sleep from light and noise thereby disrupting [Appellants'] job performance, intrusion from dirt and dust from rodeo events and gravel roads, and intrusions on [Appellants'] seclusion.\" They also alleged that the open-air arena on the original tract constituted a nuisance because it\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   creates an extreme annoyance, sometimes preventing Plaintiffs from spending time in their backyards; the bright stadium lights that can be seen from Plaintiffs' homes; the arena operates well into the night past reasonable hours; following the completion of rodeo events, large trucks make noise and haul the animals off; the announcement system creates undue noise to Plaintiffs and those similarly situated; and the rodeo events held by Defendant Church create\n   substantial interference with Plaintiffs' use and enjoyment of their property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Finally, they alleged that the construction of the arena on the new tract produced excessive noise and light.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Although we take Appellants' pleaded facts as true, we are not limited to the pleadings to determine the jurisdictional issues raised.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bland ISD\n   </em>\n   , 34 S.W.3d at 554-55. Here, the Church challenged in their plea the sufficiency of Appellants' allegations to assert standing and the existence of jurisdictional facts to support those allegations. At the trial court's hearing on the Town's and the Church's pleas, only Schmitz produced evidence of a particularized, imminent injury. He testified that when he bought his property in 2001, the lot adjacent to and north of his backyard was empty and was zoned SF-2 as was his lot. Schmitz admitted that the arena on the new tract had not yet been completed, no event had been held there, and there were no lights, speakers, or animals. But lights from the open-air arena on the original tract shone into his backyard. Schmitz relied on the current effects from the open-air arena in asserting a nuisance arising from the arena on the new tract. The edge of the new arena is forty steps from his backyard and dominates the view even over his six-foot fence. The Church's pastor testified that the Church intended to use the new arena in the same manner as it has used the open-air arena-day and night events on most days during the spring and summer. However, the doors on the new arena's south side-the side facing Schmitz's backyard-would remain closed during events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Schmitz sufficiently pleaded and proved his particularized injury such that he established his standing to assert a nuisance injury arising from the Church's activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Canyon v. McBroom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9299200\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/121/410/#p414\">\n    121 S.W.3d 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 414-15 (Tex. App.-Amarillo 2003, no pet.). And although the arena on the new tract was not completed at the time of the hearing, the Church admitted that it would use that arena in the same manner as it had used the open-air arena, which use Schmitz asserted created a nuisance on his property. This sufficiently established that his particularized injury regarding the arena on the new tract was imminent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Freedman v. Briarcroft Prop.

Although we take as true the facts the LaDukes and Pollock pleaded to demonstrate their standing, the Church challenged the lack of jurisdictional facts to support those allegations.

Summary Regarding the Church\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In their claims for declaratory and injunctive relief against the Church, Appellants did not challenge the validity of the ordinances themselves. They solely sought enforcement as against the Church, which they do not have standing to do. Regarding Appellants' nuisance-injury claim, Schmitz sufficiently established that his particularized injury occasioned by the Church's actions was imminent; thus, the trial court erred by granting the Church's plea that argued Schmitz did not have standing to assert a nuisance injury. But because the LaDukes and Pollock did not raise a fact issue regarding their standing and do not assert that they did so, the trial court did not err by granting the Church's plea as to those nuisance-injury claimants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    III. TEMPORARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Finally, Appellants argue that the trial court erred by denying their request for a temporary injunction against the Town and the Church. To obtain a temporary injunction, Appellants were required to plead and prove (1) a viable cause of action; (2) a probable right to the relief sought; and (3) a probable, imminent, and irreparable injury will occur prior to the final judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Butnaru v.

Appellants assert on appeal that they \"clearly demonstrated\" a cause of action against the Church, their probable right to relief, and the required injury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   Appellants showed that the new rodeo arena construction is located within 80 feet of Appellants' properties, that the arena covers over 61,000 square feet, and that new gravel roads between the rodeo arena and Appellants' properties will be used to transport livestock to rodeo events. Additionally, the Church currently operates rodeos on their existing open-air arena over 1,000 feet from Appellants' homes that produce excessive noise, dust, light, and odor. Further, the new arena will be used to host rodeo events about five nights per week.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Appellants include no record references to support these factual assertions and do not present cogent argument explaining how the trial court's denial exceeded the bounds of reasonable discretion as an unreasonable or arbitrary determination.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tex.

Indeed, the Church produced evidence that it had never received a complaint about noise, light, or odor arising from the open-air arena\n   and had addressed neighbor complaints arising from the construction of the arena on the new tract. The Church cogently argued to the trial court at the hearing why Appellants had not met their burden to plead and prove their entitlement to a temporary injunction. On this record, we cannot conclude that the trial court clearly abused its discretion by denying Appellants a temporary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Appellants failed to plead and prove a clear and unambiguous waiver of the Town's immunity regarding their claim under \u00a7 1983 and regarding the majority of their requests for declarations under the UDJA and for permanent-injunctive relief; thus, the trial court did not err by granting the Town's plea to the jurisdiction regarding these claims. But the Town does not enjoy governmental immunity from Appellants' claims for declaratory and permanent-injunctive relief that rely on the Town's alleged violations of TOMA; thus, the trial court erred by granting the Town's plea to the jurisdiction directed to Appellants' TOMA-based, UDJA and permanent-injunction claims as we previously specified. Similarly, the trial court erred by granting the Church's plea to the jurisdiction regarding Schmitz's nuisance-injury claim because he established his standing to assert such a claim. But the trial court did not err by dismissing Appellants' UDJA and permanent-injunction claims or the LaDukes' and Pollock's nuisance-injury claim brought against the Church based on their lack of standing. Finally, Appellants have failed to show that the trial court clearly abused its discretion by denying their request for a temporary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   We grant in part and overrule in part Appellants' first issue, deny Appellants' second issue, grant in part and overrule in part Appellants' third issue, deny Appellants' fourth issue, and deny Appellants' fifth issue.
