Hartshorn's civil commitment under the sexually violent predator (SVP) statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7\u00a7 841.001 -.153. In three issues, the TCCO contends that the Montgomery County district court that committed Hartshorn did not lose jurisdiction over his cause and that the order transferring his cause from the 345th District Court of Travis County to the 331st District Court of Travis County is void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We will reverse the district court's amended order denying the plea to the jurisdiction, render judgment granting the plea, and dismiss Hartshorn's petitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 1999, the Legislature established a civil-commitment procedure providing long-term supervision and treatment for sexually violent predators with behavioral abnormalities that are not amenable to traditional mental-health treatment and that increase their likelihood of recidivism.\n   <em>\n    Stevenson v.

The SVP statute in chapter 841 of the Health &amp; Safety Code is divided into subchapters that generally provide a chronological framework for the civil-commitment process, from the initial assessment of whether a person is a sexually violent predator through trial, civil commitment, any modifications to the person's housing or supervision during civil commitment, biennial review of the person's commitment, and any petitions by the committed person for release.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7\u00a7 841.001 -.153. The SVP statute allows a person who has\n   been civilly committed as a sexually violent predator to file a petition for release, with or without authorization from the TCCO, which coordinates the committed person's treatment and supervision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20Tex.%20Gen.%20Laws%204122\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 841.081, .121-.122. The person may also file a petition for transfer to less restrictive housing and supervision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20Tex.%20Gen.%20Laws%204122\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 841.0834(b). The issue in this case is whether amendments to the SVP statute in 2015 stripped the committing court of jurisdiction over Hartshorn's petition for release and petition for less restrictive housing and supervision. We conclude they did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2010, Hartshorn was civilly committed as a sexually violent predator in an order signed by the 435th District Court of Montgomery County, which was affirmed on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Commitment of Hartshorn\n   </em>\n   , No. 09-10-00382-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%206229545\">\n    2011 WL 6229545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2, *4, 2011 Tex. App. LEXIS 9802, at *5, *10 (Tex. App.-Beaumont Dec. 15, 2011, pet. denied) (mem. op.) (noting that in four-year time span Hartshorn was convicted of indecency with thirteen-year-old child, aggravated sexual assault of eight-year-old child, and sexual assault of twenty-year-old woman, all involving Hartshorn going into sleeping person's room and committing sexually violent offense). The appellate court issued its mandate on July 9, 2012. The committing court in Montgomery County signed a biennial-review order continuing Hartshorn's commitment on June 10, 2015. On September 14, 2015, after the Legislature's 2015 amendments to the SVP statute became effective, the committing court signed an amended order modifying the requirements of Hartshorn's civil commitment to conform with the new requirements in subsection 841.082(a) of the SVP statute. Both orders gave Hartshorn notice of his next biennial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2016, Hartshorn filed in Travis County his \"Unauthorized Petition for Release and in the alternative, Petition for Less Restrictive Housing and Supervision,\" naming the TCCO as the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7\u00a7 841.0834(b), .122. In this pleading, Hartshorn alleged that the jurisdiction of the committing court had terminated June 17, 2015, with the amendment of the SVP statute and that \"the Legislature intended for the courts of the county where [Hartshorn]'s most recent conviction for a sexually violent offense occurred[ ] to be the venue for future civil commitment proceedings.\" Hartshorn further alleged that because Travis County was the county of his most recent conviction for a sexually violent offense, his petition for release and petition for less restrictive housing and supervision should be filed there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Hartshorn never perfected service of process on the TCCO. He served only the Travis County District Attorney's Office. After the Travis County District Attorney's Office was served, it requested the assistance of the Special Prosecution Unit. Under the SVP statute, the special prosecution unit provides legal, financial, and technical assistance upon request to an attorney representing the state for a civil-commitment proceeding.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%206229545\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 841.042. The Special Prosecution Unit filed a combined motion to transfer venue to Montgomery County, plea to the jurisdiction, special exception, and original answer on behalf of the State. The State contended that the jurisdiction of the committing court in Montgomery County was not terminated effective June 17, 2015, that under the SVP statute the committing court retained jurisdiction over Hartshorn's petition for release, that Hartshorn's alternative petition for less restrictive housing and supervision should be filed in the same court statutorily authorized to hear the petition for release, that venue was mandatory in Montgomery County, and that the\n   cause should be transferred to the Montgomery County committing court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After a hearing, the district court signed an order denying the plea to the jurisdiction and motion to transfer venue and ordering the cause transferred from the 345th District Court of Travis County, the court in which Hartshorn's petitions were filed, to the 331st District Court of Travis County-the court in which he was most recently convicted of a sexually violent offense. The State filed a motion to reconsider, which the court denied in an amended order. The amended order specified that the committing court of Montgomery County \"does not have jurisdiction over this proceeding\" and that \"the 331st District Court of Travis County, Texas has jurisdiction over this proceeding, as it is the court of conviction for [Hartshorn]'s most recent sexually violent offense.\" The order directed that \"this matter is transferred to the 331st District Court of Travis County, Texas for all further proceedings.\" This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In its first and second issues, the TCCO contends that the Montgomery County court that civilly committed Hartshorn as a sexually violent predator retained jurisdiction over his petition for release under Subchapter G of the SVP statute and his petition for less restrictive housing and supervision under Subchapter E of the statute. In its third issue, the TCCO contends that the order transferring Hartshorn's cause to the 331st District Court of Travis County from the 345th District Court of Travis County is void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A plea to the jurisdiction challenges the court's authority to decide a case.\n   <em>\n    Heckman v.

Laws at 2712 (historical note).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Given the statutory context of subchapter E, we conclude that Hartshorn's 2016 petition for transfer to less restrictive housing and supervision under subsection 841.0834(b) should have been filed in the Montgomery County court that civilly committed him as a sexually violent predator in 2010.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kelley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7324935\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/309/536/#p546\">\n    309 S.W.3d at 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (construing statute in context with remainder of subchapter). Requiring Hartshorn's petition under the SVP statute to remain in the committing court of Montgomery County is an interpretation of the legislation that is logical, prevents different courts from issuing competing orders as to the same committed person, and maintains continuity of oversight by the court that has conducted biennial reviews of Hartshorn's commitment, most recently on June 30, 2017. We sustain the TCCO's second issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    Order transferring Hartshorn's cause to Travis County is void\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In its third issue, the TCCO contends that the order transferring Hartshorn's cause to the 331st District\n   Court of Travis County from the 345th District Court of Travis County is void. A judgment is void when \"the court rendering judgment had no jurisdiction of the parties or property, no jurisdiction of the subject matter, no jurisdiction to enter the particular judgment, or no capacity to act.\"\n   <em>\n    PNS Stores, Inc. v.

We have sustained the TCCO's first two issues, concluding that the committing court in Montgomery County did not lose jurisdiction over Hartshorn's cause on June 17, 2015, as a result of the amendments to the SVP statute and thus, that the plea to the jurisdiction was wrongfully denied. Because the 345th District Court of Travis County lacked jurisdiction over Hartshorn's petitions that should have been filed in Montgomery County, the 345th District Court's order transferring Hartshorn's cause to the 331st District Court of Travis County is void.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rivera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7118797\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/379/267/#p272\">\n    379 S.W.3d at 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
