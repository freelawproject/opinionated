Lowery (\"Movant\") appeals from the motion court's judgment denying his Rule 24.035 motion for post-conviction relief without an evidentiary hearing. Movant pleaded guilty to the class C felony of stealing, in violation of Section 570.030.1 (RSMo. Supp. 2013). The court suspended execution of Movant's five-year sentence and placed Movant on probation for a term of five years. Movant's probation was later revoked and the previously imposed five-year sentence was executed. The motion court denied Movant's motion for post-conviction relief without an evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We have reviewed the briefs of the parties and the record on appeal and find no error of law. No jurisprudential purpose would be served by a written opinion. However, the parties have been furnished with a memorandum for their information only, setting forth the facts and reasons for this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The judgment is affirmed pursuant to Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
