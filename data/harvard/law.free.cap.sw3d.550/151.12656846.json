During the last eight of those months, her grandparents were her primary caretakers and providers. The issue here is whether the grandparents, having continuously engaged in that parent-like role on a day-to-day basis, had standing to pursue a suit affecting the parent-child relationship (SAPCR) under the Texas statute conferring such standing on nonparents who have had \"actual care, control, and possession of the child for at least six months.\" TEX. FAM. CODE \u00a7 102.003(a)(9). Both the trial court and the court of appeals concluded the grandparents lacked standing. We disagree. We reverse the court of appeals' judgment and remand the\n   case to the trial court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Immediately upon Heather's birth in January 2013, she and her mother moved into her maternal grandparents' home. Heather's parents were not married and did not live together. On August 29, 2013, the trial court entered an order in a pending SAPCR appointing Heather's parents joint managing conservators, with Mother having the exclusive right to designate Heather's primary residence. Broadly speaking, the order granted Father possession of Heather on alternate weekends and various holidays.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   From the time of her birth until December 19, 2014, Heather primarily lived in the home of her maternal grandmother and step-grandfather (Grandparents). Mother, who struggled with alcohol addiction, also resided at Grandparents' home from August 29, 2013 until March 30, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 30, 2014, Mother moved to a sober-living facility called Oxford House to address her addiction issues. Mother, Father, and Grandparents agreed that Heather would continue to live with Grandparents while Mother was in recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mother testified that she did not have a specific time frame in mind for her stay at Oxford, though she initially anticipated being there no more than three months. She also testified that, while living at Oxford, she would go to Grandparents' house in the evenings and would \"have dinner with [Heather], bathe her, put her to bed, spend time with her.\" The record is not clear about the frequency of these visits, although the trial court found that Mother saw Heather \"on a regular basis.\" Mother also sometimes picked Heather up from daycare when she was able to get a car. Father's exercise of his possession rights when Mother moved to Oxford was \"sporadic\" for the first few months or so, after which Heather stayed with him approximately every other weekend, sometimes commencing on Thursday.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After Mother moved to Oxford, Grandparents directed Heather's day-to-day activities and took care of her daily needs; provided her with a home, food, clothing, and shelter; and paid for her daycare. They necessarily decided when Heather would start her day, what she would eat for meals, what clothing she would wear, what activities she would participate in, whether she would be restricted from watching television or encouraged to play outside. In short, they managed and controlled her everyday activities. They also ensured that her nutritional, physical, emotional, and psychological needs were addressed, while providing her with a nurturing home. When she awoke in the middle of the night, they were there to comfort her, and when she scraped her knee, she could depend on them to stop the bleeding. Indeed, Father agreed, and the trial court found, that Grandparents were Heather's \"primary caregivers\" from March to October 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Grandparents also took Heather to the doctor or to urgent care when necessary, although Mother and Father were also involved in medical decisions. The trial court found that both Mother and Grandmother made doctor's appointments for Heather, and Grandmother testified that Mother attended some, but not all, of those appointments. Mother provided authorization for Grandparents to take Heather to a specific doctor's office and to obtain emergency treatment. Father also testified that he authorized Grandparents to obtain necessary emergency treatment for Heather\n   but that, on a few occasions, a medical provider obtained his consent over the phone to treat Heather. The parties generally agree, and the trial court found, that Grandparents kept Mother and Father informed about Heather's daily activities and medical needs and \"sought input\" from them on decisions that needed to be made about her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mother and Father both testified that they intended the arrangement with Grandparents to be temporary while Mother was in recovery. Mother also testified, and the trial court found, that she did not intend to relinquish her care and control of Heather to Grandparents. However, by early October 2014, Mother remained at Oxford, while Heather still lived with Grandparents. On October 6, Grandparents filed a petition to modify the SAPCR order requesting that they be appointed Heather's managing conservators with the right to designate her primary residence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   They alleged that they had had actual care, control, and possession of Heather for six months and thus had standing to sue as nonparents under Family Code section 102.003(a)(9). Father filed a counterpetition to modify the possession order and filed a plea to the jurisdiction seeking dismissal of Grandparents' petition for lack of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In January 2015, the associate judge entered temporary orders appointing Father \"primary\" managing conservator and granting Mother supervised visitation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court held a hearing on Father's plea to the jurisdiction and granted the plea, dismissing Grandparents' petition. The trial court also entered an agreed order (as between Mother and Father) appointing Heather's parents joint managing conservators, granting Father the right to designate Heather's primary residence within Tarrant County, granting Mother possession of Heather \"at times mutually agreed to in advance by the parties,\" and requiring Mother to pay child support. In its findings of fact and conclusions of law, the court determined that Grandparents did not establish that they had \"actual care\" or \"actual control\" over Heather for the six-month period preceding their petition filing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Grandparents appealed. The court of appeals affirmed, holding that \"standing under section 102.003(a)(9) cannot be gained by a nonparent exercising care, control, and possession over a child in the absence of evidence that the child's parent is unfit or has abdicated his or her own care, control, and possession over the child to the nonparent for the statutory period.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657093\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/552/282/#p289\">\n    552 S.W.3d 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 289,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204040497\">\n    2016 WL 4040497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex.

STANDING FRAMEWORK AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The only issue presented is whether Grandparents had standing under\n   the Family Code to file a SAPCR seeking conservatorship of Heather. With that in mind, we note the significance of the stage of the case before us. Generally, standing involves a threshold determination of whether a plaintiff has a sufficient \"justiciable interest\" in the suit's outcome to be entitled to a judicial determination.\n   <em>\n    Austin Nursing Ctr. v. Lovato\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8924736\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/171/845/#p848\">\n    171 S.W.3d 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 848-49 (Tex. 2005). \"Without standing, a court lacks subject matter jurisdiction\" over the case, and the merits of the plaintiff's claims thus cannot be litigated or decided.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8924736\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/171/845/#p848\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 849 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Here, the merits of Grandparents' claims-that is, whether they should be appointed Heather's managing conservators with the right to designate her primary residence-have not yet been considered by any court and are not before us.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8171402\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/260/568/#p573\">\n    260 S.W.3d 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 573 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, no pet.) (explaining, in a suit involving grandparent access, that \"whether the grandparent ultimately will succeed is a different question than whether the grandparent has the right simply to bring suit\"). Thus, this case is not about whether Grandparents will prevail in their suit; it is about whether they may bring it in the first place. And without standing, Grandparents are precluded not only from seeking custody of Heather but also from seeking any type of visitation with her at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Standing, like other issues implicating a court's subject matter jurisdiction, is a question of law that we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    Tex.

Grandparents rely on subsection (a)(9), which confers such standing on \"a person, other than a foster parent,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   who has had actual care, control, and possession of the child for at least six months ending not more than 90 days preceding the date of the filing of the petition.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"In computing the time necessary for standing\" under this subsection, courts \"shall consider the child's principal residence during the relevant time.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7320765\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/336/619/#p628\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 102.003(b).

We cannot agree with either conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   First, the fact that \"actual care\" and \"actual control\" are often exercised together does not make either term superfluous. When a nonparent takes daily responsibility for ensuring that a child is fed, clothed, and emotionally nurtured, that nonparent is taking \"actual care\" of the child. When a nonparent consistently makes the kinds of day-to-day decisions associated with raising a child-when she gets up and goes to bed, how much television she watches, whether she gets dessert, when she needs to go to the doctor-that nonparent is exercising \"actual control\" over the child. The dissent's narrow reading of \"control\" to encompass only the \"important\" decisions to be made about a child's life is supported by neither the statute nor the term's ordinary meaning. And it raises the question of which decisions are \"important\" enough to fall into this category.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The dissent's conflation of legal and actual control is also curious. Of course, parents whose rights have not been terminated and who have not otherwise formally granted to a nonparent the right to make decisions about the child necessarily have the legal\n   <em>\n    authority\n   </em>\n   to override the nonparent's decisions or to withdraw any express or implied permission given to the nonparent. However, this merely highlights the difference between having legal control\n   and exercising actual control. The two do not, as the dissent asserts, necessarily go hand in hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Further, the court of appeals and the dissent essentially focus their analysis on the parents' conduct in evaluating nonparent standing, but the statute by its plain terms focuses on the nonparent's role in the child's life. This makes sense because the relationship that develops over time between a child and a person who serves in a parent-like role-i.e., someone who has actual care, control, and possession of the child-is what justifies allowing that person to seek to preserve involvement in the child's life. We decline to hold that a parent must wholly cease exercising his or her own parental rights and responsibilities in order for a nonparent to exercise those same kinds of responsibilities and obtain standing under section 102.003(a)(9). Requiring this type of abdication would essentially amount to an imposition that parents relinquish their parental rights entirely in order for a nonparent to attain standing to seek a continued relationship with the child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nothing in section 102.003(a)(9) supports imposing such a requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, Mother and Father argue that a nonparent's exercise of actual care and control of a child is conditioned on the nonparent's \"permanent power over a child,\" such that the provision of physical and psychological comfort is \"more than transient in nature.\" They argue that a nonparent cannot satisfy section 102.003(a)(9) when, as in this case, the living arrangement was intended to be temporary. But, just as requiring legal or exclusive control over the child would improperly add language to the statute, so too would requiring intent to make the nonparent's exercise of care, control, and possession permanent. The parents do not dispute that they consented to the arrangement,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   and however long they anticipated it lasting, the fact remains that it had continued for over six months when Grandparents filed suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jasek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7318573\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/348/523/#p535\">\n    348 S.W.3d at 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Presumably, a person would only be able to meet [the section 102.003(a)(9) ] requirements, absent violating some other law, with some type of parental or conservator consent, actual or constructive, such as where a parent leaves a child in the care of other people for more\n   than six months.\"). The statute requires six months of actual care, control, and possession, not six months of care, control, and possession\n   <em>\n    with the understanding that it is intended to be a permanent arrangement\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In sum, a nonparent has \"actual care, control, and possession of the child\" under section 102.003(a)(9) if, for the requisite six-month time period, the nonparent served in a parent-like role by (1) sharing a principal residence with the child, (2) providing for the child's daily physical and psychological needs, and (3) exercising guidance, governance, and direction similar to that typically exercised on a day-to-day basis by parents with their children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The statute does not require the nonparent to have ultimate legal authority to control the child, nor does it require the parents to have wholly ceded or relinquished their own parental rights and responsibilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Applying the standards enumerated above, we hold that Grandparents exercised \"actual care, control, and possession\" of Heather for the six-month statutory time period. A litany of facts underlie this holding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   First, as noted, it is undisputed that Heather's principal residence, from the time she was born until she was almost two, was Grandparents' home. During the six months preceding Grandparents' filing their petition, Heather spent approximately every other weekend (sometimes commencing on Thursday) at Father's,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   but otherwise resided with Grandparents. Grandparents were her primary caregivers, providing for her everyday physical and emotional needs. They paid for her food, clothes, and daycare. They managed and directed her day-to-day activities. They took her to urgent care when necessary for emergency treatment, made some of her doctor's appointments, and took her to the doctor for checkups even when Mother made the appointments. For a child Heather's age, it is difficult to imagine what more \"care\" and \"control\" they could have exercised.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   In short, Grandparents played a parent-like role in Heather's life on a daily basis for over six months before Grandparents filed their petition, from at least March 30 to October 6, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   That Heather's parents remained involved in her life and continued to make some medical decisions on her behalf does not alter or negate that conclusion. Nor does the evidence that the arrangement, while indefinite, was intended to be temporary. Mother and Father agreed to an extended arrangement in which Grandparents took primary responsibility for Heather's\n   daily needs. Certainly Mother and Father\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have revoked this arrangement at any time, but they chose not to.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In sum, we hold that Grandparents have shown that, for the statutory time period, they (1) shared a principal residence with Heather, (2) provided for Heather's daily physical and psychological needs, and (3) exercised guidance, governance, and direction similar to that typically exercised on a day-to-day basis by parents with their children. Accordingly, Grandparents \"had actual care, control, and possession\" of Heather \"for at least six months ending not more than 90 days preceding the date of the filing of the petition\" and therefore had standing to file their petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Having determined that Grandparents had standing under the statute's plain language, we turn to the constitutional implications of nonparent standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Troxel\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In confining nonparent standing under section 102.003(a)(9) to those instances in which the child's parent \"is unfit or has abdicated his or her own care, control, and possession,\" the court of appeals relied in part on\n   <em>\n    Troxel v.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Parental rights are fundamental, but neither the Texas Family Code nor the Constitution treats them as plenary and unchecked. The Family Code recognizes that a narrow class of nonparents, who have served in a parent-like role to a child over an extended period of time, may come to court and seek to preserve that relationship, over a parent's objections. We hold that Grandparents fall into that class, although we express no opinion on whether Grandparents are entitled to conservatorship or visitation rights with respect to Heather. We therefore reverse the court of appeals' judgment and remand the case to the trial court to determine the merits of Grandparents' petition.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Like the court of appeals, we use the pseudonym \"Heather\" to refer to the child at issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    The record is unclear as to Mother's living situation before August 29.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    The live pleading does not use the term \"sole managing conservator\" or \"joint managing conservator,\" but appears to be requesting some form of managing conservatorship.

Section 102.004, which expressly confers standing \"[i]n addition to the general standing to file suit provided by Section 102.003,\" allows grandparents and certain other close relatives to file an original suit requesting managing conservatorship upon \"satisfactory proof\" that \"the child's present circumstances would significantly impair the child's physical health or emotional development.\" And section 153.433(a) allows a court to \"order reasonable possession of or access to a grandchild by a grandparent\" if several conditions are met. Grandparents allege only \"general\" nonparent standing under section 102.003(a)(9).

In the first, Father and Son talk on the phone most nights and the caretaker regularly consults with Father regarding Son's schoolwork, discipline, and extracurricular activities. In the second, Father absconds with his girlfriend. In the dissent's view, the Son's caretaker has nonparent standing in the second hypothetical but not the first. By focusing on Father's conduct, both hypotheticals ignore the relationship that has necessarily developed between Son and the caretaker while he serves in that role and as manager of Son's daily activities. Suppose facts identical to the first hypothetical, except that Father is continually assigned to offshore oilrigs over the course of seven years rather than seven months. Or suppose Father checks in with Son and caretaker once a month and is available for any necessary emergency decisions that need to be made, but otherwise leaves the day-to-day decisions to the caretaker. The dissent's all-or-nothing approach means anything short of \"absconding\" on the parent's part leaves the caretaker with no ability to seek to preserve\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    involvement in the child's life in the event Father subsequently decides to restrict it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    Mother and Father testified that, on a few occasions during the pertinent time period, they told Grandmother they wanted Heather to live with Father, but that Grandmother \"disagreed\" or said \"we'll talk about it.\" There is no indication in the record or the trial court's findings that Father ever refused (or attempted to refuse) to return Heather to Grandparents at the end of his periods of weekend possession, or that the parents attempted to obtain a court order.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    This is consistent with\n    <em>\n     Jasek\n    </em>\n    's description of the \"common threads running through the cases in which the court found actual care, control, and possession,\" including:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n    that the person asserting standing (1) lived in the same home as the child or lived in a home where the child stayed overnight on a regular and frequent basis, (2) made financial contributions benefitting the child, (3) was involved with the child's education, and (4) was involved in matters involving the child's general upbringing, like health care, feeding, and clothing.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7318573\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/348/523/#p535\">\n     348 S.W.3d at 534\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    The trial court found that Father also saw Heather more often than that, although the nature and frequency of that contact is not clear from the record.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    In the dissent's view, the fact that Grandparents kept Mother and Father \"reasonably informed\" about Heather's daily activities and medical needs and sought their input on decisions about her undercuts Grandparents' assertion of control.

Everyone wants the best for Heather, though they may disagree about what that entails\n    or how to achieve it. One thing is certain, however: the instability, ill-will, and financial burdens of litigation are detrimental to the child's well-being and harmful to familial relationships.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    Litigation may be necessary when parents have abdicated their responsibilities and allowed someone else to fulfill the committed parental role,\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    but this is not one of those cases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Heather's grandparents temporarily assisted their daughter in the care of her child, which is a natural and loving thing to do, especially in times of adversity. But it does not rise to the level of \"actual control\" in this case because Heather's parents continued to exercise their parental rights, continued to fulfill their parental obligations, and did not perpetuate the grandparents as substitute or functional parents.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    The record shows that Heather was in day care while both her grandparents and parents worked; after work, Heather's mother cared for her-spending time with her and feeding, bathing, and putting her to bed; Heather's father fulfilled his parental obligations and exercised the rights he was afforded under the possession order; both parents continued to make significant decisions about Heather's healthcare; both parents consulted with and directed the grandparents regarding Heather's care; and both parents remained the primary and ultimate decision-makers about what would be best for their child. Neither the record nor the trial court's fact findings support the conclusion that the grandparents exercised actual control over Heather, but rather were at all times acting under and subject to her parents' control. Accordingly, I agree with Justice Blacklock that the grandparents do not have standing under Section 102.003(a)(9) of the Family Code and therefore join his dissent.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    In my view, any reading of Section 102.003(a)(9) that treats a non-parent's supportive participation in parental decision-making commensurate with actual control over the child is neither reasonable nor consistent with the plain meaning of the term.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    The right of parents to parent their children-even imperfectly-\"is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    When parents are fit to act as parents and are engaged as parents should be, the state has no business intruding on the parent-child relationship.

The grandparents suggest it was improper for the trial court to make fact findings on the standing issue, asserting that under\n    <em>\n     Texas Department of Parks &amp; Wildlife v. Miranda\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    the trial court must view evidence challenging jurisdictional facts in the light most favorable to standing and defer ruling on the jurisdictional matter pending the factfinder's disposition of material disputed facts. And because the existence of jurisdiction is a question of law reviewed de novo, the grandparents assert we must likewise take as true all evidence favorable to them and indulge every reasonable inference in their favor. But the grandparents acknowledge that, when the trial court makes findings of fact and conclusions of law, as in this case, appellate courts review the trial court's legal conclusions de novo and fact findings for evidentiary support.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    The contention that we must view the evidence here in the light most favorable to standing rather than in the light most favorable to the trial court's fact findings reflects a misunderstanding of\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    , which involved a jurisdictional issue intertwined with the merits of the case. When jurisdictional issues do not implicate the merits, the trial court's fact findings are afforded weight if supported by sufficient evidence,\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    and that is true whether the fact findings are express or implied.\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    is a personal-injury case in which the plaintiff suffered injuries after a tree limb fell on her head while she was engaged in recreational activities at a state park.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n    The defendant asserted sovereign immunity, which the plaintiff could overcome only by establishing gross negligence.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n    Though the plaintiff's pleadings alleged gross negligence, the defendant challenged the existence of that fact with evidence.\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n    We held that the trial court was required to consider the parties' jurisdictional evidence, but in doing so, we distinguished jurisdictional challenges that implicate the merits, holding that if the evidence raises a fact issue in such cases, the resolution of the matter is for the factfinder, not the court.\n    <footnotemark>\n     15\n    </footnotemark>\n    Such circumstances invoke a summary-judgment type inquiry,\n    <footnotemark>\n     16\n    </footnotemark>\n    which precludes the trial court from making fact findings.\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The same is not true, however, when the jurisdictional inquiry is neither intertwined with nor implicates the merits. Because standing is a prerequisite to subject-matter jurisdiction,\n    <footnotemark>\n     18\n    </footnotemark>\n    the trial court must consider disputed evidence necessary to determine\n    standing and may make findings of fact when the standing question does not involve the merits of the dispute, as in this case. We afford those findings, whether express or implied, deference if supported by sufficient evidence. Conclusions of law and application of law to the facts are, however, reviewed de novo.\n    <footnotemark>\n     19\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    The Court gives deference to the trial court's fact findings in this case because they are unchallenged\n    <footnotemark>\n     20\n    </footnotemark>\n    and the dissent does so because they are supported by legally sufficient evidence.\n    <footnotemark>\n     21\n    </footnotemark>\n    The court of appeals opined that the material facts were undisputed.\n    <footnotemark>\n     22\n    </footnotemark>\n    Whether we give deference to the trial court's findings or apply the statutory standing framework to the undisputed facts as a matter of law,\n    <footnotemark>\n     23\n    </footnotemark>\n    the result here turns on the proper construction of the statute.

But in\n     <em>\n      Jasek\n     </em>\n     the child's parents had left the picture completely. The dispute was between the child's functional (though not legal) parents and the child's legal \"parent,\" an incorporeal government entity. In such a case, it makes perfect sense to conclude that the government's legal control of the child says little about who actually controlled the child. But the court in\n     <em>\n      Jasek\n     </em>\n     neither asked nor answered whether non-parents can achieve simultaneous \"actual control\" of a child along with\n     <em>\n      natural\n     </em>\n     parents who continue to actively control the child's life. Instead, the court decided that a non-parent couple acting as the only functional parent figures for the child had \"actual control\" of the child even though a government entity was legally the child's \"parent.\"\n     <em>\n      Jasek\n     </em>\n     was probably correctly decided. But we should not rely on dicta from\n     <em>\n      Jasek\n     </em>\n     about the ability of non-parents to achieve \"actual control\" of a child when\n     <em>\n      Jasek\n     </em>\n     did not involve a conflict between parents and non-parents as we normally understand those concepts.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-148\">\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Tex.

Blacklock Justice, Dissenting.\n   </author>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Today the Court holds that nearly anyone who has \"played an unusual and significant parent-like role in a child's life\" may sue for legal rights of visitation and control over the child even if the child's parents remain actively involved in the child's life and oppose the non-parents' wishes. According to the Court, section 102.003(a)(9) of the Family Code dictates this outcome. I respectfully disagree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Section 102.003(a)(9) grants standing to file a suit affecting the parent-child relationship to non-parents who have had \"actual care, control, and possession of the child for at least six months.\" The court of appeals essentially reasoned that \"actual care, control, and possession\" of a child belongs presumptively to the child's parents. Thus, for a non-parent to achieve the \"actual care, control, and possession\" required for standing, the child's parents must first give up \"actual care, control, and possession.\" We should adopt this simple formulation, primarily because it comports with the statute's text but also because it avoids potential encroachment on \"the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.\"\n    <em>\n     Troxel v. Granville\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/#p72\">\n     530 U.S. 57\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 66,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/#p72\">\n     120 S.Ct. 2054\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/#p72\">\n     147 L.Ed.2d 49\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2000) (plurality opinion). Even if the choice were between two equally persuasive readings of section 102.003(a)(9) -and it is not-I would adopt the reading that avoids burdening parents' unalienable right to raise their children as they see fit, rather than the reading that follows modern trends in family law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    The Court instead condenses the statute's three-pronged requirement of \"actual care, control, and possession\" into one question: Did the non-parent \"play[ ] an unusual and significant parent-like role in a child's life\"?\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 162. In the Court's view, this \"parent-like role\" may be played simultaneously by parents and by multiple non-parents alike. As a matter of statutory interpretation, the principal defect in the Court's approach is its failure to afford\n    independent meaning to the statute's \"actual control\" requirement apart from the control already entailed in \"actual care\" and \"actual possession.\" The result is that parents who remain in control of their children's lives can be forced into visitation and custody fights over their own children by any non-parent whose relationship with the child triggers the Court's malleable \"parent-like role\" standard. The Court rightly recognizes that non-parents who care for and reside with a child may often develop a special bond with the child. Heather's grandparents surely have such a bond with Heather, and I join Justice Guzman in commending them for their admirable willingness to help provide for Heather during a difficult time in her parents' lives. But Texas law recognizes the unique, exclusive, and constitutionally protected relationship between parents and their children. One way it does so is through section 102.003(a)(9), which limits non-parent standing in custody and visitation cases to situations in which parents no longer exercise their unique and exclusive right of \"actual control\" over their child. Only then can a non-parent take up the \"parent-like role\" of \"actual control\" required for standing. No one can fully stand in a parent's shoes unless the parent first steps out of those shoes and walks away.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    In the case before us, the child's Mother and Father sent their daughter \"Heather\" to live with her Grandparents for a temporary period. After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court found that although Grandparents were Heather's primary caregivers during this time, both Mother and Father remained actively involved in their daughter's life, made medical decisions for her, and never intended to relinquish control over her upbringing to her Grandparents. I agree with the trial court and the court of appeals that the child's parents, not her Grandparents, retained \"actual control\" over her throughout the time in question. Because Grandparents did not have \"actual care, control, and possession\" of the child for the required six-month period, they failed to satisfy section 102.003(a)(9)'s standing requirements. We should affirm the court of appeals' judgment dismissing the case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    <strong>\n     I. Factual Background\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    The trial court entered detailed findings of fact supporting its conclusion that the child's parents remained sufficiently involved in her life to exclude the possibility that anyone else exercised actual control over her. We should review these findings of fact under a deferential legal sufficiency standard.\n    <em>\n     BMC Software Belg., N.V. v. Marchand\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11433901\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/83/789/#p794\">\n     83 S.W.3d 789\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 794 (Tex. 2002). The Court's recitation of the facts does not track the trial court's findings. We are obliged to afford the trial court's fact findings \"the same force and dignity as a jury's verdict upon questions.\"\n    <em>\n     Anderson v. City of Seven Points\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10007758\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/806/791/#p794\">\n     806 S.W.2d 791\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 794 (Tex. 1991). Instead, the Court engages in its own summary of the testimony, some of which comports with the trial court's factual findings and some of which does not. This case turns primarily on a legal question of statutory construction, and presumably the Court would reach the same conclusion on the meaning of section 102.003(a)(9) even if it had explicitly deferred to the trial court's fact-findings. But in any event, re-stating the facts as the trial court found them provides the best basis for understanding the nature of the case before us. The trial court found as follows:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Mother and Heather lived with Grandparents for several months before Mother moved out to begin a temporary stay at a rehab facility called Sober Living, where Mother could address her alcohol problem. Mother, Father, and Grandparents held a family meeting and reached an agreement\n    regarding the terms of Heather's stay at Grandparents' house. Mother's absence was intended to be, and actually was, temporary. The living arrangement was a temporary solution until Mother was able to stabilize in her recovery. After her stay at Sober Living, Mother wanted Heather to live with her and for Father to continue co-parenting Heather.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    During the time Heather lived with Grandparents, Mother continued to make certain decisions for Heather, including decisions regarding medical and wellness care. Mother gave Grandmother permission to take Heather to the doctor for specific doctor office visits. Mother signed a consent form allowing Grandparents to seek emergency medical care for Heather. Father also gave his authorization for Heather to receive medical care in case of emergency. On more than one occasion, a healthcare provider contacted Father for permission to provide medical care to Heather.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Grandmother kept Mother fully informed of Heather's activities. Grandmother consulted with and sought input from Mother and Father on decisions that needed to be made for Heather. Mother and Father both provided Grandmother with input regarding caring for Heather.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Mother left Sober Living in the evenings to visit Heather at Grandparents' house, where Mother would have dinner with Heather, bathe her, spend time with her, and put her to bed. Mother kept in constant contact with Heather while at Sober Living and would sometimes pick Heather up from daycare. Father often spent time with Heather too. Father kept her virtually every other weekend and would often see her more frequently. Both Mother and Father wanted Heather to spend even more time with Father. Even though Father and Mother never married, they had always done things together with Heather. Father is a fit father and has always been involved in Heather's life.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    <strong>\n     II.

App.-Beaumont 2009, no pet.) ). The Court's reasoning, however, fails to give meaningful effect to the statute's \"actual control\" requirement beyond the elements of control already included in \"actual possession\" and \"actual care.\" \"Control\" cannot mean providing daily supervision, clothing, food, transportation, and the like. If it did, then \"control\" would be the same thing as \"care,\" rendering one statutory term or the other superfluous. And if \"control\" were merely the physical holding of the child, then \"control\" would be the same thing as \"possession,\" again rendering one term or the other superfluous. Instead, \"control\" must mean something distinct from \"care\" and \"possession.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    In the context of child-rearing, \"control\" of a child entails the power and authority to make important decisions about the child's life. As the definitions cited above indicate, to have \"control\" of a child is to \"govern,\" \"oversee,\" and \"direct\" the child. This means more than day-to-day or hour-to-hour supervision and discipline-and certainly more than deciding \"when [a\n    child] gets up and goes to bed, how much television she watches, [and] whether she gets dessert.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 158. It means responsibility for the important choices that must be made for the child-choices about where she will live, her medical care, her education, and her future. Such control is by its nature, and by law, the exclusive right and duty of parents in the first instance.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    When important decisions must be made for a child, someone bears ultimate responsibility for them no matter how many other caregivers may be involved in the child's life or consulted on the decision. Unless the child's parents refuse or shirk this responsibility, it is theirs both in law and in fact.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Parents often delegate matters of day-to-day care and possession to others, such as schools or family members. Doing so does not reduce the parents' control over their child or share \"parent-like\" control with others. To the contrary, determining where a child will be and who will care for her is a quintessential exercise of parents' exclusive control over their children. Deciding to share possession and care of a child with others is an exercise of the parents' control over the child, not a sharing of parental control or a relinquishment of it. Even if physically absent, a parent does not hand over control of her child merely by handing over physical possession and care. Again, if that were the case, \"control\" would have no role to play in section 102.003(a)(9).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Citing\n    <em>\n     Coons-Andersen v.

App.-Dallas 2003, no pet.), the Court agrees with the notion that section 102.003(a)(9) is in harmony with the common law concept of\n    <em>\n     in loco parentis\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 157. But under the classical understanding of\n    <em>\n     in loco parentis\n    </em>\n    , the parent retains ultimate control of the child while consciously delegating possession and care of a child to another, such as a family member or boarding school. Such intentional delegation of a portion of parental authority is a reflection, not a reduction, of parents' exclusive control over their children. 1 WILLIAM BLACKSTONE, COMMENTARIES *453-54 (\"[The father] may also delegate part of his parental authority\" to someone \"who is then\n    <em>\n     in loco parentis\n    </em>\n    , and has such a portion of the power of the parent committed to his charge.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    The Court suggests that the parents' ultimate\n    <em>\n     legal\n    </em>\n    responsibility for the child is irrelevant to the inquiry because the statute requires \"actual control,\" not \"legal control\" or \"constructive control.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 157. This distinction between \"legal control\" and \"actual control\" matters, but the Court takes it too far. That Mother and Father retained their legal rights as Heather's parents does not by itself foreclose Grandparents' claim to \"actual control\" of Heather. But the Court mistakenly treats legal control and actual control like opposites, when in fact they go hand in hand nearly all the time.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Marino v.

Parents' exclusive, ultimate legal control over their children is no mere lawyerly construct.

Sometimes, usually in very difficult circumstances, legal and actual control are severed. When a parent leaves the picture, relinquishing the role of ultimate decision-maker for the child, the parent does not automatically lose legal\n    control of the child. But the parent does forfeit actual, factual control to whoever steps into the parent's shoes as the functional equivalent of the child's parent. The person who steps into the absent parent's shoes does not have all the legal rights of a parent without court action, but he has \"actual control\" of the child for purposes of section 102.003(a)(9) because he is functionally the child's ultimate decision-maker. The court of appeals correctly discerned that the \"actual control\" required by section 102.003(a)(9) remains fused with the parents' legal control of the child unless the parents relinquish their ultimate decision-making responsibility for the child to someone else.\n    <em>\n     In re H.S.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657093\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/552/282/#p289\">\n     552 S.W.3d at 289-91\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204040497\">\n     2016 WL 4040497\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *5.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Adopting this understanding of \"control\" as distinct from \"care\" and \"possession\" does not add extra words or requirements to the statute.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lee v.

This does not add a requirement to the statute. It gives life to the \"actual control\" requirement already contained in the statutory text. Actual control and legal control usually exist coextensively in the parents. When the parents relinquish their responsibilities, actual and legal control diverge, and someone else takes up actual control of the child even though the absent parents retain their legal status. Section 102.003(a)(9) grants that person standing, so long as the statute's other requirements are satisfied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    To illustrate the role \"control\" plays in section 102.003(a)(9), consider two scenarios in which a single Father has a Son. In the first, Father goes to work on an offshore oil rig for seven months, intending to return and resume his daily life with Son. He leaves Son with a close friend. Father and Son talk on the phone most nights, and the caretaker regularly consults with Father regarding Son's schoolwork, discipline, and extracurricular activities. Father also signs off on most medical treatment for Son. After six months, Father's friend asserts standing under section 102.003(a)(9) to sue for permanent possession of Son. But the friend lacks standing, because even though he had\n    <em>\n     care\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     possession\n    </em>\n    of Son, he did not have\n    <em>\n     control\n    </em>\n    ; Father retained control. In the second scenario, Father again goes to work on an offshore oil rig for seven months and leaves Son with a close friend. This time, however, Father absconds from the rig and disappears with a girlfriend. No one hears from Father for over six months. The caretaking friend asserts standing under section 102.003(a)(9) to sue for custody of Son. In this scenario, there is little doubt the friend has statutory standing. Father functionally relinquished his control\n    of Son to the friend and abdicated his parental control. Here the friend, not the Father, has actual control of Son.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    The Court disagrees with this interpretation of actual control, but it recognizes that it should give effect to the statutory requirement of \"control\" beyond what is already entailed in \"care\" and \"possession.\" To this end, the Court offers a definition of control: \"exercising guidance, governance, and direction similar to that typically exercised on a day-to-day basis by parents with their children.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 160.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    The Court's emphasis on \"day-to-day\" matters blurs the statutory distinction between daily care and ultimate control. But the Court fails to apply even its own flawed definition of \"control.\" What is the nature of the guidance, governance, and direction typically exercised by parents with their children? The Court does not say. As explained above, one defining characteristic of the guidance, governance, and direction typically exercised by parents with their children is its exclusivity. The parent-child relationship is unique, both factually and legally. There may be abundant important opportunities for non-parents to direct and guide the child, but that does not make them the functional equivalent of the child's parents. As long as the parents remain actively involved in the child's life, there is little room for anyone else to exercise the control \"typically exercised by parents\" because the parents themselves already occupy that unique and special role.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    The Court seems to acknowledge that its understanding of \"actual control\" has nothing to do with the ultimate decision-making authority \"typically exercised by parents with their children.\" Instead, the Court limits its definition of \"control\" to the \"day-to-day\" matters of parenting. If all parental \"control\" means is deciding \"when [a child] gets up and goes to bed, how much television she watches, whether she gets dessert, [and] when she needs to go to the doctor,\" then I can discern no distinction between \"care\" and \"control.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 158. The Court apparently has the same trouble, which may be why it ultimately condenses the statute's three distinct requirements into a single \"parent-like\n    role\" requirement.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 163. The correct approach is to give all three textual requirements-care, control, and possession-independent meaning by recognizing that the true extent of parents' control over their children extends well beyond the day-to-day matters of childcare to which the Court constricts its analysis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Turning to the facts of this case, the Court points to nothing about Heather's relationship with her Grandparents that amounts to the guidance, governance, and direction typically exercised by parents with their children. Rather than identify particular facts that establish each of the three required elements for standing-care, control, and possession-the Court settles for an amalgam of the three by asking whether Grandparents \"played a parent-like role in Heather's life.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 160. The Court notes several facts about the relationship that supposedly demonstrate Grandparents' \"parent-like role\":\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n    (1) Heather's principal residence was Grandparents' home;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n    (2) Grandparents were her primary caregivers;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n    (3) Grandparents paid for her food, clothes, and daycare, and managed her day-to-day activities;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n    (4) Grandparents took her to urgent care when necessary and took her to the doctor for checkups, though Mother made the check-up appointments; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n    (5) Grandparents kept Mother and Father \"reasonably informed\" about Heather's activities and medical needs and involved them in decisions about her.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9992917\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/807/290/#p294\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The Court concludes from these facts that Grandparents \"played a parent-like role in Heather's life.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9992917\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/807/290/#p294\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    That conclusion fails to appreciate the unique and exclusive nature of the parent-child relationship. But leaving that aside, the statute does not require \"a parent-like role.\" It requires \"actual care, possession, and control.\" Of the five facts identified by the Court, the first concerns possession, and the next two concern care. The fifth actually undercuts the Court's view that Grandparents' exercised control over Heather similar to that typically exercised by parents with their children. Parents typically need not keep anyone else reasonably informed about their children's activities or involve others in decisions about them. Seeking the approval of another adult for a child's medical care and regularly reporting to that person about the child's activities-as Grandparents did here-are not signs of parent-like control. They are signs of its absence. They are signs that control actually lies with the one receiving the reports about the child, not the one making them.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    The fourth fact listed above is the only one that potentially demonstrates Grandparents' \"control.\" But the trial court's several fact-findings concerning Heather's medical care establish that Grandparents did not control this important element of Heather's life with anything resembling the control \"typically exercised by parents.\" The trial court found that \"[Mother] gave [Grandmother] permission to take [Heather] to the doctor,\" that \"[Mother] continued to make certain decisions for [Heather], including certain medical and wellness care,\" that \"[Mother] gave [Grandmother] authorization to obtain certain medical treatment for [Heather]\" but that this \"authorization was only for specific doctor office visits\" or emergencies, and that \"[Grandparents] did not get any type of surgery for [Heather] without [Mother] or [Father]'s consent.\" These fact-findings do not support the conclusion that Grandparents' involvement in Heather's medical care resembled the typical role of parents. Quite to the contrary, Grandparents had to regularly seek and obtain the permission\n    of other adults before obtaining medical care for Heather. Nothing about that arrangement resembles the exclusive control over such decisions typically exercised by parents.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Nor do any of the trial court's other fact-findings support the conclusion that Grandparents' control over Heather was similar to that typically exercised by parents with their children. Throughout Heather's stay at her Grandparents' house, Father and Mother continued to exercise their ultimate power and authority as parents to govern their child. Heather's stay with her Grandparents resulted from an agreement that Father, Mother, and Grandparents reached during a family meeting. Everyone contemplated that the arrangement would be temporary. Mother intended for Heather to return to her upon the completion of her rehabilitation. Mother made many decisions for Heather, including many regarding medical care. Mother and Father both gave their consent for Heather to receive emergency medical care. Healthcare providers continued contacting Father for authorization to render aid to Heather. Grandparents regularly sought input from both Mother and Father regarding decisions that needed to be made for Heather. Heather stayed at Father's house every other weekend, and he saw her more often than that. And in the evenings Mother would go to Grandparents' house and have dinner with Heather, bathe her, spend time with her, and put her to bed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    There is no question that Mother and Father delegated a great deal of their parental responsibilities to Heather's Grandparents. But even applying the Court's definition of \"control,\" these facts cannot support the conclusion that Grandparents exercised the guidance, governance, and direction typically exercised by parents with their children. Instead, the findings of fact support the view that Mother and Father's intentional, thoughtful, temporary delegation of some of their rights to physical possession and care of Heather demonstrated\n    <em>\n     the parents'\n    </em>\n    control over Heather-not control by others.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    I would affirm the court of appeals' decision that \"standing under section 102.003(a)(9) cannot be gained by a nonparent exercising care, control, and possession over a child in the absence of evidence that the child's parent ... has abdicated his or her own ... control ... over the child to the nonparent.\"\n    <em>\n     In re H.S.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657093\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/552/282/#p289\">\n     552 S.W.3d at 289\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204040497\">\n     2016 WL 4040497\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *5.

The existence of parents' \"fundamental liberty interest\" in the care, custody, and control of their children is well-established in the Supreme Court's decisions.

Given the lack of precision in the Court's decisions, it is difficult to state a precedent-based rule distinguishing impermissible government interference with parental prerogatives from permissible government action to protect child welfare.\n    <em>\n     Troxel\n    </em>\n    was a grandparent-access case, like the case before us. The Supreme Court held that \"special weight\" must be afforded to a fit parent's decision whether \"an intergenerational relationship would be beneficial\" to the child.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/#p72\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/#p72\">\n     at 70\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/#p72\">\n     120 S.Ct. 2054\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . But how much \"special weight\"? Under what circumstances can the parents' wishes be second-guessed by the government? Existing precedent does not provide clear answers.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    One potential answer was proffered by Justice Thomas in his concurrence in\n    <em>\n     Troxel\n    </em>\n    : \"I would apply strict scrutiny to infringements of fundamental rights. Here, the State of Washington lacks even a legitimate governmental interest-to say nothing of a compelling one-in second-guessing a fit parent's decision regarding visitation with third parties.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/#p72\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/#p72\">\n     at 80\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/#p72\">\n     120 S.Ct. 2054\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Another potential answer is that proffered by the court of appeals, which interpreted\n    <em>\n     Troxel\n    </em>\n    to flatly prohibit nonparent standing \"while a fit parent is appropriately exercising his or her own parental rights.\"\n    <em>\n     In re H.S.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657093\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/552/282/#p289\">\n     552 S.W.3d at 290\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204040497\">\n     2016 WL 4040497\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *5.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Yet another approach is that taken by the Court today. The Court's discussion of the constitutional issues assumes that the\n    <em>\n     Troxel\n    </em>\n    plurality opinion defines the outer limits of the Constitution's protections for parents in custody cases. The Court brushes aside the constitutional concerns raised by Mother, Father, and the court of appeals because the Washington statute that\n    <em>\n     Troxel\n    </em>\n    invalidated allowed more expansive non-parent standing than Texas's statute. That is true. I agree with the Court that the reasoning of the plurality opinion in\n    <em>\n     Troxel\n    </em>\n    does not\n    <em>\n     compel\n    </em>\n    the conclusion that section 102.003(a)(9) as the Court interprets it is unconstitutional. The court of appeals' view that any judicial interference with the decisions of fit parents violates\n    <em>\n     Troxel\n    </em>\n    probably stretches\n    <em>\n     Troxel\n    </em>\n    beyond the plurality's reasoning. But saying a statute does not run afoul of\n    <em>\n     Troxel\n    </em>\n    is not the same thing as saying the statute is constitutional. As a matter of first impression, the rule announced by the court of appeals-that fit parents cannot be haled into court by non-parents to defend their decisions about the upbringing of their children-is certainly one plausible consequence of the Supreme Court's recognition of a \"fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.\"\n    <em>\n     Troxel\n    </em>\n    does not tell us exactly where the line is between constitutional and unconstitutional government interference with the rights of fit parents. In this case and thousands of others like it in our family courts, parents' fundamental rights are at stake. We should not assume, as the Court does, that placing additional burdens on those rights has no constitutional significance just because the\n    <em>\n     Troxel\n    </em>\n    plurality opinion does not prohibit it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    The Court downplays the significance of this case because the issue before us is who has standing to bring a suit affecting the parent-child relationship, not the merits of whether the suit should succeed. But when the constitutional concern is preservation of the parents' right to be the ultimate decision-makers for their child, the distinction between standing and the merits evaporates. Once a custody or visitation case gets through the courthouse doors, a judge or group of judges-not the parents-will ultimately decide whether to uphold or reverse the parents' decisions about their child's future. \"Our system must confront more often the reality that litigation can itself be so disruptive that constitutional protection may be required.\"\n    <em>\n     Troxel\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/#p72\">\n     530 U.S. at 101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/#p72\">\n     120 S.Ct. 2054\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Kennedy, J., dissenting). As a majority of the Supreme Court recognized in\n    <em>\n     Troxel\n    </em>\n    , \"the burden of litigating a domestic relations proceeding can itself be 'so disruptive of the parent-child relationship that the constitutional right of a custodial parent to make certain basic determinations for the child's welfare becomes implicated.' \"\n    <em>\n     Troxel\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/#p72\">\n     530 U.S. at 75\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/#p72\">\n     120 S.Ct. 2054\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/#p72\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/#p72\">\n     at 101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/#p72\">\n     120 S.Ct. 2054\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Kennedy,\n    J., dissenting) ). No matter the presumptions or legal standards applied at the merits stage, giving a judge the power to review a parent's decisions about the extent to which non-parents should be involved in a child's life undermines the parents' role as the ultimate decision-makers for their child. This is unquestionably necessary in some cases for the protection of children whose parents would harm them. But for fit parents, true control of their children is an illusion if the courts really get to make the final call.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    The Court correctly points out that the Family Code puts a thumb on the scale for parents at the merits stage by establishing a presumption that appointing the parents as managing conservators is in the child's best interest unless the appointment \"would significantly impair the child's physical health or emotional development.\" TEX. FAM. CODE \u00a7 153.131(a). Although this presumption affords important protection to parents, it does not change the fact that once standing is established, the final decision about the child's future will be made by a judge or jury, not the child's parents. Under the U.S. Supreme Court's decisions, such government usurpation of parental authority raises serious constitutional questions. We could have and should have avoided those questions by faithfully enforcing the \"actual control\" requirement of the text of section 102.003(a)(9).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    * * *\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    The U.S. Supreme Court's decision to recognize the constitutional rights of parents through the questionable mechanism of substantive due process attracts its share of second-guesses.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Troxel\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/#p72\">\n     530 U.S. at 80\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/#p72\">\n     120 S.Ct. 2054\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Thomas, J., concurring) (suggesting that the Privileges and Immunities Clause may be the more appropriate place to look); Daniel E.

Far from it. The best reading of the text of section 102.003(a)(9) requires a child's parents to relinquish or shirk their \"actual control\" of the child before a non-parent may assert the \"actual control\" required for standing. The Court need not proceed any further to resolve this case. But even if the interpretation of section 102.003(a)(9) adopted by\n    the Court today were equally persuasive-that is, even if the statute's text supported two equally plausible readings-we should prefer the interpretation that avoids constitutional questions like those at stake here. We should likewise prefer the interpretation, as between two equally plausible interpretations, that better accommodates the unalienable rights proclaimed by the Declaration of Independence and retained by the people under the Ninth Amendment. In this case, the interpretation that avoids burdening parents' rights is also the textually superior interpretation, which makes the correct outcome doubly clear.
