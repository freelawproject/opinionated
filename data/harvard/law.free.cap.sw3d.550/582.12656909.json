In his sole\n   point on appeal, Father claims the trial court erred because the facts do not satisfy the statutory requirements for termination of parental rights and the best interest determination. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum has been provided to the parties. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
