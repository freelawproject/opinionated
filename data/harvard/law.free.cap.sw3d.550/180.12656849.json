Based on his efforts in this regard, Appellant was charged with and convicted of two crimes: attempted capital murder and criminal solicitation of capital murder. The court of appeals found that Appellant's convictions on both charges violated the Double Jeopardy Clause's prohibition against multiple punishments for the \"same offense.\" The court, deeming criminal solicitation the \"most serious\" offense, upheld that conviction and vacated the conviction for attempted capital murder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree with the court of appeals that conviction for these two offenses violated double jeopardy, but disagree with the court of appeals that these offenses each required proof of a different element. Applying the cognate-pleadings test we determine that the elements of the offense of attempted capital murder are functionally equivalent to the elements of solicitation of capital murder. We affirm the court of appeals because we agree that criminal solicitation was the most serious offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Appellant and Mickey Westerman grew up in Brownwood and met in junior high. They played sports together and were friends. In 2005, they worked together in the Irving area, and Westerman lived on Appellant's property. Westerman got to know Lori, Appellant's wife. He also met Lori's parents, Gale and Hugh Box, and her brother, Koh Box. Westerman moved back to Brownwood that summer. Between 2005 and 2012 Westerman and Appellant talked on the phone five or six times. Appellant would call Westerman \"out of the blue and he would have some big idea, going to make a million dollars, you know.\" Westerman said that \"receiving a phone call from him, wasn't a surprise. It was, like, just like anybody; here is an old friend calling, you know.\" But in 2012 Appellant made a different and surprising kind of call: he \"told me that he wanted to-the way I understood it from the first phone call, I was gathering that he wanted to have Lori killed.\" Westerman, encouraged by a friend to \"do the right thing,\" called Lori, who was by then Appellant's\n   ex-wife, and told her \"Michael called and-and-and I believe that he is wanting to have you killed. And I don't know how to go about it, so, you need to get with somebody in Pecos and find out what we need to do to-to check this out.\" Lori notified the Pecos Police, and Chief Clay McKinney shortly contacted Westerman. Westerman told Chief McKinney that he was going to contact Appellant in a few days to make sure he was not just angry and talking \"outside of his head.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   That wasn't the case. Instead, Appellant made it clear that he wasn't talking about Lori; he was talking about Mr. and Mrs. Box, Gale and Hugh. At this point Texas Ranger Danny Briley began working with Westerman and monitoring his communications with Appellant. Discussion stopped when Appellant was sent to jail for about six months. But when he was released from jail, Appellant called Westerman and again talked about hiring a hit man. A series of meetings took place-all in a Walmart parking lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The first was between Appellant and Westerman on the 27th of November. A friend of Appellant's drove him to the Walmart. Appellant alone got out of his friend's car and got into the passenger side of the undercover vehicle that had been provided to Westerman. The vehicle had been rigged with recording devices. Appellant told Westerman he wanted to kill a member of Lori's family as \"fucking flat-ass revenge.\" He now wanted that member to be Lori's brother Koh Box though \"Koh Box never done me no wrong.\" Appellant told Westerman how he could get the money to pay for the \"hit\"; he would sell his property or his guns or \"cook dope\"-something he had learned in jail. \"He had all kinds of ways to try to come up with money.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The next meeting was on December 1st. This meeting was between Appellant and Stephen Reynolds, an agent with the Texas Department of Public Safety who posed as a \"hit man.\" This time Westerman drove Appellant to the Walmart, where Appellant alone got out of Westerman's vehicle and into Reynolds's rigged vehicle. Appellant began by asking the agent to kill Koh Box. Reynolds quoted Appellant a $10,000 price for the hit and said that he would need \"some operating funds\" up front. Appellant was empty-handed, but he told Reynolds he could come up with some money in about a week. Appellant then went ahead and described Box and his vehicles and business, and drew a map to Box's house. Appellant pressed that he wanted the hit to look like a robbery. Back in Westerman's vehicle on the ride home, Appellant asked for a loan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The third meeting took place on December 7th, and it is the focus of the indictments in this case. This meeting was between Appellant and the \"hit man\" Reynolds. Again, Westerman drove Appellant to the Walmart. At the direction of the Rangers, he loaned Appellant $1,000. At the Walmart, Appellant got out of Westerman's vehicle and into Reynolds's vehicle, while Westerman himself went into the Walmart. Appellant gave the $1,000 to Reynolds. After Appellant gave the partial payment to Reynolds, he was arrested and charged with solicitation of capital murder and attempted capital murder. A jury convicted Appellant of both offenses and assessed Appellant's punishment for each offense at confinement for life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On appeal, Appellant argued that the trial court erred when it authorized the jury to return multiple verdicts for the same offense. Based on its application of\n   <em>\n    Blockburger\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ervin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court of appeals agreed. Deeming both offenses, as charged, conduct-oriented, the court held that Appellant's double jeopardy rights were violated when he was punished for both solicitation and attempt for the same conduct-employment of Stephen Reynolds to kill Koh Box.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court upheld the solicitation conviction and vacated the attempt conviction, figuring that, as a 3g crime, solicitation to commit capital murder was the most serious offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We granted review of the court's holdings that 1) Appellant's convictions on both charges violated double jeopardy, and 2) the remedy for the double jeopardy violation was to affirm the solicitation conviction and vacate the attempt conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Multiple Punishments for the Same Offense\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Fifth Amendment offers protection against multiple punishments for the \"same offense.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   To determine whether there have been multiple punishments for the same offense, we begin by applying the \"same elements\" test set forth in\n   <em>\n    Blockburger\n   </em>\n   . Under that test, two offenses are not the same if \"each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Texas, we look to the pleadings to inform the\n   <em>\n    Blockburger\n   </em>\n   test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the two offenses have the same elements under the cognate-pleadings approach, then a judicial presumption arises that the offenses are the same for purposes of double jeopardy and the defendant may not be convicted of both offenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   That presumption can be rebutted by a clearly expressed legislative intent to create two separate offenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Conversely, if the two\n   offenses, as pleaded, have different elements under the\n   <em>\n    Blockburger\n   </em>\n   test, the judicial presumption is that the offenses are different for double-jeopardy purposes and multiple punishments may be imposed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   This presumption can be rebutted by a showing, through various factors, that the legislature clearly intended only one punishment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Under the Cognate-Pleadings Approach, the Elements of Solicitation of Capital Murder are Subsumed Within The Elements of Attempted Capital Murder\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In this case Appellant hired Reynolds to kill Box. This was alleged as the conduct comprising violations of two separate statutes: criminal solicitation and criminal attempt. According to the court of appeals, these two charged offenses were not the same under the\n   <em>\n    Blockburger\n   </em>\n   test because one offense required proof of an element that another does not. As set out by the court of appeals, the allegations in the indictment for criminal solicitation to commit capital murder are:\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    <em>\n     Bien v.

This was the same act alleged in the criminal solicitation indictment. To the extent that criminal attempt required a showing of an employment agreement, the act of soliciting that employment in the criminal solicitation indictment was subsumed within the elements necessary to prove criminal attempt under these indictments.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Similarly, both indictments required proof of the intent to commit the offense of capital murder. Criminal solicitation carries with it the requirement that the State prove Appellant believed the conduct he was soliciting would constitute capital murder. Under the pleadings in this case, the State was required to prove that Appellant believed the conduct he was soliciting constituted capital murder. But this element was also subsumed within the greater proof in both offenses that Appellant intended that Reynolds commit capital murder. In this regard the \"belief in the circumstances surrounding the conduct\" aspect of criminal solicitation is the functional equivalent of the intent to commit capital murder in attempted capital murder.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Finally, the criminal solicitation indictment also required proof that, under the circumstances as Appellant believed them to be, the conduct solicited actually would constitute capital murder.\n    <footnotemark>\n     23\n    </footnotemark>\n    Arguably, this would require the State to prove that the offense solicited was not legally impossible, as the statute could be read to require proof of what the actor intends, but also proof that the circumstances surrounding the conduct the actor intends actually constitutes a criminal offense.\n    <footnotemark>\n     24\n    </footnotemark>\n    As we have explained, legal impossibility exists where the act, if completed, would not be a crime, although what the actor intends to accomplish would be a crime.\n    <footnotemark>\n     25\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Nevertheless, it has been previously argued that the doctrine of impossibility should not be a defense under the Texas Penal Code.\n    <footnotemark>\n     26\n    </footnotemark>\n    And though we have recognized that the common-law defense of legal impossibility is valid defense, we do not appear to have ever applied it.\n    <footnotemark>\n     27\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    A natural reading of the text leads us to the conclusion that the State proves the offense of criminal solicitation by proving what a defendant believes the circumstances to be surrounding the solicited conduct and that such conduct would be a crime under those circumstances. The statute does not require the State to prove that those circumstances actually exist. We hold that this element of criminal solicitation was also subsumed within the proof necessary to establish the intent to commit capital murder under the attempted capital murder indictment. Consequently, we reject the court of appeals' determination that under the pleadings in this case, attempted capital murder and solicitation of capital murder were not the same offense under\n    <em>\n     Blockburger\n    </em>\n    .\n    <footnotemark>\n     28\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    <strong>\n     IV.

The Appropriate Remedy is to Vacate the Conviction the State Chooses\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    When a defendant is convicted in a single criminal trial of two offenses that are considered the same for double jeopardy purposes, the remedy is to vacate one of the convictions. In\n    <em>\n     Landers v.

State\n    </em>\n    , we revived parole eligibility as a factor by retaining the one conviction which included a deadly weapon finding.\n    <footnotemark>\n     40\n    </footnotemark>\n    Other tie breakers that have been used in the past include degree of felony,\n    <footnotemark>\n     41\n    </footnotemark>\n    first-indicted,\n    <footnotemark>\n     42\n    </footnotemark>\n    and offense named first in the judgment.\n    <footnotemark>\n     43\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Almaguer v.

Making the matter a function of prosecutorial discretion seems to be most consistent with our prior recognition that a prosecutor in this type of situation is entitled to \"submit both offenses to the jury for consideration\" and receive \"the benefit of the most serious punishment obtained.\" If a subjective decision is to be made, let the local prosecutor who exercised the decision to bring the case make\n    it.\n    <footnotemark>\n     45\n    </footnotemark>\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    We here do likewise-this is a question to be answered by the prosecutor. Here, the prosecutor has requested that the 3g offense-the criminal solicitation conviction-be retained. This is the offense that was upheld by the court of appeals. We affirm the court of appeals' judgment in whole.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Yeary, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      DISSENTING OPINION\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    When the same act or conduct violates more than one statutorily defined penal offense, in order to determine whether punishment for both statutorily defined offenses violates double jeopardy, we have said that an \"elements\" analysis is appropriate.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    This is the so-called\n    <em>\n     Blockburger\n    </em>\n    /cognate-pleadings approach to double jeopardy analysis, upon which we expounded at length several years back in\n    <em>\n     Ex parte Benson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6874022\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/459/67/#p72\">\n     459 S.W.3d 67\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 72 (Tex. Crim. App. 2015). In this case, both indictments alleged that, \"on or about the 7\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    day of December, 2012,\" Appellant committed certain conduct in recruiting Stephen Reynolds to commit murder for remuneration. Thus, on their faces, the indictments\n    <em>\n     seem\n    </em>\n    to allege that the same act or conduct simultaneously violated both the Penal Code proscription against criminal solicitation of capital murder and the separate Penal Code proscription against criminal attempt to commit capital murder.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    It is therefore understandable that both the court of appeals,\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    and now this Court,\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    have approached the question as simply a matter of whether, under\n    <em>\n     Benson\n    </em>\n    's \"elements\" approach, Appellant could be punished for both of these statutorily defined offenses without violating double jeopardy protections.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    But the double jeopardy analysis in this case does not end there. Here, the evidence shows that Appellant engaged in conduct on\n    <em>\n     two\n    </em>\n    discrete occasions whereby he approached Stephen Reynolds in an attempt to engage him to commit murder for remuneration: first on December 1, 2012 (which was \"on or about the 7\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    of December, 2012\"),\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    and then again on December 7, 2012. It is at least arguable that the double jeopardy issue in this case is not fully governed by the\n    <em>\n     Blockburger\n    </em>\n    /cognate pleadings \"elements\" approach; that there is a \"units of prosecution\" component to the double jeopardy analysis that must be addressed as well.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    \"When two distinct\n    statutory provisions are at issue, the offenses must be considered the same under both an 'elements' analysis and a 'units [of prosecution]' analysis for a double jeopardy violation to occur.\"\n    <em>\n     Benson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6874022\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/459/67/#p72\">\n     459 S.W.3d at 71\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . A jury in this case might rationally have found that Appellant committed criminal solicitation of capital murder, during his December 1st meeting with Reynolds, and also that he separately committed the offense of attempted capital murder when, on December 7th, he made a down payment for services rendered and obtained a commitment from Reynolds to carry out the offense. I do not think the double jeopardy issue is fully resolved until this possibility is explored.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    For that reason, the Court errs to affirm the judgment of the court of appeals on an \"elements\" analysis alone. I would remand the cause for the court of appeals to conduct a \"units of prosecution\" analysis. Because the parties have yet to brief that facet of the double jeopardy analysis, I would invite the court of appeals to solicit additional briefing. Instead, the Court simply affirms the lower court's judgment, to which I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"15\">\n    <p id=\"p-83\">\n     <em>\n      Bien\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386230\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/530/177/#p183\">\n      530 S.W.3d at 181\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"16\">\n    <p id=\"p-84\">\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8461186\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/203/333/#p338\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"17\">\n    <p id=\"p-85\">\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386230\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/530/177/#p183\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386230\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/530/177/#p183\">\n      at 181-82\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"18\">\n    <p id=\"p-86\">\n     Tex.
