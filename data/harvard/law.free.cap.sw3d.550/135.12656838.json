He argues that the judgment was the result of actions by opposing counsel that constituted fraud upon the court. Finding no error, we affirm. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum of law has been provided to the parties. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
