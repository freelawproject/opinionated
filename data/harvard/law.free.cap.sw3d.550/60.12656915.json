He contends that the Commonwealth failed in its burden to prove that the weapon was concealed. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Sykes was arrested by Lexington Police Officer Blake Leathers on May 7, 2016, and charged with carrying a concealed deadly weapon, trafficking in marijuana less than 8 ounces second offense, resisting arrest, and possession of drug paraphernalia. The officer described the circumstances preceding the arrest as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   Officers were dispatched to listed area [Robertson Street at Speigle Street] in reference to a shots fired call. On arrival I observed the listed vehicle [a 2009 white Impala] running on the side of the road. I approached the vehicle &amp; the subj rolled down the window &amp; I smelled a very strong odor of burnt marijuana coming from inside the vehicle. I ordered the subj out of the vehicle. Once out of the vehicle the subject\n   raised his arms &amp; ofcs observed a concealed firearm in his waistband. While attempting to arrest the subj he began resisting &amp; pulling away. Ofcs searched the veh. and located approximately 3.273 ounces of susp marijuana. Ofcs also located a cigarillo &amp; a blunt roller. An additional firearm was located in the trunk. Subj had over $3,000 in cash on his person &amp; the marijuana was in industrial sealed packaging.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Fayette County grand jury indicted him on the same charges in a four-count indictment in August 2016, and Sykes entered a plea of not guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The matter was tried before a jury in March 2017. Detective Leathers of the Lexington Police Department testified that in May 2016, he was serving as a patrol officer on the west side of Lexington in the Versailles Road area. On the evening of May 7, 2016, he was dispatched with his beat partner, Officer (now Detective) Matt Laney, to 400 Robertson Street. He described seeing and approaching Sykes' vehicle, his attempts to get Sykes' attention, the marijuana odor emanating from the vehicle once Sykes opened the window, and getting Sykes to exit the vehicle. Once he exited the vehicle, Sykes became angry and started yelling. Sykes raised both of his hands in the air, at which time Detective Laney observed a firearm in his waistband and reached out to retrieve it. Later, Detective Leathers confirmed that \"once his shirt came up over the gun,\" the firearm became apparent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Detective Leathers grabbed Sykes' hands to handcuff him, and Sykes began to resist. Sykes was not compliant as they were trying to handcuff him and retrieve the firearm. Once the firearm was secured, and the officers had handcuffed Sykes, they informed Sykes of his rights and performed a search. Detective Leathers found in excess of $3,000.00 in cash in different denominations in Sykes' pocket. The semi-automatic handgun the officers retrieved from Sykes' waistband had nine live rounds in it, with one in the chamber. Other items Detective Leathers seized included multiple cell phones, suspected marijuana, a blunt, and a cigarillo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Detective Laney testified in conformity with Detective Leathers' version of the events. He saw the firearm in Sykes' waistband when he raised his second arm after he had exited the car (he was still talking on his cell phone with his other hand). Detective Laney immediately retrieved the weapon and removed the ammunition, and he seized several items of evidence from his search of the interior and trunk of Sykes' vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the conclusion of the testimony, the court denied Sykes' motion for a directed verdict, and the matter proceeded to the jury after closing arguments. The jury returned a verdict finding Sykes guilty of carrying a concealed deadly weapon under Count 2, not guilty of resisting arrest under Count 3, and guilty of possession of drug paraphernalia under Count 4. The jury was hung on the trafficking in marijuana charge under Count 1, and the parties reached an agreement related to that charge. Pursuant to that agreement, Sykes moved to enter an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   on an amended charge of criminal attempt to trafficking in marijuana, less than 8 ounces, second offense. Sykes waived sentencing by the jury, and the court fixed his sentences at twelve months on Counts 1 and 2, and seven days on Count 4. The court ordered the forfeiture of items seized. By agreement of the parties, the forfeited items included the firearms, ammunition, drugs, and drug paraphernalia. The cash was to be returned to Sykes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The court held a sentencing hearing the following month and entered a final judgment and sentence of probation on May 2, 2017. The court imposed a twelve-month concurrent sentence for the charges on which Sykes was convicted and placed him on probation for two years subject to several conditions. This appeal now follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On appeal, Sykes seeks review of the circuit court's denial of his directed verdict motion on the charge of carrying a concealed deadly weapon.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   On motion for directed verdict, the trial court must draw all fair and reasonable inferences from the evidence in favor of the Commonwealth. If the evidence is sufficient to induce a reasonable juror to believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty, a directed verdict should not be given. For the purpose of ruling on the motion, the trial court must assume that the evidence for the Commonwealth is true, but reserving to the jury questions as to the credibility and weight to be given to such testimony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   On appellate review, the test of a directed verdict is, if under the evidence as a whole, it would be clearly unreasonable for a jury to find guilt, only then the defendant is entitled to a directed verdict of acquittal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Perdue v.

He therefore seeks palpable error review pursuant to Kentucky Rules of Criminal Procedure (RCr) 10.26 to the extent the issue is not preserved. In\n   <em>\n    Schoenbachler v.

Precedent consistently indicates that the Commonwealth's evidentiary burden on concealment is low. If the evidence permits a reasonable jury to infer that the firearm was concealed at any point, then the Commonwealth has met its evidentiary burden to have the matter submitted to the jury.\n   <em>\n    Delk v.

Whether the defendant intended to conceal the weapon is completely irrelevant.\n   <em>\n    Hall v.

However, our review of the testimony in question establishes that Sykes has omitted important details from his brief. Namely, both officers testified that the firearm was under his shirt and was not visible until Sykes held his arms up after he had exited the vehicle. Neither officer saw the firearm when Sykes got out of the vehicle; rather, it was not until his shirt was raised that the officers were able to see it tucked into the waistband of his pants. Whether the firearm was concealed in this case was certainly a factual question for the jury to decide.\n   <em>\n    Shoupe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=202%20S.W.2d%20369\">\n    202 S.W.2d at 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
