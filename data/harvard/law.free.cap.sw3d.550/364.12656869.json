R. App. P. 38.1(f) (\"The brief must state concisely all issues or points presented for review. The statement of an issue or point will be treated as covering every subsidiary question that is fairly included.\");\n   <em>\n    Wolfe v.

App. 2017). Accordingly, I would address that issue rather than decide, as the majority does, appellant was found in a suspicious place. And although the majority ultimately concludes the trial court did not err in failing to give the requested question, it repeatedly states it is not deciding that question, clouding its decision. Ultimately, the majority does not determine whether an article 38.23 instruction was warranted. Because it was not, I concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Article 38.23 requires the trial court to exclude any evidence that it finds, as a matter of law, was obtained in violation of state or federal law. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 38.23. Further, article 38.23 mandates the jury be instructed that if it believes, or has a reasonable doubt, that the evidence was illegally obtained it is to disregard any such evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id.;\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cummings v.

App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2011, pet. ref'd). Such an instruction is only required if \"there is a genuine dispute about a material fact that is essential to deciding the lawfulness of the challenged conduct in obtaining the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7092254\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/401/127/#p128\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 130 (citing\n   <em>\n    Madden v.

Crim. Proc. Code \u00a7 14.03. However, appellant has not identified any factual dispute. Appellant challenges his arrest on legal, not factual, grounds that the evidence failed to show he was in a suspicious place. This is not a \"conflict concerning [a] specific historical fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Holmes v.

If the question is only one of law, or there is no affirmative evidence that raises a contested fact issue, there is nothing to instruct the jury about.\n   <em>\n    Id.; see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cummings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7092254\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/401/127/#p128\">\n    401 S.W.3d at 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The record contains no conflicting evidence about the place where appellant was arrested.
