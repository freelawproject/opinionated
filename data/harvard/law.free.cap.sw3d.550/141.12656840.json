Wilhite argues that the trial court erred in finding him guilty because there was insufficient evidence to establish a temporal connection between him operating the vehicle and his being intoxicated.

Following a bench trial he was found guilty of the charge of driving while intoxicated and found not guilty of the three counts of kidnapping.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 25, 2015, at about 10:15 p.m., Tracy Anderson (\"Tracy\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and her son, Dustin Anderson (\"Dustin\"), were taking Dustin's fianc\u00e9, Samantha Clemens (\"Clemens\"), to work. They came upon a pick-up truck nose first in a ditch with the back of the truck partially blocking one lane of the roadway. The road did not have a shoulder at this location. The truck lights were on and the driver's side door was open. They pulled over, and Tracy and Dustin got out of their vehicle to see if anyone needed help. They did not initially\n   observe anyone. When they started to leave they heard shouting coming from behind them. Further up the road from the truck they saw Wilhite attempting to crawl out of the ditch. Wilhite appeared intoxicated. He was stumbling, he needed help getting out of the ditch, his speech was slurred, and he had an odor like beer. Tracy and Dustin asked if Wilhite was okay and if anyone else was with him. Wilhite said that he was not hurt and nobody else was with him. Wilhite walked over to Tracy's vehicle and got in the passenger's side without asking permission. Wilhite refused to get out of the vehicle and repeatedly demanded that they drive him home. They finally agreed to give him a ride to his home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   When they got to Wilhite's house, Wilhite stumbled and fell to one knee trying to get out of the Suburban. Dustin helped Wilhite up the stairs to the mobile home, opened the front door, and sat him down on a chair inside. Wilhite asked them to retrieve his truck, even offering to pay them, but they refused. Once they left Wilhite's house, Tracy called 911 and they went back to the accident site and talked with highway patrol officer, Trooper Grant Johnson (\"Trooper Johnson\"), who had responded to the crash scene in response to Tracy's 911 call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Trooper Johnson was dispatched to the scene at 10:42 p.m. and arrived at the scene at 10:50 p.m. There was no one at the scene when he arrived. Trooper Johnson found a partially consumed bottle of beer in the center console of the truck and two empty beer bottles on the passenger side floorboard. Tracy, Dustin, and Clemens arrived at the scene and told Trooper Johnson about their earlier interaction with Wilhite and gave Trooper Johnson Wilhite's address. Based on a photograph from the Department of Revenue, Tracy, Dustin and Clemens identified Wilhite as the person they had seen at the scene earlier that evening.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Trooper Johnson and another trooper went to Wilhite's home. Wilhite's fianc\u00e9, Phyllis Ward (\"Ward\") answered the door and stated Wilhite was home. She went back inside the home and came back with Wilhite. When Trooper Johnson made contact with Wilhite, he appeared very impaired and unable to stand. Trooper Johnson asked Wilhite to sit on the steps because he was very unsteady. Wilhite denied being in a crash, drinking any intoxicants that day, or meeting Tracy, Dustin, and Clemens that evening. He said that Ward had been driving. Trooper Johnson was unable to perform the horizontal gaze nystagmus test because Wilhite failed to cooperate and follow the instructions. Trooper Johnson did not request Wilhite perform the walk-and-turn or one-leg stand tests because of Wilhite's inability to maintain a standing position. Wilhite was arrested at 11:40 p.m. and transported to the hospital due to concerns about the level of alcohol in his system. Wilhite refused to provide a blood sample. Trooper Johnson obtained a warrant to draw a sample of Wilhite's blood. The blood draw occurred at 2:47 a.m. The test determined that his blood alcohol level was .129 at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A bench trial was held on August 24, 2016. Wilhite was found guilty of driving while intoxicated as a prior and persistent offender but acquitted of the remaining charges of kidnapping. He was sentenced to eight years in prison. This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence in a court-tried criminal case, the same standard is applied as in jury tried case.

In his sole point on appeal, Wilhite argues that there is insufficient evidence to convict him of driving while intoxicated because the evidence failed to establish a temporal connection between Wilhite's alleged operation of a motor vehicle and his intoxication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"The offense of driving while intoxicated, section 577.010.1, requires proof of two elements: (1) that the defendant operated a motor vehicle, and (2) was intoxicated while doing so.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. W.D. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Wilhite begins by arguing that there was insufficient evidence to prove that he operated a motor vehicle because no one witnessed him actually driving the truck. However, Wilhite was the only one at the accident scene on the side of a rural roadway and told Tracy that he was the only one in the vehicle. Based on these facts, the trial court could have reasonably inferred he was operating the truck at the time of the accident. There was sufficient circumstantial evidence to establish that he operated the vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Ward was present in the trailer for at least a portion of that time and testified at trial, but the State never inquired as to whether or not Wilhite had access to or consumed any alcohol during that time period. Wilhite was at home for a significant amount of time, giving him ample opportunity to consume alcohol after he drove the truck but prior to his first contact with Trooper Johnson and getting his blood drawn at least three hours later. There was no evidence to establish a correlation between the blood alcohol content reflected in the blood test result and Wilhite's blood alcohol content at the unknown time he last operated the vehicle.

They gave extensive testimony as to their observations of Wilhite's conduct and appearance, which would support a fact finder's determination that Wilhite was intoxicated when they first came in contact with him when he came out of the ditch near the scene of the accident. However, this too is not dispositive of the issues in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   There was no evidence presented as to how long after the accident Tracy and her family came into contact with Wilhite.
