Bazell\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12182019\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/497/263/\">\n    497 S.W.3d 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. banc 2016).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The motion court denied that request, finding that Movant was not entitled to the retroactive application of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bazell\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . Movant appeals that ruling in one point, claiming his conviction and seven-year sentence\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   exceeds the maximum sentence authorized by law, in that under the holding of\n   <em>\n    State v. Bazell\n   </em>\n   , 496 [sic] S.W.3d 263 (Mo. banc 2016), [Movant's] sentence should not have been enhanced to a class C felony but should have instead remained a class A misdemeanor; therefore, under Section 558.011, the maximum possible punishment was one year imprisonment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Our supreme court has repeatedly held that \"the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bazell\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   holding only applies forward, except those cases pending on direct appeal.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State ex rel.

Our Western District recently rejected the same point and supporting arguments as those raised here (asserted by the same appellate counsel) in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Watson v.

We concur in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Watson\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   's reasoning, reject Movant's point accordingly, and affirm the order denying Rule 24.035 relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   GARY W. LYNCH, J.-CONCURS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   DON E. BURRELL, J.-CONCURS\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    Rule references are to Missouri Court Rules (2017). This Court has validated the timeliness of Movant's post-conviction motions. Because Movant did not file a direct appeal, his\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    motion was due within 180 days of the date he was delivered to DOC custody.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Rule 24.035(b). Movant was delivered to DOC on April 26, 2016, and his\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    motion was filed on September 23, 2016-well within 180 days. The amended motion had to be filed within 60 days of the date both a complete transcript consisting of the guilty plea and sentencing hearing was filed in the trial court and counsel was appointed.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Rule 24.035(g). The public defender was appointed to represent Movant the same day he filed his\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    motion, and the transcript was filed on March 15, 2017. Movant's amended motion was timely filed less than 60 days later on May 11, 2017.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    Movant pleaded guilty in 2011, and his sentence was imposed in 2013.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    To be clear, strictly speaking, Rule 24.035 was a proper procedural vehicle by which Movant could raise a claim that his sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Rule 24.035(a). But Movant's specific claim here-that he may successfully assert a\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Bazell\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    challenge in a timely Rule 24.035 motion-\"erroneously conflates procedural cognizability with substantive merit.\"\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Watson\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656378\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/545/909/#p913\">\n     545 S.W.3d at 915\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Procedurally, Movant could bring his claim pursuant to Rule 24.035; substantively, his claim is without merit as a matter of law.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
