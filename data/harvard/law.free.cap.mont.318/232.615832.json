Skylar\u2019s resulting major medical problems and treatments have been complicated and painful. While his father, Gerald Wages (Wages), did not witness the accident, he has taken an extremely active role in Skylar\u2019s medical treatment. Wages sued Pegar and Pegar\u2019s automobile liability insurer, First National Insurance Company of America (FNIC), claiming that he has sustained severe emotional distress as a result of Pegar\u2019s negligent operation of his vehicle. Both Wages and FNIC filed motions for summary judgment. The District Court denied Wages\u2019 motion and granted FNIC\u2019s motion. Wages appeals. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">\u00b62 The only issue before this Court is whether the parent of a minor child who does not witness an accident, wherein the child is seriously injured, is entitled to maintain an independent, non-derivative claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">\u00b63 On January 5, 2000, while seven-year old Skylar was rollerblading in front of his parents\u2019 mobile home, Phillip Pegar drove through the mobile home park and struck Skylar, causing serious injury. Skylar\u2019s mother, who was home at the time, ran to the scene and removed Skylar from under Pegar\u2019s truck. An ambulance arrived and took Skylar and his mother to the hospital. Wages was notified of the accident by telephone and left work, rushing to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\u00b64 Skylar experienced bilateral pelvic fractures and complete urethral disruption. He has undergone at least four major, invasive and expensive surgical procedures since January 5, 2000, as well as considerable physical therapy. Due to the extensive nature of Skylar\u2019s urethra injury and the failure of surgery to correct the problem, Wages has had to catherize his son between three and four times per day with a large catheter tube. To adequately provide care for his son, including taking him to the children\u2019s hospital in Salt Lake City on several occasions for surgery and treatment, Wages has missed substantial time at work. As a result, he has lost income while at the same time his financial obligations for medical expenses have risen dramatically.</p>\n<p id=\"APn\">\u00b65 Skylar\u2019s prognosis remains unclear. He is behind in his education due to the accident and his ongoing medical treatment. His parents have noticed a distinct change in his personality. Moreover, the prospect of his future ability to participate in physical activities is questionable as is his ability to have children.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\u00b66 On the date of Skylar\u2019s accident, Pegar was insured by FNIC. Pegar had $25,000/$50,000 liability coverage. Skylar, through a court-appointed guardian and conservator, settled his claim for the policy limits of $25,000. Wages subsequently submitted a claim to FNIC for $25,000 to settle his independent claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED). FNIC denied the claim, maintaining that under state law Wages could not sustain an independent, non-derivative claim for NIED without having witnessed the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">\u00b67 On June 29, 2001, Wages filed suit for declaratory relief against FNIC, seeking a determination that FNIC must indemnify Pegar pursuant to Pegar\u2019s liability policy with FNIC. Wages claimed that a parent of a minor child need not witness an accident in order to maintain an independent claim for NIED. While the declaratory proceeding was pending, Pegar stipulated to a consent judgment in favor of Wages in the sum of $150,000. In return, Wages agreed not to execute against Pegar\u2019s assets. Pegar also assigned any of his rights as against FNIC to Wages. The District Court entered this consent judgment in favor of Wages and against Pegar in the sum of $150,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>on November 20, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">\u00b68 Both Wages and FNIC subsequently filed motions for summary judgment. A hearing was held on June 28,2002. On July 23,2002, the District Court denied Wages\u2019 motion for summary judgment and granted FNIC\u2019s motion. The court subsequently entered Judgment dismissing Wages\u2019 complaint and ordered Wages to pay FNIC\u2019s costs of defense with ten-percent interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">\u00b69 Our review of a summary judgment order is <em>de novo. </em>Summary judgment is proper only when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P. The initial burden is on the moving party to establish that there is no genuine issue of material fact; and once met, the burden shifts to the party opposing the motion to establish otherwise. <em>Sacco v. High Country Independent Press </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 209, 215, 896 P.2d 411, 415. Once the court determines that genuine issues of fact do not exist, \u201cthe court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d We review this legal conclusion to determine whether the court erred. <em>Treichel v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. </em>(1997), 280 Mont. 443, 446, 930 P.2d 661, 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">\u00b610 The issue before this Court is whether Wages, as the father of a minor child who did not witness the accident that resulted in his child being seriously injured, is entitled to maintain an independent, non-derivative claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress. While the parties still dispute whether Pegar was negligent in causing Skylar\u2019s injuries despite Pegar\u2019s stipulated consent judgment, they nonetheless agree that no genuine issues of material fact exist relative to their summary judgment motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">\u00b611  \u201cThe decision to recognize emotional distress as an independent tort has been in gradual evolution for courts nationwide, and Montana is no exception.\u201d So began this Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Sacco, </em>271 Mont. at 220, 896 P.2d at 417. We then engaged in a comprehensive summary of our case law and relevant case law from other jurisdictions, and analyzed the various elements ofaNIED claim as applied by these jurisdictions. Ultimately, we developed the following rule: An independent cause of action for negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress arises under circumstances where 1) serious or severe emotional distress to the plaintiff was 2) the reasonably foreseeable consequence of 3) the defendant\u2019s negligent or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>intentional act or omission. <em>See Sacco, </em>271 Mont. at 234 and 237, 896 P.2d at 426 and 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\u00b612 Wages argues that he has met each element of the <em>Sacco </em>NIED rule. FNIC does not dispute Wages\u2019 claim that his emotional distress is \u201cserious\u201d as defined by the Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 46, comment j at 78; it argues, however, that because Wages did not witness Skylar\u2019s accident, his emotional distress was not reasonably foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u00b613 In response to FNIC\u2019s argument, Wages maintains that he need not have witnessed Skylar\u2019s accident for it to be foreseeable that he could suffer severe emotional distress as a result of Pegar\u2019s negligent driving and Skylar\u2019s injuries. He asserts that this Court in <em>Sacco </em>expressly rejected the \u201cbystander rule\u201d previously set forth in <em>Versland v. Caron Transport </em>(1983), 206 Mont. 313, 671 P.2d 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\u00b614 In <em>Versland, </em>we set forth the following test for establishing a claim for damages for NIED:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-7\">1. The shock must result from a direct emotional impact upon the plaintiff from the sensory and contemporaneous perception of the accident, as contrasted with learning of the accident from others after its occurrence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">2. The plaintiff and victim must be closely related, as contrasted with an absence of any relationship or the presence of only a distant relationship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-9\">3. Either death or serious physical injury of the victim must have occurred as a result of the defendant\u2019s negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-10\"><em>Versland, </em>206 Mont. at 322-23, 671 P.2d at 588. Later, in <em>Sacco, </em>we said: \u201c[w]e recognize that negligent infliction of emotional distress as an independent tort action under the narrow <em>Versland </em>analysis is archaic and does not fully address all plaintiffs who are deserving of relief.\u201d <em>Sacco, </em>271 Mont. at 232, 896 P.2d at 425. We then proceeded to establish the rule stated in \u00b6 11 above, and we expressly overruled <em>Versland </em>and other \u201cprior cases dealing with independent causes of action involving negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress, to the extent [such cases are] inconsistent with this opinion.\u201d <em>Sacco, </em>271 Mont. at 239, 896 P.2d at 429. Thus, Wages argues, \u201csensory and contemporaneous perception of the accident\u201d is no longer a required element of a NIED claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">\u00b615 Wages maintains that Pegar had a duty to him and to Skylar under \u00a7 28-1-201, MCA, \u201cto abstain from injuring the person ... of another....\u201d Moreover, Wages claims that Pegar negligently breached that duty by injuring Skylar and inflicting emotional distress on Wages. He strongly asserts that it is \u201cindisputably foreseeable\u201d that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>parent could suffer serious emotional distress as a result of the type of accident in which Skylar was involved and the ongoing injuries with which he continues to suffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\u00b616 FNIC, in turn, argues that Wages\u2019 emotional distress was not foreseeable. It relies for its position on <em>Treichel, </em>which was decided after <em>Sacco. </em>In <em>Treichel, </em>we were asked to determine whether the \u201cEach Person\u201d or \u201cEach Accident\u201d limits of liability set forth in the State Farm policy held by plaintiff and her deceased husband applied to plaintiffs claim for NIED. In reaching our conclusion, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeR\">Unlike Carolyn [the plaintiff in the <em>Treichel </em>case], the plaintiff in <em>Bain </em>[a loss of consortium case] was not at the scene of the accident and did not witness the injuries to his spouse. As the District Court pointed out in the case before us \u201c[i]t is this personal, on the scene, direct physical and emotional impact which distinguishes emotional distress claims under <em>Sacco </em>from loss of consortium claims....\u201d Carolyn was a separate person who received an independent and direct injury at the accident scene. Her serious and severe emotional distress was the reasonably foreseeable consequence of Hintz\u2019s negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-5\"><em>Treichel, </em>280 Mont. at 449, 930 P.2d at 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\u00b617 FNIC, interpreting this language, urges us to craft the following <em>Treichel </em>\u201crule\u201d-\u201cthe individual who witnesses a family member sustain injury or death in an accident states a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress whereas those not present at the scene who do not witness the injury causing event or its immediate aftermath may state a claim for loss of consortium.\u201d Thus, FNIC implies that in <em>Treichel, </em>we reintroduced the contemporaneous impact requirement into the NIED test. FNIC concludes its analysis by arguing that because the existence of a duty depends on the foreseeability of harm, and foreseeability requires the on-the-scene witnessing of the accident, Pegar had no established legal duty to Wages, and therefore breached no legal duty to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">\u00b618 The District Court agreed with FNIC, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">In this case [Wages] was not the physical victim of [Pegar] nor was he a witness to his child\u2019s accident. Therefore [Pegar] breached no established legal duty running directly to Gerald Wages. [Wages] must show the breach of an independent duty by [Pegar] that ran to [Wages] to prevail on his independent tort claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">\u00b619 The District Court continued, quoting <em>Sacco:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-10\">The existence of a duty depends on the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Thus a further limitation on the right of recovery, as in all negligence cases, is that the defendant\u2019s obligation to refrain from particular conduct is owed only to those who are foreseeably endangered by the conduct and only with respect to those risks or hazards whose likelihood made the conduct unreasonably dangerous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><em>Sacco, </em>271 Mont. at 232, 896 P.2d at 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">\u00b620 The District Court then concluded, quoting <em>Treichel, </em>that \u2018\u201cpersonal on the scene, direct physical and emotional impact\u2019 was still vital. Duty in a NIED case, therefore, exists only to those who actually witness the accident. Foreseeability is lacking to those who are not actually at the accident scene.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\u00b621 We disagree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion. First, we note that FNIC\u2019s and the District Court\u2019s interpretation of <em>Treichel </em>is incorrect. In <em>Treichel, </em>as we noted above, the question before the Court was the recoverability of the spouse\u2019s claim for NIED under the \u201cEach Person\u201d limit of liability offered under their State Farm policy. While the Court in <em>Treichel </em>did refer to the fact that Carolyn, the spouse, experienced direct on-the-scene injury, this was offered only to buttress the District Court\u2019s distinction between NIED and loss of consortium claims, and the court\u2019s conclusion that recovery should be had under the policy. It is clear from the remaining language of the Court\u2019s opinion that our fundamental ruling in <em>Sacco </em>was undisturbed. In fact, we specifically noted in <em>Treichel </em>that \u201c[I]n clarifying the elements of a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress in <em>Sacco, </em>we eliminated the other various sorts of theories by which independent torts of negligent infliction of emotional distress came into Montana law such as the <em>Versland </em>bystander analysis.\u201d <em>Treichel, </em>280 Mont. at 448, 930 P.2d at 664. Thus, it is clear that we have not reintroduced the bystander component into the NIED analysis by virtue of our <em>Treichel </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">\u00b622 The law as announced in <em>Sacco </em>remains applicable to the case before us. Therefore, we must determine whether Wages is entitled to maintain a NIED claim under <em>Sacco.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">\u00b623 As we noted above, duty and foreseeability are inextricably linked. <em>Sacco, </em>271 Mont. at 232, 896 P.2d at 422-23; <em>LaTray v. City of Havre, </em>2000 MT 119, \u00b6 16, 299 Mont. 449, \u00b6 16, 999 P.2d 1010, \u00b6 16, (\u201cin the absence of foreseeability, there is no duty; in the absence of duty, there is no negligence\u201d). As we recognized in <em>Samson v. State, </em>2003 MT 133, \u00b6 22, 316 Mont. 90, \u00b6 22, 69 P.3d 1154, \u00b6 22, \u201c[ajnalyzing foreseeability in the duty context, we look to whether or not the injured party was within the scope of risk created by the alleged negligence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>tortfeasor-that is, was the injured party a foreseeable plaintiff?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">\u00b624  This Court has long held that the existence of a legal duty is a matter of law to be determined by the court. <em>Roy v. Neibauer </em>(1981), 191 Mont. 224, 226, 623 P.2d 555, 556. <em>See also, Lopez v. Great Falls Pre-Release Services, </em>1999 MT 199, 295 Mont. 416, 986 P.2d 1081; <em>LaTray, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18 and 26. As an element of duty, foreseeability must be determined by the court as well. In the case before us the District Court concluded that Wages was not a foreseeable plaintiff because he had not witnessed the accident and, therefore, as a matter of law, Pegar owed no duty to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\u00b625  The District Court reached this conclusion by erroneously interpreting and applying <em>Treichel. </em>As we explained above, it should have applied <em>Sacco. </em>In <em>Sacco, </em>we severed the previously mandatory nexus between witnessing the accident and foreseeability, and established that a defendant can owe a duty to a NIED claimant even in circumstances where the claimant was not at the scene of the accident. Therefore, the District Court erred in premising its conclusions solely on the fact that Wages did not witness the accident. For this reason, we reverse and remand this matter to the District Court to determine once again, under <em>Sacco </em>and not <em>Treichel, </em>whether Wages was a foreseeable plaintiff. For such a determination, the court may consider such factors as the closeness of the relationship between the plaintiff and victim, the age of the victim, and the severity of the injury of the victim, and any other factors bearing on the question. Moreover, the court <em>may </em>consider whether the plaintiff was a bystander to the accident. It may not, however, rely exclusively on the fact that a plaintiff was <em>not </em>a bystander to conclude that such a plaintiff is an unforeseeable plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\u00b626 Should the court determine that foreseeability and duty exist and that upon the evidence, \u201csevere\u201d or \u201cserious\u201d emotional distress could be found, it is then the jury\u2019s responsibility to determine whether that duty was breached, whether that breach caused Wages\u2019 to suffer \u201csevere\u201d or \u201cserious\u201d distress, and, if so, what damages Wages has suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">\u00b627 For the foregoing reasons, we reverse and remand this matter for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b261-9\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, REGNIER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
