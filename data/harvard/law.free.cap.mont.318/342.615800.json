Defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims. The District Court granted summary judgment to Defendants on Osterman\u2019s claims for actual and constructive fraud, unfair trade practices, and negligent misrepresentation. A jury trial ensued on the remaining claims, and a verdict was returned in favor of Osterman for breach of express warranty. Osterman thereafter sought attorney fees and costs. Following a hearing, the District Court concluded Osterman was entitled to attorney fees and costs for her breach of warranty claim only, reducing her requested amount based upon a pro rata calculation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>of the attorneys\u2019 time spent on that claim. Osterman appeals the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment on her claims for fraud and unfair trade practices, as well as the court\u2019s award of attorney fees. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">\u00b62 Osterman raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to Defendants on Osterman\u2019s claims for actual fraud, constructive fraud, \u25a0unfair trade practices, and negligent misrepresentation?</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in applying a pro rata reduction to Osterman\u2019s requested attorney fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">\u00b65 In the summer of 1996, Laura Osterman, then age 69 and recently widowed, responded to a written solicitation from Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. (Sears) regarding vinyl siding for her home. On August 15, 1996, James E. Sluder (Sluder) of K-Designers (K-Designers), an authorized contractor of Sears, visited Osterman at her home to discuss the purchase and installation of vinyl siding. During his visit, Sluder provided Osterman with a number of color brochures, including one clearly identifying the manufacturer of the siding as a company named \u201cGentek.\u201d Sluder also provided a brochure, several pages in length, in which the words \u201cSEARS SIDING,\u201d repeatedly appeared throughout the brochure in large print followed by the slogan, \u201c[p]roudly sold, furnished and installed by K-Designers, a Sears authorized contractor,\u201d which appeared in small font near the bottom of the page. The brochure also contained one page dedicated entirely to promoting K-Designers, bearing the K-Designers logo at the bottom right hand corner.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">\u00b66 On the day of Sluder\u2019s visit, Osterman agreed to purchase approximately $22,000 worth of vinyl siding, to be financed through \u201cSears Financial,\u201d and installed at her residence the following month. Osterman and Sluder executed a Sales Agreement, whereby Osterman agreed to purchase the siding and \u201cto contract with K-Designers, to furnish, deliver, and arrange for installation of all materials ....\u201d Osterman \u00e1dditionally agreed to participate in a product awareness program and signed a certificate-like document indicating that she would, among other things, allow K-Designers to use \u201cbefore and after\u201d photographs of her home, allow placement of a Sears Siding/K-Designers sign on her property during installation, and allow K-Designers to show the exterior of her property to prospective customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>\u00b67 Despite this, Osterman believed she was dealing exclusively with Sears, that Sluder was a Sears\u2019 employee, and that the materials provided would be Sears\u2019 products. When installation of the siding commenced in September 1996, however, it was K-Designers, not Sears, that arrived to install the siding.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">\u00b68 On October 7, 1996, at the completion of installation, Osterman tendered a check to K-Designers for approximately $11,000 and signed a Certificate of Completion acknowledging \u201cthat all goods and services sold to us by K-Designers have been furnished and performed in a workmanlike manner and in accordance with the terms of said contract.\u201d However, shortly after signing this document, Osterman discovered numerous defects in the installation of the siding. In particular, she noticed that the trim was not properly installed, that nails were put through the siding at inappropriate places, that some of the trim siding was attached to the house with double sided tape, and that the siding material was inappropriate to Montana\u2019s climate. Osterman accordingly notified her local Sears store regarding her dissatisfaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\u00b69 Following several warranty service calls by both K-Designers and Sears, Osterman continued to be dissatisfied with the siding project. On May 4,1999, Osterman filed suit, seeking damages for actual and constructive fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of express warranty, negligent hiring of an independent contractor, negligent installation, and deceptive, unfair trade practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">\u00b610 After substantial discovery, K-Designers filed a motion for summary judgment asserting that Osterman\u2019s claims for fraud, misrepresentation, and unfair trade practices were barred by the applicable two years statute of limitations. Thereafter, both K-Designers and Sears moved for summary judgment on the merits of Osterman\u2019s fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and unfair trade practices claims, with K-Designers additionally requesting summary judgment on Osterman\u2019s claims for negligent installation and breach of express warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">\u00b611 Following a hearing, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of K-Designers and Sears on Osterman\u2019s claims for actual and constructive fraud, as well as unfair trade practices, as time barred. The District Court also concluded that summary judgment on the merits of these claims and on Osterman\u2019s negligent misrepresentation claim was appropriate. The court reserved the breach of express warranty, negligence, and negligent hiring of an independent contractor claims for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>\u00b612 On November 9, 2000, a Cascade County jury returned a verdict for Osterman in the amount of $12,500 for breach of express warranty against both K-Designers and Sears. The jury rejected, however, Osterman\u2019s negligent installation claim against K-Designers and the negligent hiring of an independent contractor claim against Sears.</p>\n<p id=\"AWQ\">\u00b613 Osterman thereafter moved for an award of attorney fees and costs. Pursuant to the Sales Agreement entered with K-Designers, the District Court determined Osterman was entitled to recover attorney fees and costs, but only from K-Designers and only with respect to her breach of express warranty claim. The court accordingly scheduled a hearing to determine the proper amount of fees and costs to be awarded to Osterman.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">\u00b614 At the hearing, Osterman\u2019s attorneys indicated that they had expended 147.15 hours prior to the entry of summary of judgment, which dismissed four of Osterman\u2019s seven claims, and 68.65 hours thereafter, for a total of 215.80 hours. Allocating this time between the various claims on a pro rata basis, the District Court concluded Osterman was entitled to one-seventh of the 147.15 hours expended prior to the entry of summary of judgment, or 21.02 hours, and one-third of the 68.65 hours spent thereafter, or 22.88 hours, for a total of 43.9 hours. At $125.00 per hour, which the parties agreed was a reasonable hourly rate, the District Court awarded Osterman attorney fees in the amount of $5,487.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">\u00b615 With respect to costs, the court similarly concluded Osterman should receive only those incurred in relation to the breach of express warranty claim. The court reduced Osterman\u2019s requested amount of costs proportionately, for a total award of $790.25. Osterman appeals the District Court\u2019s summary dismissal of her claims for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and unfair trade practices, and the court\u2019s award of partial attorney fees against K-Designers. We affirm the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of Sears and K-Designers. However, we conclude the District Court erred in its award of attorney fees and costs, and remand that issue to the District Court for redetermination.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">\u00b616 Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to Defendants on Osterman\u2019s claims for actual fraud, constructive fraud, unfair trade practices, and negligent misrepresentation?</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">\u00b617 We review a district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling <em>de novo </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>and employ the same method of evaluation, based upon Rule 56 M.R.Civ.P., as applied by the district court. <em>Andrews v. Plum Creek Manufacturing, LP., </em>2001 MT 94, \u00b6 5, 305 Mont. 194, \u00b6 5, 27 P.3d 426, \u00b6 5. Pursuant to Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., we apply the following inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar6\">The movant must demonstrate that no genuine issues of material fact exist. Once this has been accomplished, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to prove, by more than mere denial and speculation, that a genuine issue [of fact] does exist. Having determined that genuine issues of fact do not exist, the court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We review the legal determinations made by a district court as to whether the court erred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><em>Bruner v. Yellowstone County </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 261, 264, 900 P.2d 901, 903 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">\u00b618 In the instant case, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of K-Designers and Sears as to Osterman\u2019s claims for actual and constructive fraud, as well as her claim for unfair trade practices, on the basis that these claims were barred by the applicable two-year statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 27-2-203 and 27-2-211, MCA (1999). Osterman argues that the two-year period was tolled and that her filing was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">\u00b619 Section 27-2-203, MCA, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">The period prescribed for the commencement of an action for relief on the ground of fraud or mistake is within 2 years, the cause of action in such case not to be deemed to have accrued \u25a0until the discovery by the aggrieved party of the facts constituting the fraud or mistake.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">\u00b620  Under Montana law, it is well settled that fraud claims are subject to a two-year statute of limitations. <em>Fleming v. Fleming Farms, Inc. </em>(1986), 221 Mont. 237, 243, 717 P.2d 1103, 1107. This two-year statute of limitations also applies to actions for constructive fraud. <em>Tynes v. Bankers Life Co. </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 350, 357, 730 P.2d 1115, 1120 (citing <em>Purcell v. Automatic Gas Distributors, Inc. </em>(1983), 207 Mont. 223, 232, 673 P.2d 1246, 1251 (defining \u201cconstructive fraud\u201d as within the definition of fraud)).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">\u00b621 In <em>Association of Unit Owners of Deer Lodge Condominium v. Big Sky of Montana, Inc. </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 64, 82, 798 P.2d 1018, 1029, this Court upheld, without analysis, the district court\u2019s determination that the unit owners\u2019 claim for unfair trade practices under \u00a7 30-14-133, MCA, was time barred by the statute of limitations set forth at \u00a7 27-2-211, MCA. That section provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>(1) Within 2 years is the period prescribed for the commencement of an action upon:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\">(c) a liability created by statute other than:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">(i) a penalty or forfeiture; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">(ii) a statutory debt created by the payment of public assistance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">\u00b622 As defined by this Court in <em>Royal Ins. Co. v. Roadarmel, </em>2000 MT 259, \u00b6 17, 301 Mont. 508, \u00b6 17, 11 P.3d 105, \u00b6 17, a \u201cliability created by statute\u201d is one which \u201cestablishes a new rule of private right unknown to the common law.\u201d Put another way, it is a \u201c\u2018liability which would not exist but for the statute <em>....\u201d\u2019Royal Ins. Co., </em>\u00b6 17 <em>(citing Abell v. Bishop </em>(1930), 86 Mont. 478, 486, 284 P. 525, 528). In <em>Royal Ins. Co., </em>we concluded that an insurer\u2019s right to subrogation in a workers\u2019 compensation claim constituted a \u201cliability created by statute\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 27-2-211(l)(c), MCA, \u201cbecause it amount[ed] to an unqualified right of <em>reimbursement </em>not found at common law.\u201d <em>Royal Ins. Co., </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">\u00b623  Montana\u2019s Unfair Trade Practices Act authorizes private individuals to maintain a cause of action for injuries sustained as a result of unfair or deceptive trade practices and allows recovery of actual damages or $200, whichever is greater. <em>See </em>\u00a7 30-14-133(1), MCA. Additionally, the district court may, in its discretion, award up to three times the amount of actual damages and reasonable attorney fees. <em>See </em>\u00a7 30-14-133(1), MCA; <em>Dillree v. Devoe </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 47, 54, 724 P.2d 171, 176. While it is possible to conceive of a case in which the same conduct gives rise to a common law cause of action and a claim under the Act, we conclude the Act creates a liability not existing at common law by providing the successful claimant the <em>unqualified right </em>to receive the greater of $200, or actual damages. Further, the Act provides authority for the district court to award treble damages upon successful proof of unfair or deceptive practices. In <em>Plath v. Schonrock, </em>2003 MT 21, \u00b6 27, 314 Mont. 101, \u00b6 27, 64 P.3d 984, \u00b6 27, we determined that such damages are intended to be compensatory rather than punitive, and thus, do not constitute a penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">\u00b624  Therefore, as a liability created by statute that is neither a penalty nor a statutory debt, claims brought under Montana\u2019s Unfair Trade Practices Act, \u00a7 30-14-101, <em>et seq., </em>MCA, are subject to the two-year time limitation set forth at \u00a7 27-2-211, MCA. Having so concluded, we now turn to the record to determine whether Osterman\u2019s claims were timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>\u00b625 Osterman filed her complaint on May 4,1999, approximately two years and nine months after entering the Sales Agreement with K-Designers and Sears. This period of time notwithstanding, Osterman argues the District Court erred in dismissing her claims for fraud and unfair trade practices as untimely because when she entered the Sales Agreement, she believed she was dealing exclusively with Sears, and that it was not until sometime later that she discovered K-Designer\u2019s involvement in the siding project. Accordingly, Osterman argues that disputed issues of material fact regarding discovery of her cause of action raised the possibility that her action had accrued beyond the two-year statutory period, and thus, precluded an award of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">\u00b626 As a general rule, the statute of limitations for actions based on fraud begins to run when the fraud occurs, unless the facts forming the basis for the alleged fraud are, by their nature, concealed, or the defendant takes affirmative action to prevent the plaintiff from discovering the injury. <em>Cartwright v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc\u2019y </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 1, 17, 914 P.2d 976, 986. A significant number of jurisdictions also apply this rule to actions for unfair trade practices. <em>Teran v. Citicorp. Person-to-Person Financial Center </em>(Ariz. 1985), 706 P.2d 382, 389; <em>Miller v. Dickenson </em>(Tex. App. 1984), 677 S.W.2d 253, <em>258; Pickett v.Holland America Line-Westours, Inc. </em>(Wash. App. 2000), 6 P.3d 63, 69; <em>Medimatch, Inc. v. Lucent Technologies Inc. </em>(N.D. Cal. 2000), 120 F.Supp.2d 842, 852.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\u00b627  For purposes of tolling the statute of limitations in an action for fraud or unfair trade practices, ordinary diligence must be exercised by the aggrieved party in the discovery of the facts constituting the fraud or deceptive practice. <em>See Gregory v. City of Forsyth </em>(1980), 187 Mont. 132, 137, 609 P.2d 248, 251. \u2018When the statute of limitations issue involves the time at which the plaintiff, through the use of reasonable diligence, should have discovered the facts, \u2018[t]he test is whether the plaintiff has information of circumstances sufficient to put a reasonable person on inquiry, or has the opportunity to obtain knowledge from sources open to his or her investigation.\u201d\u2019 <em>Johnson v. Barrett, </em>1999 MT 594, \u00b6 11, 295 Mont. 254, \u00b6 11, 983 P.2d 925, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\u00b628 Here, the District Court found that Osterman failed to specify any representation made by either K-Designers or Sears that K-Designers was part of the Sears Company, that Sluder was a Sears\u2019 employee, or that the product sold was manufactured by Sears. Rather, Osterman simply asserted she was led to believe that was the case. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>assertion, however, would have been in derogation to the information actually provided to Osterman on August 15, 1996, whereupon she received sales brochures identifying the manufacturer of the siding as a company named \u201cGentek,\u201d and K-Designers as \u201ca Sears authorized Contractor.\u201d On that same date, Osterman also executed a Sales Agreement authorizing K-Designers to \u201cfurnish, deliver, and arrange for installation of all materials ...\u201d and agreed to participate in a product awareness program in which she would, among other things, allow K-Designers to use before and after photographs of her home, place a Sears Siding/K-Designers sign on her property during installation, and show the exterior of her property to prospective customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">\u00b629 By October 7,1996, Osterman had demonstrated her knowledge of K-Designer\u2019s relationship with Sears by tendering a check to K-Designers for approximately $11,000 and signing a Certificate of Completion acknowledging \u201cthat all goods and services sold to us by K-Designers have been furnished and performed in a workmanlike manner and in accordance with the terms of said contract.\u201d Thus, even if Osterman was not fully aware of K-Designers\u2019 relationship with Sears on August 15, 1996, this confusion was clearly resolved by October 7 of that same year when she wrote the payment check to K-Designers and signed a Certificate of completion, more than two years prior to the filing of her suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\u00b630  A \u201cparty asserting fraud is put on inquiry notice of the other party\u2019s misdeeds, and must exercise ordinary diligence to discover the facts constituting the fraud.... Mere ignorance of the facts will not suffice to toll the statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Holman v. Hansen </em>(1989), 237 Mont. 198, 202, 773 P.2d 1200, 1203 (citations omitted). Here, Osterman has not shown affirmative conduct by Sears or K-Designers calculated to obscure the existence of a cause of action. Nor is this a situation in which the facts giving rise to the alleged fraud are, by their nature, concealed. Rather, K-Designers\u2019 relationship with Sears as an \u201cauthorized contractor\u201d is evident from a plain reading of the August 15,1996 Sales Agreement. Although Osterman correctly points out that a person who fails to take the opportunity to examine a written form before executing it may still claim fraud to a document \u201cwhere he is prevented from reading it or having it read to him by some fraud, trick, artifice, or devise by the other party,\u201d <em>Cartwright, </em>276 Mont. at 26, 914 P.2d at 992, she has not shown that to be the case here. Accordingly, the District Court was correct in holding Osterman\u2019s claims for actual and constructive fraud and unfair trade practices to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>be barred under the statute of limitations because she discovered, or reasonably should have discovered, the facts constituting the alleged fraud and deceptive practices more than two years prior to filing suit. \u00b631 Turning to Osterman\u2019s claim for negligent misrepresentation, the District Court correctly concluded this claim was not barred by the statute of limitations. <em>See Cechovic v. Hardin &amp; Assoc., Inc. </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 104, 119, 902 P.2d 520, 529 (holding that because negligent misrepresentation is couched in terms of negligence, the three-year statute of limitations for negligence applies). However, the court found that Osterman failed to make a prima facie showing of negligent misrepresentation and granted summary judgment in favor of K-Designers and Sears on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">\u00b632 This Court has long recognized the tort of negligent misrepresentation. <em>See Yellowstone II Dev. Gr. v. First Amer. Title Co., </em>2001 MT 41, \u00b6 78, 304 Mont. 223, \u00b6 78, 20 P.3d 755, \u00b6 78. To prevail on a claim for negligent misrepresentation, the plaintiff must prove the following elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">a) the defendant made a representation as to a past or existing material fact;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">b) the representation must have been untrue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">c) regardless of its actual belief, the defendant must have made the representation without any reasonable ground for believing it to be true;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">d) the representation must have been made with the intent to induce the plaintiff to rely on it;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">e) the plaintiff must have been unaware of the falsity of the representation; it must have acted in reliance upon the truth of the representation and it must have been justified in relying upon the representation;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">f) the plaintiff, as a result of its reliance, must sustain damage. <em>Yellowstone II, </em>\u00b6 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">\u00b633 Here, the gravamen of Osterman\u2019s claim is that the vinyl siding was sold, furnished, and installed on her home under false and misleading circumstances. Essentially, Osterman argues that Sluder\u2019s failure to clearly identify his relationship with Sears and K-Designers when he visited her home on August 15, 1996, along with the sales brochures\u2019 heavy promotion of the product as \u201cSEARS SIDING,\u201d lulled her into believing she was dealing exclusively with Sears. During the proceedings for summary judgment, however, Osterman failed to specify any false statements allegedly made by K-Designers or Sears causing her to believe this was true.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>\u00b634  As this Court has often noted, the party opposing summary judgment must \u201cset forth specific facts and cannot rely on speculative, fanciful, or conclusory statements.\u201d <em>Sprunk v. First Bank System (Sprunk II) </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 463, 466-67, 830 P.2d 103, 105; <em>Klock v. Town of Cascade </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 167, 174, 943 P.2d 1262, 1266. Here, Osterman\u2019s claim fails to offer evidence demonstrating the primary element of the cause of action; namely, that Sears or K-Designers made a false representation of material fact. Her claim for negligent misrepresentation accordingly fails, entitling Sears and K-Designers to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">\u00b635 Did the District Court abuse its discretion in applying a pro rata reduction to Osterman\u2019s requested attorney fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">\u00b636 We review a district court\u2019s award of attorney fees to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Mortgage Source, Inc. v. Strong, </em>2003 MT 205, \u00b6 8, 317 Mont. 37, \u00b6 8, 75 P.3d 304, \u00b6 8. A district court abuses its discretion if its fee award is based on an inaccurate view of the law or a finding of fact is clearly erroneous. <em>Ihler v. Chisholm, 2000 MT 37, </em>\u00b6 24, 298 Mont. 254, \u00b6 24, 995 P.2d 439, \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">\u00b637 The District Court awarded attorney fees and costs to Osterman for the breach of warranty portion of her claim only, this being the only theory based upon contract for which Osterman received a verdict against both Sears and K-Designers. To calculate the award, the District Court allocated the total amount of time expended by Osterman\u2019s attorneys among the seven claims that existed prior to summary judgment, and the three claims which existed thereafter, on a pro rata basis. Based upon the evidence received at the June 13, 2001 hearing, the court awarded Osterman one-seventh of the time expended by her attorneys prior to entry of summary of judgment, or 21.02 hours, and one-third of their time expended thereafter, or 22.88 horns, for a total of 43.9 hours or a total fee of $5,487.50. The court similarly pro rated costs, awarding Osterman one-third of total costs, or $790.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">\u00b638 Osterman asserts the District Court erred in applying such a mechanical, pro rata division of her requested attorney fees because each of her claims were inextricably intertwined and predicated upon common core facts. She argues that, in awarding attorney fees, a district court must focus on the nature of the claims advanced, regardless of their ultimate disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">\u00b639 Indeed, the United States Supreme Court rejected \u201ca mathematical approach comparing the total number of issues in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>case with those actually prevailed upon\u201d for determining attorney fee awards in <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart </em>(1983), 461 U.S. 424, 435 n.11, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1940 n.11, 76 L.Ed.2d 40, 52 n.11, upon which we have relied. <em>See Laudert v. Richland County Sheriff\u2019s Dept., </em>2001 MT 287, \u00b6 18, 307 Mont. 403, \u00b6 18, 38 P.3d 790, \u00b6 18. The <em>Hensley </em>Court noted that \u201c[s]uch a ratio provides little aid in determining what is a reasonable fee in light of all the relevant factors.\u201d <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 435, n.11, 103 S.Ct. at 1940 n.11, 76 L.Ed.2d at 52 n.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">\u00b640  A pro rata calculation is also inconsistent with a consideration of the guidelines we have established for determining a reasonable fee award: (1) the amount and character of the services rendered; (2) the labor, time, and trouble involved; (3) the character and importance of the litigation in which the services were rendered; (4) the amount of money or the value of the property to be affected; (5) the professional skill and experience called for; (6) the attorneys\u2019 character and standing in their profession; and (7) the results secured by the services of the attorneys. <em>Swenson v. Janke </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 354, 361, 908 P.2d 678, 682-83; <em>see also Plath, </em>\u00b6 36. Although these factors are not exclusive-that is, a district court may consider other factors-they serve as guidelines for determining what constitutes a reasonable fee. <em>Morning Star Enterprises, Inc. v. R.H. Grover Inc. </em>(1991), 247 Mont. 105, 113, 805 P.2d 553, 558. Because the District Court\u2019s pro rata calculation failed to consider these factors, Osterman was deprived of a proper assessment of her fee claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">\u00b641 Accordingly, we reverse the District Court\u2019s attorney fee award and remand this matter for a determination of reasonable attorney fees in accordance with the requirements of <em>Swenson, </em>274 Mont. at 361, 908 P.2d at 682-83, and <em>Plath, </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">\u00b642 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b376-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
