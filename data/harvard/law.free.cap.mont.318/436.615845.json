We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">\u00b62 The following issues are presented on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in denying Gardner\u2019s motion to suppress the child\u2019s testimony as tainted?</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">\u00b64 2. Was there sufficient evidence to sustain Gardner\u2019s conviction?</p>\n<p id=\"Axa\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err in allowing rebuttal testimony offered by the State?</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">\u00b66 4. Did the District Court err by instructing the jury to ignore testimony of a police officer concerning the child\u2019s truthfulness?</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">\u00b67 5. Did the District Court err in allowing testimony by a police officer who stated that, according to his use of the Reid Technique, Gardner was lying in his interviews?</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">\u00b68 On February 17,2000, Gardner was charged by Information with four counts of incest with his daughter K.G. in violation of \u00a7 45-5-507, MCA. On December 29, 2000, the State amended the Information charging him with a single count of incest.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">\u00b69 Troy Ray Gardner (Gardner or father) and Raeann Vernia (Vernia or mother) were married in 1991 and had a daughter, K.G. In 1993, Vernia and Gardner divorced. Pursuant to an agreement, K.G. was to live with her mother for eight months of the year and her father for four months; however, Gardner rarely saw K.G. in the years following the divorce because he was in the military service. This continued for approximately five years until Vernia suggested that Gardner spend more time with K.G. After Gardner left the military and was living again in Montana, K.G., then approximately seven years old, began having some overnight visits with her father about once a month.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">\u00b610 On August 12,1999, K.G. had a roller skating accident in which she injured her genital area on a banister of the porch at her home in Livingston. When Vernia put K.G. in the bathtub to soothe her injury, K.G. asked her mother to inspect her vaginal area. Vernia stated KG.\u2019s vaginal area appeared bruised, swollen, and chafed. Vernia told K.G. she really did not think the bruising had just happened, and asked if her \u201cdad or someone else\u201d had done something to her. K.G. started crying and responded that her dad had \u201chit her and rubbed her there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-13\">\u00b611 Vernia took K.G. to the Livingston Police Department where Vernia gave a voluntary written statement alleging incest by Gardner. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Vernia then took K.G. to the Livingston hospital emergency room where the child was examined and questioned by Dr. Burwell, the ER physician. Dr. Burwell\u2019s assessment of the child\u2019s injury was that the physical evidence was consistent with either a straddle injury or sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">\u00b612 The following day, August 13, 1999, K.G. was interviewed twice by Officer Severson of the Livingston Police Department. The investigation was then turned over to the Park County Sheriffs Department because K.G. reported the abuse had occurred at the family ranch in Clyde Park. K.G. was interviewed again on September 9, *1999, by Detective Steffins. Two of the three interviews of the child were taped.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">\u00b613 On September 22, 2000, Gardner filed a motion to suppress all pretrial statements and exclude any trial testimony by the child witness as \u201cirrevocably tainted,\u201d and a motion to dismiss the Information. In the alternative, Gardner\u2019s motion to suppress requested a taint hearing, pursuant to Rule 104, M.R.Evid., before determining the admissibility of such evidence. Gardner asserted that unnecessarily suggestive interviewing techniques by police had tainted the child\u2019s statements and rendered them unreliable, thus constituting a substantive due process violation under both the United States and the Montana constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\u00b614 On November 1, 2000, the District Court conducted a \u201ctaint hearing\u201d to determine whether the child\u2019s testimony had been rendered irremediably unreliable by the investigative process. On November 15, 2000, the District Court denied both the motion to suppress and motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">\u00b615 Following a jury trial from January 10 through January 13,2001, the jury returned a verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">\u00b616 On February 9, 2001, Gardner filed a motion for judgment of acquittal notwithstanding the verdict, attacking the victim\u2019s credibility, criticizing the police investigation, and asserting that no medical evidence existed to support an allegation of sexual abuse. On April 25,2001, the District Court entered its order denying Gardner\u2019s motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-9\">[T]he jury listened to the defendant and the victim testify, listened to the defendant\u2019s expert witness, and the defendant was allowed liberal cross-examination of the officers who conducted the various interviews.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-10\">While the defendant rails against the law enforcement interviews and how they \u201ctainted\u201d the victim\u2019s testimony, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Court does not agree. The interviews were not ideal, but it does not appear that they had an impact on the victim\u2019s testimony. As the Court noted when ruling on a prior motion the victim\u2019s statement remained basically consistent from her initial disclosures to her mother and Dr. Burwell. This was before law enforcement got involved. After weighing all the evidence the jury obviously decided that the victim\u2019s testimony was more credible than that of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">\u00b617 On November 5, 2001, the District Court entered its judgment deferring imposition of sentence for five years and imposing numerous conditions on the deferral. Gardner appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\u00b618 As a preliminary matter, the State urges this Court to rule that Gardner\u2019s appeal is defective and, therefore, not properly before the Court. The State argues that Gardner\u2019s notice of appeal, which simply states that he is appealing \u201cfrom the final judgment,\u201d violates Rule 4(c), M.R.App.P., which requires the notice must designate \u201cthe judgment, order or part thereof appealed from.\u201d The State contends that Gardner\u2019s challenges to pre-judgment issues were not preserved by his notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">\u00b619 Gardner counters that his notice of appeal properly raises all of his issues on appeal pursuant to \u00a7 46-20-104, MCA, which delineates the scope of an appeal by a defendant. Section 46-20-104, MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-8\">(1) An appeal may be taken by the defendant <em>only from a final judgment of conviction and orders after judgment </em>which affect the substantial rights of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-9\">(2) Upon appeal from a judgment, the court may review the verdict or decision <em>and any alleged error </em>objected to which involves the merits or necessarily affects the judgment. Failure to make a timely objection during trial constitutes a waiver of the objection except as provided in 46-20-701(2). [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">In support of its contention that Gardner\u2019s notice of appeal is deficient, the State cites <em>State v. Spotted Blanket, </em>1998 MT 59, 288 Mont. 126, 955 P.2d 1347, and <em>State v. Delap </em>(1989), 237 Mont. 346, 772 P.2d 1268. However, in both of these cases the notice of appeal specifically designated one ruling, but argument on appeal was made for another, and, therefore, this Court, pursuant to Rule 4(c), M.R.App.P., declined to hear the new issue because it was not specified in the notice of appeal. <em>Spotted Blanket, </em>\u00b6 12; <em>Delap, </em>237 Mont. at 351, 772 P.2d at 1271. That is not the case here. We agree that, under \u00a7 46-20-104(2), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>MCA, Gardner\u2019s notice of appeal \u201cfrom the final judgment\u201d is not deficient, and his appeal properly encompasses the issues he raises.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Issue 1</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">\u00b620 Did the District Court err in denying Gardner\u2019s motion to suppress the child\u2019s testimony as tainted?</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">\u00b621 On appeal, this Court treats a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress the testimony of a witness as a ruling on the admissibility of evidence. <em>State v. Bingman, </em>2002 MT 350, \u00b6 19, 313 Mont. 376, \u00b6 19, 61 P.3d 153, \u00b6 19. The standard of review for a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings is abuse of discretion. Absent a showing of such abuse, the Supreme Court will not overturn the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Bingman, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">\u00b622 Gardner alleges the District Court erred in denying his motion to suppress the child\u2019s pretrial and trial testimony as tainted. Memory \u201ctaint\u201d occurs when children\u2019s memories \u201chave been falsified by suggestion in the course of interviews and pretrial preparations.\u201d John R. Christiansen, <em>The Testimony of Child Witnesses: Fact, Fantasy, and the Influence of Pretrial Interviews, </em>62 Wash. L. Rev. 705, 707 (1987). If a child\u2019s memory is tainted by the investigation process, the potential exists that the child may give unreliable or false statements.</p>\n<p id=\"AyV\">\u00b623 Montana has not adopted the \u201ctaint hearing\u201d as a necessary or required procedure in child sexual abuse cases. The State challenges the notion that taint hearings should be conducted at all. Similarly, Amicus County Attorney Association also argues against adopting taint hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">\u00b624 We affirm the District Court\u2019s decision denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and motion to dismiss. However, we decline to address the broader issue of whether taint hearings are required under Montana law. The State did not cross-appeal the District Court\u2019s holding of a taint hearing; thus, the issue is not properly before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">\u00b625 Although not required to do so by current law, the District Court conducted a taint hearing to determine whether KG.\u2019s testimony was rendered irremediably unreliable by the investigative process. The District Court denied both the motion to suppress the testimony, and the motion to dismiss, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Whether the interview techniques were flawed or improper goes to the weight and not the admissibility of the statements. The Court does not find that the alleged improper techniques render the statements so unreliable that they should not be presented to a jury. The jury will be capable of weighing the evidence and determining what weight, if any, to be given to the victim\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">\u00b626  Reviewing this matter as an evidentiary issue, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motions was not an abuse of discretion. The court heard testimony from both Vernia and K.G. that no strife existed between Vernia and Gardner over custody and visitation issues, thus dispelling the concern that Vernia had been motivated to coax an adverse statement from the child about her father. Although Gardner alleges KG.\u2019s testimony was tainted by improper interviewing techniques, the officers testified that they did not have a preconceived opinion as to what happened; that they asked repetitious questions because K.G. was a child and they wanted to be clear on what she said; and that they did not have a sense that K.G. was giving \u201cwrong\u201d answers. Officer Steffins stated that even in the presence of leading, repetitious, and yes-no questions, K.G. had corrected him a number of times when he misunderstood or made a misstatement, and he did not believe this child had been influenced by suggestive comments. The court also heard testimony from Dr. Sarah M. Baxter, an expert witness in the area of child sexual abuse, who stated that leading and repetitious questions are more dangerous for preschool age children than grade school children like K.G., and that these kinds of questions are less of a concern for children with good cognitive skills like those possessed by K.G. Before rendering its decision, the court received, listened to, and reviewed the transcripts of the two recorded interviews of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">\u00b627 We conclude that the District Court\u2019s denial of Gardner\u2019s motion to suppress and motion to dismiss was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Issue 2</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">\u00b628 Was there sufficient evidence to sustain Gardner\u2019s conviction?</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">\u00b629  The standard of review for sufficiency of the evidence to support a jury verdict is \u201cto determine whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Bauer, </em>2002 MT 7, \u00b6 15, 308 Mont. 99, \u00b6 15, 39 P.3d 689, \u00b6 15. A directed verdict of acquittal is appropriate only when there is no evidence to support a guilty verdict. <em>Bauer, </em>\u00b6 15. This Court has held repeatedly that \u201ca conviction for a sex offense may be based entirely on the uncorroborated testimony of the victim,\u201d regardless of whether the victim is a child. <em>Bauer, </em>\u00b6 15 (citing <em>State v. Olson </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 364, 372, 951 P.2d 571, 576; <em>State v. Gilpin </em>(1988), 232 Mont. 56, 70, 756 P.2d 445, 453; <em>State v. Maxwell </em>(1982), 198 Mont. 498, 503, 647 P.2d 348, 351; <em>State v. Metcalf </em>(1969), 153 Mont. 369, 378, 457 P.2d 453, 458). The credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony are determined by the trier of fact, and disputed questions of fact and credibility will not be disturbed on appeal. <em>Bauer, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">\u00b630 Gardner argues that the evidence produced at trial was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s guilty verdict. K.G.\u2019s testimony served as the basis for Gardner\u2019s conviction. K.G. testified at trial that on three or four different occasions at the family ranch, while Gardner read her a bedtime story, Gardner had rubbed her softly with his hand in the area of her privates as the two of them lay on KG.\u2019s bed. K.G. testified that the rubbing lasted approximately five minutes, during which time she tried to ignore it, then asked Gardner to stop. K.G. testified that Gardner stopped when she asked him to. He then finished reading the story, walked out of the room quietly, and went downstairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">\u00b631 K.G. stated she told her mother about the rubbing at the time of the roller skating injury when she was in the bathtub, and that she was afraid and nervous about telling her mother because she did not know what was going to happen. Vernia said that when she asked K.G. how long this had been going on, K.G. said, \u201cfor a long time.\u201d When Vernia then asked K.G. how many times this happened, she responded, \u201cat least five times.\u201d At trial, K.G. testified that it had happened \u201cthree or four\u201d times. Dr. Burwell, the ER physician, testified that K.G.\u2019s injuries were consistent with either a straddle injury from hitting a banister during a roller skating accident or from sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">\u00b632 Gardner testified at trial that he never touched his daughter in a sexual manner. Testimony by Gardner\u2019s girlfriend and many of Gardner\u2019s relatives who were at the family ranch during KG.\u2019s visits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>with her father testified they never saw anything untoward or any hesitation between K.G. and her father. Gardner told the jury, however, that he believed K.G. had been sexually abused and that his daughter was very honest. Additionally, Gardner told police during the pretrial interviews and at trial that there were times when he had been alone upstairs with his daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">\u00b633 Dr. Baxter testified that even interviews conducted by highly skilled individuals are subject to criticism because interviewing children is very difficult. According to Baxter, there was no such thing as a perfect interview. Dr. Baxter agreed that K.G. demonstrated consistency when confronted with leading and repetitive questions and demonstrated that she was not susceptible to \u201csuggestibility\u201d in that she had not incorporated new details into her facts each time she was questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\u00b634  Gardner was given every opportunity to expose any weaknesses in the interviews and the investigatory process to the jury. Gardner\u2019s allegations in conflict with K.G.\u2019s testimony constituted questions for the trier of fact, which the jury resolved against him. We are unwilling to second-guess the jury in these factual matters. Thus, we hold that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational jury could have found the essential elements of incest beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Issue 3</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">\u00b635 Did the District Court err in allowing rebuttal testimony offered by the State?</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">\u00b636  \u201cRebuttal evidence offered by the State is admissible if it has a tendency to contradict or disprove evidence of the defense.\u201d <em>State v. Love </em>(1968), 151 Mont. 190, 196, 440 P.2d 275, 279. \u201cRebuttal testimony is proper only if it tends to counteract a new matter offered by the adverse party.\u201d <em>State v. Hart, </em>2000 MT 332, \u00b6 20, 303 Mont. 71, \u00b6 20, 15 P.3d 917, \u00b6 20. This Court \u201cwill review a district court\u2019s admission of rebuttal testimony to determine whether the district court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Hart, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">\u00b637 Gardner contends the District Court committed reversible error in allowing rebuttal testimony offered by the State. Specifically, Gardner alleges that it was error for the District Court, over his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>objection, to allow the State to recall Vernia and her friend, Shannon Hamilton, to give rebuttal testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">\u00b638 In the State\u2019s case-in-chief, Vernia testified that during one of KG.\u2019s visits to her father when he was employed at a veterinarian clinic in Bozeman, K.G. called and requested that Vernia come and pick her up early. K.G. told Vernia that her father had scared her, but offered no further explanation at that time. K.G. testified she could not remember why she got scared. During Vernia\u2019s direct examination, Vernia testified that KG. had told her that the touching of KG.\u2019s genital area by her father had first started when KG. called her, upset, from Bozeman.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">\u00b639 During the defendant\u2019s case-in-chief, Gardner offered his explanation as to why K.G. was frightened and called her mother to come and pick her up. Gardner explained that when a bloody colt arrived at the vet clinic in need of immediate care, KG. wandered into the pen where the injured animal was being treated. According to Gardner, as he assisted the vet who was attending the colt, he raised his voice at K.G. and instructed her to go outside the pen in an attempt to protect her. Gardner testified that he had a deep voice that could be intimidating.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">\u00b640 The District Court then permitted rebuttal testimony from Vernia and Hamilton who described KG.\u2019s demeanor when they picked her up after her call from Bozeman. Vernia testified that KG. was \u201creally upset, crying, [and] just hysterical.\u201d Vernia also testified that KG. curled up in a little ball and stared out the window all the way home to Livingston, and did not talk for three days. Vernia testified that when she asked KG. what happened, KG. said her dad \u201creally scared her.\u201d Hamilton testified that after the Bozeman visit, KG. was \u201cvery quiet and more to herself, didn\u2019t want to play, didn\u2019t want to do anything.\u201d She had to \u201csleep with a bear or something\u201d that night.</p>\n<p id=\"Aa4\">\u00b641  The District Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the State\u2019s rebuttal testimony. Vernia\u2019s and Hamilton\u2019s rebuttal testimony tended to counteract the new matter offered by Gardner, that being the \u201cbloody colt\u201d theory of why K.G., frightened, had called her mother and asked to be picked up. Gardner alleges the rebuttal testimony of Vernia and Hamilton \u201cdid not contain facts which in any manner serve to rebut Gardner\u2019s description of KG. and the bloody injured colt.\u201d However, Vemia\u2019s and Hamilton\u2019s description of KG.\u2019s demeanor, both when they picked her up and for the following three days, specifically, that KG. was quiet, withdrawn, did not want to talk, and reverted back to sleeping with toys or a blanket that her grandmother made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>her, could be viewed as tending to contradict or disprove the theory offered by the defense and tending to counteract the \u201cbloody colt\u201d evidence offered by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">\u00b642 We conclude that the District Court properly acted within its discretion in allowing the rebuttal testimony offered by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Issue 4</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">\u00b643 Did the District Court err by instructing the jury to ignore testimony of a police officer concerning the child\u2019s truthfulness?</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">\u00b644 \u201cIt has long been the rule of this Court that on appeal we will not put a District Court in error for a ruling or procedure in which the appellant acquiesced, participated, or to which appellant made no objection.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Smith </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 495, 501, 791 P.2d 1373, 1377. \u201cAcquiescence in error takes away the right of objecting to it.\u201d <em>State v.

Gardner\u2019s allegation of error centers on the following exchange during the State\u2019s direct examination of Detective Steffins regarding his interview of K.G.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-11\">Prosecutor: How did the interview go?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-12\">Police Officer: As far as it going, it was consistent with the interview that Detective Severson did previously. I found no discrepancies between the two interviews. [K.G.\u2019s] story was consistent in detail, and she was very forthright, honest and truthful as far as I was concerned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-13\">Defense Counsel: Your Honor, I have to object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-14\">The Court: Yeah. The jury will disregard the last statement by Detective Steffins.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Defense Counsel: On the grounds that he\u2019s not qualified to make that observation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-4\">The Court: He\u2019s not qualified to make that determination. That\u2019s a jury question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">When Steffins offered the opinion that K.G. was \u201cvery forthright, honest and truthful,\u201d defense counsel objected on the grounds an untrained officer was not qualified to make this observation. The court sustained the objection and immediately admonished the jury to disregard the statement. Throughout the remainder of the trial, Gardner neither made further objection regarding the testimony nor indicated that the court\u2019s admonition did not cure the evidentiary error. Gardner did not move for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">\u00b646 On appeal, Gardner asserts prejudicial error on the grounds the only person who can speak directly to the credibility of a child witness is an expert who has been qualified under the standards set forth in <em>State v. Scheffelman </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 334, 342, 820 P.2d 1293, 1298. Gardner contends that Officer Steffins could not meet these criteria, thus, his testimony should have been inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">\u00b647 However, the District Court sustained Gardner\u2019s objection regarding the alleged inadmissible testimony and admonished the jury to disregard it. Because Gardner did not further object or move for a mistrial, the District Court was not placed on notice that Gardner believed the error had not been cured, and was not given an opportunity to correct itself. Gardner\u2019s acquiescence in the District Court\u2019s admonition constitutes a waiver of his right to assert error regarding this issue on appeal. Thus, we decline to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Issue 5</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">\u00b648 Did the District Court err in allowing testimony by a police officer who stated that, according to his use of the Reid Technique, Gardner was lying in his interviews?</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">\u00b649 In order to properly preserve an issue for appeal, a defendant must make a timely objection or motion to strike. <em>State v. Stuit </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 176, 182, 885 P.2d 1290, 1294. One \u201cmust object to improper testimony when it is offered or abide the result; failure to object at the proper time waives the error.\u201d <em>State v. Lawrence </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 140, 163, 948 P.2d 186. 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">\u00b650 Gardner alleges that the District Court committed reversible error in allowing Detective Steffins to testify that, according to the \u201cReid Technique,\u201d Gardner was lying in his interviews. During direct examination by the State, Steffins testified that the Reid Technique, a technique used for interviewing criminal suspects, demonstrates that a person who is lying will \u201csoften\u201d over time, give qualified answers, transfer blame to others, appeal to a higher (divine) authority, and try to avoid getting \u201cboxed in\u201d with an answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">\u00b651 On the first day of trial, Steffins described his observations of Gardner during two interviews he conducted of him. Steffins stated that Gardner gave qualified answers, was evasive, shifted blame, tried to justify incriminatory actions through loss of memory while conversely saying he had an excellent memory, made a statement of denial akin to swearing on a stack of Bibles, tried to keep from getting boxed in on specific dates, and \u201csoftened\u201d at the end of the interview by saying he just did not remember when or where the alleged inappropriate contact happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">\u00b652 As the State correctly notes, defense counsel made no objection to any of Steffins\u2019 testimony when it was offered on the first day of trial and did not cross-examine Steffins at that time. Instead of proceeding with cross-examination, defense counsel informed the court that Steffins had been subpoenaed for Gardner\u2019s case-in-chief, and, therefore, the defense would conduct direct and cross-examination of Steffins later in the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">\u00b653 On the third day of trial, defense counsel called Steffins during its case-in-chief and challenged him regarding his training, interview techniques, and assessment of Gardner. Defense counsel then asserted Steffins\u2019 training, which consisted of only twenty-four hours of instruction in the use of the Reid Technique, did not qualify him to make \u201cextreme psychological judgments\u201d about Gardner, thus rendering his observations of Gardner and his conclusion that Gardner was lying, inadmissible opinion testimony, and moved to strike all of Steffins\u2019 testimony on grounds he did not meet the qualifications necessary for an expert witness in the area of psychology. The court denied the motion to strike, stating that although Steffins was not an expert in psychology, Steffins could base his opinion on his training and the interviews he had done over the years as a police officer, and that the credibility and weight of the officer\u2019s testimony would be a jury question.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">\u00b654 The State contends that Gardner did not preserve the issue for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>appeal. In support of this contention the State cites <em>State v. Lawrence </em>for the proposition that objections to improper testimony must be timely, and failure to make a timely objection waives the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">\u00b655 We agree. Rule 103 of the Montana Rules of Evidence pertaining to evidentiary rulings states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">(a) Effect of Erroneous Ruling. Error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">(1) <em>Objection. </em>In case the ruling is one admitting evidence, a <em>timely objection or motion to strike </em>appears of record, stating the specific ground of objection, if the specific ground was not apparent from the context....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">[Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Rule 103, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">\u00b656 The requirement of timely objections has been the rule in Montana since the early 1900s. In <em>Yoder v. Reynolds </em>(1903), 28 Mont. 183, 72 P. 417, this Court held the fact the plaintiff sat by and allowed alleged inadmissible testimony go to the jury without objection waived the error. The <em>Yoder </em>court noted, \u201c[i]t is the settled law that one must object to improper testimony when it is offered, or abide the result.\u201d <em>Yoder, </em>28 Mont. at 194, 72 P. at 419. Similarly, in <em>Poindexter &amp; Orr Live Stock Co. v. Oregon Short Line R. Co. </em>(1905), 33 Mont. 338, 83 P. 886, this Court held the lower court did not err in refusing to strike evidence where plaintiffs counsel sat by and permitted the evidence to be heard without objection. The <em>Poindexter </em>court stated, \u201c[t]he practice, whether in civil or criminal cases, of deliberately permitting evidence to be given without objection in the first instance, and then moving to strike it out on grounds which might readily have been availed of to exclude it when offered, is not to be tolerated.\u201d <em>Poindexter, </em>33 Mont. at 341, 83 P. at 887.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">\u00b657 Here, as in <em>Poindexter, </em>Gardner\u2019s counsel made a strategic decision not to object when the alleged inadmissible testimony was offered on the first day of trial. Instead, defense counsel chose to wait until the third day of trial to attempt to discredit Steffins\u2019 ability to give such testimony, and to move to strike, which the District Court overruled. By doing so, Gardner failed to preserve this issue for appeal. \u00b658 Gardner cites <em>State v. Whitlow </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 430, 442, 949 P.2d 239, 247, for the premise that, where a defendant does not object to alleged inadmissible testimony during the State\u2019s case-in-chief, but waits to do so later during cross-examination, the error is nonetheless preserved for appellate review. In <em>Whitlow, </em>defense counsel waited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>until his cross-examination of a witness before raising an objection to the witness\u2019s testimony. The Court, although citing the established rule that objections must be timely made, nonetheless chose to address the challenged testimony on the merits of the issue, and affirmed the conviction. <em>Whitlow, </em>285 Mont. at 442, 949 P.2d at 247. However, whatever flexibility in the timing of an evidentiary objection may have been bestowed by <em>Whitlow </em>cannot be stretched into a delay of two days after the evidence has been presented to the jury. By then, the challenged evidence will have been deeply implanted into jurors\u2019 memories under layers of new testimony, and any attempt by the trial judge to honor an objection by striking the then-distant testimony would be a difficult endeavor, well illustrating the purpose served by the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">\u00b659 As expressed in <em>Poindexter, </em>adherence to the longstanding rule requiring timely objections is necessary: the issue will not be deemed preserved for appellate review where counsel sits by and permits evidence to be given without objection in the first instance, and then moves to strike on grounds which were manifest and available at the time the evidence was first offered. Thus, we decline to consider Gardner\u2019s issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">\u00b660 We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b472-6\">JUSTICES REGNIER, NELSON and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
