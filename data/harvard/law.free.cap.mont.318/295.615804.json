(\u201cInterBel\u201d) acted <em>ultra vires </em>by providing dial-up Internet access services to its customers. Mooseweb and InterBel filed cross motions for summary judgment. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of InterBel and Mooseweb appeals. We affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether InterBel acted <em>ultra vires </em>and exceeded the scope of business authorized for Cooperatives by Montana law by providing dial-up Internet access service.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b318-13\">\u00b63 InterBel is a Montana corporation organized under the Montana Rural Electric and Telephone Cooperative Act, \u00a7 35-18-101, <em>et. seq., </em>MCA. Mooseweb operates an Internet service provider which provides dial-up Internet access to its customers, and is a member of the InterBel Telephone Cooperative. Mooseweb began providing dial-up access in 1996, and now has customers in Lincoln, Flathead, and Lake Counties. InterBel joined the Internet market in 1999, placing itself in competition with Mooseweb for Mooseweb\u2019s north Lincoln County customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-14\">\u00b64 Mooseweb filed a Complaint against InterBel alleging that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>InterBel is forbidden by Montana law to provide Internet services, and its actions were thereby <em>ultra vires. </em>Mooseweb and InterBel filed cross motions for summary judgment. The District Court granted InterBel\u2019s motion and denied Mooseweb\u2019s motion, concluding that InterBel\u2019s Internet services are not <em>ultra vires. </em>Mooseweb appeals from the District Court\u2019s Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-3\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">\u00b65 We review a district court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment <em>de novo </em>and apply the same criteria as a district court. <em>Minnie v. City of Roundup </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 429, 431, 849 P.2d 212, 214. Summary judgment is appropriate where the movant shows there are no genuine issues of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Lemont Land Corp. v. Rogers </em>(1994), 269 Mont. 180, 183, 887 P.2d 724, 726. The \u201cmoving party has the burden of showing a complete absence of any genuine issue as to all facts considered material in light of the substantive principles that entitle the moving party to judgment as a matter of law and all reasonable inferences are to be drawn in favor of the party opposing summary judgment.\u201d <em>Kolar v. Bergo (1996), </em>280 Mont. 262, 266, 929 P.2d 867, 869.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">\u00b66 Did InterBel act <em>ultra vires </em>and exceed the scope of business authorized for Cooperatives by Montana Law by providing dial-up Internet access service?</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">\u00b67 InterBel is a rural telephone cooperative organized under the Montana Rural Electric and Telephone Cooperative Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), which is codified at \u00a7 35-18-101, <em>et. seq., </em>MCA. The Act was originally enacted in 1939, and has been amended several times. The purposes for which rural cooperatives may be organized and the powers they may exercise are defined strictly by law. <em>See Montana Power Company v. Fergus Electric Co-op </em>(1967), 149 Mont. 258, 262-63, 425 P.2d 329, 332-33. Section 35-18-105, MCA, which identifies permissible purposes for incorporation under the Act, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">Cooperative nonprofit membership corporations may be organized under this chapter:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-9\">(1) for the purpose of supplying electrical energy and promoting and extending the use of electrical energy in rural areas, as provided in this chapter;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-10\">(2) for the purposes of making generally available adequate telephone service, cable television service, or broadband facilities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>through the improvement and expansion of existing telephone, cable television, or broadband facilities and the construction and operation of additional facilities as are required to ensure the availability of service to the widest practicable number of users of telephone service, cable television service, or broadband facilities; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-4\">(3) for purposes allowable under federal authorization, including rural economic development activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Mooseweb argues that pursuant to \u00a7 35-18-105(2), MCA, InterBel is limited to providing \u201cadequate telephone service\u201d and the other services specifically enumerated in the statute, and that its dial-up Internet service, therefore, constitutes an <em>ultra vires </em>act.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\u00b68 It is Mooseweb\u2019s position that the plain meaning of the phrase \u201cadequate telephone service,\u201d as used in \u00a7 35-18-105(2), MCA, proscribes InterBel from providing dial-up Internet access. In its brief, Mooseweb examines dictionary definitions of the words \u201cadequate,\u201d \u201ctelephone,\u201d and \u201cservice,\u201d and urges us to define it as \u201cbasic two-way <em>voice </em>communication on the telephone network, or in other words, ordinary telephone calls that allow private voice conversations between two parties.\u201d This proposed definition originates in an affidavit by Mooseweb\u2019s founder and owner, Fred Weber. Mooseweb argues that Internet access service is completely different from telephone service. An Internet service provider, it argues, provides a computer data connection to the Internet, which originates on a different network, using different protocols, and different technology, and for a different purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">\u00b69 In response to Mooseweb\u2019s proscription argument, InterBel points to recent legislative amendments that ostensibly provide assistance in the interpretation and meaning of \u201cadequate telephone service.\u201d In 1993, the legislature added subsection (3) to \u00a7 35-18-105, MCA, permitting cooperatives to be organized \u201cfor purposes allowable under federal authorization, including rural economic development activities.\u201d The 1993 legislature also amended \u00a7 35-18-106, MCA, to permit cooperatives to engage in activities \u201cauthorized under federal law.\u201d Section 35-18-106(1X1), MCA, now states that a cooperative may \u201cperform all other acts and exercise all other powers that may be necessary, convenient, or appropriate to accomplish the purpose for which the cooperative is organized or authorized under federal law.\u201d InterBel urges that this reference to federal law permissibly draws us to various federal statutes and regulations, specifically the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, that provide a more expansive definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>\u201ctelephone service.\u201d Mooseweb counters by relying on other federal statutes and regulations to support its more limited view of the phrase \u201cadequate telephone service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-3\">\u00b610  Statutory language must be construed according to its plain meaning, and if the language is clear and unambiguous, no further interpretation is required. <em>Mattson v. Montana Power Co., </em>2002 MT 113, \u00b6 10, 309 Mont. 506, \u00b6 10, 48 P.3d 34, \u00b6 10. \u201cWhen construing a statute, our goal is to ascertain and give effect to the legislative intent. If the words of the statute are clear and plain, we discern the intent of the legislature from the text of the statute.\u201d <em>Fliehler v. Uninsured Employers Fund, </em>2002 MT 125, \u00b6 13, 310 Mont. 99, \u00b6 13, 48 P.3d 746, \u00b6 13 (citations omitted). A court\u2019s duty when interpreting a statute is \u201cnot to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">\u00b611 Unfortunately, the Act does not define \u201cadequate telephone service.\u201d In our view the phrase \u201cadequate telephone service\u201d as used in \u00a7 35-18-105(2), MCA, is unclear, vague and ambiguous. An examination of the legislative history of \u00a7 35-18-105(2), MCA, reveals that the phrase was added to the statute in 1957; however, nothing in the legislative history sheds light on the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the statute to aid us in our interpretation. The legislature, however, provided guidance in our task of interpreting the Act. Section 35-18-103, MCA, states: \u201cThis chapter shall be construed liberally. The enumeration of any object, purpose, power, manner, method, or thing shall not be deemed to exclude like or similar objects, purposes, powers, manners, methods, or things.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u00b612 After sorting through the arguments in the summary judgment proceeding, the District Court concluded that while the legislature \u201cmost likely did not foresee the advent of the World Wide Web and the Internet when it passed subsection (2) in 1957-just as it may not have foreseen fiber optic cable, touch tone dialing, cordless telephones, automatic redial, call waiting, and a hundred other advances-the mandate to liberally construe the Act provides the latitude necessary to permit technological progress, so long as the advances are reasonably related to the business of providing telephone and cable television service.\u201d The District Court further determined that the federal government\u2019s definition of \u201ctelephone service\u201d encompassed \u201cmuch more than voice communication between telephone handsets.\u201d The District Court reasoned that the Internet market was a permissible activity for InterBel to enter.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\u00b613 We agree with the District Court, although we see no need to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>venture into federal law for our analysis. The mandate of \u00a7 35-18-103, MCA, is clear. Not only did the legislature direct us to liberally construe the Act, it specifically provided, in the second sentence of \u00a7 35-18-103, MCA, that, <em>\u201c[t]he enumeration of any object, purpose, power, manner, method, or thing shall not be deemed to exclude like or similar objects, purposes, powers, manners, or things. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added). This unique statutory guidepost is compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">\u00b614 Nonetheless, Mooseweb contends that Internet services, such as web-site hosting, modems, computer installation, and support are not \u201clike or similar\u201d to \u201cadequate telephone service.\u201d Mooseweb points out that the hardware and software associated with computer and Internet access is entirely different than two-way simultaneous voice communication. We cannot accept Mooseweb\u2019s narrow view of \u00a7 35-18-105, MCA, and its interpretation of \u201cadequate telephone service\u201d when considering the statutory backdrop of \u00a7 35-18-103, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\u00b615 Rather than focusing on the difference in technologies, we believe the more appropriate inquiry is to examine the purpose or end result of the communication. E-mail has replaced traditional voice communication for many of us; now we routinely communicate with friends, relatives and business associates through electronic mail rather than a telephone call. Fax transmissions over phone lines are commonplace and provide a preferable method of transporting various types of documents. Even voice communication can be transmitted over the Internet. All of this information and data is transmitted over phone lines by means of the dial-up connection. In essence, these new technologies in many instances have replaced the telephone as the instrument of choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\u00b616  In the final analysis, we agree with the District Court and InterBel that dial-up Internet service, albeit not specifically enumerated under \u00a7 35-18-105(2), MCA, is sufficiently \u201clike or similar\u201d to telephone service so as to be allowable under the Act. In the words of the District Court, dial-up Internet service is \u201creasonably related to the business of providing telephone or cable television service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\u00b617 We affirm the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b322-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, LEAPHART, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
