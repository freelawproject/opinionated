Haddon of the United States District Court for the District of Montana, Great Falls Division, certified two questions to this Court. By order dated March 7, 2002, Judge Haddon recused himself, and Chief Judge Donald W. Molloy of the United States District Court for the District of Montana, Missoula Division, now presides over the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">\u00b62 The two certified questions presented by the United States District Court are:</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">\u00b63 (1) Are the Great Falls Public School District\u2019s actions of entering into exclusive agreements for the sale of soft drink products in its facilities legislative actions for which a school district is immune from suit under \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA (2001)?</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">\u00b64 (2) Is the Great Falls Public School District subject to suit under the Montana Unfair Trade Practices Act, \u00a7 30-14-101, MCA (2001), et. seq., as a \u201cperson\u201d engaged as a \u201cbusiness\u201d as defined in the Act?</p>\n<p id=\"b25-9\">\u00b65 We answer both these questions in the negative and hold that the Great Falls Public School District is neither immune from suit under \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA, for entering into exclusive agreements for the sale of soft drink products, nor a \u201cperson\u201d engaged as a \u201cbusiness,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 30-14-202(2) and (7), MCA, of the Montana Unfair Trade Practices Act (MUTPA).</p>\n<p id=\"b25-10\">\u00b66 According to the facts submitted by the United States District Court, the Board of Trustees of the Great Falls Public School District (hereinafter, Board of Trustees and School District) discussed the possibility of an exclusive soft drink contract as a method of enhancing the School District\u2019s nontax revenue at a public meeting on January 15, 1999. On July 1, 2000, the Board of Trustees adopted Policy Nos. 7210 and 7332. Policy No. 7210 provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[t]he District will seek and utilize all available sources of revenue for financing its educational and related programs. This includes revenues from nontax, local, state and federal sources.\u201d Policy No. 7332 provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[r]evenue enhancement through a variety of District-wide and District approved marketing activities, including but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>not limited to advertising, corporate sponsorship, signage, etc., is a Board-approved venture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">\u00b67 In March 2001, the School District entered into \u201cexclusive\u201d agreements with Coke and Pepsi. Under the terms of those agreements, Coke and Pepsi agreed to pay $250,000 each, or $500,000 total, in annual installments of $50,000, to the School District for the exclusive right to provide vending machines and sell soft drink products at the School District\u2019s facilities over the next ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">\u00b68 Prior to June 2001, Montana Vending, Inc. (Montana Vending), supplied soft drink products and vending machines at the School District for about twenty years. After entering these exclusive contracts with Coke and Pepsi, the School District terminated its relationship with Montana Vending. Soft drink products are now sold exclusively by Coke and Pepsi through vending machines owned by them. The School District does, however, provide electricity to operate the machines, liability insurance for the facilities housing the machines, and custodial services to maintain the facilities housing the machines.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">\u00b69 The School District entered into these exclusive agreements with Coke and Pepsi without a public bidding process or public request for proposal. Although Montana Vending was in a position to entertain any proposal made by the School District, it was not afforded an opportunity to participate in or compete for the \u201cexclusive right\u201d to sell soft drink products at the School District\u2019s facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">\u00b610 On August 28, 2001, Montana Vending brought suit against the Coke and Pepsi companies, among others, in state district court, alleging they had violated Montana\u2019s Unfair Trade Practices Act and caused Montana Vending great economic injury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Coke and Pepsi filed a notice to remove the action to federal district court. Montana Vending subsequently dismissed its claim without prejudice and refiled its complaint in state district court, alleging violations of MUTPA and naming the School District as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">\u00b611 Coke, Pepsi, and the other named defendants again sought to remove the matter to federal district court on the basis that the School District had been fraudulently joined. At a hearing on January 24, 2002, the United States District Court concluded that the two questions of law presented above were of \u201cessentially first impression\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>and would determine whether that court had jurisdiction. It therefore certified these questions to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-3\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">\u00b612 Are the Great Falls Public School District\u2019s actions of entering into exclusive agreements for the sale of soft drink products in its facilities legislative actions for which a school district is immune from suit under \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA (2001)?</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">\u00b613 As a governmental entity pursuant to \u00a7 2-9-lll(l)(a), MCA, the School District claims immunity for entering the exclusive contracts with Coke and Pepsi for the sale of soft drink products in its facilities. It argues that the Board of Trustees was acting in a legislative capacity in adopting enabling policies and ultimately authorizing the execution of beverage contracts to fund educational and related programs, and thus should be held immune for its actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">\u00b614 Section 2-9-111(2), MCA, provides that <em>\u201ca </em>governmental entity is immune from suit for a legislative act or omission by its legislative body, or any member or staff of the legislative body, engaged in legislative acts.\u201d A legislative act includes actions by a school board that result in adoption of school board policies pursuant to \u00a7 20-3-323(1), MCA; however, it does not include administrative actions undertaken in the execution of a law or policy. Section 2-9-lll(l)(c)(i)(C) and (l)(c)(ii), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">\u00b615 In <em>Dagel v. City of Great Falls </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 224, 819 P.2d 186, this Court addressed the statutory requirements of \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA, as amended by the Legislature in 1991. We noted that the legislative purpose of the amendment was partly to clarify \u201cthat governmental entities are not immune under the legislative immunity statute for nonlegislative actions.\u201d <em>Dagel, </em>250 Mont. at 233, 819 P.2d at 191. In so noting, we concluded that harassment by a supervisor employed by the City of Great Falls resulting in an employee\u2019s constructive discharge was clearly not a \u201clegislative act\u201d for which immunity could be claimed. <em>Dagel, </em>250 Mont. at 233, 819 P.2d at 191. \u00b616 Following <em>Dagel, </em>this Court had the opportunity to examine whether a teacher was immune from suit under \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA, for her allegedly negligent actions of throwing a shot put on a school playground, striking and injuring a student. <em>Hedges v. Swan Lake and Salmon Prairie School District No. 73 </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 188, 832 P.2d 775 <em>(Hedges II). </em>In <em>Hedges II, </em>we concluded there was no immunity for the school district or any member of its staff because there were no actions by the school board which resulted in the adoption of school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>board policy. <em>Hedges II, </em>253 Mont. at 195, 832 P.2d at 778. As a result, there was no legislative act as defined in \u00a7 2-9-lll(l)(c)(i)(C), MCA (1991), and thus, no immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">\u00b617  In this case, the School Board adopted Policy Nos. 7210 and 7332 for the purpose of raising revenue from nontax sources. The exclusive agreements with Coke and Pepsi entered into some nine months later was in furtherance of this objective. Although the School District asserts these agreements resulted in the adoption of a school board policy, and therefore, come within the sphere of actions which are immunized by \u00a7 2-9-111(2), MCA, it has provided no authority which would compel such a conclusion. Neither does the plain meaning of the immunity statute support the School District\u2019s assertion. For purposes of this case, the statute defines legislative actions as those which \u201cresult in the creation of law,\u201d \u00a7 2-9-lll(l)(c)(i)(A) , MCA, or which \u201cresult in the adoption of school board policies,\u201d \u00a7 2-9-lll(l)(c)(i)(C), MCA. Thus, these provisions immunize a legislative body\u2019s adoption or enactment of policy in furtherance of its constitutional or statutory duties. Here, the School District is insulated from legal challenge for its decision to enhance nontax revenue by way of commercial engagements, the essence of Policy Nos. 7210 and 7332.</p>\n<p id=\"AF\">\u00b618  It does not follow from this statutory language, however, that actions taken by a school district to effectuate the policies it has adopted are also immunized. Indeed, \u00a7 2-9-lll(l)(c)(ii), MCA, clearly states otherwise, providing that \u201cadministrative acts undertaken in the execution of a law or public policy\u201d are not immunized. <em>See also Kiely Const. LLC v. City of Red Lodge, </em>2002 MT 241, \u00b6 83, 312 Mont. 52, \u00b6 83, 57 P.3d 836, \u00b6 83, citin<em>g Knight v. City of Missoula </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 232, 245, 827 P.2d 1270, 1278 (recognizing that the 1991 amendments to \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA, \u201cmake clear that a governmental entity is no longer immune for <em>all </em>its actions,\u201d only legislative actions). The School District\u2019s agreements with Coke and Pepsi, entered pursuant to Policy Nos. 7210 and 7332, are precisely the kind of administrative actions, taken to execute policy, which are exempted from the immunizing effect of the statute. Because the School District\u2019s agreements with Coke and Pepsi were in execution of previously adopted Policy Nos. 7210 and 7332, we conclude they were administrative, not legislative acts. Accordingly, we hold the School District is not immune from suit for entering into the exclusive agreements for the sale of soft drink products in its facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">\u00b619 Is the Great Falls Public School District subject to suit under the Montana Unfair Trade Practices Act as a \u201cperson\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>engaged in \u201cbusiness\u201d as defined in the Act?</p>\n<p id=\"b29-3\">\u00b620 Section 30-14-205, MCA, provides, in relevant part, that it is unlawful for a person, directly or indirectly, to enter an agreement for the purpose of fixing the price or regulating the production of an article of commerce in order to restrict trade to prevent competition in the distribution or sale of merchandise or commodities. According to \u00a7 30-14-202(7), MCA, of the Montana Trade Practices Act, the term \u201cperson\u201d \u201cincludes any person, partnership, firm, corporation, joint-stock company, or other association engaged in business within this state.\u201d \u201cBusiness\u201d is defined as \u201cany person, domestic or foreign, engaged in the production, manufacture, distribution, purchasing, or sale of any article of commerce within the state of Montana.\u201d Section 30-14-202(2), MCA. Because public entities, such as school districts, are not specifically mentioned in these definitions, we must look further to determine whether the School District is a \u201cperson\u201d engaged as a \u201cbusiness\u201d under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">\u00b621 When interpreting a statute, our objective is to implement the objectives the legislature sought to achieve. <em>Western Energy Co. v. State, </em>1999 MT 289, \u00b6 11, 297 Mont. 55, \u00b6 11, 990 P.2d 767, \u00b6 11. The legislative intent is to be ascertained, in the first instance, from the plain meaning of the words used. <em>Cenex, Inc. v. Bd. of Com\u2019rs for Yellowstone County </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 330, 335, 941 P.2d 964, 967. If the intent of the legislature can be determined from the plain meaning of the words used in the statute, the plain meaning controls, and this Court need go no further nor apply any other means of interpretation. <em>Gulbrandson v. Carey </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 494, 500, 901 P.2d 573, 577. It is only when the intent cannot be ascertained from the language of the statute, that we examine legislative history. <em>Gulbrandson, </em>272 Mont. at 500, 901 P.2d at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\u00b622 Montana Vending argues that the School District is a \u201cperson\u201d engaged as a \u201cbusiness\u201d under MUTPA. In support of its contention, Montana Vending asserts that, by using the term \u201cincludes\u201d in its definition of \u201cperson,\u201d the legislature intended a broad and inclusive interpretation of the term which must be construed to \u201csubserve the beneficial purposes\u201d of MUTPA. <em>See </em>\u00a7 30-14-201, MCA. Accordingly, the list of \u201cpersons\u201d identified in \u00a7 30-14-202(7), MCA, should not be considered exhaustive, but merely a list of possibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\u00b623 In response, the School District and other named defendants argue that the plain language of MUTPA does not include school districts. They emphasize that when interpreting a statute, \u201cthe office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d <em>Infinity Ins. v. Dodson, </em>2000 MT 287, \u00b6 46, 302 Mont. 209, \u00b6 46, 14 P.3d 487, \u00b6 46. Citing no fewer than twenty instances throughout the code specifically including political subdivisions and other governmental entities in its definition of \u201cperson,\u201d the School District surmises that if the legislature had intended for MUTPA to apply to school districts, it would have so stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">\u00b624 In the 1912 case <em>In re Beck\u2019s Estate </em>(1912), 44 Mont. 561, 576, 121 P. 784, 788, cited by the defendants Coca-Cola Company and BCI Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Los Angeles (collectively, Coke), this Court held that the State Orphans\u2019 Home was not a \u201cperson\u201d capable of receiving a testamentary disposition of property. Noting that the purpose of the legislation allowing a testamentary disposition to be made to any \u201cperson\u201d capable of taking was to prescribe rules to regulate the conduct, and protect and control the rights of citizens, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-5\">Therefore, the rule to be observed in the construction of statutes is, that the state is not included by general words therein creating a right and providing a remedy for its enforcement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-6\"><em>In re Beck\u2019s Estate, </em>44 Mont. at 574, 121 P. at 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">\u00b625 In <em>State v. Hultgren </em>(1975), 168 Mont. 257, 261, 541 P.2d 1211, 1213, we reaffirmed the holding <em>in Beck </em>with the following general rule of statutory construction set forth in C.J.S. Statutes \u00a7 317:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-8\">The government, whether federal or state, and its agencies are not ordinarily to be considered as within the purview of a statute, however general and comprehensive the language of the act may be, unless intention to include them is clearly manifest, as where they are expressly named therein, or included by necessary implication.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">\u00b626 Today, the general rule regarding inclusion in words such as \u201cperson\u201d is set forth at 82 C.J.S. \u00a7 311 (1999):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-10\">A statute regulating only persons and corporations does not include the government itself, unless a contrary intention is clearly expressed. Thus, the word \u201cperson\u201d used in a statute will not be construed so as to include the sovereign, whether the United States, or a state, or an agency thereof, or a city or town. However, the word may include the sovereign where the legislative intent to do so is manifest. Whether the word \u201cperson,\u201d as used in a statute, encompasses a state or the United States therefore depends on the context in which the word is found, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>including the purpose of the statute, the subject matter, and the legislative history.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">\u00b627 Without resorting to MUTPA\u2019s legislative history, we note that the Act plainly applies to natural persons, partnerships, firms, corporations, joint-stock companies, and other associations engaged in business within this state. Section 30-14-202(7), MCA. Nowhere in the statute are school districts specifically identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">\u00b628 Nonetheless, Montana Vending argues that the School District qualifies as a \u201cperson\u201d because, literally defined, it is an \u201cassociation.\u201d In support of its contention, Montana Vending cites Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defining \u201cassociation,\u201d in pertinent part, as \u201ca gathering of people for a common purpose.\u201d Reasoning that a school district is such a gathering, Montana Vending concludes that the School District is an association and therefore falls within the definition of \u201cperson\u201d under MUTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\u00b629 In response, the defendant, Admiral Beverage Corporation (Admiral Beverage), asserts that Montana Vending\u2019s own definition of association-\u201ca gathering of people for a common purpose\u201d \u2014 necessarily cannot apply to school districts because it speaks of a group of humans. It notes that, as defined in Title 20, chapter 6 of the Montana Code Annotated, a school district is a <em>\u201cterritory </em>... organized under the provisions of this title to provide public educational services under the jurisdiction of the trustees prescribed by this title.\u201d Section 20-6-101, MCA (emphasis added). Stressing that MUTPA requires a literal construction \u201cso that its beneficial purposes may be subserved,\u201d Admiral Beverage argues that the School District cannot be an association because, by definition, it is a territory. <em>See </em>\u00a7 30-14-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">\u00b630 The term \u201cperson\u201d ordinarily refers to a living human being-a natural person. <em>In re Beck\u2019s Estate, </em>44 Mont. at 572, 121 P. at 787. As used in \u00a7 30-14-202(7), MCA, of MUTPA, the term \u201cperson\u201d also includes corporations and other business entities. A school district, however, is neither a natural person, partnership, corporation, association, or other organization of persons. Rather, it is part of the local government as defined in \u00a7 2-6-401(l)(a), MCA, and a political subdivision of the state. Section 2-9-101(5), MCA; <em>see also Becky v. Butte-Silver Bow School Dist. </em># <em>1 </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 131, 137, 906 P.2d 193, 196 (concluding that a school district is a public body for the purposes of the \u201cright to know\u201d provision of Article II, Section 9, of the Montana Constitution). Because school districts are, by definition, a governmental entity, as defined in \u00a7 2-9-101(3) and (5), MCA, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>examine the plain language of MUTPA for legislative intent to include the government within the meaning of \u201cperson.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">\u00b631 Montana Vending contends that the legislature manifested its intent to include governmental entities as persons under the Act by choosing not to create a specific exemption for public bodies, such as school districts. In support of its contention, Montana Vending points out that MUTPA contains only one exemption for public or governmental entities, which is found in part one of the Act. Section 30-14-105, MCA, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Exemptions. Nothing in this part shall apply to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-6\">(1) actions or transactions permitted under laws administered by the Montana Public Service Commission acting under statutory authority of this part or the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Montana Vending argues that if the legislature intended to exempt school districts from MUTPA, as it did for the Public Service Commission, it would have clearly manifested that intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">\u00b632 We first note that, contrary to Montana Vending\u2019s assertion, \u00a7 30-14-105, MCA, does not wholly exempt the Public Service Commission from the provisions of that part, but limits the exemption to \u201cactions or transactions permitted under laws administered by\u201d the Commission. Section 30-14-105(1), MCA. Further, while part one of MUTPA is entitled \u201cConsumer Protection Act\u201d and offers general consumer protection, part two, entitled \u201cUnfair Trade Practices Generally,\u201d primarily covers anti-competitive practices to protect businesses from the predatory practices of other businesses. <em>Granbois v. Big Horn County Elec. </em>Co-Op., 1999 MT 222, \u00b6 31, 296 Mont. 45, \u00b6 31, 986 P.2d 1097, \u00b6 31. In <em>Granbois, </em>we held that part one, found at \u00a7 30-14-105(1), MCA, \u201cclearly exempts only those transactions regulated by the Public Service Commission.\u201d <em>Granbois, </em>\u00b6 30. Further, we noted that \u201cit is apparent that the legislature provided different exemption provisions in parts one and two.\u201d <em>Granbois, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">\u00b633 In this case, Montana Vending has brought its claim under part two of MUTPA, alleging unlawful trade practices generally. As noted in <em>Granbois, </em>the legislative purpose of the two parts is not the same. <em>Granbois, </em>\u00b6 31. Accordingly, we are unpersuaded the legislature intended to include school districts as \u201cpersons\u201d under MUTPA simply because it declined to create a special exemption for governmental entities in part two.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">\u00b634  Further, the articulated purpose of the Act is \u201cto safeguard the public against the creation or perpetuation of monopolies and foster and encourage competition by prohibiting unfair and discriminatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>practices by which fair and honest competition is destroyed or prevented.\u201d Section 30-14-201, MCA. As a general rule, the government acts as a market regulator and not a competitor. 15A Am. Jur.2d Commerce \u00a7 37 (2003). Accordingly, the plain and ordinary interpretation of this language is that MUTPA was created to apply to <em>businesses, </em>not government.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">\u00b635 The conclusion that the School District does not qualify as a \u201cperson\u201d under MUTPA finds further support in several California state court decisions, construing the similarly worded California Unfair Practices Act and Unfair Competition Act. In <em>Community Memorial Hosp. of San Buena Ventura v. County of Ventura </em>(1996), 50 Cal.App.4th 199, 209, 56 Cal.Rptr.2d 732, 738, the Court of Appeals held that a county community hospital was not a \u201cperson\u201d under the state\u2019s Unfair Practices Act. Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code \u00a7 17021 (1997) (defining \u201cperson\u201d as \u201cany person, firm, association, organization, partnership, business trust, company, corporation or municipal or other public corporation\u201d). Noting that, \u201cin the absence of express words to the contrary, neither the state nor its subdivision are included within the general words of a statute,\u201d the court reasoned that including the \u201ccounty in the Unfair Practices Act... as it relates to the operation of its hospital would result in an infringement on its sovereign powers.\u201d <em>Community Memorial Hosp., </em>50 Cal.App.4th. at 210, 56 Cal.Rptr.2d at 738-39. Accordingly, the court concluded the county could not be held liable under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\u00b636 More recently, in <em>Trinkle v. California State Lottery </em>(1999), 71 Cal.App.4th. 1198, 1203-04, 84 Cal.Rptr.2d 496, 499, the court held the state lottery was not a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of the Unfair Competition Act, and thus, could not be sued for violating the Act\u2019s provisions, even if the state lottery operated in the fashion of a private business. Like MUTPA, California\u2019s Unfair Competition Act (UCA) prescribes penalties against \u201cpersons\u201d who engage in acts of unfair competition. Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 17203,17206 (1997). Under the UCA, \u201cperson\u201d includes \u201cnatural persons, corporations, firms, partnerships, joint stock companies, associations, and other organizations of persons.\u201d <em>See </em>Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17201 (1997). Noting the general rule that words of a statute must be given their ordinary meaning and receive a commonsense construction, the Court of Appeals stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-6\">[t]he state is neither a natural person, partnership, corporation, association, nor other \u201corganization of persons.\u201d It is a sovereign entity representing the people. Only through an unreasonable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>strained construction can the state be deemed to fall within any of the statute\u2019s definitional categories.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-5\"><em>Trinkle, </em>71 Cal.App.4th at 1203, 84 Cal.Rptr.2d at 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">\u00b637  We similarly conclude and hold that the plain meaning of \u201cperson,\u201d as defined by MUTPA at \u00a7 30-14-202(7), MCA, does not include school districts. To conclude otherwise would result in a strained interpretation of the Act and infringe upon the governmental entity\u2019s statutory powers to raise revenue for the purpose of funding education related programs. <em>See </em>\u00a7 20-6-607, MCA (authorizing trustees of any district to lease district property and use any money collected for any proper school purpose).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">\u00b638 The second issue posed by this certified question is whether the School District is engaged as a \u201cbusiness,\u201d as defined by MUTPA. Montana Vending argues the School District is engaged as a business because it deeply involved itself in the sale and distribution of soft drink products by entering the exclusive ten-year agreements with Coke and Pepsi, and points out that in addition to supplying the electricity, liability insurance, and custodial services for the facilities housing Coke and Pepsi\u2019s vending machines, the School District, through its students, has provided a ready and captive market for the sale of Defendants\u2019 soft drink products.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">\u00b639 However, \u00a7 30-14-202(2), MCA, defines \u201cbusiness\u201d as including \u201cany <em>person, </em>domestic or foreign, engaged in the production, manufacture, distribution, purchasing, or sale of any article of commerce within the state of Montana.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Because we have already determined that the School District is not a \u201cperson\u201d under MUTPA, it necessarily cannot be engaged as a \u201cbusiness\u201d as the term is defined at \u00a7 30-14-202(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">\u00b640  The School District\u2019s act of entering exclusive agreements for the sale of soft drink products in its facilities is not a legislative act as defined at \u00a7 2-9-lll(l)(c)(i)(C), MCA, and thus, the School District is not immune from suit under \u00a7 2-9-111(2), MCA. However, because we conclude the School District is not a \u201cperson\u201d engaged as a \u201cbusiness,\u201d as defined at \u00a7 30-14-207(2) and (7), MCA, we hold the School District is not subject to suit under the Montana Unfair Trade Practices Act, \u00a7 30-14-101, MCA, et. seq.</p>\n<judges id=\"b34-11\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER, LEAPHART and COTTER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b26-9\">In addition to the School District, Montana Vending brought suit against six corporations, including Coke and Pepsi, involved in the manufacture and distribution of soft drink products.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
