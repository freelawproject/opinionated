The Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, held that the franchise fee constitutes an illegal tax. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether a franchise fee based on 4 percent of gross annual revenue generated by each utility that occupies the public rights-of-way within the city constitutes a tax on the sale of utility services?</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">\u00b63 On October 23,2000, the Billings City Council adopted Ordinance No. 00-5133, entitled the \u201cCity of Billings Right-of-Way Management Ordinance\u201d (\u201cthe ordinance\u201d). The stated purpose of the ordinance was to protect the public rights-of-way within the city against damage and unauthorized encroachment; minimize public inconvenience during utility emplacement or maintenance; recover the costs of regulation and oversight; recover fair compensation for the occupation of the rights-of-way; and prevent premature exhaustion of the right-of-way capacity to accommodate telecommunications, utilities and other public services. To accomplish these goals, the ordinance set forth a comprehensive regulatory scheme for leasing city-owned property, licensing non-governmental entities whose facilities pass through the rights-of-way and executing franchise agreements with businesses that occupy the rights-of-way to service customers within the city. Under the ordinance, each lessee, licensee and franchisee must obtain a work permit, post a performance bond, secure insurance and comply with the various notice provisions of the ordinance before entering city-controlled property to install or maintain facilities. Each must also pay fees in accordance with (1) a lease of city property based on fair market rent, (2) a pass-through license based on a per-foot annual assessment, or (3) a franchise fee based on 4 percent of gross annual revenues received from the provision of telecommunications or utility services within the city. Under the ordinance, operative franchise contracts remain valid and enforceable for the terms of the existing agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"Amh\">\u00b64 Montana Dakota Utilities (MDU), Montana Power Company and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Yellowstone Valley Electric Cooperative (collectively, \u201cthe Utilities\u201d) filed an Amended Complaint on February 1, 2001. The Utilities challenged the franchise fee provisions of the ordinance as an illegal tax on the sale of their services within the city and sought a declaratory judgment. Touch America, Inc., intervened as a plaintiff without objection. By stipulation, the parties agreed that MDU would not be required to file a franchise application required by the ordinance until its 25-year franchise agreement with the City of Billings (hereafter \u201cthe City\u201d) expires in 2004. The City Council delayed enforcement of the ordinance pending the resolution of the legal challenge in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">\u00b65 On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court ruled on September 20,2001, that the ordinance\u2019s franchise fee constituted an unlawful tax. The court also held that the franchise fee provisions of the ordinance were severable from the provisions that otherwise regulated use of the public rights-of-way in the City. However, a successful initiative drive placed the ordinance on the November 2001 ballot, and Billings voters rejected the measure by a margin of 58 to 42 percent. The City filed a timely appeal, and oral argument was heard before this Court on September 17, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">\u00b66 Our standard of review on appeal from summary judgment rulings is <em>de novo. Motarie v. N. Mont. Joint Refuse Disposal </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 239, 242, 907 P.2d 154, 156. We apply the same evaluation as the district court based on Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., and <em>Bruner v. Yellowstone County </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 261, 264, 900 P.2d 901, 903. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Carbon County v. Union Reserve Coal Co. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 459, 469, 898 P.2d 680, 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">\u00b67  This Court normally does not address moot questions, i.e., questions that once existed but no longer present an actual controversy. <em>Lewistown Propane Co. v. Moncur, </em>2002 MT 349, \u00b6 14, 313 Mont. 368, \u00b6 14, 61 P.3d 780, \u00b6 14 (citation omitted). Although voter rejection of the ordinance in November 2001 mooted issues concerning the legal validity of that measure, the Utilities urge this Court to accept jurisdiction under the exception for issues which are capable of repetition yet avoid review. The Utilities cite <em>Skinner Enterprises, Inc. v. Lewis &amp; Clark City-County Health Dept., </em>1999 MT 106, 294 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>310, 980 P.2d 1049, in which we set forth a two-part burden that the party invoking the exception must shoulder: (1) the challenged action must be too short in duration to be fully litigated prior to cessation; and (2) there must be a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be subject to the same action again. <em>Skinner, </em>\u00b6 18 <em>(citing Heisler v. Hines Motor Co. </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 270, 275-76, 937 P.2d 45, 48).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-3\">\u00b68 The Utilities point out that the Billings City Council passed an ordinance in 1992 that incorporated franchise fee provisions similar to those charged by the ordinance subject to this appeal. When a referendum drive placed the 1992 ordinance before the voters, the City withdrew the measure. In the case before us today, Billings voters disapproved the ordinance about six weeks after the District Court ruled the franchise fee provisions illegal, but before this Court had an opportunity to address the City\u2019s appeal. The Utilities assert that, in the absence of a final determination by this Court of the fee\u2019s legality, the City may again bring forth a similar local ordinance that impresses a franchise fee upon utilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">\u00b69  We have consistently held that the existence of a justiciable controversy is a threshold requirement to a court\u2019s granting relief. <em>Powder River County v. State, </em>2002 MT 259, \u00b6 101, 312 Mont. 198, \u00b6 101, 60 P.3d 357, \u00b6 101 (citing <em>Shamrock Motors, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>1999 MT 21, \u00b6\u00b6 17-19, 293 Mont. 188, \u00b6\u00b6 17-19, 974 P.2d 1150, \u00b6\u00b6 17-19). The test for a justiciable controversy consists of three elements: (1) the parties have existing and genuine, as distinguished from theoretical, rights or interests; (2) the controversy must be one upon which the judgment of the court may effectively operate, as distinguished from a debate or argument invoking a purely political, administrative, philosophical or academic conclusion; and (3) there must be a controversy the judicial determination of which will have the effect of a final judgment in law or decree in equity upon the rights, status or legal relationships of one or more of the real parties in interest, or lacking these qualities be of such overriding public moment as to constitute the legal equivalent of all of them. <em>Powder River County, \u00b6 </em>102 (citing <em>Northfield Ins. Co. v. Montana Ass\u2019n of Counties, </em>2000 MT 256, \u00b6 12, 301 Mont. 472, \u00b6 12, 10 P.3d 813, \u00b6 12 ).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">\u00b610  The franchise fee provision of the ordinance under consideration presents the issue of whether the fee violates Montana\u2019s statutory prohibition against local governments imposing a tax on the sale of goods and services, \u00a7 7-1-112(1), MCA. When certain public utilities were released from monopoly regulation by state and federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>governments during recent years, local governments re-evaluated their practice of granting franchises for utility use and occupation of city streets and alleys at no cost. <em>See, </em>Roger D. Colton and Michael F. Sheehan, <em>Raising Local Government Revenue Through Utility Franchise Charges: If the Fee Fits, Foot It, </em>21 Urb. Law. 55 (1989); Clarence A. West, <em>The Information Highway Must Pay Its Way Through Cities: A Discussion of the Authority of State and Local Governments to be Compensated For the Use of Public Rights-of-Way, </em>Mich. Telecomm. &amp; Tech. L. Rev. 29 (1994-95). Given the inclination of Montana\u2019s local government leaders to exploit potential new sources of revenue, we anticipate the question of whether the Montana Legislature has checked the power of local governments to charge franchise fees will, in the absence of appellate review, arise again. Franchise law is relatively undeveloped in Montana. However, this case may be resolved on the basis of statutory interpretation. We conclude that appellate review of the franchise fee controversy will have the effect of a final judgment in law regarding the rights of local governments and utilities and is appropriate at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">\u00b611 In accepting jurisdiction, we limit our review to the issue of whether the ordinance\u2019s franchise fee constitutes an illegal tax, proscribed by \u00a7 7-1-112(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">\u00b612 Is a franchise fee based on 4 percent of gross annual revenue generated by each utility that occupies the public rights-of-way within the City a tax on the sale of utility services?</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">\u00b613 A franchise is a \u201cspecial privilege in the streets, highways, and public places of the city, whether granted by the state or the city, which does not belong to citizens generally by common right.\u201d Section 7-3-4201(3), MCA. Since the nineteenth century, state and local governments in Montana have granted franchises to private or public corporations for the construction and maintenance of infrastructures within the public rights-of-way to provide essential services to the public. <em>See Davenport v. Kleinschmidt </em>(1887), 6 Mont. 502, 13 P. 249 (water franchise); <em>Hershfield v. Rocky Mt. B. T. Co. </em>(1892), 12 Mont. 102, 29 P. 883 (telephone franchise); <em>State ex rel. Deeney v. Butte Elec. &amp; Power Co. </em>(1911), 43 Mont. 118, 115 P. 44 (grant of electric franchise does not grant right to provide gas service); <em>State ex rel. City of Billings v. Billings Gas Co. </em>(1918), 55 Mont. 102, 173 P. 799 (gas franchise); <em>City of Helena v. Helena Light &amp; Ry. Co. </em>(1922), 63 Mont. 108, 207 P. 337 (street railroad franchise).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">\u00b614 This Court characterized a franchise as property that \u201cis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>incorporeal and intangible in its nature.\u201d <em>Glodt v. City of Missoula </em>(1948), 121 Mont. 178, 183, 190 P.2d 545, 547. A franchise is the special privilege awarded by government to a person or corporation and conveys a valuable property right.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\">\u00b615 The City is a municipal corporation with its own governmental charter. A local government under a self-government charter may exercise any power not prohibited by the Montana Constitution, state law or its own charter. Art. XI, Sec. 6, Mont. Const. (1972); \u00a7 7-1-101, MCA. Section 7-1-106, MCA, further states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-4\">The powers and authority of a local government unit with self-government powers shall be liberally construed. Every reasonable doubt as to the existence of a local government power or authority shall be resolved in favor of the existence of that power or authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\u00b616 Only by express statutory prohibition does Montana law preempt a self-governing municipality from acting in a certain area. <em>D &amp; F Sanitation v. City of Billings </em>(1986), 219 Mont. 437, 445, 713 P.2d 977, 982. The statutory prohibition pertinent to the resolution of this case, \u00a7 7-1-112, MCA, limits the authority of local government as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">A local government with self-government powers is prohibited the exercise of the following powers unless the power is specifically delegated by law:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">(1) the power to authorize a tax on income or the sale of goods or services ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">\u00b617 The District Court held that the franchise fee that the City sought to charge the Utilities by ordinance was an illegal tax on the sale of services provided within city limits. The court reviewed three cases in which this Court construed \u00a7 7-1-112(1), MCA, and distinguished permissible municipal fees from illegal taxes. An analysis of those cases follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">\u00b618 <em>Montana Innkeepers Assoc. v. City of Billings </em>(1983), 206 Mont. 425, 671 P.2d 21, involved a $1.00 fee imposed by the City on adults for each day of hotel or motel occupancy in the City. Although the City charged the occupants and not the businesses, this Court concluded that the fee imposed an illegal tax on the sale of temporary lodging. <em>Montana Innkeepers, </em>206 Mont. at 430, 671 P.2d at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">\u00b619 In <em>Brueggemann v. City of Billings </em>(1986), 221 Mont. 375, 719 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>P.2d 768, we examined an ordinance subjecting every lawyer or law firm practicing within the City to an annual licensing fee based on gross revenue generated by the attorneys. Because the fee was unrelated to any regulation of the local bar association by the City, this Court characterized the fee as an impermissible sales tax on attorney services. <em>Brueggemann, </em>221 Mont. at 378, 719 P.2d at 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">\u00b620 The District Court also compared the franchise fee to municipal fees charged to developers for new hook-ups to a city\u2019s sewer and water systems. This Court earlier upheld such municipal fees as a legal exercise of a city\u2019s self-governing powers. <em>Lechner v. City of Billings </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 195, 797 P.2d 191. In <em>Lechner, </em>the City placed the collected fees in a special account earmarked for sewer and water system improvement. We reasoned in <em>Lechner </em>that the new homeowners, churches, schools and businesses that generated the need for additional water and sewer capacity directly benefitted from the expenditure of the development fees for system expansion. <em>Lechner, </em>244 Mont. at 199, 797 P.2d at 208. Rather than a tax \u201clevied for the general public good,\u201d the fees were \u201cimposed for the benefit of new users of the water and sewer facilities whose use of these systems gives rise to the need for the additional water and sewer capacity.\u201d <em>Lechner, </em>244 Mont. at 199, 797 P.2d at 208. In contrast to the fee in <em>Montana Innkeepers, </em>the fee in <em>Lechner </em>was \u201cdirectly related to the City\u2019s authority to regulate municipal utilities.\u201d We noted that the revenues were placed in a special fund earmarked for expanding the City\u2019s water and sewer facilities. <em>Lechner, </em>244 Mont. at 199, 797 P.2d at 208. Contrary to the City\u2019s contention, <em>Lechner </em>did not draw the broad conclusion that the constitution permits localities to charge fees and rents. Rather, <em>Lechner </em>upheld the fee as reasonably related to the regulatory purpose for which it would be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">\u00b621 The purpose of the water and sewer fee set <em>Lechner </em>apart from <em>Montana Innkeepers </em>and Brueggemann. The <em>Lechner </em>decision involved a classic regulatory fee, charged to those who requested a new service, grounded in the cost of providing that service. Furthermore, the fee was used for regulatory purposes. The taxes in <em>Montana Innkeepers </em>and <em>Brueggemann </em>were, in contrast, based upon a business transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">\u00b622 In the case at hand, the District Court noted that the fees to be collected from franchisees in the City were not earmarked for right-of-way maintenance or regulation but would be used to reduce general property taxes and to fund transportation improvement projects, public safety operations and park maintenance. The court determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>that, unlike the property owners in <em>Lechner </em>who benefited from the development fee that increased the cost of their new building, the Utilities would receive no direct benefit from a franchise fee that the City planned to deposit in the general fund account. The court also concluded that a franchise fee based on gross revenue constituted a charge placed on the Utilities\u2019 business transactions that was similar to the illegal fees exacted in <em>Montana Innkeepers </em>and <em>Brueggemann.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A9a\">\u00b623 The court employed the three-part test set forth in <em>City of Lakewood v. Pierce County </em>(Wash.Ct.App. 2001), 23 P.3d 1, to determine whether the City\u2019s franchise fee constituted a sales tax. The Washington Court held: \u201c[I]f the charges are intended to raise money, they are taxes; if the charges are primarily tools of regulation, they are not taxes.\u201d <em>Lakewood, </em>23 P.3d at 7. It reasoned that regulatory fees are assessed to address problems caused by those who are required to pay the fees and, as long as that nexus exists, the authority to charge fees comes within the police powers of the city. The <em>Lakewood </em>test distinguishes a regulatory franchise fee from a tax on the following grounds: (1) whether the primary purpose is to raise revenue or to regulate; (2) whether the money collected is allocated only to the authorized regulatory purpose; and (3) whether there is a direct relationship between the fee charged and the service received by those who pay the fee or between the fee charged and the burden produced by the fee-payer. <em>Lakewood, </em>23 P.3d at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-3\">\u00b624 By applying the <em>Lakewood </em>test to the City\u2019s franchise fee, the District Court determined: (1) the primary purpose of the ordinance was to raise revenue; (2) the money collected would be placed in the general fund and was not allocated to any specific regulatory activity, such as managing and maintaining the public rights-of-way; and (3) the relationship between the fee charged and the services rendered or burden imposed upon the public rights-of-way was uncertain. The court also noted that the City\u2019s franchise fee was not subject to negotiation but imposed on the Utilities unilaterally by ordinance. Because the City planned to collect franchise fees as a revenue-generator and would not deposit the fees in a special account for right-of-way maintenance or regulation, the court concluded that the fee was a tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">\u00b625 This Court has held that a governmental demand for money made for the purpose of raising revenue is a tax. <em>State ex rel. State Aeronautics Comm\u2019n v. Bd. of Exam. </em>(1948), 121 Mont. 402, 407-08, 194 P.2d 633, 636-37, overruled on other grounds by <em>Bd. of Regents v. Judge </em>(1975), 168 Mont. 433, 445, 543 P.2d 1323, 1330. <em>Brueggemann, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number><em>Montana Innkeepers </em>and <em>Lechner </em>honor the rule that \u201c[i]f charges are primarily to raise money, they are taxes. If the charges are primarily tools of regulation, they are not taxes.\u201d 16 E. McQuillin, <em>Municipal Corporations, </em>Sec. 44.02 at 2 (3rd ed., supp. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">\u00b626  In the present case, the gross revenue fee is separate and apart from the City\u2019s police power over public streets and alleys. Section 12 of the ordinance defines \u201cgross revenue\u201d as the compensation received from the provision of telecommunications services or utility services, both of which are defined in section 6 as the \u201coffering\u201d of telecommunications, electric power, manufactured or natural gas, or water \u201cfor a fee directly to the public.\u201d Accordingly, the gross revenue fee, like the taxes in <em>Montana Innkeepers </em>and <em>Brueggemann, </em>is based exclusively on the sale of a product or service within the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\u00b627 The City contends that the District Court, in limiting its analysis to the question of whether the charge was a \u201ctax\u201d or a \u201c regulatory fee,\u201d ignored its contention that the charge was neither a tax nor a fee, but rather a \u201crent\u201d for a public utility\u2019s occupation of the right-of-way. The City, relying on <em>State ex rel. Malott v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs </em>(1930), 89 Mont. 37, 296 P. 1, contends that a charge is not a tax when it is levied in return for a special benefit. Applying the <em>\u201cMalott </em>test\u201d to the present case, the City argues that the gross revenue charge will be paid only in return for the grant of a specific benefit (the franchise) and is therefore not a \u201ctax\u201d but in the nature of \u201crent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">\u00b628 We note first of all, that the City\u2019s relationship with the public streets and alleys is not that of a traditional proprietor. Under Montana law, the state, not the City, \u201chas ownership and control of all city streets,\u201d with local governments as the trustees. <em>State v. City of Helena </em>(1981), 193 Mont. 441, 444, 632 P.2d 332, 334. Use of city streets is authorized by statute, \u00a7 69-4-101, MCA; \u00a7 35-18-106(8), MCA; and \u00a7 70-30-102, MCA. Although the City has regulatory authority over its streets, \u00a7 7-3-4313, MCA, and \u00a7 7-3-4449, MCA, it does not have the power to exclude public utilities. <em>State ex rel. Rocky Mountain Bell Tel. Co. v. Mayor of City of Red Lodge </em>(1904), 30 Mont. 338, 346, 76 P. 758, 761. Pursuant to this statutory authority, the Utilities herein have occupied the streets and alleys of the City for many years. As they point out, the fact that they remain subject to the City\u2019s police and regulatory powers does not make them \u201ctenants\u201d in the same sense as a private business that, for example, rents space in the City\u2019s airport. Furthermore, given that the Utilities occupied the rights-of-way for years prior to enactment of the ordinance, it cannot be said, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>even under the City\u2019s so-called <em>\u201cMalott </em>test,\u201d that the ordinance conferred any benefit on them that they did not already enjoy.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-3\">\u00b629 The City\u2019s \u201crental\u201d theory is also inconsistent with the fact that the gross revenue fee is not tied to a utility\u2019s use or occupancy of the public right-of-way. <em>See XO Missouri, Inc., v. City of Maryland Heights </em>(E.D.Mo. 2003), 256 F.Supp.2d 987, 993-95 (gross revenues-based charge is not a legitimate fee because not based on regulatory costs or extent of right-of-way use). The fee is imposed on all revenues derived from business conducted within the city limits, regardless of the fact that some utility facilities are located on public right-of-way and some on private easements.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">\u00b630 The City contends that, pursuant to the ordinance, any franchise agreement would be the result of negotiation and relies on our decision in <em>City of Baker v. Montana Petroleum Co. </em>(1935), 99 Mont. 465, 44 P.2d 735, for the proposition that a fee paid pursuant to a contract is not a tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">\u00b631 In <em>Baker, </em>the City of Baker passed a gas franchise ordinance in 1916, imposing a gross receipts-based fee. The utility accepted the terms of the ordinance and installed its gas distribution system shortly thereafter. 99 Mont. at 473, 44 P.2d at 735. It then proceeded to make payments for more than a decade. This Court construed the fee as part of a contract between the parties. \u201cThe relationship between the parties with reference to the franchise and its provisions for gross receipts tax is contractual and is to be distinguished, on that ground, from cases of purely revenue producing ordinances calling for license or occupational taxes.\u201d 99 Mont. at 476, 44 P.2d at 736. Thus the <em>Baker </em>decision involved a utility that was aware of the City of Baker\u2019s gas franchise ordinance and chose to accept the terms of the ordinance, construct a gas distribution system and pay the fee for over a decade. The utility was thus estopped from challenging the validity of the fee. <em>Baker, </em>99 Mont. at 482, 44 P.2d at 739. In contrast, the Utilities in the present matter did not install and operate their systems knowing that the City had established a franchise fee. Rather, since the Utilities have been occupying the rights-of-way for years prior to enactment of the ordinance, it cannot be said that they negotiated or accepted the terms of the ordinance. <em>See Florida Power Corp. v. City of Winter Park </em>(Fla.Dist.App. 2002), 827 So.2d 322, 323 n.1, 324 n.2. Given that the City unilaterally imposed the fee on utilities whose occupancy of the right-of-way predated the ordinance, the relationship between the parties was not \u201ccontractual\u201d and, for that reason, is distinguishable from <em>City of Baker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>\u00b632 The Utilities have cited us to a number of decisions from other jurisdictions for the proposition that a revenue-producing, nonregulatory fee is a tax. In <em>St. Louis v. Western Union Tel. Co. </em>(1893), 148 U.S. 92, 13 S.Ct. 485, 37 L.Ed. 380, the Court held that, \u201cthe power to require payment of some reasonable sum for the exclusive use of a portion of the streets was within the grant of power to regulate the use.\u201d The $5.00 per telephone pole fee did not have the characteristics of a tax: \u201cThe amount to be paid is not graduated by the amount of the business, nor is it a sum fixed for the privilege of doing business. It is more in the nature of a charge for the use of property belonging to the city.\u201d 148 U.S. at 97, 13 S.Ct. at 487, 37 L.Ed. at 383. In <em>Western Union Telegraph Co. v. New Hope </em>(1903), 187 U.S. 419, 427, 23 S.Ct. 204, 205, 47 L.Ed. 240, 244, the Court upheld a municipal fee of $1.00 per telegraph pole and $2.50 per mile of wire on the ground that the fee was \u201ca charge in the enforcement of local government supervision\u201d as opposed to a tax \u201con the property of the company, or on its transmission of messages, or on its receipts from such transmissions, or on its occupation of business!.]\u201d In <em>Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Taylor </em>(1904), 192 U.S. 64, 72, 24 S.Ct. 208, 211, 48 L.Ed. 342, 346, the Court struck a city fee that was \u201cmere subterfuge\u201d for raising revenue, not tied to the city\u2019s regulatory costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">\u00b633 The District Court relied on a decision by the Florida Supreme Court <em>in Alachua County v. State </em>(Fla. 1999), 737 So.2d 1065, where the court struck the county\u2019s 3 percent gross revenue \u201celectric utility privilege fee\u201d on the ground that it was in reality a tax. Despite the county\u2019s home-rule powers, the court found that the fee was not a reasonable rental charge or legitimate franchise fee, but a \u201cforced charge on the utilities.\u201d <em>Alachua County, </em>737 So.2d at 1069. Although the county had argued \u201cthat the fee was a reasonable rental fee, a user fee, or a franchise fee,\u201d the record showed that the fee was unrelated to regulatory costs or the extent of right-of-way use and was designed to fund general county operations and to reduce the county ad valorem tax millage rate. <em>Alachua County, </em>737 So.2d at 1067.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">\u00b634 In <em>City of Hawarden v. US West Communications, Inc. </em>(Iowa 1999), 590 N.W.2d 504, the Iowa Supreme Court considered a 3 percent gross revenue \u201cuser fee\u201d on public utilities, imposed after US West had operated a telephone exchange in the city for more than a century. The fee was \u201crelated, not to the expense of regulation or any special benefit conferred on the utility, but to gross revenues generated by the utility.\u201d <em>Hawarden, </em>590 N.W.2d at 507. The court rejected the city\u2019s argument that the fee was in fact rent \u201clegitimately charged for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>the commercial use of public property.\u201d <em>Hawarden, </em>590 N.W.2d at 507. The city\u2019s home-rule powers did not change longstanding state law that the city held the fee to its streets in trust for the public and lacked authority to exact a rental for their use by public utilities. The Iowa court recognized the city\u2019s fee \u201cfor what it is-a revenue-generating <em>measure.\u201d Hawarden, </em>590 N.W.2d at 509. It concluded that, \u201c[w]hether characterized as a \u2018tax\u2019 or \u2018rent,\u2019 the city is without authority to impose such a fee for use of public easements granted by the state.\u201d <em>Hawarden, </em>590 N.W.2d at 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\">\u00b635  We conclude that a unilaterally imposed, revenue-generating gross-revenue fee, unrelated to use or occupancy of the right-of-way, is a tax on goods or services in violation of \u00a7 7-1-112(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">\u00b636 Finally, the City asserts that the District Court erred in holding that only three \u201cregulatory provisions\u201d of the ordinance were severable from the invalid franchise fee provision. It is the City\u2019s position that, if the Court concludes that the franchise fee is an invalid tax on the sale of services, all other provisions of the ordinance should be treated as severable. The Utilities contend that the severability issue is moot now that the ordinance has been defeated and cannot be enacted for two years. Unlike the franchise fee provision which, having been subj ect to prior enactments, is capable of repetition yet evading review, <em>Heisler, </em>282 Mont. at 275, 937 P.2d at 48 (citation omitted), the other provisions of the ordinance have not been the subject of repeated attempts at enactment. We agree with the Utilities that it is too speculative to conclude that they will, in years to come, be subject to these same regulatory provisions with no ability to test their validity in court. Accordingly, now that the ordinance has been defeated, the severability issue is moot. Likewise, the issue as to whether the District Court should have declared the fee reasonable is now moot.</p>\n<p id=\"A_D\">\u00b637 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b441-5\">JUSTICES REGNIER, NELSON, RICE and DISTRICT JUDGE PREZEAU concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"pACH\"> Although incorporeal, franchises historically were subject to taxation, Art.

This being so, the City may exercise any power or provide any service except those that are specifically prohibited by the Constitution, state law, or the charter itself. Section 7-1-102, MCA; <em>D &amp; F Sanitation v. City of Billings, </em>219 Mont. 437, 435, 713 P.2d 977 (1986). Moreover, as the Court points out at \u00b6 15, Section 7-1-106, MCA, provides in part that \u201cevery reasonable doubt\u201d as to the existence of a local government power or authority should be resolved in favor of its existence. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>the utilities must demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that there is an express, and not implied, constitutional, statutory, or charter prohibition against the power which the City seeks to exercise. The utilities have not pointed to either a constitutional or a charter prohibition against the challenged fee. Therefore, they must demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that a state statute prohibits the imposition of the challenged fee. I would conclude that the utilities have failed to carry this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">\u00b639 The City has established that there is a contractual relationship between it and the utilities that benefits both parties. The utilities do not dispute the right of the City to enter into the franchise agreement with them nor do they argue that the City is prohibited from charging franchise fees. Finally, there is no express statutory limitation on the right of municipalities to generate income from contractual agreements involving the public right of way. All this being so, this is simply a fee that has been imposed pursuant to the City\u2019s contractual grant of a special right. I would evaluate the fee in the context of the City\u2019s right to enter contracts, which is a right <em>without </em>statutory limitation, and not in the context of the \u201ctax on the sale of goods and services,\u201d as the Court has done here. The mere fact that the fee is called a \u201cfranchise fee\u201d does not convert this otherwise valid exercise of the power to enter into a contract for a valuable property right, into a prohibited regulatory scheme. In short, I think we have over-analyzed the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\u00b640 I would conclude that the utilities have failed to carry the heavy burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that this franchise fee, for which valuable consideration has been received by the utilities, is the same as \u201ca tax on income or the sale of goods and services\u201d such as is prohibited in \u00a7 7-1-112, MCA. I would therefore reverse the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the franchise fee constitutes an illegal tax. I dissent from our refusal to do so.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
