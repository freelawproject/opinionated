Asbeck, Jr. and Elaine Asbeck (the Asbecks) appeal the judgment of the Seventh Judicial District Court, Richland County, ordering that the State of Montana Department of Transportation (the DOT) to pay interest on only $7,187 of the remaining $24,780 settlement paid to the Asbecks.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">\u00b62 We reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">\u00b63 We address the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">\u00b64 Did the District Court err in determining that the DOT only had to pay interest on $7,187 of the $24,780 remaining settlement paid to the Asbecks?</p>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b454-14\">\u00b65 The DOT filed a condemnation action against the Asbecks in connection with a highway construction project. On July 22, 1985, as part of this litigation, the DOT and the Asbecks executed a stipulation, and, ultimately, a Montana Department of Transportation Right-of-Way Agreement, whereby all but one issue was resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>\u00b66 The one remaining issue concerned the interest owed to the Asbecks. The pertinent part of the stipulation reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-4\">That Defendants hereby stipulate to the Court entering an order putting Plaintiff into possession upon deposit of $11,000.00 into Court for the benefit of the Defendants, and Plaintiff hereby stipulates that the Defendants may withdraw the entire deposit. Pursuant to Section 70-30-302, MCA, Plaintiff will pay interest on the final award or settlement from the date of service of summons (March 14,1985) until the date of withdrawal by the Defendants at the rate of 10% per annum. If the Defendants withdraw more than the final award or settlement, they will be required to return the excess amount plus interest from the date of the withdrawal pursuant to Section 70-30-311(4), MCA. If the final amount is more than the amount withdrawn, Plaintiff will pay interest on the excess from the date of service of summons as provided by statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\u00b67 The agreed upon compensation owed the Asbecks was $35,780. The DOT immediately paid $11,000, which left an amount of $24,780 remaining. The DOT deposited $24,708<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with the District Court, which was dispersed to the Asbecks on January 22, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\u00b68 On April 5, 2001, the District Court ordered the DOT to pay the Asbecks interest on $7,187 (the amount of land leveling costs) of the $24,780 total amount, which the DOT paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">\u00b69 The Asbecks appeal the District Court\u2019s April 17, 2001 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">\u00b610 The District Court grounded its decision in \u00a7 70-30-302, MCA. The interpretation of a contract is a question of law for the court to decide. <em>Ophus v. Fritz, </em>2000 MT 251, \u00b6 19, 301 Mont. 447, \u00b6 19, 11 P.3d 1192, \u00b6 19. We review questions of statutory interpretation and application for correctness. <em>Nelson v. Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co., </em>2003 MT 101, \u00b6 26, 315 Mont. 268, \u00b6 26, 68 P.3d 689, \u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">\u00b611 Did the District Court err in determining that the DOT only had to pay interest on $7,187 of the $24,780 remaining settlement paid to the Asbecks?</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">\u00b612 The Asbecks argue that the District Court misinterpreted the stipulation by incorrectly applying to the stipulation the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>language of \u00a7 70-30-302(1), MCA. This language targets the assessment of compensation in a condemnation case. The Asbecks assert this section of the statute is inapplicable given that the stipulation targets the payment of interest. Consequently, the Asbecks maintain that the District Court should have applied the statutory language of \u00a7 70-30-302(2), MCA, to the stipulation, as that language targets precisely the payment of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\u00b613 The DOT counters that the District Court correctly applied \u00a7 70-30-302(1), MCA, as the intent of \u00a7 70-30-302, MCA, in general, is to define what constitutes compensation under the eminent domain statutes. In effect, the DOT maintains that to require it to pay interest on the full $24,780 is to compensate the Asbecks for items that do not meet the statutory definition of compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\u00b614 The District Court\u2019s decision states that it is grounded in \u00a7 70-30-302(2), MCA. Notwithstanding, it also appears that the District Court was actually applying \u00a7 70-30-301(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">\u00b615 Section 70-30-302, MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">(1) For the purpose of assessing compensation, the right to compensation is considered to have accrued at the date of the service of the summons, and the property\u2019s current fair market value as of that date is the measure of compensation for all property to be actually taken and the basis of depreciation in the current fair market value of property not actually taken but injuriously affected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">(2) If an order is made allowing the condemnor to take possession ... the full amount finally awarded must draw interest at the rate of 10% a year from the date of the service of the summons to the earlier of the following dates:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">(a) the date on which the right to appeal to the Montana supreme court expires or, if an appeal is filed, the date of final decision by the supreme court; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-10\">(b) the date on which the condemnee withdraws from the court the full amount finally awarded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-11\">(3) If the condemnee withdraws from the court a fraction of the amount finally awarded, interest on that fraction ceases on the date it is withdrawn but interest on the remainder of the amount finally awarded continues to the earlier of the dates referred to in subsections (2)(a) and (2)(b) until the full amount is withdrawn from the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">\u00b616 We assume that in entering into the stipulation, both the Asbecks and the DOT sought to protect their respective interests. <em>Smith v. School Dist. No. 18, Pondera County </em>(1943), 115 Mont. 102, 116, 139 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>P.2d 518, 523 (it is assumed that each party, in entering into a contract, protects his interests and insists on his rights), <em>overruled on other grounds by Massey v. Argenbright </em>(1984), 211 Mont. 331, 337, 683 P.2d 1332, 1335.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">\u00b617  Our review of the District Court\u2019s decision leads us to conclude that the District Court erred in applying the statute to the exclusion of the actual stipulation language to which the parties agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\u00b618  We have repeatedly held that \u201c[w]here the words [of a contract] are clear, certain, and unambiguous, the language alone [of the contract] controls.\u201d <em>Morning Star Enterprises v. R.H. Grover </em>(1991), 247 Mont. 105, 111, 805 P.2d 553, 557. An ambiguity exists where the wording of the contract, taken as a whole, is reasonably subject to two different interpretations. <em>Lemley v. Bozeman Community Hotel Co. </em>(1982), 200 Mont. 470, 474, 651 P.2d 979, 981. Hence, in interpreting a written contract, the intention of the parties is ascertained \u201cfirst and foremost\u201d from the writing alone. <em>Morning Star Enterprises, </em>247 Mont. at 111, 805 P.2d at 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\u00b619  Here, the pertinent language of the stipulation does not refer to compensation. Rather, it refers to the payment of interest on the final award of settlement. Specifically, the DOT agreed pursuant to \u00a7 70-30-302, MCA, to \u201cpay interest <em>on the final award or settlement </em>from the date of service of summons (March 14, 1985) until the date of withdrawal by the Defendants at the rate of 10% per annum.\u201d [Emphasis added.] This language is clear and unambiguous. If the DOT had wanted to limit its obligation to pay interest on statutorily defined compensation, then it should have included the limiting language in the stipulation. The plain language of the stipulation requires the DOT to pay interest on the excess of the final settlement award, with the interest to be paid from the date of the service of summons to the date of withdrawal. There is no reason for the courts to narrow the language of the stipulation by application of a statutory definition when the parties chose not to do so themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">\u00b620  We hold that the District Court erred in requiring the DOT to pay interest on only $7,187 of the $24,780 final settlement. We remand this case to the District Court with instructions to enter an order requiring the DOT to pay interest, from March 14, 1985, to January 22, 2001, on the entire final settlement, with credit for interest and payments already made.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">\u00b621 Reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b457-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b455-13\"> While the stipulated amount owed to the Asbecks was $24,780, the record reflects that the DOT deposited $24,708, the seeming result of a typographical error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
