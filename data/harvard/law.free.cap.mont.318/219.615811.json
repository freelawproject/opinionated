Did the District Court err in denying four of Falls Down\u2019s challenges for cause?</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">\u00b65 2. Did the District Court err in denying Falls Down\u2019s objection to the State\u2019s peremptory challenge?</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">\u00b66 3. Did the District Court err in denying Falls Down\u2019s motion for a mistrial or for additional individual voir dire when the State asked the jury about their knowledge regarding post traumatic stress disorder?</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">\u00b67 Falls Down was convicted by a jury of deliberate homicide, attempted deliberate homicide, aggravated kidnaping, two counts of sexual intercourse without consent, and one count of sexual intercourse without consent by accountability.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">\u00b68 Before his jury trial, individual voir dire was conducted. During individual voir dire, the potential jurors were asked to complete a questionnaire. The District Court, the State of Montana (State), and Falls Down then questioned the potential jurors who either had personal knowledge of the case, had heard about the case, or had answered affirmatively to any of the questions on the questionnaire.</p>\n<p id=\"Ari\">\u00b69 During this questioning, Falls Down challenged for cause four potential jurors. These four jurors included: A.C., J.B., D.R., and M.S. Additional facts regarding their statements will be discussed as they become applicable in the following analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-14\">\u00b610 The District Court denied three of Falls Down\u2019s challenges for cause without explanation. As to the fourth challenge for cause, the District Court denied the challenge, stating generally that the law simply requires that an attorney obtain a commitment from a potential juror that the juror can set aside any personal biases.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-15\">\u00b611 After conducting individual voir dire, the State and Falls Down <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>then conducted general voir dire on the 48 potential jurors chosen from the individual voir dire process.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">\u00b612 During this general voir dire, both the State and Falls Down exercised their first six peremptory challenges on the first 24 potential jurors questioned. In so doing, the State removed R.M., the only juror of a different ethnic background. Falls Down removed the four jurors, whom he was unsuccessful in challenging for cause, thereby using four of his six peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\u00b613 Falls Down objected to the State\u2019s peremptory challenge, citing \u201cBattin\u201d in support of his argument that such a challenge needed an explanation. The State countered by explaining it removed R.M. because it felt she would not be fair and impartial given that her son had been charged with an assault case and her husband had been involved in an assault case. The District Court then denied Falls Down\u2019s objection, without finding that purposeful discrimination had not occurred in removing R.M. from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">\u00b614 Also during general voir dire, the State asked the jurors if any of them knew about or had experience with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In response to this question, two jurors stated that they had first-hand knowledge regarding the behavioral manifestations of PTSD. The State then asked these jurors to explain what behavioral manifestations they had observed. This line of questioning then concluded with the State asking whether the jurors would hold these behavioral manifestations against a witness. The jurors agreed that they would not and that they would use their common sense and experience in evaluating the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">\u00b615 Falls Down did not object to the State\u2019s questioning until he began his general voir dire. At that time, Falls Down moved for a mistrial, arguing that the questioning, in effect, bolstered and vouched for the State\u2019s main witness. The District Court denied Falls Down\u2019s motion for a mistrial, finding that because the State did not mention the witness\u2019s name, no witness bolstering occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">\u00b616 Falls Down now appeals the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">ISSUE 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">\u00b617 We review whether a court, in granting or denying a challenge for cause, has abused its discretion. <em>State v. Good, </em>2002 MT 59, \u00b6 41, 309 Mont. 113, \u00b6 41, 43 P.3d 948, \u00b6 41. If a court has abused its discretion in granting or denying a challenge for cause, we then determine whether a conviction should be set aside as a result of that error. <em>Good, </em>\u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">\u00b618 Did the District Court err in denying four of Falls Down\u2019s challenges for cause?</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">\u00b619 Falls Down argues that because the District Court erroneously denied his four challenges for cause, he had to use four of his six peremptory challenges to remove the jurors. In effect, Falls Down argues that the District Court denied him his statutorily entitled peremptory challenges. Further, Falls Down argues that even though the potential jurors indicated that they could be fair and impartial, that did not cure their biases. Thus, Falls Down argues that the error committed by the District Court in denying his challenges for cause was structural, requiring automatic reversal of Falls Down\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">\u00b620 The State argues that the potential jurors\u2019 initial responses proved that they could be fair and impartial. The State also argues that only after further manipulation of the potential jurors\u2019 initial responses did their responses become unclear and seemingly biased. \u00b621 We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">\u00b622  According to \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA, a potential juror can be challenged for cause if that potential juror \u201c[has] a state of mind in reference to the case or to either of the parties that would prevent the juror from acting with entire impartiality and without prejudice to the substantial rights of either party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">\u00b623  We held in <em>State v. DeVore, </em>1998 MT 340, 292 Mont. 325, 972 P.2d 816, that jurors should be disqualified based on their prejudices only where they have \u201cform[ed] fixed opinions or the guilt or innocence of the defendant <em>which they would not be able to lay aside and render a verdict based solely on the evidence presented in court.\u201d DeVore, </em>\u00b6 21, <em>overruled in part by Good </em>(quoting <em>Great Falls Tribune v. District Court, Etc. </em>(1980), 186 Mont. 433, 439-40, 608 P.2d 116, 120 (citations omitted) (emphasis added)). Further, we noted that \u201c[i]t is not a district court\u2019s role to rehabilitate jurors whose spontaneous, and thus most reliable and honest, responses on voir dire expose a serious question about their ability to be fair and impartial.\u201d <em>DeVore, </em>\u00b6 28 (holding that the District Court erred in denying DeVore\u2019s challenges for cause where two jurors stated that they thought DeVore was \u201cguilty of something,\u201d and could not afford DeVore his presumption of innocence).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">\u00b624 Given our jurisprudence, we turn to the specific questions and answers at issue under Falls Down\u2019s challenges for cause. We will address and analyze the answers of each potential juror in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>\u00b625 The first potential juror, A.C., who was challenged for cause, stated the following upon questioning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-4\">COURT: Have you formulated an opinion about the guilt or innocence of Myron Falls Down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\">A.C.: Not set in stone, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">COURT: Could you be a fair and impartial juror in this case? A.C.: I don\u2019t know the answer to that either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">COURT: Mr. Eakin. [Counsel for the State]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-8\">EAKIN: Well, why do you have some doubt about whether you could be a fair and impartial juror?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-9\">A.C.: Well, I\u2019m not sure that what I\u2019ve read or heard might not sway my opinion. I don\u2019t know. Never been in this spot before, so....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-10\">EAKIN: Okay. The Judge is going to instruct you that your decision in the case would have to be based solely on what you will hear or see in the courtroom. You understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-11\">A.C.: Yeah, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-12\">EAKIN: And so could you, then, follow the instruction that the judge gives you to just base your decision on what you will hear and see in the courtroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-13\">A.C.: Probably, to the best of my ability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-14\">\u00b626 When questioned by defense counsel (Mr. Selvey) about whether A.C. had formed an opinion regarding Falls Down\u2019s guilt, A.C. stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-15\">SELVEY: Okay. Now, based on what you have read, did you make your own opinion about whether Mr. Fallsdown is guilty or not guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-16\">A.C.: Probably when I first read it I would assume that he was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac9\">SELVEY: And you still feel that way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-17\">A.C.: I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-18\">\u00b627  Here, A.C. initially stated that she had not firmly formulated an opinion regarding Falls Down\u2019s guilt. Any impartiality concerns she had arose from her having already heard and read about the case in the media. Unlike the jurors in <em>DeVore, </em>A.C.\u2019s concerns did not arise from her unwavering belief that Falls Down was guilty. Indeed, A.C. stated that initially she assumed that Falls Down was guilty, but did not know if she still believed that when questioned by Mr. Selvey. Further, A.C. stated that she could follow the court\u2019s instructions in basing her decision solely on the evidence presented in the courtroom. These facts demonstrate that A.C.\u2019s opinion regarding Falls Down was not fixed. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Falls Down\u2019s challenge for cause regarding A.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>\u00b628 Potential juror J.B. stated that she had formed an opinion about Falls Down\u2019s guilt or innocence. When questioned about this opinion, J.B. stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-4\">SELVEY: What is that opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">J.B.: Basically, based upon my prior knowledge of just what I had heard prior to, you know, getting involved in this at all. I had presumed guilty just from my own personal perspective.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-d\">SELVEY: Okay. Without having heard the other side of the story and the news clippings that you saw or read, why did you make a determination that he must be guilty then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-6\">J.B.: It was just based upon the information that was printed and that I heard that it sound like it was pretty factual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">SELVEY: All right. And yet you still feel that you can, in actuality, blank that out of your mind and give this defendant the presumption of innocence that he\u2019s entitled to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">J.B.: I think I can do that based upon the facts presented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">\u00b629 J.B. later clarified her statement that although she thought Falls Down was guilty, she also believed in the concept of the presumption of innocence. Specifically, J.B. stated: \u201cThat\u2019s just personal opinion compared to what you\u2019re doing in a court of law when you\u2019re making a decision based upon the facts that you\u2019re presented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">\u00b630  Here, J.B. initially presumed that Falls Down was guilty, based on what she had heard and read in the media. However, again unlike the jurors in <em>DeVore, </em>J.B. was not set in her opinion. Indeed, she stated that she could set aside her opinion. She stated that she understood the difference between arriving at a personal opinion and making a decision based on facts presented solely in the courtroom. Thus, we hold that J.B.\u2019s opinion regarding Falls Down\u2019s guilt was not fixed. Her testimony shows that she was able to set aside her personal opinion and base her decision on the facts presented in the courtroom. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Falls Down\u2019s challenge for cause regarding J.B. \u00b631 The third potential juror who was challenged for cause was D.R. He stated the following during questioning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-11\">COURT: Have you formed any opinion about the guilt or innocence of Myron FallsDown?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-12\">D.R.: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-13\">COURT: Do you believe you could be a fair and impartial juror in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-14\">D.R.: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-15\">SELVEY: Do you feel that Mr. FallsDown has to prove his innocence to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>D.R.: Yeah, I would like to hear what he has to say, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQp\">SELVEY: Okay. Well, how would you feel if Mr. FallsDown didn\u2019t present any evidence and didn\u2019t take the stand in his defense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_9\">D.R.: That is a good question, I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know how to answer that. I think he should take the stand, but I guess it would be his choice if he didn\u2019t want to take the stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMa\">SELVEY: Would you-is it fair to say that him not trying to prove his innocence, it would be very negative in your view?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-4\">D.R.: You know, I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t [k]now how to answer that. It just-I guess it depends on what the prosecutor had to say.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aaq\">\u00b632  Here, D.R. initially stated that he had not formed an opinion about the guilt of Falls Down, and that he could be a fair and impartial juror. D.R. also stated that he would like to hear from Falls Down, but remained open to the fact that Falls Down may not testify. These statements demonstrate that D.R.\u2019s opinion of Falls Down\u2019s guilt was not fixed. Indeed, that was his initial response. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Falls Down\u2019s challenge for cause regarding D.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\u00b633 M.S., the fourth and final potential juror who was challenged for cause stated the following during questioning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">COURT: Have you formed any opinion about the guilt or innocence of Myron FallsDown?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">M.S.: Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">COURT: Do you believe that you could be fair and impartial in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-9\">M.S.: I think I could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-10\">EAKIN: Now, this opinion that you have formed, that was based on what you had read in the newspaper and saw on the TV?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AE9\">M.S.: That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-11\">EAKIN: Can you set that opinion aside and sit on the jury in this case and just decide this case based on what you hear and see in the courtroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-12\">M.S.: Yes, I think I could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-13\">SELVEY: Ma\u2019am, based on what you have read and seen on TV, what is your opinion about Mr. FallsDown as he sits before you, he is guilty or not guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-14\">M.S.: He is guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-15\">SELVEY: So realistically, how is it that you would set aside that opinion just because someone tells you to set it aside?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-16\">M.S.: Because that is-that is why I am here, to set that aside if I am chosen as a juror. I mean, do we have a choice?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-17\">\u00b634 The above line of questioning continued, ending with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-4\">SELVEY: And I can assure you that no judge, no prosecutor or otherwise can just tell me to ignore my opinion about certain things. So can you just honestly ignore your opinion about what you feel, that Mr. FallsDown is guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-5\">M.S.: Yes, if I was in court, yes, I think I could.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\u00b635  Here, M.S. did initially state that she thought Falls Down was guilty. However, she continually stated that she could be a fair and impartial juror, even after Mr. Selvey questioned her on that point several times. M.S. believed if she was chosen as a juror that it was her job to set aside any personal opinions she may have. She consistently felt she could so. Her conviction, thereby, evidences that her opinion of Falls Down\u2019s guilt wavered, unlike the jurors\u2019 opinions did in <em>DeVore. </em>Thus, we hold that the District Court did not err in denying Falls Down\u2019s challenge for cause regarding M.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">\u00b636 In summary, we hold that the four jurors who were challenged for cause-A.C., J.B., D.R., and M.S.-showed that they could be fair and impartial, and the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Falls Down\u2019s four challenges for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">ISSUE 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">\u00b637 We review whether a court\u2019s findings of fact regarding a peremptory challenge are clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Ford, </em>2001 MT 230, \u00b6 7, 306 Mont. 517, \u00b6 7, 39 P.3d 108, \u00b6 7, <em>cert denied, </em>537 U.S. 973, 123 S.Ct. 466, 154 L.Ed.2d 329. We apply <em>de novo </em>review to a court\u2019s application of the law. <em>Ford, </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">\u00b638 Did the District Court err in denying Falls Down\u2019s objection to the State\u2019s peremptory challenge?</p>\n<p id=\"b249-13\">\u00b639 Falls Down argues that the District Court erred in not making findings regarding his <em>Batson </em>argument when the State exercised its peremptory challenge in removing the only potential juror of a different ethnic background. Thus, Falls Down argues that he was denied his right to equal protection under the United States and Montana Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-14\">\u00b640 The State argues that Falls Down did not make an appropriate <em>Batson </em>argument. In the alternative, the State argues that it provided a race-neutral explanation for exercising its peremptory challenge, thereby withstanding a <em>Batson </em>argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>\u00b641 We agree with the State that its race-neutral explanation withstands Falls Down\u2019s <em>Batson </em>argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\u00b642 In <em>Ford, </em>we addressed <em>Batson </em>and its progeny for the first time. We reviewed the evolution of the <em>Batson </em>argument concerning jury composition. <em>Ford, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\u00b643 In reviewing this evolution, we noted that peremptory challenges have long been essential to the trial process, and, indeed, have been said to be \u201cone of the most important of the rights secured to the accused.\u201d <em>Ford, </em>\u00b6 13 (quoting <em>Pointer v. United States </em>(1894), 151 U.S. 396, 408, 14 S.Ct. 410, 414, 38 L.Ed. 208). Unbridled use of peremptory challenges ceased in 1986 when the United States Supreme Court held, in <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>that prosecutors could not exercise their peremptory challenges on the sole basis of race. <em>Batson v. Kentucky </em>(1986), 476 U.S. 79, 84, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 1716, 90 L.Ed.2d 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u00b644 We noted that the holding in <em>Batson </em>extended to defense counsel, <em>Georgia v. McCollum </em>(1992), 505 U.S. 42, 112 S.Ct. 2348, 120 L.Ed.2d 33, and to private litigants in a civil case, <em>Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co. </em>(1991), 500 U.S. 614, 111 S.Ct. 2077, 114 L.Ed.2d 660, regardless of whether the potential juror shares racial identity with the defendant, <em>Powers v. Ohio </em>(1991), 499 U.S. 400, 111 S.Ct. 1364, 113 L.Ed.2d 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">\u00b645 However, most important in our review of the <em>Batson </em>argument was adoption of the <em>Batson </em>requirements when raising such an argument in court. Specifically and initially, counsel making the argument must establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination. Then, counsel responding to the argument must articulate a race-neutral explanation in exercising the peremptory challenge. Finally, the trial court must determine, through findings of fact, that counsel established a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination. <em>Ford, </em>\u00b6 16. In addition, counsel must raise a <em>Batson </em>argument before the jury is sworn and before the venire is dismissed. <em>Ford, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 24-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">\u00b646 Falls Down did not precisely articulate that he was relying on <em>Batson </em>for his argument. Indeed, he objected to the State\u2019s exercise of its peremptory challenge by citing \u201cBattin.\u201d However, Falls Down did articulate his reason for such an argument, namely that R.M. was the only potential juror of a different ethnic background and should not be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">\u00b647 We note, here, that the first requirement for establishing a <em>Batson </em>argument is effectively moot, since the State immediately responded as to why it exercised its peremptory challenge. Thus, we need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>address whether Falls Down established a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination. However, we also note that the District Court did not make findings of fact regarding its reason for denying Falls Down\u2019s objection, namely that no prima facie case of purposeful discrimination existed. We reiterate the importance of adherence to these requirements in preserving the record on appeal. Notwithstanding, we conclude that the record here is sufficient for us to address the issue raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">\u00b648  On these facts, we hold that the State provided a sufficient race-neutral explanation as to its exercise of its peremptory challenge. The State noted that its concern with R.M. arose not from her ethnic background, but rather from her experiences with assault cases. We hold that the District Court\u2019s denial of Fall\u2019s Down <em>Batson </em>argument was proper on the facts here.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">\u00b649 Because we hold that the District Court did not err in denying Falls Down\u2019s objection to the State\u2019s peremptory challenge, we need not reach the issue of whether the denial violated his right to equal protection under the United States and Montana Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">ISSUE 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">\u00b650 We review whether a court in granting or denying a mistrial has abused its discretion. <em>State v. Partin </em>(1997), 287 Mont. 12, 17-18, 951 P.2d 1002, 1005.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">\u00b651 Did the District Court err in denying Falls Down\u2019s motion for a mistrial or for additional individual voir dire when the State asked the jury about their knowledge regarding PTSD?</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">\u00b652 Falls Down argues that the State vouched for and actually bolstered the credibility of its main witness by referencing PTSD, from which the witness suffers.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">\u00b653 The State argues that its questioning of the jurors about the effects of PTSD was permissible so as to ascertain their understanding of the symptoms of the disorder. The State argues that this \u25a0understanding was necessary to establish because the disorder might have affected the State\u2019s witness during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">\u00b654 Falls Down cites no authority to support his argument that the State vouched for its witness by questioning the jury about PTSD. Rather, Falls Down cites cases holding that prosecutors may not vouch for the credibility of a government witness. <em>United States v. Roberts </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>(9th Cir. 1980), 618 F.2d 530, 533, <em>cert. denied, </em>452 U.S. 942, 101 S.Ct. 3088, 69 L.Ed.2d 957; <em>United States v. Frederick </em>(9th Cir. 1996), 78 F.3d 1370, 1378. These cases do not stand for the proposition that questioning about PTSD during voir dire amounts to witness vouching, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">\u00b655 We have repeatedly held that it is not this Court\u2019s obligation to locate authorities or formulate arguments for the parties in support of their positions. <em>See Johansen v. State, Dept. of Natural Resources, </em>1998 MT 51, \u00b6 24, 288 Mont. 39, \u00b6 24, 955 P.2d 653, \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">\u00b656  Thus, given that Falls Down did not locate authority for his position, we will not address his argument here, and we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Falls Down\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\u00b657 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b252-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b252-8\">JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<p id=\"AKI\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">\u00b658 I dissent. I would reverse the conviction due to the court\u2019s failure to grant challenges for cause to two of the venirewomen who indicated that their state of mind would prevent them from acting with entire impartiality and without prejudice to the substantial rights of either party. Section 46-16-115(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">\u00b659 Turning first to jury panelist A.C. This panelist advised the court that she had read about the case in the newspaper and, although she understood that what she read was not evidence, she was not sure that she could set aside the information and judge the defendant solely on the evidence or whether she could be fair and impartial. She indicated that she could \u201cprobably\u201d follow the judge\u2019s instructions \u201cto the best of [her] ability.\u201d When asked by defense counsel whether she felt Falls Down was innocent as he sat before her, she indicated, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can answer that. I don\u2019t know if he is or not.\u201d Counsel then inquired further as to her state of mind concerning his presumed innocence, to which she responded: \u201cHmm, that\u2019s a good question. I\u2019m feeling very nervous.\u201d In telling fashion, she stated, \u201cI really don\u2019t know. My first instinct would be that he certainly was involved in this at least. To what extent, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">\u00b660 When asked whether she would have a difficult time setting her opinion aside, A.C. said, \u201cI would probably have a difficult time doing that. But if you want be here, we can make that happen.\u201d Defense counsel asked her if she could be fair and impartial and objective and not judge the defendant as she sat there today. A.C. said, \u201cWell, I could try to be, but I can\u2019t guarantee that, no.\u201d Clearly, when A.C. could not guarantee that she could be fair and impartial, her state of mind was such that it would prevent her from acting with entire impartiality and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>without prejudice to the rights of defendant Falls Down. The District Court abused its discretion in denying Falls Down\u2019s challenge for cause under \u00a7 46-16-115(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">\u00b661 Prospective juror M.S. had also been exposed to information about the case in newspaper articles. As the dialogue quoted by the Court indicates, she unequivocally stated that she had formed an opinion about the defendant\u2019s guilt, \u201cHe is guilty.\u201d Although, the prosecutor got her to say that she would ignore her opinion if she were in court, she nonetheless conceded that if she were the defendant, she would not feel comfortable if a juror on her case held that opinion (as did she) that she was guilty. As with A.C., prospective juror M.S. clearly evinces a state of mind such that it would prevent her from acting with entire impartiality and without prejudice to the rights of defendant Falls Down. The District Court abused its discretion in denying Falls Down\u2019s challenge for cause under \u00a7 46-16-115(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\u00b662 A defendant charged with a crime is entitled to an impartial jury of his or her peers. Art. II, Sec. 24, Mont. Const. A district court should jealously protect this right by liberally granting challenges for cause leveled at veniremen and women who, like A.C. and M.S., clearly have formed an opinion about the defendant\u2019s guilt. With some forty-eight unchallenged, prospective jurors remaining on the panel, the court should have excused those jurors whose frame of mind was obviously tainted by exposure to news coverage and moved on to panelists who could, without need of \u201ccoaxed recantations,\u201d be impartial and objective. <em>State v. Freshment, </em>2002 MT 61, \u00b6 12, 309 Mont. 154, \u00b6 12, 43 P.3d 968, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\u00b663 The District Court abused its discretion in denying the challenges for cause to A.C. and M.S., thereby forcing Falls Down to unnecessarily waste two of his six peremptory challenges to which he was entitled by law. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 530, 537, 866 P.2d 1099, 1103, overruled in part by <em>State v. Good, </em>2002 MT 59, 309 Mont. 113, 43 P.3d 948. Falls Down\u2019s number of peremptory challenges was thus not equal to that of the State. <em>Armstrong v. Gondeiro, </em>2000 MT 326, 303 Mont. 37, 15 P.3d 386. As a result, Falls Down was denied his right to a fair and impartial jury and his right to due process of law.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
