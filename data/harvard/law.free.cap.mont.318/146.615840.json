Notti (Notti) was convicted by a jury of sexual intercourse without consent. He appeals this conviction on the ground that he did not receive effective assistance of counsel. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">\u00b62 The only issue before this Court is whether Notti\u2019s conviction should be reversed as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">\u00b63 Notti was charged by information on September 5, 2000, with sexual intercourse without consent, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA. At his arraignment in September 2000, he pled \u201cnot guilty.\u201d In February 2001, a jury found him guilty. In March 2001, subsequent to his conviction and before his sentencing, Notti appeared in court and stated that he wished to dismiss his attorney. The attorney withdrew as counsel and the court appointed a new public defender to represent Notti at sentencing. At sentencing in February 2002, Notti was sentenced to fifty (50) years in the Montana State Prison, with twenty (20) years suspended contingent upon specific terms and conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-13\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b169-14\">\u00b64  To assess a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, both on direct appeal and in post-conviction proceedings, this Court applies the two-prong test from <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, which requires the defendant to \u201cshow that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense and deprived the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d <em>State v. Weldele, </em>2003 MT 117, \u00b6 68, 315 Mont. 452, \u00b6 68, 69 P.3d 1162, \u00b6 68 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-15\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b169-16\">\u00b65 Notti claims that his attorney was ineffective because he failed to file pre-trial motions to preclude numerous trial witnesses from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>repeating the prior consistent statements of the complaining witness. He also faults his attorney for failing to object during the trial when the State repeatedly presented purportedly inadmissible hearsay evidence through these witnesses. Specifically, Notti asserts that the State impermissibly buttressed the testimony of the complaining witness with testimony from five other witnesses, including the 9-1-1 operator, the initial responding officer, the emergency room doctor, the chief investigating detective, and the crime lab technician. Each of these witnesses repeated what the complaining witness had told him or her about the incident. Notti maintains that such testimony was inadmissible hearsay under Rule 801(d)(1)(B), M.R.Evid., and that his attorney\u2019s failure to object to its introduction constitutes ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">\u00b66  As we have stated on numerous previous occasion, there is a strong presumption that counsel \u201crendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690. <em>See also Weldele, </em>\u00b6 70. To overcome this presumption, a defendant bears the burden of showing that counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and if so, that defendant was actually prejudiced by counsel\u2019s deficient performance. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688 and 692.</p>\n<p id=\"Abt\">\u00b67 In analyzing ineffective assistance of counsel claims, we must first consider whether the record is sufficient to determine whether counsel was ineffective. \u201cWhere ineffective assistance of counsel claims are based on facts of record in the underlying case, they must be raised in the direct appeal and, conversely, where the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be documented from the record in the underlying case, those claims must be raised by petition for post-conviction relief.\u201d <em>State v. Daniels, </em>2003 MT 247, \u00b6 41, 317 Mont. 331, \u00b6 41, 77 P.3d 224, \u00b6 41 (citation omitted). As we stated in <em>Daniels: </em>\u201cThe underlying principle of the foregoing rule is that a silent record cannot rebut the strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.... Absent a complete record, this Court will not speculate on counsel\u2019s alleged errors.\u201d <em>Daniels, </em>\u00b6 41 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">\u00b68 In <em>State v. White, </em>2001 MT 149, 306 Mont. 58, 30 P.3d 340, this Court discussed in great detail what constitutes on-record and off-record actions of counsel to be considered when a challenge to the counsel\u2019s effectiveness has been presented. We held that the operative test is whether or not the record contains the answer as to why counsel took, or failed to take, action in providing a defense. <em>White, </em>\u00b6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>20. We concluded that while failure to object to testimony is generally record-based and appropriate for direct appeal, if the record does not fully explain why counsel failed to object to the admission of evidence, the matter is best-suited for post-conviction proceedings which would permit a further inquiry into whether the particular representation was ineffective. <em>White, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15 and 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">\u00b69  In the case before us, the record is silent as to why counsel failed to file pre-trial motions and failed to object to the admission of the challenged evidence at trial. Therefore, the claimed deficiencies cannot be reviewed on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">\u00b610 Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed, and the ineffective assistance of counsel claim is dismissed without prejudice to its being raised in a post-conviction relief proceeding.</p>\n<judges id=\"b171-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
