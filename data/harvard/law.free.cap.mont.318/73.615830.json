Nicholas\u2019s father told him to go tell the boys to stop sledding because of the icy conditions. As instructed, Nicholas drove the family\u2019s 1988 Bronco to the hill where the boys were sledding. He then proceeded down the hill, stopped his vehicle and delivered the warning. It is disputed whether Zadkiel was with the group when the warning was delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">\u00b65 After informing the boys, Nicholas pulled forward. As he did so, Zadkiel, while operating his sled, slid under Nicholas\u2019s front wheels and was run over.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">\u00b66 Zadkiel incurred chest and abdominal injuries as a result of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-13\">\u00b67 The Giambras brought a motion for summary judgment against Travelers arguing that Travelers was required to advance payment of Zadkiel\u2019s medical expenses. Travelers refused to advance payment of Zadkiel\u2019s medical expenses, claiming that liability of its insured, Nicholas, was not reasonably clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-14\">\u00b68 The District Court agreed with Travelers, granted its motion for summary judgment, and denied Giambras\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">\u00b69 We review a District Court\u2019s grant or denial of summary judgment <em>de novo. Cole ex rel. Cole Revocable Trust v. Cole, </em>2003 MT 229, \u00b6 8, 317 Mont. 197, \u00b6 8, 75 P.3d 1280, \u00b6 8. We also review any legal conclusions concerning the grant or denial of summary judgment for correctness. <em>Gonzales v. Walchuk, </em>2002 MT 262, \u00b6 9, 312 Mont. 240, \u00b6 9, 59 P.3d 377, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">\u00b610 Did the District Court err in denying the Giambras\u2019 motion for summary judgment in concluding that genuine issues of material fact existed regarding the negligence and liability?</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">\u00b611 The Giambras argue that Nicholas\u2019s liability is clear, and that he was negligent per se for violating certain traffic laws. Specifically, the Giambras maintain that Nicholas violated Livingston City ordinance 9-320 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">B. Notwithstanding the provision of this section every driver of a vehicle shall exercise due care to avoid colliding with any pedestrian upon any street and shall give warning when necessary, and shall exercise proper precaution upon observing any child or any confused or incapacitated person upon a street.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEo\">The Giambras also argue that Nicholas violated the similar provisions of \u00a7 61-8-504, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">\u00b612 The Giambras argue that it is undisputed that, as instructed, Nicholas drove down a hill that was glare ice and gave no warning when he moved his vehicle forward after warning the sledders to stop sledding. The Giambras conclude that Nicholas, thus, did not exercise proper precaution because he ran over Zadkiel knowing that other children were sledding on the hill. As such, the Giambras argue that Nicholas\u2019s liability is reasonably clear and that Travelers is obligated to advance funds in payment of Zadkiel\u2019s medical expenses under our decision in <em>Ridley v. Guaranty Nat. Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 325, 951 P.2d 987.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">\u00b613 Travelers argues that evidence exists as to Zadkiel\u2019s own negligence, and that Nicholas observed the necessary traffic laws. Specifically Travelers contends that Zadkiel jumped on his sled and slid in front of Nicholas\u2019s vehicle after Nicholas delivered the warning and resumed his travel down the hill. Travelers maintains that, according to witnesses, Nicholas was not aware that Zadkiel had resumed sledding and had driven his sled in front of Nicholas\u2019s vehicle. Also there is some evidence that Zadkiel was attempting to beat Nicholas down the hill after Nicholas had resumed his travel. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Travelers argues that the accident happened in the middle of the city street; that Nicholas was obeying all traffic laws; that there is no evidence that the street was closed; and that there is no evidence that the icy conditions contributed to the accident. Moreover, Travelers points out that it is arguable whether ordinance 9-320 and \u00a7 61-8-504, MCA, apply given Zadkiel\u2019s age-i.e, whether he is a \u201cchild\u201d in contemplation of the ordinance and statute. Finally, Travelers concludes that Nicholas was not negligent and that Zadkiel was the sole cause of the accident. Travelers, thus, argues that it is not obligated to advance payment of Zadkiel\u2019s medical expenses because liability is not reasonably clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">\u00b614 After reviewing the motions, briefs, and discovery, the District Court concluded that there is a conflict in the evidence as to which party was negligent and that Nicholas\u2019s liability is not reasonably clear. We reach the same conclusion based upon the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"AN\">\u00b615  In <em>Ridley, </em>we held that pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 33-18-201(6) and (13), MCA, when liability is reasonably clear, an insurer is obligated to advance payment of an injured third party\u2019s medical expenses until a final settlement is reached. <em>Ridley, </em>286 Mont. at 334, 951 P.2d at 992.</p>\n<p id=\"AFH\">\u00b616  Here, genuine issues of material fact exist regarding negligence and liability. As such, Nicholas\u2019s liability is not reasonably clear, and Travelers has no obligation under <em>Ridley </em>to advance payment of Zadkiel\u2019s medical expenses. The District Court did not err in denying the Giambras\u2019 motion for summary judgment and in granting Travelers\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">\u00b617 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b98-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES RICE, COTTER and REGNIER concur</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
