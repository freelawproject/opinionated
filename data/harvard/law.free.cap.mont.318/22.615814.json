He appeals his conviction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">\u00b62 Reginald Adgerson (Adgerson) and Catherine Gordon (Gordon) married in 1995 and later had two children. Gordon separated from Adgerson in the Spring of2000. She filed her initial dissolution papers with the assistance of Pamela Buey, an attorney employed by Lewis and Clark County Attorney\u2019s Office, and completed the balance of the dissolution with the assistance of a different attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-11\">\u00b63 Gordon worked as a probation and parole officer for the state of Montana, in Helena. As part of her job, Gordon interacted with the Lewis and Clark County Attorney\u2019s Office and the Lewis and Clark County Court. As such, Gordon was familiar with the prosecuting attorneys in this case, Michael Menahan and Leo Gallagher. Additionally, she was familiar with all the First Judicial District Court Judges through her work as a probation and parole officer in Helena. Adgerson worked as a car salesman.</p>\n<p id=\"AU7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>\u00b64 During their separation period, both Adgerson and Gordon were subject to a mutual restraining order. Further, the divorce decree included a parenting plan outlining specific protocol to allow contact solely concerning custody, decision-making, and emergencies regarding the children. However, Adgerson did not comply with the restraining order and was convicted of misdemeanor stalking and contempt, entered by Helena City Court December 18,2000, and March 15,2001, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\u00b65 Between March and July 2001, Adgerson continuously contacted Gordon via the telephone and while Gordon dropped the children off for visitation regarding issues outside the scope of the parenting plan. He did this in such a manner that frightened Gordon to the point where she feared for her physical safety. Phone records indicate that Adgerson called Gordon many times during the day on numerous occasions. During children exchanges, the two sometimes had heated altercations. The record indicates that some of these encounters contemplated matters within the scope of the parenting plan and other encounters did not concern their children.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\u00b66 Ultimately, the State charged Adgerson by Information with felony stalking on August 1, 2001. Judge Dorothy McCarter of the First Judicial District heard the case. Adgerson moved to dismiss the Information claiming that \u00a7 45-5-220, MCA, was overbroad and vague. The District Court denied his motion. A jury convicted Adgerson of felony stalking on May 30,2002, and the District Court sentenced him to the Montana Department of Corrections for five years, with two years suspended. From this, Adgerson appeals. We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">\u00b67 1. Did the trial judge err in failing to recuse herself due to impartiality and did the prosecutor commit misconduct when he failed to remove his office as prosecutor due to impartiality?</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">\u00b68 2. Was Adgerson denied effective assistance of counsel by trial counsel\u2019s failure to move for disqualification of all the judges within the First Judicial District and for failure to move for removal of the prosecutor?</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">\u00b69 3. Did the trial court err in failing to grant Adgerson\u2019s motion to dismiss because Montana\u2019s stalking statute, \u00a7 45-5-220, MCA, is unconstitutional both on its face and as applied?</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AX\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">\u00b610 Did the trial judge err in failing to recuse herself due to impartiality and did the prosecutor commit misconduct when he failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>to remove his office as prosecutor due to impartiality?</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">\u00b611 On appeal, Adgerson claims that Gordon\u2019s interaction with the judges of the First Judicial District and the Lewis and Clark County Attorney\u2019s Office through her work created an irreparable bias against him which resulted in their having an interest in the outcome of the case. First, Adgerson contends an appearance of impropriety exists because Gordon, as a probation and parole officer, appeared before the First Judicial District Court Judges, including Dorothy McCarter, frequently for work related issues, thus Judge McCarter had an interest in the outcome, and therefore, should have recused herself. Second, he contends that Gordon\u2019s interaction with the Lewis and Clark County Attorney\u2019s Office and Pam Buoy\u2019s work on Gordon\u2019s initial filing of dissolution of marriage created an interest such that the office should have disqualified itself from prosecuting Adgerson, and therefore, should have removed itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">\u00b612  The State argues that Adgerson did not raise this issue before the District Court, and as such he waived his right to raise it on appeal. We agree with the State. The rule is well established that this Court will not address an issue raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Peterson, </em>2002 MT 65, \u00b6 24, 309 Mont. 199, \u00b6 24, 44 P.3d 499, \u00b6 24 (citing <em>State v. Weaselboy, </em>1999 MT 274, \u00b6 16, 296 Mont. 503, \u00b6 16, 989 P.2d 836, \u00b6 16). A party may not raise new arguments or change its legal theory on appeal, because it is fundamentally unfair to fault the trial court for failing to rule on an issue it was never given the opportunity to consider. <em>State v. Martinez, </em>2003 MT 65, \u00b6 17, 314 Mont. 434, \u00b6 17, 67 P.3d 207, \u00b6 17. The District Court record does not reflect Adgerson\u2019s claim, therefore we must limit our review only to issues raised before the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\u00b613 In his reply brief, Adgerson urges this Court to address his complaints by invoking the plain error doctrine. <em>State v. Finley </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 126, 137, 915 P.2d 208, 215, <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Gallagher, </em>2001 MT 39, 304 Mont. 215, 19 P.3d 817. The plain error doctrine only applies to limited situations as prescribed in <em>Finley. Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 137, 915 P.2d at 215. It applies only \u201cwhere failing to review the claimed error at issue may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 137, 915 P.2d at 215. We conclude that the plain error doctrine does not apply in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">\u00b614 Therefore, we cannot address this issue on direct appeal because it has not been properly preserved for our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">\u00b615 Was Adgerson denied effective assistance of counsel by trial counsel\u2019s failure to move for disqualification of all the judges within the First Judicial District and for failure to move for removal of the prosecutor?</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\u00b616 When contemplating ineffective assistance claims, this Court has adopted the two-pronged test set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. The appellant must illustrate that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Hagen v. State, </em>1999 MT 8, \u00b6 10, 293 Mont. 60, \u00b6 10, 973 P.2d 233, \u00b6 10. First, to demonstrate deficient performance by counsel, the appellant must show, considering all the circumstances, that counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. <em>Kills On Top v. State </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 32, 49, 901 P.2d 1368, 1379. The appellant must overcome the strong presumption that counsel provides a wide range of reasonable professional assistance through defense strategies and trial tactics. <em>Kills On Top, </em>273 Mont. at 49, 901 P.2d at 1379. Second, the appellant must demonstrate that there was a reasonable probability of a different result had counsel not made unprofessional errors. <em>State v. Harris, </em>2001 MT 231, \u00b6 19, 306 Mont. 525, \u00b6 19, 36 P.3d 372, \u00b6 19. Upon such a challenge, the appellant must prove that the fact finder\u2019s reasonable doubt respecting guilt could have been directed by counsel\u2019s errors, and the court considers the totality of the evidence before the court and jury to determine if there could have been a different outcome. <em>Harris, </em>\u00b6 19 (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 695, 104 S. Ct. at 2068-69).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\u00b617 However, before we can consider the ineffective assistance claim on its merits, it is necessary to consider whether the claim is properly before this Court. Such claims must be based upon facts within the district court record, not on \u201cmere conclusory allegations,\u201d in order for an appellant to raise an ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal. <em>State v. Hulbert </em>(1988), 232 Mont. 115, 120, 756 P.2d 1110, 1113 (quoting <em>State v. Tome </em>(1987), 228 Mont. 398, 403, 742 P.2d 479, 482). Conversely, ineffective assistance claims that cannot be construed from the record in the underlying case must be raised through a petition for postconviction relief. <em>Hagen, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\u00b618 When it is not clear whether a claim for ineffective assistance is record based, we stated in <em>Soraich v. State, </em>2002 MT 187, 311 Mont. 90, 53 P.3d 878:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-8\">Though not easily distilled into a formula, the definitive question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>that distinguishes and decides which actions are record and which are nonrecord, is <em>why ? </em>In other words, if counsel fails to object to the admission of evidence, or fails to offer an opening statement, does the record fully explain <em>why </em>counsel took the particular course of action? If not, then the matter is best-suited for post-conviction proceedings which permit a further inquiry into whether the particular representation was ineffective. Only when the record will fully explain why counsel took, or failed to take, action in providing a defense for the accused may this Court review the matter on direct appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><em>Soraich, </em>\u00b6 22 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u00b619 Adgerson argues that his trial counsel fell below average competence of any Montana attorney when she failed to note the potential relationship conflicts and motion the District Court for recusal or disqualification. Further, he alleges that these omissions deprived him of a trial free from the appearances of impropriety, thus meeting both prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>test. Adgerson points out that the record reveals that Gordon, as a probation officer, frequented Judge McCarter\u2019s courtroom, worked with the Lewis and Clark County Attorney on a regular basis, and had an attorney/client privilege between herself and Deputy County Attorney, Pam Buey. He contends that the void in the record-his trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to documented alleged improper relationships-should serve as evidence within the record substantiating his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">\u00b620 The State counters that the record does not conclusively reflect an obvious impropriety merely because it documents that a probation officer regularly appeared in front of a certain judge or that a probation officer worked along side a county attorney\u2019s office on some cases, thus Adgerson\u2019s ineffective assistance claim cannot be ascertained from the facts within the record. Therefore, Adgerson should pursue his claims in a postconviction relief proceeding because his allegations are not record based. We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">\u00b621 According to <em>Soraich, </em>this Court must ask if <em>why </em>trial counsel did not object to Gordon\u2019s relationships with the District Court and Attorney\u2019s Office is apparent from the record. The record indicates that trial counsel was aware of these alleged improper relationships. However, there is no evidence of any objection to those relationships or evidence as to why defense counsel chose not to object to those relationships. There is simply insufficient information in the record for us to conclusively determine if defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to these relationships was due to reasonable defense strategies or trial tactics, or if it was due to ineffective assistance. In turn, this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>refuses to take such leaps to speculate as to <em>why </em>counsel went down a certain defense strategy path without facts to support such determinations. To permit inquiry into the alleged errors of Adgerson\u2019s trial counsel, his ineffective assistance claim would be properly asserted through a petition for postconviction relief in compliance with \u00a7\u00a7 46-21-101 through -105, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">\u00b622  Accordingly, we find that Adgerson\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is not properly before this Court and we choose not to address it on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">\u00b623 Did the trial court err in failing to grant Adgerson\u2019s motion to dismiss because Montana\u2019s stalking statute, \u00a7 45-5-220, MCA, is unconstitutional both on its face and as applied?</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">\u00b624 The grant or denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case is a question of law which is reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal. <em>State v. </em>Beanblossom, 2002 MT 351, \u00b6 9, 313 Mont. 394, \u00b6 9, 61 P.3d 165, \u00b6 9. This Court\u2019s standard of review is plenary, and we determine whether a district court\u2019s conclusion is correct. <em>Beanblossom, </em>\u00b6 9. When resolution of an issue on appeal involves a question of constitutional law, we review to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Matter of S.L.M. </em>(1997), 287 Mont. 23, 32, 951 P.2d 1365, 1370.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">\u00b625 First, Adgerson challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 45-5-220, MCA. Specifically, he asserts that the statute unconstitutionally deprives him of the right to parent his children, rights to family privacy, and rights to happiness and individual dignity, claiming the statute is vague and overbroad because the terms \u201charassing,\u201d \u201crepeatedly,\u201d and \u201cintimidating\u201d are capable of numerous meanings. Section 45-5-220, MCA, states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-9\">(1) A person commits the offense of stalking if the person purposely or knowingly causes another person substantial emotional distress or reasonable apprehension of bodily injury or death by repeatedly:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-10\">(a) following the stalked person; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-11\">(b) harassing, threatening, or intimidating the stalked person, in person or by phone, by mail, or by other action, device, or method.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-12\">(2) This section does not apply to a constitutionally protected activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-13\">\u00b626 This Court has already considered the constitutionality of this statute in <em>State v. Martel </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 143, 902 P.2d 14. In <em>Martel, </em>the appellant argued that the statute was vague because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>legislature failed to define the exact words that Adgerson now challenges. In finding that the statute was not vague in relation to these designated words, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-4\">Words such as \u201crepeatedly,\u201d \u201charassing,\u201d and \u201cintimidating\u201d have commonly understood meanings. \u201cRepeatedly\u201d means \u201cmore than once.\u201d \u201cIntimidate\u201d means \u201cto make timid; to frighten.\u201d \u201cHarass\u201d means \u201cto annoy repeatedly.\u201d A person of average intelligence would recognize and understand these terms without recourse to legislative definitions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-5\"><em>Martel, </em>273 Mont. at 150, 902 P.2d at 19 (citations omitted). Adgerson urges us to consider the Kansas Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Bryan, </em>in which that court expressed concern regarding statutes that used words such as \u201calarms\u201d or \u201cannoys\u201d because they are subject to a variety of interpretations, and without an objective standard, interpretation of such words are entirely dependent upon a victim\u2019s subjective feelings. <em>State v. Bryan </em>(Kan. 1996), 910 P.2d 212, 217. However, this Court found in <em>Martel, </em>that the terms Adgerson now challenges, were commonly understood and not subject to a variety of interpretations, thus we are not persuaded by <em>Bryan </em>and see no reason to change our interpretation of the terms set out in <em>Martel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\u00b627  In response to Adgerson\u2019s overbroad claim, we again look to our decision in <em>Martel. </em>An overbroad statute is one that forbids or burdens constitutionally unprotected activity, but by construction, also prohibits constitutionally protected activity. <em>Martel, </em>273 Mont. at 152-53, 902 P.2d at 20. In <em>Martel, </em>while considering whether this statute was overbroad, we stated, \u201cthe statute serves a plainly legitimate purpose \u2014 to discourage the repeated, intentional, harmful conduct which constitutes stalking.\u201d <em>Martel, </em>273 Mont. at 153, 902 P.2d at 20. When claiming that a statute is unconstitutional, the appellant must also illustrate how the alleged overbreadth is both \u201creal\u201d and \u201csubstantial,\u201d not only as applied to him, but how it is overbroad as applied to others. <em>Martel, </em>273 Mont. at 153, 902 P.2d at 20. This Court found that Martel did not assert any specific arguments alleging infringement of the appellant\u2019s or other\u2019s constitutionally protected First Amendment activities. Adgerson has failed to do so as well, merely asserting that he should have been granted an evidentiary hearing to provide such facts. Absent specific examples of such infringement, we find that Adgerson\u2019s overbreadth argument must fail. \u00b628 Next, Adgerson argues that the statute is not constitutional as applied to him because it denies him the right to parent his children, rights to family privacy, and rights to happiness and individual dignity. To address this argument, we review the constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>activity exception, under subsection (2) of the stalking statute. Adgerson argues that his constitutional rights to parent his children, to family privacy, and to happiness and individual dignity fit within this exception of the stalking statute, therefore the District Court erred by not granting his motion to dismiss. The legislature inserted the subsection (2) constitutional activity exception to protect \u201cpotential constitutional problems such as attempts to enforce the statute against investigative reporters or people walking a picket line.\u201d <em>Martel, </em>273 Mont. at 153-54, 902 P.2d at 21. However, we stated in <em>State v. Helfrich, </em>\u201c[depending upon the nature, timing, context and frequency of the [constitutionally protected activity, such activity]... may or may not be a constitutionally protected activity under \u00a7 45-5-220(2), MCA.\u201d <em>State v. Helfrich </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 452, 459, 922 P.2d 1159, 1163.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">\u00b629  The exception directs us to evaluate the nature, timing, context and frequency of Adgerson\u2019s alleged constitutionally protected activity. This Court has held that threats are not protected speech. <em>State v. Cooney </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 42, 49, 894 P.2d 303, 307. Additionally, we have said that activity intended to embarrass, annoy or harass is not protected speech. <em>Helfrich, </em>277 Mont. at 460, 922 P.2d at 1164. While complying with the parenting plan, Adgerson contacted Gordon concerning decision-making for their children. However, he also contacted her repeatedly about issues not related to their children in ways that frightened Gordon to a point where she feared for her safety. When we consider the facts of this case in conjunction with our holding in <em>Helfrich, </em>we find that some but not all of Adgerson\u2019s communications with Gordon are constitutionally protected. In denying his motion to dismiss, the District Court properly found that \u201cthe conduct for which Adgerson is being prosecuted, as alleged by the State, has nothing to do with his own personal happiness and dignity; it was intended to harass and intimidate his former wife.\u201d Therefore, this Court concludes that Adgerson\u2019s contacts with Gordon were not constitutionally protected and thereby did not meet the \u00a7 45-5-220(2), MCA, exception. As such, we find the trial court properly denied Adgerson\u2019s motion to dismiss, and we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b52-5\">JUSTICES RICE, NELSON, LEAPHART and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
