Mary Lyn was employed by Gasomat. On December 11, 1995, during the cotuse and scope of her employment, she was killed when the vehicle, in which she was a passenger, hit black ice and slid sideways into an oncoming semi-tractor trailer. The vehicle was driven by another Gasomat employee, Todd Adams (Adams), during the course and scope of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"AA8\">\u00b64 Gasomat was covered by workers\u2019 compensation insurance, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation benefits were paid to Okuly and his minor children.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">\u00b65 Okuly brought suit to recover wrongful death and survival damages from Gasomat\u2019s general liability insurer, USF&amp;G, and Okuly\u2019s insurer, Prudential Property and Casualty Company (Prudential), pursuant to their policies for uninsured motorist benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"Aip\">\u00b66 USF&amp;G refused to defend Gasomat. Subsequently, Gasomat entered into a settlement and confession of judgment agreement. A stipulated judgment was entered into on September 8, 1999, which provided that Okuly was owed $150,000 for separate actions of preimpact fright, $600,000 for emotional distress claims of individual family members, and $500,000 for wrongful death and survival claims, totaling $1,250,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">\u00b67 Okuly sued USF&amp;G and Prudential to collect the $500,000 judgment and moved for summary judgment. Prudential has since settled and is no longer a party to this appeal. USF&amp;G then moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">\u00b68 The District Court held that Okuly\u2019s remedy was exclusive under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the Act). The District Court granted USF&amp;G\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">\u00b69 Okuly now appeals the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">\u00b610 We review a District Court\u2019s grant or denial of summary judgment <em>de novo. Cole ex rel. Cole Revocable Trust v. Cole, </em>2003 MT 229, \u00b6 8, 317 Mont. 197, \u00b6 8, 75 P.3d 1280, \u00b6 8. We also review any legal conclusions concerning the grant or denial of summary judgment for correctness. <em>Gonzales v. Walchuk, </em>2002 MT 262, \u00b6 9, 312 Mont. 240, \u00b6 9, 59 P.3d 377, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">\u00b611 Did the District Court err in finding that Okuly could not recover from USF&amp;G a stipulated judgment of $500,000 under the uninsured motorist statute, \u00a7 33-23-201, MCA, because Okuly\u2019s exclusive remedy was under the Act?</p>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">\u00b612 Okuly argues that uninsured motorist benefits are mandated unless rejected in writing under the uninsured motorist statute, \u00a7 33-23-201, MCA. Relying on our holding in <em>Sullivan v. Doe </em>(1972), 159 Mont. 50, 495 P.2d 193, he contends that these benefits cannot be reduced by workers\u2019 compensation benefits, because such a reduction is against the policy of the uninsured motorist statute.</p>\n<p id=\"AAL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>\u00b613 Okuly also argues that his claim under the uninsured motorist statute is a contract claim, not a tort claim. He contends that his claim is a first party claim, brought by him-the insured-directly against USF&amp;G \u2014 the insurer. Therefore, because the Act targets tortious conduct of an employer or a co-employee and because his claim is a first party contract claim, Okuly argues that his claim is not barred by the Act. Consequently, Okuly argues that we should overrule our decision in <em>Hubbel v. Western Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1985), 218 Mont. 21, 706 P.2d 111, wherein we held that the Act was the injured person\u2019s exclusive remedy. <em>Hubbel, </em>218 Mont. at 26, 706 P.2d at 114. Further, Okuly contends that we should apply contract analysis to the claim at issue since the Act is not applicable to recovery of contract damages. In support of this contention, Okuly argues that contract damages can be likened to disability benefits or life insurance benefits which are not excluded by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">\u00b614 USF&amp;G argues that the uninsured motorist statute only mandates coverage for persons who are \u201clegally entitled to recover damages,\u201d and that, under our holding in <em>Hubbel, </em>the Act is Okuly\u2019s exclusive remedy. Therefore, USF&amp;G contends that because both the uninsured motorist statute and USF&amp;G\u2019s policy require him to be legally entitled to recover damages, to which he is not entitled under the Act, Okuly cannot recover the $500,000 stipulated judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\u00b615 USF&amp;G also argues that our decision in <em>Hubbel </em>should not be overruled, as our decision is consistent with the majority of jurisdictions that have already decided this exact issue. Further, USF&amp;G contends that accepting Okuly\u2019s argument would, in effect, rewrite USF&amp;G\u2019s policy as well as the uninsured motorist statute itself, since both clearly state that a person cannot recover unless that person is legally entitled to do so. Finally, USF&amp;G argues that we should not enforce the stipulated judgment upon which Okuly brings the case at bar because the District Court erred in ordering the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\u00b616 Okuly relies on <em>Sullivan </em>for his contention that uninsured motorist benefits cannot be offset by workers\u2019 compensation benefits. In <em>Sullivan, </em>a police officer was injured by an uninsured motorist. Both the police officer and his employer had uninsured motorist coverage. The police officer brought suit against both insurance companies to recover on their uninsured motorist policies. Both policies authorized an offset in benefits paid to the police officer based on the amount the police officer received in workers\u2019 compensation benefits. <em>Sullivan, </em>159 Mont. at 52-55, 495 P.2d at 194-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>\u00b617 We held in <em>Sullivan </em>that an insurance conapany cannot reduce its liability under its uninsured motorist coverage below the statutory minimum by subtracting the amount of workers\u2019 compensation benefits a person has received. <em>Sullivan, </em>159 Mont. at 60-61, 495 P.2d at 198-99. Such reduction, we held, is against the policy behind the uninsured motorist statute, namely \u201cto provide protection for the automobile insurance policyholder against the risk of inadequate compensation for injuries or death caused by the negligence of financially irresponsible motorists.\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>159 Mont. at 60, 495 P.2d at 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">\u00b618 USF&amp;G does not seek to reduce its liability through Okuly\u2019s receipt of workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Rather, USF&amp;G maintains that Okuly is not legally entitled to recover damages under its uninsured motorist policy because Okuly\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits are his exclusive remedy. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">\u00b619 We held in <em>Hubbel </em>that the decedent\u2019s remedy under the Act was exclusive. <em>Hubbel, </em>218 Mont. at 26, 706 P.2d at 114. In order to recover under Montana\u2019s uninsured motorist statute, \u00a7 33-23-201, MCA, two conditions must be met. First, a claimant must be \u201clegally entitled to recover damages\u201d from the owner or operator of the uninsured motor vehicle. Second, the driver of the motor vehicle must be uninsured. Section 33-23-201(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\u00b620 The decedent in <em>Hubbel </em>was killed in a car accident through the negligence of his co-partner. The decedent\u2019s personal representative received workers\u2019 compensation benefits, but brought suit against the employer\u2019s insurance company for damages under its uninsured motorist policy. We concluded that since neither of the above-two statutory conditions were met, decedent\u2019s personal representative was not entitled to uninsured motorist benefits. <em>Hubbel, </em>218 Mont. at 22-23, 706 P.2d at 111-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">\u00b621 In reaching our conclusion, we relied on \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, which states specifically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-8\">For all employments covered under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act or for which an election has been made for coverage ... the provisions are exclusive .... [A]n employer is not subject to any liability whatever for the death of or personal injury to an employee covered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act .... The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act binds the employee himself, and in case of death binds his personal representative and all persons having any right or claim to compensation for his injury or death</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>\u00b622  Here, Okuly is barred from bringing suit and ultimately recovering from Adams or Gasomat, since Adams was Mary Lyn\u2019s co-employee and Gasomat was her employer. As such, under \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, and our holding in <em>Hubbel, </em>Okuly\u2019s exclusive remedy is that which he already received-the workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Like decedent\u2019s personal representative in <em>Hubbel, </em>Okuly is not \u201clegally entitled to recover damages\u201d from USF&amp;G. Therefore, Okuly cannot meet the conditions of \u00a7 33-23-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">\u00b623 Because we conclude that our holding <em>in Hubbel </em>is controlling we do not reach USF&amp;G\u2019s other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">\u00b624  We hold that the District Court did not err in granting USF&amp;G\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\u00b625 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b115-7\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, REGNIER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
