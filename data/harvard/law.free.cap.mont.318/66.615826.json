We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\u00b62 Maloney presents two issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Maloney\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the charge of attempted theft?</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court\u2019s refusal to submit Maloney\u2019s instruction on determining the property\u2019s value prejudicially affect her rights by preventing the jury from receiving a full and fair instruction on the law applicable to the case?</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">\u00b65 Dawn Maloney purchased a 1986 Chrysler Fifth Avenue sedan from a used car sales lot for $150 in December 1999. In February 2000, she obtained a $200 loan secured by the car\u2019s title from Montana Title Pawn. Maloney did not repay the loan, and the car was repossessed on April 8, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">\u00b66 Maloney reported to her insurance company, State Farm, that the car had been stolen. A claims representative told Maloney that she needed to submit an Affidavit of Vehicle Theft (AVT) and a police report in order for State Farm to settle her claim. Shortly after speaking with the claims representative, Maloney went to Montana Title Pawn and asked how she could redeem the car. On May 3, 2000, she filed a report with the Bozeman police department and also executed an AVT, which she submitted to State Farm. She did not attempt to redeem the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-12\">\u00b67 In the AVT, Maloney stated that she had paid $150 for the car, and that the amount for which she was making the claim was $2,575. She listed the odometer reading as 26,000 miles, and stated that the car had \u201cgood\u201d paint and body, and \u201cexcellent\u201d transmission and engine, at the time of the purported theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-13\">\u00b68 A State Farm Insurance Claim Specialist investigated Maloney\u2019s claim and discovered that her car had not been stolen, but had, in fact, been repossessed by Montana Title Pawn. State Farm denied her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-14\">\u00b69 Maloney was charged with Attempted Theft, a Felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-4-103 and \u00a7 45-6-301, MCA (1999); False Reports to Law Enforcement Authorities, aMisdemeanor, \u00a7 45-7-205, MCA(1999); and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>False Swearing, a Misdemeanor, \u00a7 45-7-202, MCA (1999). The False Swearing charge was dropped during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\u00b610 Maloney was tried before a jury on February 21, 2002. After the close of the State\u2019s case, she moved for a directed verdict on the ground that the State failed to prove the element of value necessary to convict an accused of the offense of felony attempted theft. The District Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\u00b611 During the settlement of jury instructions, Maloney requested that the jury be instructed as to how to determine the value of the property at issue. The District Court ruled that \u201cvalue\u201d was adequately addressed in the lesser included offense instruction and refused to give Maloney\u2019s proposed instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">\u00b612 The jury found Maloney guilty of the two charges. Maloney appeals her conviction on the felony attempted theft charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">\u00b613 Our standard of review of a trial court\u2019s decision to deny a criminal defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict is for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Brady, </em>2002 MT 282, \u00b6 20, 302 Mont. 174, \u00b6 20, 13 P.3d 941, \u00b6 20 (citations omitted). When the evidence in a criminal case is insufficient to support a guilty verdict, the trial court may dismiss the action and discharge the defendant. Section 46-16-403, MCA. A defendant is entitled to a directed verdict of acquittal if reasonable persons could not conclude from the evidence, taken in a light most favorable to the State, that guilt was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Brady, </em>\u00b6 20 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">\u00b614 Our standard of review of a jury instruction in a criminal case is whether the instruction fully and fairly instructed the jury on the law applicable to the case. Since a trial court has broad discretion when instructing a jury, reversible error will occur only if the jury instructions prejudicially affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>State v. Strauss, </em>2003 MT 195, \u00b6 47, 317 Mont. 1, \u00b6 47, 74 P.3d 1052, \u00b6 47 (citing <em>State v. Courville, </em>2002 MT 330, \u00b6 15, 313 Mont. 218, \u00b6 15, 61 P.3d 749, \u00b6 15). When a proposed jury instruction is adequately covered by a given instruction, it is not erroneous for a trial court to refuse the proposed instruction. <em>State v. DuBray, </em>2003 MT 255, \u00b6 92, 317 Mont. 377, \u00b6 92, 77 P.3d 247, \u00b6 92 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A0U\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">\u00b615 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Maloney\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the charge of attempted theft?</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">\u00b616 At the close of the State\u2019s case, Maloney moved for a directed verdict on the grounds that the value of the property at issue had not been established. Under \u00a7 45-6-301(7), MCA (1999), theft of property not exceeding $1,000 in value is a misdemeanor, while theft of property exceeding $1,000 in value is afelony. Section 45-2-101(76)(b), MCA (1999), provides: \u201cWhen it cannot be determined if the value of the property is more or less than $1,000 ... its value is considered to be an amount less than $1,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u00b617 Maloney argues that the State did not present sufficient evidence from which a jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the property at issue was valued at more than $1,000, and thus the value had to be considered as less than $1,000 per \u00a7 45-2-101(76)(b), MCA. She maintains that State Farm would not have paid the full amount of the claim, and that the State failed to put on evidence to establish conclusively what her claim was actually worth. Maloney argues that the only substantial evidence presented valued the car at either $150 (the purchase price) or $200 (the title loan amount).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\u00b618 Maloney does not argue that the property at issue is the car; she argues that the property at issue is the insurance claim, and that the \u201cvalue\u201d is the actual value of the insurance claim, not the amount she requested on the AVT. Maloney argues that an insurance company does not generally pay the full amount demanded on an insurance claim, and that the State had the burden of establishing how much State Farm would have actually paid on her claim, in order to establish its value.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">\u00b619 The State argues that the value of the property is $2,575, the amount Maloney requested from State Farm. The State points out that there is a difference between actual theft and attempted theft in terms of property value. At trial, the State argued that a bank robber who grabs $10,000 but drops $5,000 on the way out the door <em>attempted </em>to steal $10,000. Following this reasoning, the State maintains that Maloney attempted to steal $2,575 from State Farm. Had State Farm not discovered her deception, it may have paid her less than $1,000 on her claim, but that would not affect the amount she <em>attempted </em>to steal. The fact that she did not receive the funds in the amount that she requested does not negate the fact she attempted to acquire them.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">\u00b620  Maloney points to this Court\u2019s holding in <em>State v. Martin, </em>2001 MT 83, 305 Mont. 123, 23 P.3d 216, in which we concluded that the property\u2019s value is an essential element in a felony theft case and that it must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Martin, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 60-61. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>However, Martin is of no assistance here. In Maloney\u2019s case, the property at issue was not the car, but, rather, was the insurance claim. Maloney herself stated in the AVT that she believed her claim to be worth $2,575. Whether or not State Farm would have paid Maloney $2,575 for the car is irrelevant to the question of how much money she <em>attempted </em>to gain from the insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">\u00b621  Maloney concedes that the District Court was required to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State when considering her motion. She further concedes that the law recognizes the ability of an owner to express the value of her property. The District Court determined that there was sufficient evidence presented for the jury to be able to determine whether or not the property which Maloney attempted to steal was valued at greater than $1,000. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">\u00b622 Thus, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Maloney\u2019s Motion for a Directed Verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">\u00b623 Did the District Court\u2019s refusal to submit Maloney\u2019s instruction on determining the property\u2019s value prejudicially affect her rights by preventing the jury from receiving a full and fair instruction on the law applicable to the case?</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">\u00b624 Maloney argues that the jury should have been given her Proposed Instruction Number Four, which, drawing from \u00a7 45-2-101(76)(b), MCA, read,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-9\">Value\u2019 means the market value of the property at the time and place of the crime. When it cannot be determined, beyond a reasonable doubt, if the value of the property is more or less than $1,000, its value is considered to be an amount less than $1,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvI\">\u00b625 The State objected to the submission of this proposed instruction, arguing that the property at issue was the insurance claim and that the value of the claim is the amount requested by the alleged wrongdoer. The State argued that a person who requests over $1,000 while perpetuating a lie is committing an attempted felony theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">\u00b626 The District Court rejected Maloney\u2019s proposed instruction, and gave the following as Instruction Number 13:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-11\">The Defendant is charged with attempted theft of property of a value in excess of $1,000. Attempted theft of property of a value of less than $1,000, is a lesser included offense. A lesser-included offense is one that is less serious than the charged offense. The Defendant cannot be convicted of more than one of these offenses. Therefore, after considering all of the evidence as it pertains to the charge, and the lesser included offense, you should first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>consider the verdict on the greater offense of attempted theft. If you are unable after reasonable effort to reach a verdict on the greater offense, you may consider the lesser offense of attempted theft of property of a value less than $1,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-4\">In the event you find the Defendant guilty of attempted theft of property of a value in excess of $1,000, you need to go no further as you will have reached a verdict on this charge and shall proceed to the charge of false report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\">In the event you find the defendant guilty of the lesser included offense of attempted theft of property of a value less than $1,000, then you need go no further as you have reached a verdict on this charge and shall proceed to the charge of false report.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">\u00b627  While an instruction in a criminal case must contain an explanation of the crime, it need not contain the exact statutory language. <em>State v. Campbell </em>(1972), 160 Mont. 111, 114, 500 P.2d 801, 803. Furthermore, District Courts are given broad discretion in instructing the jury, and while a defendant is entitled to have the jury instructed on her theory of the case, she is not entitled to an instruction concerning every nuance of her argument. <em>State v. Long </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 228, 234, 907 P.2d 945, 948 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">\u00b628 The lesser included offense instruction given to the jury gave it the opportunity to consider the lesser included offense if the jury could not agree that the property\u2019s value exceeded $1,000. Furthermore, Maloney had the opportunity to argue that the claim did not have a value exceeding $1,000, and in fact did so during closing arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"AHP\">\u00b629  We conclude that the District Court\u2019s tendered instruction adequately informed the jury that value is an element of the charged offense and that it must determine that the value of the property at issue exceeded $1,000 in order to find Maloney guilty of the greater offense. Although Maloney\u2019s proposed instruction did more precisely follow the language of \u00a7 45-2-101(76)(b), MCA, it would have been largely redundant to Instruction 13 and would have added little to the jury\u2019s understanding of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">\u00b630  Having determined that the element of value was adequately covered in another instruction, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s refusal to offer Maloney\u2019s Proposed Instruction Number Four did not prejudicially affect her substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">\u00b631 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b94-11\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LE APHART, REGNIER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
