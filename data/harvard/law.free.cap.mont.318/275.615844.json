(Rail Link) and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company (BNSF); and (3) failing to direct the conservator to establish special needs trusts. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AFj\">\u00b62 Russell E. and Sandra L. Simmons brought this action in September of 2001, seeking court approval of settlements they had negotiated with Rail Link and BNSF for personal injuries and damages to their grandchildren, Roxanne D. Simmons (Roxanne) and Russell W. Simmons, Jr. (Russell), and their grandchildren\u2019s half-sister, Samantha Ann Esterbrook (Samantha), as a result of an April 11,1996, train derailment and chlorine spill in Alberton, Montana. The Simmonses\u2019 petitions for court approval of the settlements stated the Simmonses were the court-appointed guardians of the three children. The Simmonses also sought appointment of a guardian ad litem to manage and protect the settlements. The Simmonses\u2019 son-Roxanne\u2019s and Russell\u2019s father-consented to the petition and the proposed settlements. King, the mother of all three children, did not oppose the settlement amounts but opposed the proposed plan for administering the trusts and asked to be substituted for the Simmonses as the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">\u00b63 The District Court held five hearings in this matter. Before the fifth hearing, the Simmonses\u2019 guardianships of the children were dissolved in a separate proceeding not of record in this case, and the children began residing with King. After that time, the District Court held its final hearing in this matter, in which it approved the settlements with Rail Link and BNSF. The court appointed attorney John Schulte as conservator of the children\u2019s monies and gave Schulte authority to choose the investment firms to hold those monies. The court provided that money may only be removed from the settlement accounts by court order. King appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">\u00b64 We review findings of fact to ascertain whether they are clearly erroneous and conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>In re Estate of McDermott, </em>2002 MT 164, \u00b6 22, 310 Mont. 435, \u00b6 22, 51 P.3d 486, \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AId\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">\u00b65 Did the District Court err by including the Simmonses as parties to future matters involving the conservatorship of King\u2019s children?</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">\u00b66 King contends the District Court erred in including the Simmonses as parties to future matters. She claims their interest terminated with the dissolution of their court-appointed guardianships <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>of the children. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">\u00b67  \u201cInterested person\u201d is defined broadly at \u00a7 72-1-103(25), MCA, as an heir, devisee, child, spouse, creditor, beneficiary, or any other person having a property right or claim against a trust estate. A person who is furnishing or supplying any money for support or care of a person for whom a conservator has been appointed is a person interested in the welfare of the protected person. Section 72-5-413(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">\u00b68 In this case, it is undisputed that the Simmonses were the children\u2019s guardians and caregivers for several years immediately preceding the conservatorship, without significant financial support from King or the children\u2019s fathers. Counsel indicated at the fifth hearing that the children continued to stay with the Simmonses on weekends after they went to live with King. It was the Simmonses who negotiated-and petitioned the District Court for approval of-the settlements with Rail Link and BNSF for the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">\u00b69  The Simmonses arguably have claims against the trust estates for their care of the children. In addition, they contributed monies to which they were entitled from Rail Link and BNSF for their own injuries and damages from the train derailment and chlorine spill to the children\u2019s settlements. We hold the District Court did not err by including the Simmonses as parties to future matters regarding the conservatorship.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">\u00b610 Did the District Court err in requiring the Simmonses\u2019 consent for stipulations for disbursement of settlement monies Roxanne, Russell and Samantha received from Rail Link and BNSF?</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">\u00b611 King says the District Court erred in requiring the Simmonses\u2019 consent for disbursement of settlement monies Roxanne, Russell and Samantha received from Rail Link and BNSF. She claims the Simmonses\u2019 interest ended with the dissolution of their court-appointed guardianship of the children. This issue is simply a restatement of Issue One, phrased differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">\u00b612  We held above that the Simmonses are proper parties to future conservatorship proceedings. Having done so, we also hold the District Court did not err in including the Simmonses, along with their son and King, as parties to any stipulations for disbursal of settlement monies.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">\u00b613 Did the District Court err in failing to direct Schulte to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>special needs trusts?</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">\u00b614 King claims the District Court erred in ordering Schulte to deposit the settlement proceeds in interest-bearing accounts without specifying the terms of special needs trusts. It appears that the District Court concluded that since monies were provided to the children by Rail Link and BNSF in settlement of their personal injuries, such funds should be used for the payment of any necessary medical expenses rather than allow the children to have at least part of their needs met through their eligibility for Medicaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\u00b615 King failed to present any evidence at the hearings in the District Court concerning approval of the proposed settlements, or more specifically any evidence or clearly defined argument supporting the need or basis for establishing the special needs trusts. Normally, we will not hold a district court in error for a proceeding in which the parties acquiesced. <em>State v. LaDue, </em>2001 MT 47, \u00b6 23, 304 Mont. 288, \u00b6 23, 20 P.3d 775, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\u00b616 Correspondingly, King does not provide us much more on appeal. In her opening brief on appeal, King sets forth several definitional authorities regarding what a special needs trust is, including a statement that \u201c[u]nder certain circumstances, a special needs trust <em>may </em>be established\u201d for particular purposes. (Emphasis added). She does not, however, advance any authority under which it would be error not to establish such trusts in the present case. While she does cite to one case in her reply brief, it is well-established that we do not consider new matter raised for the first time in a reply brief. <em>See </em>Rule 23(c), M.RApp.P.; <em>State v. Sattler, </em>1998 MT 57, \u00b6 47, 288 Mont. 79, \u00b6 47, 956 P.2d 54, \u00b6 <em>47; </em>EBI/<em>Orion Group v. Blythe </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 50, 57, 931 P.2d 38, 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">\u00b617 With the record presented, we normally would not grant relief to a litigant who fails to document its arguments sufficiently in the district court and this Court. Consequently, we understand the District Court\u2019s position in this matter. However, we are concerned about the well being and protection of the minors involved in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar0E\">\u00b618 Special needs trusts are appropriately designed for certain situations so as to ensure the beneficiary\u2019s support and future eligibility for Medicaid and other governmental benefits. When properly used, these trusts are prepared and approved with the consent of the various governmental entities charged with the responsibility of such programs. Specifically, in certain catastrophic personal injury cases, victims may have to compromise their claims when facing the questionable liability of the defendant. Although such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>compromise settlements are in the best interests of the victims, the result is that the victims are only compensated partially and sometimes minimally compared to the actual damages suffered. In such situations, it is entirely proper to recognize in the settlement documents that the victims\u2019 actual damages far exceed the amount of settlement received and the proceeds received represent compensation for nonmedical damages. In these cases, a special needs trust may be properly used to preserve the victims\u2019 eligibility for Medicaid and other governmental programs. These personal injury plaintiffs are not \u201cdouble dipping,\u201d but all involved simply recognize that the compensation paid does not fully compensate the injured parties and thus Medicaid can be preserved to meet their future medical needs.</p>\n<p id=\"ARU\">\u00b619  Although the record was not sufficiently developed on all of these matters, we are concerned that under the circumstances these children may not have been properly protected by the District Court\u2019s rejection of a special needs trust. Therefore, we think the proper course is to reverse and remand this matter to the District Court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">\u00b620 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b302-5\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b302-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"AG-\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">\u00b621 I join the Court\u2019s opinion affirming the District Court on Issues One and Two. King clearly failed to establish error by the District Court with regard to the Simmonses being parties to future matters involving the conservatorship of King\u2019s children and with regard to requiring their consent for stipulations for disbursement of settlement monies to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">\u00b622 I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s opinion on Issue Three, relating to the special needs trusts. I do so for the same reasons as I join the Court\u2019s opinion on the earlier issues: King has not established error. In other words, I dissent for the reasons stated so candidly by the Court. I would affirm the District Court on this issue as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">\u00b623 I, too, am concerned about the well being and protection of these children. However, as the Court properly notes, Kang did not present evidence or clearly defined argument in the trial court supporting the need or basis for establishing special needs trusts. I also agree with the Court that she does not do so on appeal and, indeed, does not advance a single authority in her opening brief under which the District Court erred in not establishing such trusts in the present case. I disagree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>with the Court that only \u201cnormally\u201d would we grant relief to an appellant who fails to support her or his argument in either the trial court or at this Court. Our cases are legion that we do not even consider arguments not supported by authority as required by Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P. <em>See, e.g., Wiard v. Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp., </em>2003 MT 295, \u00b6 30, 318 Mont. 132, \u00b6 30, 79 P.3d 281, \u00b6 30; <em>In re Marriage of Gerhart, </em>2003 MT 292, \u00b6 24, 318 Mont. 94, \u00b6 24, 78 P.3d 1219, \u00b6 24; <em>In re Marriage of Clark, </em>2003 MT 168, \u00b6 25, 316 Mont. 327, \u00b6 25, 71 P.3d 1228, \u00b6 25; <em>Hawkins v. Harney, </em>2003 MT 58, \u00b6 34, 314 Mont. 384, \u00b6 34, 66 P.3d 305, \u00b6 34. To reverse a District Court on a record-and briefing-such as that before us here is, in my view, insupportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">\u00b624 The appellant bears the burden of establishing error. <em>See, e.g., Hawkins, \u00b6 </em>35; <em>In re Marriage of McMahon, </em>2002 MT 198, <em>\u00b6 </em>7, 311 Mont. 175, \u00b6 7, 53 P3d 1266, \u00b6 7; <em>Matter of M.J.W., </em>1998 MT 142, \u00b6 18, 289 Mont. 232, \u00b6 18, 961 P.2d 105, \u00b6 18. The Court admits that Kong has not satisfied her burden here. Our concern for the children notwithstanding, it is our duty to apply the law, not to simply-and without any legal justification-reverse a district court under circumstances such as these.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\u00b625 The Court sets an unwise and dangerous precedent here. It signals that it will reverse trial courts, without any legal basis whatsoever, when it has \u201cconcerns.\u201d How it will decide when to exercise such extraordinary discretion in future cases remains to be seen. I cannot agree with turning Montana\u2019s legal system on its head in such a fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\u00b626 I would affirm the District Court on all three issues. I dissent from the Court\u2019s refusal to do so.</p>\n<judges id=\"b303-7\">JUSTICE WARNER joins in the foregoing concurring and dissenting opinion of CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
