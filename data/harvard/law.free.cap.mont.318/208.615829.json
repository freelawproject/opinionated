The District Court adjudicated the three children youths in need of care and terminated the parental rights of Mother, as well as the parental rights of the respective fathers of each of the children. Only Mother\u2019s rights are at issue on appeal. We affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">\u00b62 Mother raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-10\">1. Does the Indian Child Welfare Act apply to the termination of Mother\u2019s rights to C.H. and D.H.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-12\">2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it terminated Mother\u2019s parental rights?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-14\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b231-15\">\u00b63 In 1992, Mother initiated contact with the Department of Health and Human Services (the Department) because her oldest child, C.H.-who was then approximately twenty months old-was uncontrollable. Since that time, Mother has had two more children, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>S.H., and D.H., and the Department has continued to provide Mother with parenting skills classes and other services. Visits to Mother\u2019s home revealed a situation of chaos and dysfunction. The home was extremely messy and cluttered, with dirty dishes, old dried food, clothes and paper all over. The Department responded to numerous reports of Mother\u2019s poor judgment and physical altercations amongst Mother and the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\u00b64 Numerous mental health care professionals have interacted with the family members. They report that although Mother can recite the lessons from parenting skills classes, she displays a lack of decision-making ability. She does not know what needs to be done in the next minute, hour or day. She misses the significance, severity and intensity of nonverbal cues from her children. This results in a situation of neglect. Because of wild behavior, each of the children has received various psychological diagnoses. C.H. was removed from Mother\u2019s care in April 2000. S.H. was removed in October 2000, and D.H. was removed in March 2001. By all accounts, now placed in structured and stable environments, the children are doing better outside of Mother\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">\u00b65 From January 2001 to July 2002, Mother had three different court-approved treatment plans. Each plan required Mother to deal with her own mental health issues so that she would be able to provide a safe, structured and stable environment for the children. The plans had different benchmarks, such as being on time and attending all meetings for herself and her children, submitting to urine analysis for drugs, allowing her mental health care providers to share information with the Department, and keeping her house clean. The social worker who devised the plans did not think Mother had successfully completed, the plans. None of the professionals who testified at the hearing were in favor of Mother keeping her parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\u00b66 Also at issue is the Native American heritage of two of the children. At the hearing, the Department provided Mylene Widner as a possible expert. Widner is an enrolled member of the Crow Indian Tribe and is also a descendant of the Little Shell Band of the Chippewa. Based on her familiarity with the Little Shell and her review of the record, Widner testified to the following. C.H.\u2019s father qualifies and is enrolled for membership in the Little Shell Band of the Chippewa, based on his one-quarter blood quantum, the minimum blood quantum necessary to qualify for membership. C.H. has one-eighth blood quantum and does not qualify for membership. Widner also explained that the abuse and neglect of C.H. was not related to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>any Little Shell custom or tradition.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">\u00b67 After the conclusion of the termination hearing, the District Court ordered briefs concerning the Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1901-1923 (\u201cICWA\u201d) issues. Only the Department filed a brief. Based on all of its knowledge of the case, the Department only addressed the Indian heritage of C.H. On Mother\u2019s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, her counsel included a footnote stating that she had been told that D.H.\u2019s father was an enrolled member of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe. This was the first and only indication that D.H. may be a Native American. On appeal, Mother raises ICWA issues for both C.H. and D.H.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">\u00b68 We review a District Court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights to determine whether the District Court abused its discretion. <em>In re A.F., </em>2003 MT 254, \u00b6 12, 317 Mont. 367, \u00b6 12, 77 P.3d 266, \u00b6 12. The test for abuse of discretion is \u201cwhether the trial court acted arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>In re D.V., </em>2003 MT 160, \u00b6 14, 316 Mont. 282, \u00b6 14, 70 P.3d 1253, \u00b6 14. A district court must make specific fact findings in accordance with statutory requirements before terminating parental rights. <em>In re J.V., </em>2003 MT 68, \u00b6 7, 314 Mont. 487, \u00b6 7, 67 P.3d 242, \u00b6 7. We review those findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous, and we review conclusions of law to determine whether the court correctly interpreted the law. <em>In re J.V., </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">\u00b69 A parent\u2019s right to the care and custody of a child is a fundamental interest. However, a court\u2019s paramount concern in a parental rights termination proceeding is the best interest of the children. <em>In re D.V., </em>\u00b6 15. Primary consideration shall be given to the physical, mental, and emotional conditions and needs of the children. Section 41-3-609(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">\u00b610 1. Does the Indian Child Welfare Act apply to the termination of Mother\u2019s rights to C.H. and D.H.?</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">\n<em>A. Policy of ICWA and applicable rules.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">\u00b611 The principal purpose of ICWA is to \u201cpromote the stability and security of Indian tribes by preventing further loss of their children; and to protect the best interests of Indian children by retaining their connection to the tribes.\u201d <em>In re Baby Girl Doe </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 380, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>388, 865 P.2d 1090, 1095. Congress\u2019s declaration of policy for ICWA states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-4\">The Congress hereby declares that it is the policy of this Nation to protect the best interests of Indian children and to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families by the establishment of minimum Federal standards for the removal of Indian children from their families and the placement of such children in foster or adoptive homes which will reflect the unique values of Indian culture, and by providing for assistance to Indian tribes in the operation of child and family service programs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1902. ICWA is clear and unambiguous that \u201cthere is no resource that is more vital to the continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than their children.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1901(3). ICWA recognizes the unique and privileged interest that Indian tribes have in the welfare and upbringing of Indian children.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">\u00b612 For the purpose of ICWA, an \u201cIndian Child\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">any unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is either (a) a member of an Indian tribe or (b) is eligible for membership in an Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">\u00b613 For ICWA to apply, the Indian tribe in question must be recognized by the Secretary of the Interior as eligible for services provided to Indians by the Secretary. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(8) and (11).</p>\n<p id=\"Ar0\">\u00b614 In state court proceedings for the termination of parental rights of Indian children, notice must be given to the Indian child\u2019s tribe. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912. Any parent from whose custody a child was removed may petition any court of competent jurisdiction to invalidate such action based on the lack of proper notice to the tribe, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1914. Furthermore, ICWA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-10\">In any State court proceeding for the foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child, the Indian custodian of the child and the Indian child\u2019s tribe shall have a right to intervene at any point in the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1911(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">\n<em>B. ICWA analysis for C.H.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b234-13\">\u00b615 The Department contends that ICWA does not apply in the present case. However, in an abundance of caution, the Department had Mylene Widner testify as an ICWA expert. Widner is a descendant of the Little Shell Band of the Chippewa and is an enrolled member of the Crow. Widner testified that she was familiar with the Little Shell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>standards for membership and their child-rearing practices. Her testimony was also based on her review of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">\u00b616 According to Widner, C.H.\u2019s father qualifies for enrollment as a member of the Little Shell Band of the Chippewa by dint of his one-quarter blood quantum, the tribe\u2019s minimum standard. C.H., however, only has one-eighth blood quantum and does not qualify for enrollment. Furthermore, Widner testified that the Little Shell Band is not a federally recognized tribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\u00b617  We conclude ICWA does not apply to C.H. for two reasons. First, C.H. is not an Indian child as defined by ICWA. ICWA requires that a child be eligible for membership in the tribe. C.H. is not eligible because of her insufficient blood quantum. Second, ICWA does not apply to tribes which have not yet been federally recognized. Although other bands of Chippewa are recognized, the Little Shell Band is not currently recognized by the Secretary of the Interior as eligible to receive services. 67 Fed. Reg. 46,328 (July 12, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\n<em>C. ICWA analysis for D.H.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\u00b618 Prior to the proposed findings of fact there was no indication from any of the parties or witnesses that one of the children other than C.H. might have qualified as an Indian Child under ICWA. We note that the initial order to show cause included notice of ICWA and was served on both Mother and R.H., the natural father of D.H. The notice briefly summarized the rights afforded under ICWA, and specifically stated, \u201cyour children\u2019s Indian Tribe will be contacted if you have made it known which Tribe your children are enrolled in or is [sic] enrollable in.\u201d Mother raised the ICWA issue in regard to D.H. in her proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in a footnote, which stated: \u201c[Mother] has not alleged that she is a member of an Indian Tribe, however, the undersigned counsel has been verbally advised that [R.H.], [D.H.]\u2019s father is an enrolled member of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe.\u201d The record reveals minimal participation of R.H. Although he was served with the order vacating and resetting permanent custody hearing, he did not appear at the hearing. His court-appointed counsel indicated R.H. did not want to parent D.H. or to work with the Department. He did not sign his treatment plans. Thus, we are faced with a situation where an important and legally significant fact was not effectively raised until after the trial was over and the appeal was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">\u00b619  Normally, issues not raised at the trial court will not be addressed by this Court. <em>See In re G.S., </em>2002 MT 245, \u00b6 48, 312 Mont. 108, \u00b6 48, 59 P.3d 1063, \u00b6 48. \u201cIt is fundamentally unfair to fault the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>trial court for failing to rule correctly on an issue it was never given the opportunity to consider.\u201d <em>City of Missoula v. Campbell, </em>2001 MT 271, \u00b6 13, 307 Mont. 286, \u00b6 13, 37 P.3d 670, \u00b6 13. Mother cites no authority which would allow her to invalidate the termination proceedings with nothing more than a belated footnote raising the possibility of D.H.\u2019s Indian child status. We will not overturn a child termination proceeding for failure to comply with ICWA when neither the Department nor the District Court had any notice of the possibility that the child might qualify as an Indian child, the child\u2019s alleged Indian father gave no indication of Indian heritage or interest in the child, and the mother did not give timely notice of the potential issue. \u00b620 ICWA only requires notice to the tribe when \u201cthe court knows or has reason to know that an Indian child is involved.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a). The Bureau of Indian Affairs has issued nonbinding guidelines to assist courts in interpreting the foregoing. <em>Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield </em>(1989), 490 U.S. 30, 53, 109 S.Ct. 1597, 1610, 104 L.Ed.2d 29, 49; and <em>In re M.G., </em>2003 MT 60, \u00b6 10, 314 Mont. 396, \u00b6 10, 66 P.3d 312, \u00b6 10, <em>citing to </em>44 Fed. Reg. 67, 584 to 67, 585 (1979). The guidelines list \u201c[c]ircumstances under which a state court has reason to believe a child involved in a child custody proceeding is an Indian include but are not limited to the following,\u201d the last of which is \u201c[a]n officer of the court involved in the proceeding has knowledge that the child may be an Indian child.\u201d Guidelines for State Courts; Indian Child Custody Proceedings, 44 Fed. Reg. at 67,586. Attorneys are officers of the court. <em>See, e.g., Steele v. McGregor, </em>1998 MT 85, \u00b6 28, 288 Mont. 238, \u00b6 28, 956 P.2d 1364, \u00b6 28. If we were to give a strict interpretation to this guideline, the knowledge of Mother\u2019s counsel that D.H. might qualify as an Indian Child would arguably be sufficient to undermine the entire termination proceeding. However, the guidelines are not binding but are intended to assist state courts in application of ICWA. 44 Fed. Reg. 67,584-585. We have previously determined the guidelines are persuasive authority. <em>In re M.R.G., </em>\u00b6 10. Because ICWA is a remedial statute, its terms should be liberally construed to achieve their purpose. One purpose of ICWA is to afford tribes the opportunity to intervene by providing that tribes receive notice <em>before </em>proceedings begin. <em>In re Adoption of Riffle </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 237, 241, 902 P.2d 542, 544 (citing 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912). In the present case, this purpose could not be honored because the court did not know or have reason to know of the possibility of D.H.\u2019s Indian heritage until <em>after </em>the termination hearing had concluded. As pointed out below, this is not to say that, if D.H.\u2019s Indian heritage qualifies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>under ICWA, the tribe may not participate in future proceedings concerning D.H.\u2019s placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">\u00b621 Although we deny Mother\u2019s ICWA claim, we recognize the inherent remedial character of ICWA and that we have a \u201cresponsibility to promote and protect the unique Indian cultures of our state for future generations of Montanans.\u201d <em>In re K.H. and K.L.E., </em>1999 MT 128, \u00b6 20, 294 Mont. 466, \u00b6 20, 981 P.2d 1190, \u00b6 20. It behooves us to take great pains to ensure that the prerequisites of ICWA have been satisfied. <em>In re K.H., </em>\u00b6 29. ICWA protects the best interests of Indian children by making sure that their unique cultural heritage is taken into account. ICWA gives rights not only to parents of Indian children, but also to their tribe(s). <em>In re C.H., </em>2000 MT 64, 299 Mont. 62, 997 P.2d 776; 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1914. ICWA recognizes that tribes have a unique interest and ability to provide services in the upbringing of Indian children.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\u00b622  One very valid reason to give notice to the tribe is so that it may become involved in the upbringing of its members and be allowed to provide the services for which it is uniquely situated to provide. Also, in considering the best interests of the child in question, a court will necessarily consider the child\u2019s ethnic and cultural heritage. But here, faced with a silent record, we have no idea whether or not D.H. even qualifies as an Indian child, and if he does, whether the tribe is interested in being involved in his case, and if it is, whether the tribe might be able to locate extended family members who would be able to provide the level of care necessary for D.H. If D.H. does qualify as an Indian child and his tribe is interested in participating in placement proceedings, it should be afforded the opportunity to do so even though the proceeding for termination of parental rights has already transpired and concluded. \u201cEven if a tribe fails to intervene at the beginning of a proceeding, it is not precluded from intervening at a later point in the absence of an express waiver of the right to intervene.\u201d <em>Adoption of Riffle, </em>273 Mont. at 241, 902 P.2d at 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\u00b623 Although the District Court did not know for the purposes of \u00a7 1912 that D.H. might be an Indian child for the termination proceeding, we conclude that for any future proceeding regarding D.H., this appeal itself sufficiently puts the District Court and the Department on notice that D.H. might be an Indian child. Accordingly, notice must be given to the Northern Cheyenne so that it may determine whether or not D.H. is or is not an Indian child. Only after that determination has been made, and the tribe has been given actual notice and a chance to become involved, will it be possible to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>what subsequent ICWA proceedings are appropriate, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b624 2. Did the District Court exercise proper discretion in terminating Mother\u2019s parental rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b625 The District Court found that termination of Mother\u2019s parental rights was proper pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(b) and (f), MCA, which provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">(1) The court may order a termination of the parent-child legal relationship upon a finding that any of the following circumstances exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">(b) the child has been abandoned by the parents;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">[or] (f) the child is an adjudicated youth in need of care and both of the following exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-9\">(i) an appropriate treatment plan that has been approved by the court has not been complied with by the parents or has not been successful; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-10\">(ii) the conduct or condition of the parents rendering them unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">Section 41-3-609(l)(b) and (f), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">\u00b626 We have previously upheld termination of parental rights where substantial evidence demonstrates a failure to meet the terms of the treatment plan. In <em>In re K.S, </em>although some friends testified against termination of parental rights, the bulk of evidence demonstrated a failure to meet the treatment plan. <em>In re K.S., </em>2003 MT 212, \u00b6\u00b6 18-20, 317 Mont. 88, \u00b6\u00b6 18-20,75 P.3d 325, \u00b6\u00b6 18-20. Termination of parental rights was proper where there was a long course and documented history of abuse and neglect and a likelihood the same conduct would be repeated. <em>In re G.S., </em>2002 MT 245, 312 Mont. 108, 59 P.3d 1063. We upheld the termination of parental rights when the parent missed many mandatory meetings with the children and the children began acting out again when the parent did make it to the meetings. <em>In re Custody and Parental Rights of A.L.R., </em>2002 MT 183, \u00b6 18, 311 Mont. 76, \u00b6 18, 54 P.3d 17, \u00b6 18. Also, the likelihood of the parent to repeat the same conduct is a factor to consider. <em>A.L.R., </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-13\">\u00b627 Mere compliance with the terms of a treatment plan does not always lead to successful completion. <em>In re S.M., </em>2001 MT 11, \u00b6 44, 304 Mont. 102, \u00b6 44, 19 P.3d 213, \u00b6 44; <em>Matter of S.M., </em>1999 MT 36, \u00b6 24, 293 Mont. 294, \u00b6 24, 975 P.2d 334, \u00b6 24. \u201c[I]t is well established that a treatment plan can be unsuccessful even when the tasks were completed.\u201d <em>Matter of S.M., </em>\u00b6 25. \u201cPartial compliance with a treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>plan is insufficient to preclude termination of parental rights.\u201d <em>In re B.C. </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 423, 430, 942 P.2d 106, 111. In <em>In re S.M., </em>the mother had allowed her two children to be abused by two different men. Her treatment plans were not successful because she remained unable to understand or to anticipate the dangers her decisions posed to her children. <em>In re S.M., </em>2001 MT 11, \u00b6 45, 304 Mont. 102, 19 P.3d 213. In <em>In re D.H., </em>the parents partially completed their treatment plans and attended the mandatory counseling sessions, however, the plans were not \u201csuccessful\u201d in their completion because the parents had not improved their parenting skills nor were they able to protect their children. <em>In re D.H., </em>2001 MT 200, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30, 306 Mont. 278, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30, 33 P.3d 616, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30. <em>In re Declaring E.W., </em>the mother complied with the terms of the treatment plan but the testimony was conflicting as to whether or not the plan had been successful. <em>In re Declaring E.W., </em>1998 MT 135, \u00b6\u00b6 19-25, 289 Mont. 190, \u00b6\u00b6 19-25, 959 P.2d 951, \u00b6\u00b6 19-25. The children\u2019s pediatrician testified that they were \u201chigh needs\u201d children and the mother did not have the ability to respond to their needs. <em>In re Declaring E.W., </em>\u00b6 21. We concluded that the lower court\u2019s decision to terminate that mother\u2019s parental rights was supported by substantial evidence and was not clearly erroneous. <em>In re Declaring E.W., </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\u00b628 Here, Mother contends that she was complying with all of the terms of her latest court approved treatment plan. The last two treatment plans had four goals for Mother: (1) address her mental health issues; (2) establish a stable, consistent and safe environment; (3) address her children\u2019s mental health needs; and (4) establish a healthy relationship with her children and effectively parent. The record indicates that over a long period of years, Mother was the recipient of services under various and sundry social programs. She would show improvement for a time but inevitably relapse into her previous ways of doing things as she became overwhelmed. To successfully complete the treatment plan, it was vital that Mother demonstrate she would no longer become overwhelmed with the stresses of her life. This Mother did not do. Although she was addressing her underlying chemical dependency issues, she was not in compliance with her treatment plan because she denied the Department access to her mental health care providers. Just as in <em>A.L.R., </em>Mother missed meetings and was likely to return to the lifestyle which gave rise to the proceedings. Most importantly, Mother did not demonstrate sufficient mental stability to be able to parent her high needs children.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>\u00b629  The record clearly indicates that although Mother attempted to comply with the treatment plan, she was not successful in doing so; it is also clear the conduct and conditions which made Mother unfit were unlikely to change within a reasonable time.
