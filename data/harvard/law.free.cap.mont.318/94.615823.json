We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-13\">\u00b62 Kimberly raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b117-14\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in failing to award her spouse\u2019s bonus and profit-sharing award to Kimberly when he disclosed them only two business days before trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b117-15\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in failing to award her spouse\u2019s interest in an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) to Kimberly?</p>\n<p id=\"b117-16\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court improperly determine the amount and distribution ofKimb.erly\u2019s pretrial expenditures of home sale proceeds?</p>\n<p id=\"A0S\">\u00b66 4. Is the District Court\u2019s distribution of the marital estate inequitable?</p>\n<p id=\"b118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">\u00b67 Kimberly and Kevin Gerhart married in 1981. Kimberly worked as a retail employee and a bank teller until the parties decided to have a family. Subsequently, she worked primarily as a homemaker. The couple had two children, born in 1994 and 1996. Kevin worked in the dairy industry throughout the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\u00b68 The parties separated in April of 1999, and Kimberly petitioned for dissolution in August of 2000. After the separation, Kevin voluntarily paid Kimberly\u2019s living expenses and child support until the couple sold the marital home in October of 2000. As agreed by the parties, the net proceeds of $118,958.73 were placed into a money market account in Kimberly\u2019s name. At that time, Kevin stopped paying for Kimberly\u2019s personal living expenses, but he continued to make monthly child support payments of $1,500. Kimberly spent some of the sale proceeds in the ensuing months. In September of 2001, when the account balance had fallen to approximately $83,000, the District Court issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Temporary Order, which it amended in October of 2001. In the Temporary Order, the District Court prohibited further withdrawals from the home sale proceeds account absent a court order. In addition, the District Court ordered Kevin to pay $1,326 in child support and $l,675in temporary maintenance each month.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">\u00b69 During the interim, Kevin had begun working for a new employer in a management position in December of 1999. Shortly thereafter, Kevin\u2019s employer instituted an ESOP program, in which Kevin could participate after completing one year of employment. Under the ESOP\u2019s vesting schedule, Kevin had no vested interest in the ESOP at the time of trial on Kimberly\u2019s dissolution proceeding. Kevin testified at trial that he had no vested interest in the ESOP shares, and Kimberly could have the asset \u201cif it has no value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">\u00b610 In 2001, Kevin received a bonus and profit-sharing award totaling $45,532.70. He deposited the checks into an investment bank account which, at the time of trial in March of 2002, had declined in value to $28,798.23. Kevin testified that he planned to use the funds to pay increased taxes resulting from the bonus and award moving him into a higher tax bracket.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">\u00b611 Kevin failed to disclose the account in his Final Declaration of Disclosure. After Kimberly\u2019s counsel requested Kevin\u2019s W-2 forms for the .year 2001, Kevin amended his disclosure to include the account, and the amended disclosure was received two days before trial. Kevin testified he had inadvertently omitted the bonus and profit-sharing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>award, having placed his W-2 tax form in an envelope marked for his 2001 taxes without looking at it and simply forgetting about the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">\u00b612 After trial, the District Court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Decree of Dissolution. It valued the marital estate at $444,637, and apportioned $218,694 to Kimberly and $225,943 to Kevin. The court also ordered Kevin to pay child support of $1,736, as well as $2,000 in maintenance, per month. The trial court observed that Kevin had \u201cno vested interested [sic] in the ESOP plan\u201d and acknowledged the account containing the bonus and profit-sharing award, but included neither as a marital asset to be divided.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">\u00b613 The trial court found that Kimberly had spent $43,958 of the marital home proceeds before Kevin stopped paying her living expenses. It divided the $83,635 home proceeds account balance equally between the parties, and added the $43,958 Kimberly previously had spent to her distribution, resulting in a $127,593 valuation of the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\u00b614 Both parties timely filed motions for amendment and/or clarification of the District Court\u2019s findings, conclusions, and decree. In its Order RE: Motions to Amend Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Decree of Dissolution and Motion for Clarification of Court Orders, the court denied Kimberly\u2019s motion for amendment of the property distribution. Kimberly appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">\u00b615 We initially review a district court\u2019s division of marital property to determine whether the findings of fact upon which the division is based are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Marriage of Pospisil, </em>2000 MT 132, \u00b6 19, 299 Mont. 527, \u00b6 19, 1 P.3d 364, \u00b6 19 (citation omitted). \u201cA finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that the district court made a mistake.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of </em>Steinbeisser, 2002 MT 309, \u00b6 17, 313 Mont. 74, \u00b6 17, 60 P.3d 441, \u00b6 17 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">\u00b616 Pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA, a district court has broad discretion to distribute a marital estate equitably according to the circumstances of the case. <em>In re Marriage of Bee, </em>2002 MT 49, \u00b6 34, 309 Mont. 34, \u00b6 34, 43 P.3d 903, \u00b6 34 (citation omitted). Absent clearly erroneous findings, we will affirm a trial court\u2019s property distribution unless the court abused its discretion. <em>Marriage of Pospisil, </em>\u00b6 19 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">\u00b617 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in failing to award Kevin\u2019s bonus and profit-sharing award to Kimberly when he disclosed them only two business days before trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\u00b618 Kimberly argues that the presumption contained in \u00a7 40-4-253(4), MCA, required the District Court to penalize Kevin by awarding his late-disclosed assets to her. Her argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">\u00b619  Section 40-4-253(4), MCA, provides, in pertinent part, that a party\u2019s failure to disclose an asset on his or her final disclosure declaration is presumed to be grounds for the court to award the undisclosed asset to the other party separate from the equitable division of the marital estate. Thus, it is undisputed that the statute clearly authorizes a court to award undisclosed assets to the opposing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\u00b620  The statute only creates a presumption, however. Section 26-1-601, MCA, sets forth a list of conclusive presumptions, including \u201cany other presumption, which, by statute, is expressly made conclusive,\u201d while \u00a7 26-1-602, MCA, provides that all other presumptions are disputable and may be controverted by other evidence. Section 40-4-253(4), MCA, on which Kimberly relies, does not state that the presumption therein is conclusive. Consequently, the presumption at issue is disputable.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">\u00b621  Kevin testified about why he was late in disclosing the account. Kimberly argues that Kevin\u2019s explanation of the late disclosure is insufficient to overcome the presumption in \u00a7 40-4-253(4), MCA. As the finder of fact, however, it was within the District Court\u2019s province to determine Kevin\u2019s credibility. <em>In re Marriage of Nies &amp; Cooper, </em>2003 MT 100, \u00b6 18, 315 Mont. 260, \u00b6 18, 68 P.3d 697, \u00b6 18 (citation omitted); <em>Albrecht v. Albrecht, </em>2002 MT 227, \u00b6 47, 311 Mont. 412, \u00b6 47, 56 P.3d 339, \u00b6 47 (citations omitted). The trial court apparently accepted Kevin\u2019s explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">\u00b622 We conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion by failing to award the profit-sharing and bonus account to Kimberly.</p>\n<p id=\"Agu\">\u00b623 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in failing to award Kevin\u2019s interest in the ESOP to Kimberly?</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">\u00b624 Kimberly asserts that the District Court abused its discretion by failing to award Kevin\u2019s interest in the ESOP to her because Kevin agreed to allow her to have it. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Kimberly properly characterizes Kevin\u2019s testimony, Kimberly has failed to cite any authority to support her position. Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., requires an appellant to cite to authorities in support of the arguments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>raised. Moreover, we have repeatedly held that absent such authorities, we will not consider the issue. <em>See, e.g., In re Marriage of Clark, </em>2003 MT 168, \u00b6 25, 316 Mont. 327, \u00b6 25, 71 P.3d 1228, \u00b6 25 (citation omitted). Consequently, we decline to address this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"AX0\">\u00b625 3. Did the District Court improperly determine the amount and distribution of Kimberly\u2019s pretrial expenditures of home sale proceeds?</p>\n<p id=\"Ae\">\u00b626 Kimberly sets forth two arguments regarding the trial court\u2019s determinations relating to the home sale proceeds she spent before the court awarded her temporary maintenance in September of 2001. First, Kimberly argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it awarded her \u201cfunds that did not exist\u201d because she had spent them on reasonable living expenses. Second, Kimberly contends that the trial court erred in determining the pretrial expenditures were $43,958. We address her arguments in reverse order.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">\u00b627 Kimberly claims the trial court erred in its calculation of the amount of home sale proceeds she spent. She states she spent $35,325.</p>\n<p id=\"ACP\">\u00b628 At trial, Kevin testified that Kimberly had spent $34,958. Kimberly testified she had spent approximately $35,000. No other evidence was presented. The trial court found Kimberly had spent $43,958, which we observe is the same as Kevin\u2019s figure except that the first two digits are inverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">\u00b629 The first prong of our standard of review of a trial court\u2019s finding is whether it is clearly supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Marriage of Steinbeisser, </em>\u00b6 17. Nothing in the record supports a finding that Kimberly spent $43,958 of the home sale proceeds. Consequently, the finding is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">\u00b630 Kevin asserts, however, that Kimberly did not raise this matter in the District Court. Therefore, according to Kevin, it is not properly before us. He relies on <em>Siefke v. Siefke, </em>2000 MT 281, 302 Mont. 167, 13 P.3d 937.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">\u00b631 This Court generally will not address an issue raised for the first time on appeal because \u201c[a] district court cannot be placed in error for something which it never had the opportunity to decide.\u201d <em>Siefke, </em>\u00b6 25. The procedural facts in <em>Siefke </em>render it otherwise readily distinguishable from the present case, however. There, the wife failed to object during a hearing to the husband\u2019s evidence regarding the calculation of his child support, and the trial court made clear that it intended to consider the evidence presented. On appeal, the wife attempted to challenge the evidence and its sufficiency. <em>Siefke, </em>\u00b6 24. We refused to consider the issue raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Siefke, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>\u00b632 Here, the miscalculation Kimberly raises could not have been objected to in the District Court because both she and Kevin presented evidence that her expenditures were around $35,000. Kimberly simply could not have known that the court would miscalculate or misstate the amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">\u00b633 Kimberly also argues that the District Court should not have included any pretrial expenditures as part of her share of the marital estate because she used the home sale proceeds for her reasonable living expenses. She cites to no authority for this argument, however. As stated above, Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., requires an appellant to cite to authorities in support of the arguments raised, and we will not consider an issue briefed without such citations. <em>See Marriage of Clark,</em></p>\n<p id=\"AH7\">\u00b6 25. Consequently, we decline to address this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\u00b634  We conclude the District Court clearly erred when it found that Kimberly\u2019s pretrial expenditures of the home sale proceeds were $43,958. For the reasons discussed below, however, we hold this does not constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\u00b635 4. Is the District Court\u2019s distribution of the marital estate inequitable?</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">\u00b636 Kimberly next argues that if this Court decides the previous issue in her favor, her percentage of the marital estate will be reduced. Therefore, she contends she is entitled to reconsideration of the overall division of property. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">\u00b637 As discussed above, the District Court erroneously overstated Kimberly\u2019s pretrial expenditures as $43,958. That error also affected the District Court\u2019s valuation of the home sale account and, ultimately, Kimberly\u2019s share of the marital assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">\u00b638 As valued and distributed by the District Court, Kimberly received 49.185% of the total marital estate and Kevin received 50.815%. Had the District Court attributed $34,958 in pretrial expenditures to Kimberly and made a corresponding reduction in the value of the home sale account and the marital estate, Kimberly would have received $209,694, or 48.135% of the marital estate, a decrease of 1.050%.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">\u00b639  Section 40-4-202 requires the district court to make an equitable distribution, but it does not necessarily require equal distribution. <em>In re Marriage of Smith, </em>2003 MT 63, \u00b6 13, 314 Mont. 421, \u00b6 13, 67 P.3d 199, \u00b6 13 (citations omitted). We recently held that a 1/6 of 1% shortage to one party was insufficient to result in a conclusion that the property distribution was \u201cunequal,\u201d even in light of the parties\u2019 agreement to an \u201cequal distribution.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number><em>Hochhalter, </em>2001 MT 268, \u00b6\u00b6 37-38, 307 Mont. 261, \u00b6\u00b6 37-38, 37 P.3d 665, \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">\u00b640  In the present case, and notwithstanding the court\u2019s erroneous finding, we must conclude that the property distribution remains, in the District Court\u2019s words, \u201cfair and equitable.\u201d From the latter phraseology, it is clear that the District Court intended an equitable-not necessarily equal-distribution. The court\u2019s intent is even more clear, however, regarding distribution of the home sale proceeds account. The District Court stated in that regard that \u201cthe balance of funds from the proceeds of the sale of the home will be equally divided between the parties.\u201d The court accomplished this equal division of the balance by awarding $41,817 to Kimberly and $41,818 to Kevin. The District Court then stated that \u201c[t]he monies that were paid to Kimberly from those proceeds [that is, her expenditures] are included in the distribution to her.\u201d Thus, whether Kimberly\u2019s expenditures were $34,958 or $43,958, the court intended to increase the value of the account-and the marital assets-in that amount and distribute it to Kimberly as part of her fair and equitable allocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\u00b641 On this record, we hold that the property distribution is equitable.</p>\n<p id=\"A9u\">\u00b642 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b123-6\">JUSTICES REGNIER, WARNER and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b123-7\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"ACi\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">\u00b643 I dissent from the Court\u2019s resolution of Issues 3 and 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">\u00b644 The Court declines to address the merits of Kimberly\u2019s contention that the District Court erred by including her pretrial expenditures from home sale proceeds within her share of the marital estate on the ground that she \u201ccites to no authority for this argument.\u201d \u00b6 33. However, specific authority is not necessarily existent for every issue which may arise during the course of a district corut\u2019s distribution of marital property, which the law requires to be equitable. Here, Kimberly argues that the District Court abused its discretion in making the property distribution and cites <em>Marriage of Steinbeisser, </em>2002 MT 309, 313 Mont. 74, 60 P.3d 441, in support of her argument. I conclude therefrom that Kimberly has offered sufficient authority and would reach the merits of the issue. Further, I conclude that the District Court indeed abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">\u00b645 Following their separation, Kevin paid $1,500 per month for Kimberly\u2019s living expenses until sale of the parties\u2019 home in October 2000, when Kevin stopped paying maintenance and paid only child support (Finding No. 18). About a year later, the court, based upon Kevin\u2019s annual income of $132,000 and Kimberly\u2019s imputed annual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>income of $10,980, required that Kevin pay temporary maintenance in the amount of $1,675 per month. However, for that intervening year, Kimberly had no choice but to withdraw funds from the sale proceeds to support herself. Further, the District Court, in its final order, noted that its earlier orders had failed \u201cto allow for any daycare expenses for the children\u201d during this time, causing an additional expense to Kimberly of $300 per month (Finding No. 11).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">\u00b646 Kevin argues that Kimberly\u2019s withdrawals were used for other purposes, citing Kimberly\u2019s testimony that \u201csome\u201d of these expenditures were for living expenses. However, Kevin mischaracterizes Kimberly\u2019s testimony. In response to a question about distribution of the proceeds, Kimberly testified that she had used \u201csome\u201d-in other words, less than the <em>total sale </em>proceeds-for living expenses. She did not testify that she had used only \u201csome\u201d of the <em>withdrawals </em>for living expenses. Under additional questioning, this point was clarified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">[Counsel]: You testified that you used some of those funds for your own living expenses; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">[Kimberly]: I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">[Counsel]: Is that how the balance went from [$118,000] to the current balance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-8\">[Kimberly]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">Thus, the accurate conclusion to be drawn from Kimberly\u2019s testimony is that <em>all </em>of the withdrawals were for living expenses, including the daycare expenses which the court admittedly failed to consider, during the year that she was not receiving maintenance from Kevin.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">\u00b647 Although the District Court noted that Kimberly made the withdrawals from the account, and then included those withdrawals within her share of the property distribution, it failed to acknowledge that the withdrawals were expended for living expenses necessitated by Kevin\u2019s failure to pay maintenance and the court\u2019s earlier failure to consider and provide for the children\u2019s daycare expenses (Finding No. 25). This failure was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">\u00b648 This result of this error was to \u201caward\u201d $35,300 to Kimberly which she had previously expended for her and her children\u2019s living expenses. This error, combined with the nearly $9,000 error which the Court recognizes in \u00b6 34, is equivalent to 10 percent of the total marital estate, a significant impact. Therefore, I would reverse on issues 3 and 4 and remand for reconsideration of the estate distribution after correction of these errors.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
