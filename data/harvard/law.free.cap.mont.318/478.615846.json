The Twentieth Judicial District Court, Lake County, entered judgment and Minez appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-13\">\u00b62 We address the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b501-14\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Minez\u2019s motion for substitution of counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b501-16\">\u00b64 2. Do Minez\u2019s convictions of producing methamphetamine and possession of glassware and chemicals used to produce methamphetamine violate his rights against double jeopardy?</p>\n<p id=\"b501-17\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court illegally sentence Minez as a persistent felony offender?</p>\n<p id=\"b501-18\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b501-19\">\u00b66 On the morning of November 2, 2000, officers from the Flathead County Sheriffs Office and the Northwest Drug Task Force searched a home and vehicles belonging to Minez\u2019s ex-wife, Cora, in Poison, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Montana. During the search of the home, the officers noticed a strong chemical smell they identified with the production of methamphetamine. They found numerous items-in various rooms of the home and in two cars parked outside-which they identified as related to the production of methamphetamine and which later tested positive for the presence of methamphetamine and chemicals constituting immediate precursors to methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">\u00b67 The officers located Minez in a downstairs bedroom of the home. They arrested him, and the State of Montana charged him with use or possession of property subject to criminal forfeiture and criminal production of dangerous drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\u00b68 Minez\u2019s first trial ended in a mistrial when a juror became sick and there were no alternate jurors. Just before his subsequent jury trial in January of 2002, Minez moved for substitution of counsel, but the court denied his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">\u00b69 At the trial, the State presented testimony by Flathead County and Northwest Drug Task Force officers and a chemist from the Montana State Crime Laboratory concerning the items and chemicals found at the house and in the vehicles. Three informants also testified for the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">\u00b610 A neighbor of Cora\u2019s testified she had observed Minez apparently living at Cora\u2019s house beginning in the summer of 2000. According to the neighbor, Cora, Cora\u2019s boyfriend and a teenage daughter also lived there. She testified there was a lot more traffic to and from the house after Minez moved in, and everyone except Minez appeared to be gone during the day. The neighbor had seen Minez using two vehicles parked outside the house on many occasions, and observed that he often backed one car up to the house to load and unload items from the trunk. She testified she had seen a funnel attached to surgical tubing in the open trunk of one of the cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">\u00b611 The neighbor\u2019s husband, a volunteer firefighter who had been trained as a first responder for methamphetamine labs, also testified. He stated that, on a number of occasions, he had observed Minez taking items wrapped in white plastic out of the trunk and into the house, and taking a gym bag back and forth from the car. He testified that when his wife told him she had seen the funnel and tubing, he became concerned because he knew these items could be connected with a methamphetamine lab.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">\u00b612 An acquaintance of Minez who was incarcerated at the Dawson County Correctional Facility at the time of trial also testified. The acquaintance admitted having told a detective Minez was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>manufacturing methamphetamine at Cora\u2019s house. He denied having told the officer Minez had offered him methamphetamine and that he had seen the methamphetamine lab and iodine crystals and glass tubing in the house. He also denied having prepared a rough diagram, which was introduced into evidence, of the layout of the interior of the house for the officer. The acquaintance acknowledged that the prison grapevine is far-reaching and prisoners identified as \u201csnitches\u201d are treated badly by other prisoners.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">\u00b613 The jury found Minez guilty of both charges, and the District Court sentenced him and entered judgment. Minez appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\u00b614 Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying the motion for substitution of counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">\u00b615  Atrial court\u2019s ruling on a request for substitution of appointed counsel is within that court\u2019s discretion and, absent an abuse of discretion, we will not disturb it. <em>State v. Gallagher, </em>2001 MT 39, \u00b6 4, 304 Mont. 215, \u00b6 4, 19 P.3d 817, \u00b6 4 <em>(Gallagher II). </em>In reviewing such a ruling, we first determine whether the court made an adequate initial inquiry into the complaints; if so, we then review the court\u2019s decision on whether the complaints are seemingly substantial. If the court concludes sifter an adequate initial inquiry that the defendant has failed to present seemingly substantial complaints, then it need not conduct an additional hearing. <em>State v. Gallagher, </em>1998 MT 70, \u00b6 15, 288 Mont. 180, \u00b6 15, 955 P.2d 1371, \u00b6 15 <em>(Gallagher I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">\u00b616 In his pretrial motion asking the District Court to appoint new counsel to represent him, Minez stated his court-appointed attorney, Ben Anciaux, had \u201cnot provided effective assistance\u201d and had \u201cdone things that were not with the permission or at the request of Defendant that have prejudiced Defendant.\u201d The court held a pretrial hearing on various motions, including this one, and asked Minez to explain his reasons for filing this motion. Minez elaborated that he felt Anciaux had prejudiced him by waiving his speedy trial right and by requesting a mental evaluation without his knowledge or permission. He also stated Anciaux had not followed through on interviewing witnesses or providing him with copies of documents. Minez did not, however, identify the alleged witnesses or outline the witnesses\u2019 potential testimony. In response to the court\u2019s inquiry if there was anything else, Minez answered \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">\u00b617 Ruling from the bench, the District Court noted it had observed Anciaux during the trial which ended in a mistrial and had seen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>\u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d to indicate ineffective assistance or a failure to prepare for trial. It voiced concern that Minez also had filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him on speedy trial grounds, and predicted the first thing a replacement defense counsel would do would be to ask for more time to prepare for trial. The court stated it had every indication Anciaux was acting in Minez\u2019s best interest, and found no \u201cseemingly substantial complaints made by the defendant.\u201d Observing that there appeared to be a communication problem between Minez and Anciaux, the District Court expressed hope it could be overcome. Finally, it was clear to the court that Minez\u2019s \u201cpresent attorney is not only competent but he\u2019s prepared to try this case.\u201d The court denied the motion for appointment of new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\u00b618 Minez argues on appeal that the District Court inadequately considered his argument that Anciaux had a conflict of interest in representing him. The basis for the alleged conflict is that, in another criminal proceeding in which Anciaux represented Minez, Minez had asserted that Anciaux rendered ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\u00b619 An appellant may not change legal theories on appeal or raise issues which were not raised in the trial court. <em>State v. Ely, </em>2003 MT 140, \u00b6 9, 316 Mont. 169, \u00b6 9, 69 P.3d 1189, \u00b6 9 (citations omitted). Minez did not raise the conflict of interest argument in the District Court. Therefore, we do not consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">\u00b620 Minez also contends the District Court did not adequately inquire into his allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. According to Minez, the court should have asked Anciaux about his attempts, or lack thereof, to contact the witnesses Minez wished him to contact. Relying on <em>State v. Finley </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 126, 143, 915 P.2d 208, 219, <em>overruled on other grounds by Gallagher II, </em>\u00b6 21, Minez asserts the court\u2019s failure to require Anciaux to respond to his allegations signified the court\u2019s failure to conduct a critical analysis of Minez\u2019s complaints. <em>Finley </em>is readily distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">\u00b621 In <em>Finley, </em>the defendant made written complaints about his counsel in a <em>pro se </em>motion for change of venue. The district court denied the motion without holding a hearing. <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 130, 915 P.2d at 211. On appeal, we concluded the trial court erred in failing to \u201cinquireG into the complaints\u201d and \u201cma[k]e some sort of a critical analysis\u201d in response to the motion. We also determined the court had corrected its error by conducting a post-trial hearing on the defendant\u2019s complaints about his representation and, consequently, the court\u2019s original error was harmless. <em>See Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 143, 915 P.2d at 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>\u00b622 Unlike in <em>Finley, </em>the District Court in the present case held a hearing on Minez\u2019s motion for appointment of new counsel at which it afforded Minez the opportunity to present a full explanation of the claims supporting his motion. Because Minez did not identify any of the witnesses he felt Anciaux should have contacted, the court had nothing about which to question Anciaux in that regard. Moreover, as indicated above, the court voiced its concern about the impact of a substitution of counsel on Minez\u2019s right to speedy trial and stated it had seen \u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d to indicate Anciaux had failed to prepare for trial or was rendering ineffective assistance of counsel. In any event, this was an initial hearing to determine whether Minez presented seemingly substantial complaints. We conclude the District Court made an adequate initial inquiry into the complaints to satisfy that first requirement from <em>Gallagher I </em>and also met <em>Finley\u2019s </em>\u201ccritical analysis\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\u00b623 Minez also relies on <em>United States v. Nguyen </em>(9th Cir. 2001), 262 F.3d 998, 1004, for the proposition that, in order to make a sufficient inquiry into a criminal defendant\u2019s request for substitution of appointed counsel, a trial court should question the attorney or defendant \u201cprivately and in depth\u201d and examine available witnesses. <em>InNguyen, </em>the defendant repeatedly asked to speak with the presiding judge regarding a communication breakdown with his appointed counsel and stated he had witnesses to support his claims. The court decided the matter at a pretrial meeting which the defendant did not personally attend or even know about, and then refused to grant the defendant a full hearing on the issue. <em>Nguyen, </em>262 F.3d at 1003. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals determined that, given the trial court\u2019s failures to conduct a sufficient inquiry into the defendant\u2019s request or to consider the length of delay necessary to substitute a new attorney, the degree of inconvenience the delay would cause, why the motion to substitute was not made earlier, or the severity of the conflict, the court had violated the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel. <em>Nguyen, </em>262 F.3d at 1005.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u00b624 The Ninth Circuit Court\u2019s <em>Nguyen </em>test does not precisely mirror Montana law on the subject of an adequate initial inquiry. The District Court in the present case did, however, invite and hear Minez\u2019s elaboration on his claims at a pretrial hearing. In further contrast with <em>Nguyen, </em>Minez did not offer any witnesses to support his claims; indeed, his briefs on appeal mention only himself and his attorney as potential witnesses. The court analyzed, at least briefly, the degree of conflict present between Minez and Anciaux and the effect on Minez\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>speedy trial right of a potential delay for substitution of counsel. We conclude that further \u201cprivateQ and in depth\u201d questioning of Minez was not required in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">\u00b625 Proceeding to the second <em>Gallagher I </em>requirement, Minez argues his allegations that Anciaux failed to contact witnesses, and waived Minez\u2019s right to speedy trial and moved for a mental disease or defect examination without his knowledge or approval, represent a seemingly substantial complaint. We disagree. According to Minez, the conflict between himself and Anciaux is exemplified by Anciaux\u2019s actions, without consulting him, of requesting a mental examination and waiving the right to speedy trial. Minez does not claim a breakdown in communication with Anciaux so severe that Minez refused to speak to Anciaux, as is generally required for appointment of new counsel due to lack of communication. <em>See Gallagher II, </em>\u00b6 13. Further, Minez failed to meet his burden of presenting material facts to support any of his claims; instead offering only bare, unsupported allegations. He did not identify any way in which he felt he had been prejudiced by Anciaux\u2019s request for a mental evaluation or waiver of his right to speedy trial. Bare, unsupported allegations are insufficient to justify the appointment of new counsel. <em>State v. Kaske, </em>2002 MT 106, \u00b6 30, 309 Mont. 445, \u00b6 30, 47 P.3d 824, \u00b6 30 (citations omitted). We conclude Minez\u2019s complaints were not seemingly substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\u00b626  On this record, we conclude the District Court made an adequate initial inquiry into Minez\u2019s claims. We also conclude the court properly exercised its discretion in determining Minez failed to present seemingly substantial complaints and in declining to hold an additional hearing on Minez\u2019s motion for substitution of counsel. We hold, therefore, that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Minez\u2019s motion for substitution of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">\u00b627 Do Minez\u2019s convictions of producing methamphetamine and possession of glassware and chemicals used to produce methamphetamine violate his rights against double jeopardy?</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">\u00b628 Minez argues that, in this case, the offense of possession of property subject to criminal forfeiture-here, glassware and chemicals used to produce methamphetamine-is only a form of preparation to commit the offense of producing methamphetamine. As a result, he argues his conviction of both offenses violates his rights under \u00a7 46-11-410(2)(b), MCA, and his constitutional right-under both the United States and Montana Constitutions-to be free from double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>\u00b629 Section 46-ll-410(2)(b), MCA, provides that a defendant may not be convicted of more than one offense if one offense consists only of a conspiracy or other form of preparation to commit the other. The State contends as a threshold matter that, because Minez failed to assert at the settlement of jury instructions that a conviction of use or possession of property subject to criminal forfeiture was prohibited under \u00a7 46-ll-410(2)(b), MCA, he has failed to preserve the issue for appeal. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">\u00b630 Minez filed a pretrial motion in which he claimed \u201cUse or Possession of Property Subject to Criminal Forfeiture is the conspiracy or other preparation to commit and a lesser-included offense of Criminal Production or Manufacture of Dangerous Drugs.\u201d After the State filed a response, Minez filed a reply in which he conceded further briefing, argument and ruling on this issue were premature until after evidence was presented at trial. Then, during the settlement of jury instructions, Minez proposed an instruction that use or possession of property subject to criminal forfeiture is a lesser included offense to criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs. On this record, we conclude Minez raised and preserved this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">\u00b631 In <em>State v. Wolfe </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 400, 821 P.2d 339, the defendant argued his convictions for possession of explosives and criminal mischief violated \u00a7 46-11-502(2), MCA (1989). We concluded the statutory prohibition against convictions of two offenses, one of which consists only of a conspiracy or other form of preparation to commit the other, was not violated because the prohibition is limited to situations in which one crime charged is an inchoate crime. <em>Wolfe, </em>250 Mont. at 410, 821 P.2d at 345. Solicitation, conspiracy and attempt are the only offenses enumerated as inchoate offenses in Title 45, Chapter 4, MCA. We note that, while \u00a7 46-11-502(2), MCA (1989) was recodified as \u00a7 46-11-410(2), MCA, in 1991, the statute remains the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">\u00b632  As in <em>Wolfe, </em>neither of the two crimes of which Minez was convicted is a statutorily enumerated inchoate offense. Therefore, we conclude that, pursuant to <em>Wolfe, </em>Minez\u2019s convictions of both counts did not violate \u00a7 46-ll-410(2)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">\u00b633 The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution prohibit being put in jeopardy twice for the same offense. Where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one is whether each provision requires proof of an additional fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>which the other does not. <em>State v. Beavers, </em>1999 MT 260, \u00b6 26, 296 Mont. 340, \u00b6 26, 987 P.2d 371, \u00b6 26 (quoting <em>Blockburger v. United States </em>(1932), 284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed.2d 306, 309). Although we determined in <em>Beavers, </em>\u00b6 27, that the <em>Blockburger </em>testis not applicable to analyses of included offenses under \u00a7 46-1-202, MCA, we have not discarded it as the standard for determining whether double jeopardy precludes charging two crimes where neither is a lesser included offense of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\u00b634 The elements of the offense of criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs are (1) to purposely or knowingly (2) produce, manufacture, prepare, cultivate, compound or process (3) a dangerous drug as defined in \u00a7 50-32-101, MCA. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-9-110(1), MCA. The elements of the offense of use or possession of property subject to criminal forfeiture are (1) to knowingly (2) possess, own, use or attempt to use (3) property that is subject to criminal forfeiture. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-9-206(1), MCA. \u201cProperty subject to criminal forfeiture\u201d is \u201cmoney, raw materials, products, equipment, and other property of any kind that is used or intended for use in manufacturing, preparing, cultivating, compounding, processing, delivering, importing or exporting a dangerous drug.\u201d Section 45-9-206(2)(a), MCA. Thus, the statutory offense of criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs requires proof of production, manufacture, preparation, cultivation, compounding or processing of a dangerous drug. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-9-110(1), MCA. The statutory offense of use or possession of property subject to criminal forfeiture does not. Conversely, the statutory offense of use or possession of property subject to criminal forfeiture requires proof of possession, ownership, use or an attempt to use property subject to criminal forfeiture. Section 45-9-206(1), MCA, The statutory offense of criminal manufacture of dangerous drugs does not.</p>\n<p id=\"AFZ\">\u00b635  We conclude the offenses defined in \u00a7\u00a7 45-9-110(1) and 45-9-206(1), MCA, each require proof of an additional fact not required by the other. We hold, therefore, that Minez has not established a constitutional double jeopardy violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">\u00b636 Did the District Court illegally sentence Minez as a persistent felony offender?</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">\u00b637 Minez contends the State failed to give him notice of intent to request that he be designated a persistent felony offender until it recommended the designation at his sentencing in January of2002. He points out that \u00a7 46-13-108, MCA (1999), requires the State to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>notice of intent to seek persistent felony offender status at or before the omnibus hearing, except for good cause shown. The statute further provides that, if the defendant objects to the allegations in the notice, the court shall conduct a hearing to determine if the allegations in the notice are true. Section 46-13-108(3), MCA (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">\u00b638 The premise underlying Minez\u2019s claim in this regard is contradicted by the record. Contrary to Minez\u2019s representation, the District Court record contains a persistent felony offender notice filed by the State on October 30, 2001, with a certificate of service on Minez\u2019s counsel. That notice declared the State\u2019s intent to seek to have Minez designated a persistent felony offender based on an October 26, 2001 felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">\u00b639  Minez did not object to the October 30, 2001 persistent felony offender notice in the District Court on any basis. Because he did not object, no hearing or findings were required under \u00a7 46-13-108(3), MCA (1999). \u201cThe purpose for providing such notice is to give the defendant an opportunity to file an objection to the criminal record relied upon in the notice and to hold a hearing should there be any such objections.\u201d <em>State v. Niederklopfer, </em>2000 MT 187, \u00b6 10, 300 Mont. 397, \u00b6 10, 6 P.3d 448, \u00b6 10 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">\u00b640  We hold that Minez has not established he was illegally sentenced as a persistent felony offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">\u00b641 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b509-8\">JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b509-9\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"AdhS\">concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">\u00b642 I concur with the Court\u2019s disposition of issues 1 and 3, but dissent from the Court\u2019s disposition of issue 2. I would reverse Minez\u2019s conviction of the offense of use or possession of property subject to criminal forfeiture and instruct the district court to vacate his sentence on that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">\u00b643 First, I disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion at \u00b633 that neither of the crimes of which Minez was convicted is a statutorily enumerated inchoate offense. The enumerated inchoate offenses are solicitation, conspiracy and attempt. Sections 45-4-101 through 103, M.C.A. According to \u00a7 45-4-103(1), M.C.A., \u201c[a] person commits the offense of attempt when, with the purpose to commit a specific offense, he does any act toward the commission of such offense.\u201d The offense of use or possession of property subject to criminal forfeiture requires proof that one \"... knowingly possesses, owns uses or attempts to use ...\u201d the materials necessary to produce a dangerous drug. I cannot understand how the Court can conclude that possessing, using or attempting to use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>materials necessary to produce a dangerous drug does not constitute an \u201cact toward the commission\u201d of the production of dangerous drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqb\">\u00b644 In <em>State v. Wolfe, </em>upon which the Court relies at \u00b6\u00b6 32-33, we concluded that neither of the offenses charged was an inchoate crime. In doing so, we found it significant that neither statute referenced the other. <em>Wolfe, </em>250 Mont. at 410. Here, by contrast, \u00a7 45-9-206, M.C.A. (the criminal forfeiture statute) alludes <em>directly </em>to \u00a7 45-9-110, M.C.A. (the criminal possession of dangerous drugs statute). Specifically, \u00a7 45-9-206(2)(a), M.C.A. provides that the property that is subject to criminal forfeiture is \"... the raw materials, products, equipment ... that is used or intended for use in manufacturing [or] preparing ... a dangerous drug in violation of ... (among others) 45-9-110 ....\u201d This internal reference in the forfeiture statute to using the forfeitable materials to <em>commit the other crime charged </em>makes it clear that the forfeiture crime of which Minez was convicted <em>is </em>an inchoate offense. Our discussion in <em>Wolfe </em>only buttresses this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">\u00b645 Second, even if we address Minez\u2019s argument solely on the basis of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution, which prohibit being put in jeopardy twice for the same offense, the result is the same. As the Court points out at \u00b6 31, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one is \"... whether each provision requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not.\u201d I submit that the offense of use or possession of property subject to criminal forfeiture requires proof of the same facts underlying a conviction for criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs-i.e., knowing possession, use, or attempt to use, property or materials that are subject to criminal forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">\u00b646 Because Minez has established both a statutory and a constitutional double jeopardy violation, I would reverse his conviction for use of possession of property subject to criminal forfeiture and direct the district court to vacate his sentence on that charge. I dissent from our refusal to do so.</p>\n<judges id=\"b510-6\">JUSTICES WARNER and LEAPHART join in the concurrence and dissent of JUSTICE COTTER.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
