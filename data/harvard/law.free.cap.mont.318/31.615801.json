Scott survived the shooting, but lost use of his right eye and was permanently disfigured and severely brain damaged. Scott died two years later at a nursing home.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">\u00b64 During his trial, Henderson relied on the defense of justifiable use of force. He argued that during an altercation with Scott, the handgun accidentally fired. However, the jury concluded otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">\u00b65 Since Henderson\u2019s defense was justifiable use of force, his attorney, David Stufft (Stufft), argued during his opening statement that the jury would hear evidence that Scott was attacking Henderson. As a result of this altercation, Stufft argued that the handgun accidentally fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-12\">\u00b66 Specifically, Stufft argued the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-13\">Ron tells us, and you\u2019re gonna hear from Ron-you\u2019re gonna hear from Ron on a video that the sheriffs department took-you\u2019re gonna hear from Ron telling people \u201cLook at my neck, I was choked. Can you see where I\u2019ve been choked?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-14\">Ron had everything going for him, up until his brother came in that night to the shop. Ron had everything going for him. That-we\u2019ll hear from Ron and everybody else that Ron didn\u2019t throw a one-fisted punch at the father or at the brother. Ron\u2019s not backing up, Ron is being pushed backwards. Ron is being hit until he finally falls into not this saw but another saw. And when he comes up and he gets up on the back of him they\u2019re still at it. Scott is choking him. Ron pulls that gun not to fire the shot, but-in whatever happened, if arms hit arms or who knows what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>happened-the gun fires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">\u00b67 Stufft concluded his opening statement with the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">Now, here\u2019s a guy who\u2019s been beaten and beaten and smacked around and, in all reality, has a concussion and can\u2019t remember what happened. And he sits in jail with an ice pack, or they give aspirin or some other basic drugs, and waits for five days until they can check out his headache, his swollen jaw, his sore ribs. That\u2019s what the evidence is gonna show, people.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\u00b68 Despite this argument, the jury never heard Ron testify, as Stufft did not call him as a witness. The jury convicted Henderson of attempted deliberate homicide and use of a firearm during the commission of that crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\u00b69 Henderson now appeals his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">\u00b610 Ineffective assistance of counsel claims are mixed questions of fact and law. <em>State v. Herrman, </em>2003 MT 149, \u00b6 18, 316 Mont. 198, \u00b6 18, 70 P.3d 738, \u00b6 18. Thus, we review an ineffective assistance of counsel claim <em>de novo. Herrman, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">\u00b611 Did Henderson\u2019s attorney provide ineffective assistance of counsel when he asserted in his opening statement that the jury would hear from Henderson but ultimately did not call Henderson as a witness?</p>\n<p id=\"b55-12\">\u00b612 Henderson maintains that because he was not called as a witness, as Stufft promised the jury, the jury only heard one side of the story. As a result, Henderson argues that the jury was not afforded the opportunity to deliberate on his defense of justifiable use of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-13\">\u00b613 The State of Montana (State) argues that Stufft did not promise the jury that they would hear from Henderson. Rather, the State argues that Stufft\u2019s statements demonstrate he was leaving his options open until the State presented its case.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-14\">\u00b614 We apply a two-pronged test when addressing ineffective assistance of counsel claims. First, an individual claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must establish that performance of his counsel was deficient. Second, an individual must establish that counsel\u2019s deficient performance was prejudicial. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 682, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2061-62, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>State v. Whitlow, </em>2001 MT 208, \u00b6 17, 306 Mont. 339, \u00b6 17, 33 P.3d 877, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-15\">\u00b615 We have recently addressed two ineffective assistance of counsel cases in <em>Herrman, </em>and in <em>State v. Turnsplenty, </em>2003 MT 159, 316 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Mont. 275, 70 P.3d 1234. Both cases involved claims that counsel improperly exercised their challenges for cause and their peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">\u00b616 In addressing Herrman\u2019s claims, we noted that it was a mistake for us to \u201cassume,\u201d as we did in <em>State v. Chastain </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 61, 947 P.2d 57, that we could \u201cdetermine from a cold record whether there was a tactical reason for not exercising a challenge [for cause].\u201d <em>Herrman, </em>\u00b6 30. Consequently, we overruled <em>Chastain </em>on that basis. <em>Hermann, </em>\u00b6 33. We held in <em>Hermann, </em>that the reasons for counsel\u2019s actions \u201cshould be the subject of a postconviction evidentiary inquiry.\u201d <em>Herrman, </em>\u00b6 30. Further, we held that we could not conclude whether counsel had a strategic plan for exercising a peremptory challenge, rather than a challenge for cause, without the benefit of a postconviction hearing. <em>Herrman, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">\u00b617 Similarly, in <em>Turnsplenty, </em>we relied on <em>Herrman </em>in holding that we could not address Turnsplent/s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel without considering matters outside the record. <em>Turnsplenty, </em>\u00b6 18. Hence, we dismissed his claim, as it was not record based and would be more appropriately raised within a postconviction relief proceeding. <em>Turnsplenty, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18, 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\u00b618  Here, Henderson\u2019s claim does not involve a challenge for cause or a peremptory challenge, as in <em>Herrman </em>and <em>Turnsplenty. </em>However, Henderson\u2019s argument still raises the question why Stufft took the particular course of action he did, namely in not calling Henderson as a witness after stating to the jury that his client would testify. We decline to speculate on why defense counsel did not call his client to testify in view of his opening statements. As we explained in <em>State v. Harris, </em>2001 MT 231, 306 Mont. 525, 36 P.3d 372, if the record does not disclose fully why counsel took a particular action, then \u201cthe matter is best-suited for post-conviction proceedings which permit a further inquiry into whether the particular representation was ineffective.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>\u00b6 21. Whether Stufft had a tactical or strategic reason for not calling his client to testify, given his opening statements, is best explored in an evidentiary hearing in a postconviction proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">\u00b619  We hold that Henderson\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not sufficiently record-based, and, accordingly, we dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">\u00b620 Dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b56-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES RICE, WARNER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
