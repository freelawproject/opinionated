ORS 163.115. On appeal, he argues that the trial court erred in admitting a statement made by the victim to one of her friends while defendant was present. We agree with defendant that the trial court erred in admitting the victim\u2019s statement as an adopted admission under OEC 801(4)(b)(B). We therefore reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">On the night of the victim\u2019s death, she and defendant, her former boyfriend, were both at the Grove Tavern in Cottage Grove, although they were not there together. Defendant was upset about their recent breakup and the fact that, throughout the evening, the victim made loud, insulting comments about him. Defendant left the Grove Tavern around 2:15 a.m., and the victim left approximately 15 minutes later.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">At approximately 2:50 a.m. that morning, police officers responded to a call reporting an intoxicated person in the lobby of the Cottage Grove Hotel. At the hotel, officers discovered the victim\u2019s body lying on the second floor near the elevator. While waiting for the paramedics to arrive, officers received a report of a disturbance in a parking lot near the hotel. Officer Smith went to investigate and discovered defendant with blood spattered on his jacket and soaking the lower legs of his jeans and boots. Defendant \u201cstarted calling out \u2014 he said he hurt her real bad. He said he\u2019d done something real bad.\u201d Defendant told Smith that he wanted Smith to kill him and that he had \u201churt her bad.\u201d Smith placed defendant in a patrol car and drove defendant to the police station. There, defendant continued saying that he had \u201churt her bad\u201d and asking Smith to kill him because he did not deserve to live. Defendant appeared to be intoxicated at the time, but was only moderately impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Detective Shepherd read defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights and interviewed him a few hours later. During the interview, defendant stated that he left the Grove Tavern alone that night, but he encountered the victim a few blocks away from the bar and walked her to the Cottage Grove Hotel, where she lived. According to defendant, he planned on saying goodbye to her at the door to the hotel and walking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>home. As she went inside, the victim said something to him that he did not understand, and \u201cnext thing I know she\u2019s all bloody on the ground.\u201d He said that he did not know why he began beating her, and while doing it, he \u201ckept screaming to myself, \u2018stop.\u2019 I just wanted to stop.\u201d Defendant took an Intoxilyzer test during the interview and registered a blood alcohol content of . 10 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The victim was pronounced dead at the hospital of \u201cblunt force head injuries complicated by the compression of the neck fracturing the bones and the cartilage in the neck.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">At trial, defendant advanced the theory that he had committed manslaughter rather than murder because he did not commit the homicide intentionally; under ORS 163.115(l)(a), a criminal homicide constitutes murder \u201c[w]hen it is committed intentionally,\u201d unless an affirmative defense applies, and a criminal homicide constitutes manslaughter in the first degree when \u201c[i]t is committed recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.\u201d ORS 163.118.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">One of the witnesses who testified for the state on the question of defendant\u2019s intent was Pennington. She testified that, a few nights before the victim was killed, she and the victim were talking together at the Grove Tavern. Defendant was also there, and although he was not there with the victim, he was sitting \u201ca seat or two away\u201d from her. No music was playing, and the bar was not very noisy. The prosecutor asked Pennington, \u201cAt some point were they sitting together in [t]he Grove [Tavern] when [the victim], in front of [defendant,] made a comment about what he might do to her?\u201d Defendant objected on hearsay grounds, and a hearing was held outside the presence of the jury. At that hearing, in response to questioning by the prosecutor, Pennington testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">\u201cA: She was telling me about a night that \u2014 -just a few nights before that, that he was, um \u2014 laying outside her apartment door with his head against the door talking about, um \u2014 that he wanted to be with her. If \u2014 if he couldn\u2019t have her then nobody else was going to. He was going to kill her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>\u201cQ: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-4\">\u201cA: And [she] told me that she believed that he was going to kill her. And I told her that if you believe that, then go to the police. But I didn\u2019t really\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">\u201cQ: All this was said with him right there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">\u201cA: Yeah.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Pennington also testified that defendant was \u201cprobably from me to the judge away,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that the victim</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-8\">\u201cwas loud enough to hear we had a conversation. She wasn\u2019t afraid. In fact, I had said something to her: He\u2019s sitting right there * * *. She said: I don\u2019t care. He can hear. He knows what he did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">The prosecutor then offered the statement as an adopted admission. Defense counsel objected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-10\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: There\u2019s no evidence that he heard it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, there\u2019s circumstantial evidence that he heard it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-12\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That wouldn\u2019t qualify it as an adopted admission. There has to be something overt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-14\">\u201c [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I mean, just the fact that he may have heard it doesn\u2019t make it an adopted admission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: That\u2019s not true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-16\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, there would have to be some evidence that he heard it. How could it be an adopted admission otherwise?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-17\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, I think there is evidence that he heard it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-18\">The court overruled defendant\u2019s objection, finding that the victim\u2019s statement was an adopted admission. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Defense counsel then requested, and was granted, an opportunity to continue to question Pennington outside the presence of the jury, \u201cin aid of objection.\u201d He asked her:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-4\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay, so is the statement that * * * [the victim] said that [defendant] made the comments that if he couldn\u2019t have her then no one else could either. And that if she did not take him back, he was going to kill her. Are you saying that was done in front of [defendant]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">\u201c [PENNINGTON]: He was \u2014 yeah, like I said, from me to the judge. He was sitting at the bar and he was sitting there staring off to the front of the bar just like this and didn\u2019t move. I kept looking over at him and he didn\u2019t move. He just sat there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Didn\u2019t move at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-8\">\u201c [PENNINGTON]: And there was one point, I remember, the time I was there, she actually scooted over \u2014 a seat or two and he scooted over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-9\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So they sat next to each other?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-10\">\u201c[PENNINGTON]: No, not next to each other. Not like seat by seat. It was a couple seats away. But, like I said, that bar wasn\u2019t very big.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">Defense counsel renewed his objection, arguing that an adopted admission is \u201ca statement of which the party has manifested the party\u2019s adoption or belief. There\u2019s no overt manifestation. She can\u2019t even testify that he heard it.\u201d The court responded, \u201cThe classic adopted admission is an adoption by silence,\u201d and overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">Pennington then testified before the jury and related the incident at the Grove Tavern, including her rendition of the victim\u2019s statement that defendant had threatened to kill the victim. Pennington testified that, in response to the victim\u2019s statement, defendant \u201cdidn\u2019t do anything. He just\u2014 stared off into the wall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-13\">When the trial resumed the next week, defendant moved for a mistrial on the ground that Pennington\u2019s statement was improperly admitted under <em>State v. Carlson, </em>311 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Or 201, 207, 808 P2d 1002 (1991). The trial court denied that motion. Defendant was ultimately convicted of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">On appeal, defendant argues, in a single assignment of error, that the trial court erred in admitting Pennington\u2019s testimony as to the victim\u2019s statements and in denying his motion for a mistrial after that evidence was admitted. We decline to consider the latter challenge because it was not preserved for our review. <em>State v. Walton, </em>311 Or 223, 248, 809 P2d 81 (1991) (to preserve claim of error, a motion for a mistrial must be timely, that is, \u201cmade when the allegedly objectionable statements were made\u201d). For the reasons that follow, however, we conclude that the trial court erred in admitting Pennington\u2019s testimony as to the victim\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Because there is evidence in the record that defendant heard Pennington\u2019s statement, we are bound by the trial court\u2019s finding to that effect. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>335 Or 511, 523, 73 P3d 282 (2003). That fact alone, however, is not sufficient to support the conclusion that he adopted it. Under OEC 801(4)(b)(B), if a party \u201cmanifests * * *\u25a0 adoption or belief in\u201d the truth of a statement made by another person, the statement is admissible if offered against the adopting party. The proponent of the statement has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the hearer adopted the statement. <em>Carlson, </em>311 Or at 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">In <em>Carlson, </em>311 Or at 207, the Supreme Court explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">\u201cA party <em>adopts </em>the proffered statement of another person when that party\u2019s words or conduct indicate that [he or she] \u2018intended\u2019 to adopt the statement. A party manifests a <em>belief </em>in the truth of another\u2019s statement when the party intends to embrace the truth of the statement, i.e., intends to agree with or approve the contents of the statement. * * * A mere listening presence does not indicate that a party has manifested an adoption of or a belief in the truth of another person\u2019s statement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">(Citations and internal quotation marks omitted; emphases and brackets in original.) The Supreme Court has also stated that \u201c[a] party may adopt a statement either expressly, impliedly, by conduct <em>or, in a civil case, by silence.\u201d State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number><em>Severson, </em>298 Or 652, 657, 696 P2d 521 (1985) (emphasis added), <em>cited with approval in Carlson, </em>311 Or at 207. Relying on that language, defendant argues that silence, as opposed to verbal or nonverbal conduct, can never be sufficient to give rise to an adopted admission in a criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Defendant\u2019s contention is not clearly incorrect. The Alabama Supreme Court, for example, has adopted that rule. In <em>Ex parte Marek, </em>556 So 2d 375, 381 (Ala 1989), the court explained that, because nonresponse to an accusatory statement may flow from a variety of causes, it is not reasonable to draw <em>any </em>conclusions from it. Nor does anything in Oregon law militate against adopting a similar rule here. As defendant contends, the negative implication from the statement in <em>Severson </em>\u2014 \u201c[a] party may adopt a statement either expressly, impliedly, by conduct or, in a civil case, by silence\u201d \u2014 although not conclusive as a matter of pure logic, is that silence is never enough to constitute an adopted admission in a criminal case. Further, the legislature\u2019s commentary reveals that the drafters of the evidence code believed that finding an adopted admission by silence would be problematic in a criminal case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">\u201cAn admission may be made by adopting or acquiescing in the statement of another. * * * Adoption or acquiescence may be manifested in any appropriate manner. The greatest issues surround silence, where the theory is that the person would have protested an untrue statement. This calls for an evaluation of probable human behavior under the circumstances. In civil cases the results have been generally satisfactory. <em>In criminal cases, troublesome questions are raised. The inference involved is fairly weak to begin with. Silence may be motivated by advice of counsel or a realization that \u2018anything you say may be used against you.\u2019 </em>Unusual opportunity is afforded to manufacture evidence. Encroachment upon the privilege against self-incrimination seems inescapable. Not surprisingly, in <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 US 610, 96 S Ct 2240, 49 L Ed 2d 91 (1976) and <em>United States v. Hale, </em>422 US 171, 95 S Ct 2133, 45 L Ed 2d 99 (1975), the United States Supreme Court held that evidence of silence during police interrogation is inadmissible at the defendant\u2019s subsequent trial for the purpose of impeaching the defendant\u2019s credibility. Such evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>declared to be insolubly ambiguous, fundamentally unfair and possessed of an intolerably prejudicial impact. The Legislative Assembly agrees. This subparagraph should not be construed to allow the admission, for any purpose in a criminal case, of evidence of silence during police interrogation after the defendant has been informed of the right to remain silent as provided in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 US 436, 86 S Ct 1602, 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966). In light of the <em>Doyle </em>and <em>Hale </em>decisions, Rule 801 contains no special provisions concerning failure to deny in criminal cases.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Legislative Commentary to OEC 801(4)(b)(B), <em>reprinted in </em>Laird C. Kirkpatrick, <em>Oregon Evidence </em>\u00a7 801.03, 674 (5th ed 2007) (emphasis added). Thus, although the legislature did not foreclose the possibility of a statement being adopted by silence \u2014 unless the silence occurred during a police interrogation after <em>Miranda </em>warnings \u2014 the legislature expressed concern about allowing adoption by silence in a criminal case because \u201cthe inference is fairly weak.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">In any event, even if silence in the face of an accusatory statement could, in some situations, amount to an adoption of that statement, the silence in this case did not. The Oregon Supreme Court applied OEC 801(4)(b)(B) to nonverbal conduct in <em>Carlson. </em>In that case, police officers questioned the defendant about needle marks on his arms. When the defendant replied that the marks were injuries that he had received from working on a car, his wife yelled, \u201cYou liar, you got them from shooting up in the bedroom with all your stupid friends.\u201d In response, the defendant \u201chung his head and shook his head back and forth.\u201d 311 Or at 203. The Supreme Court concluded that the \u201cdefendant\u2019s nonverbal reaction is so ambiguous that it cannot reasonably be deemed sufficient to establish that any particular interpretation, consistent with the trial judge\u2019s ruling, is more probably correct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Although <em>Carlson </em>dealt with nonverbal conduct, rather than silence, the <em>Carlson </em>court\u2019s interpretation of OEC 801(4)(b)(B) guides our analysis in this case. In <em>Carlson, </em>the court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>\u201c[w]hen it is claimed * * * that a party-litigant has manifested an adoption or a belief by nonverbal conduct and the conduct is susceptible of more than one interpretation, * * * the court must examine the totality of the circumstances surrounding the hearsay declaration and the party\u2019s nonverbal behavior to determine whether the party intended to adopt, agree with or approve the contents of the declaration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">311 Or at 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The totality of the circumstances in this case do not establish that defendant\u2019s silence was anything more than a \u201cmere listening presence.\u201d <em>Carlson, </em>311 Or at 207. In response to the victim\u2019s statement, defendant \u201cdidn\u2019t do anything. He just \u2014 stared off into the wall.\u201d The only evidence to support the conclusion that defendant adopted the statement is that he heard the statement, the statement was important, and it was accusatory. But, under those facts, there are many reasons why defendant may have decided not to respond. Most obviously, he may have wanted to avoid arguing with the victim, especially in a bar, or he may have believed that it would be inappropriate to intrude into the conversation of which he was not part.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Given the many reasons why defendant may have chosen not to intrude into the conversation between the victim and her friend, we conclude that, as in <em>Carlson, </em>311 Or at 214, \u201cdefendant\u2019s * * * reaction is so ambiguous that it cannot reasonably be deemed sufficient to establish that any particular interpretation * * * is more probably correct. We hold, therefore, that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant intended to adopt, agree with or approve\u201d the statement the victim made to Pennington.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Another fact in the present case undermines the conclusion that defendant adopted the accusatory statement: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>defendant was a bystander, not a participant, in the conversation during which the statement was made. In interpreting FRE 801(d)(2)(B) \u2014 which the <em>Severson </em>court recognized as an analog to OEC 801(4)(b)(B) \u2014 no federal court, as far as our research has been able to discover, has held that a defendant adopted a statement made in the defendant\u2019s presence where the defendant was not an <em>active participant in the conversation. </em>In <em>U.S. v. Ward, </em>377 F3d 671, 676 (7th Cir 2004), <em>cert </em>den, _ US _ , 127 S Ct 56 (2006), the Seventh Circuit upheld a finding that a defendant had adopted a statement where the statement was made near the defendant in an apartment and the defendant\u2019s subsequent verbal response indicated that he had heard the earlier statement. The court noted that the statement had been made during a conversation in which the defendant was an active participant. Similarly, the Eighth Circuit upheld a finding that a defendant had adopted a statement made by the defendant\u2019s co-conspirator to the defendant\u2019s mother because the defendant \u201cactively participated in the conversation and did not contradict or deny [his co-conspirator\u2019s] statements.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Kehoe, </em>310 F3d 579, 591 (8th Cir 2002), <em>cert den, </em>538 US 1048 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">In contrast, the Ninth Circuit excluded an allegedly adopted statement where the only evidence that the defendant had heard the statement was that he was \u201caround\u201d when the statement was made, and there was no evidence about how close the defendant had been to the declarant of the statement or how noisy the area was where the statement was made. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>522 F2d 1068, 1076 (9th Cir 1975), <em>cert den, </em>423 US 1049 (1976). The Eighth Circuit also excluded an allegedly adopted statement <em>in Arpan v. United States, </em>260 F2d 649 (8th Cir 1958). In <em>Arpan, </em>the defendant\u2019s father told a coroner shortly after the defendant\u2019s wife\u2019s death that the defendant had said that he had killed her. The discussion between the defendant\u2019s father and the coroner occurred in the defendant\u2019s kitchen while the defendant, who was depressed and withdrawn, sat in the kitchen near his mother. <em>Id. </em>at 656-57. The court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">\u201cUsually, situations of implied or adoptive admission in criminal cases have involved some tie on the part of the accused to the setting or the events of the making of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>statement, so that he would naturally be prompted to engage in denial or reply. In [a] patent and extreme example, a man walking on the street and passing two strangers carrying on a private conversation about him could hardly legally be regarded as having a responsibility to stop them and make denial of some incriminating statement asserted against him, in order to prevent it from subsequently being treated as an adoptive admission by him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-4\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">\u201cWe should have difficulty persuading ourselves that [the circumstances in this case] presented such a situation of naturally expectable responsiveness to anything which might fortuitously have drifted to appellant\u2019s hearing, of the conversation between the coroner and his father, as to entitle his failure to be prompted to interjection or denial to be fairly regarded as an adoptive assent or admission by him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">For all of the reasons discussed above, including the fact that defendant was not a participant in the conversation at the bar and did not exhibit any behavior manifesting an adoption or belief in the victim\u2019s statement, we conclude that there is inadequate evidence that he adopted the accusatory statement. The trial court erred in ruling to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">The state also argues that admission of the victim\u2019s statement to Pennington was harmless, because evidence of similar threats was also admitted. However, we conclude that, given the importance of the statement made to Pennington and the differences between that statement and the other threats on which the state relies, admitting the statement was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">Under the Oregon Constitution, error is harmless if there is little likelihood that the particular error affected the verdict. <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003). Pennington\u2019s testimony was offered to demonstrate that defendant <em>intentionally </em>killed the victim. According to the state, the testimony of other witnesses established intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">First, the state relies on the testimony of Ames. Ames testified that defendant had told him that defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>was so frustrated that \u201che felt he could kill someone.\u201d However, Ames testified that he did not believe that defendant was referring to the victim, but, rather, stating that he could kill someone in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">The state also presented evidence that, at least two months before trial, defendant had asked another acquaintance, Newton, whether the victim was using drugs and told Newton that he would kill her if she was. Newton told defendant that the victim was not using drugs. After defendant killed the victim, the police found a letter on him that was addressed to the victim. In that letter, defendant stated, \u201cWhy you did what you did to me and then lied to me about it, I don\u2019t even know. I don\u2019t know if it was the drugs or booze. * * * I don\u2019t intend to say anything about your * * * drugs [.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Neither of these pieces of testimony is sufficient to make the erroneously admitted evidence harmless. According to Ames\u2019s testimony, defendant stated that he <em>\u201ccould </em>kill someone\u201d; but he did not state that he <em>intended </em>to kill anyone, and he certainly did not indicate that he intended to kill the victim. The threat regarding the alleged drug use presents a closer question, but that evidence does not have the same weight as Pennington\u2019s testimony. Although defendant refers to the victim\u2019s drug use in the letter, the letter does not disclose whether he actually had knowledge that the victim had used drugs. Additionally, the threat defendant made to Newton more than two months before her death would likely not have the same weight in the minds of most jurors as the threat defendant made the week before he killed the victim. Finally, defendant\u2019s threat to kill the victim if she used drugs is much more likely to be interpreted as an idle threat than the statement that he was going to kill her if he could not have her.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">We cannot say that there is little likelihood that defendant\u2019s threat to kill the victim if he could not have her had an effect on the verdict. According to defendant\u2019s testimony, on the night of the homicide, he walked the victim to her apartment and intended to leave and go home; instead, he began beating her, and he did not know why he had done it. Immediately after being arrested, defendant confessed to having hurt the victim and made no effort to cover up his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>crime. Based on those facts, the victim\u2019s statement, offered through Pennington\u2019s testimony, that defendant threatened to kill her was important evidence to establish that he had committed the crime intentionally. Because none of the other evidence admitted had the same weight, we conclude that the admission of Pennington\u2019s testimony was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-19\"> The judge noted that, from where he was sitting, he could reach out and touch Pennington: \u201cShe stuck her hand out towards me, I stuck my hand out towards her, and we can touch fingertips.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b513-7\"> The legislative commentary to OEC 801(4)(b)(B) is nearly identical to the Notes of the Advisory Committee onFRE 801(d)(2)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b514-8\"> Testimony from another witness, Holcomb, admitted after Pennington\u2019s testimony, demonstrates that it would not have been out of character for defendant to maintain silence in response to a negative statement that the victim made about him. Holcomb testified that when the victim was at a bar and defendant would walk by, she would often make loud, insulting comments meant to embarrass him. In response to these insults, defendant normally \u201cwould try to take himself out of the situation, but he was very quiet.

Defendant killed the victim, his former girlfriend, a few nights after the conversation with Pennington. The majority concludes that the statements were hearsay and that the trial court erred in admitting them as \u201cadopted admissions\u201d by defendant under OEC 801(4)(b)(B). I disagree that the trial court erred and, therefore, dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The circumstances of this case are unusual in several important respects: First, unlike many \u201cadopted admissions\u201d cases, there was no police presence whatsoever at the time the statements were made. No crime had occurred; no crime was under investigation. Second, the state\u2019s sole purpose in offering the statement in this case was to provide circumstantial evidence of defendant\u2019s intent to kill the victim. Thus, the statement was offered to prove only that defendant had said, on a prior occasion, that he would kill the victim if he could not have her as his girlfriend. That is precisely the sort of statement that cries out for a denial or clarification by the maker of the statement \u2014 if in fact it was not made or was otherwise misunderstood. This is particularly true when, as here, there was a clear opportunity for defendant to clarify his intentions, whether or not he had made the statement. Instead, defendant responded simply by staring at the wall. A few days later, the victim was dead, and the defense to the murder charge was that defendant had not acted intentionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>As the majority notes, Oregon does not have a definitive rule prohibiting adopted admissions by silence in all criminal cases. 217 Or App at 482-83. Indeed, the legislative commentary accompanying the enactment of the Oregon Evidence Code indicates that the legislature, while being fully cognizant of the special concerns raised in criminal cases, chose <em>not </em>to adopt such a bar, except in the narrow circumstances where the silence occurs during police interrogation after <em>Miranda </em>warnings have been given:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-4\">\u201cAdoption or acquiescence may be manifested in any appropriate manner. The greatest issues surround silence, where the theory is that the person would have protested an untrue statement. This calls for an evaluation of probable human behavior under the circumstances. In civil cases the results have been generally satisfactory. In criminal cases, troublesome questions are raised. The inference involved is fairly weak to begin with. Silence may be motivated by advice of counsel or a realization that \u2018anything you say may be used against you.\u2019 Unusual opportunity is afforded to manufacture evidence. Encroachment upon the privilege against self-inclimination seems inescapable. Not surprisingly, in <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 US 610, 96 S Ct 2240, 49 L Ed 2d 91 (1976) and <em>United States v. Hale, </em>422 US 171, 95 S Ct 2133, 45 L Ed 2d 99 (1975), the United States Supreme Court held that evidence of silence during police interrogation is inadmissible at the defendant\u2019s subsequent trial for the purpose of impeaching the defendant\u2019s credibility. Such evidence was declared to be insolubly ambiguous, fundamentally unfair and possessed of an intolerably prejudicial impact. The Legislative Assembly agrees. This subparagraph should not be construed to allow the admission, for any purpose in a criminal case, of evidence of silence during police interrogation after the defendant has been informed of the right to remain silent as provided in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 US 436, 86 S Ct 1602, 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966). In light of the <em>Doyle </em>and <em>Hale </em>decisions, Rule 801 contains no special provisions concerning failure to deny in criminal cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Legislative Commentary to OEC 801(4)(b)(B), <em>reprinted in </em>Laird C. Kirkpatrick, <em>Oregon Evidence </em>\u00a7 801.03, 674 (5th ed 2007). The legislature thus contemplated that a criminal defendant\u2019s silence <em>could </em>constitute an adopted admission as long as the circumstances did not involve police interrogation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>after the administration of <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>See also </em>Kirkpatrick, <em>Oregon Evidence </em>\u00a7 801.03 at 685 (\u201cSilence in the face of accusations by persons other than law enforcement officers may be admissible against the defendant in a criminal case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">In my view, this case presents an opportunity to clarify that a criminal defendant\u2019s silence <em>may </em>manifest an adoption where, as here, defendant heard and understood the accusatory statement, it was the sort of statement that, under the circumstances, a reasonable person would deny, disavow, or, at a minimum, attempt to clarify, and where the statement did not arise during police interrogation after <em>Miranda </em>warnings had been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Defendant argues that this approach is precluded in Oregon, relying on the court\u2019s observation in <em>State v. </em>Severson, 298 Or 652, 657, 696 P2d 521 (1985), and quoted in <em>State v. Carlson, </em>311 Or 201, 207, 808 P2d 1002 (1991), that \u201c[a] party may adopt a statement either expressly, impliedly, by conduct <em>or, in a civil case, by silence. </em>Commentary to Oregon Evidence Code 148-49 (1981).\u201d (Emphasis added.) The majority is, at least to some extent, persuaded by that argument. <em>See </em>217 Or App at 482 (positing that \u201c[djefendant\u2019s contention is not clearly incorrect\u201d and noting that the Alabama Supreme Court has adopted it). Yet, as the majority recognizes, it does not necessarily follow from the statement made by the court in <em>Severson </em>that the opposite is also true \u2014 that is, that silence can never be sufficient in a criminal case. Such a reading of <em>Severson </em>is particularly doubtful in light of the <em>Severson </em>court\u2019s citation to the legislative commentary, which, as demonstrated above, evidences the legislature\u2019s intention to exclude the use of silence in criminal cases only in certain circumstances. <em>See </em>Kirkpatrick, <em>Oregon Evidence </em>\u00a7 801.03 at 685 (\u201cAs the Commentary indicates, adoption by silence should rarely be found in a criminal case <em>where the defendant has failed to respond to an accusation made by or in the presence of a law enforcement officer.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\"><em>Carlson, </em>the leading Oregon case on the subject of adopted admissions, also does not compel the conclusion that silence is automatically an insufficient basis upon which to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>find that a statement has been adopted by a criminal defendant. Although the court in <em>Carlson </em>explained that \u201c[a] mere listening presence does not indicate that a party has manifested an adoption of or a belief in the truth of another person\u2019s statement,\u201d 311 Or at 207, the import of the court\u2019s comment is simply that silence does not <em>automatically </em>satisfy the requirement of the rule for adopted admissions; it does not foreclose the possibility that, given the totality of the circumstances under which the statement was made, a criminal defendant\u2019s silence in light of those circumstances may nevertheless demonstrate, rather than a \u201cmere listening presence,\u201d the defendant\u2019s intention to adopt the statement. Indeed, the federal treatise cited by the <em>Carlson </em>court for the proposition that a \u201clistening presence\u201d alone is insufficient says as much:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-4\">\u201c[D]eciding that a party was present and that he heard a statement uttered by another represents only one step in a larger inquiry. It should not by itself satisfy Rule 801(d)(2)(B).[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] A mere listening presence does not indicate that a party has adopted or manifested his belief in everything that is said, and even active participation in a conversation does not so indicate. The philosophy of the adversary system does not, in such minimal circumstances, suggest that the absence of the usual safeguards of oath, cross-examination, and demeanor evidence should be excused. In addition to a listening presence, it should be shown that a party has replied or otherwise spoken or acted in a manner which shows his adoption or belief in the statement or, <em>if the party has stood silent, that the circumstances indicate that silence manifests belief or adoption\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">David W. Louisell &amp; Christopher B. Mueller, 4 <em>Federal Evidence </em>\u00a7 424, 265-66 (1980) (footnote omitted; emphasis added);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>see also </em>Kirkpatrick, <em>Oregon Evidence </em>\u00a7 801.03 at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>683 (\u201cAdoption by implication may be found when a party remains silent in response to a statement where a reasonable person, under the circumstances, would deny correct, or otherwise answer the statement if false.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">The treatise farther explains that, when a party does or says nothing in response to a statement, the question whether the inaction or silence indicates adoption must be resolved by examining the circumstances. Louisell and Mueller, 4 <em>Federal Evidence </em>\u00a7 424 at 268. To indicate adoption, it must appear that the party heard the statement, the matter was within his or her knowledge, and, \u201cperhaps most importantly,\u201d \u201cthe occasion and nature of the statement [were] such that the party would likely have replied if he did not mean to accept what was said.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted); <em>see also U.S. v. Kehoe, </em>310 F3d 579, 591 (8th Cir 2002), <em>cert den, </em>538 US 1048 (2003) (for an out-of-court statement to constitute an adopted admission under FRE 801(d)(2)(B), the defendant must have been present when the statement was made, have understood it, and have had an opportunity to deny it); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>522 F2d 1068, 1075-76 (9th Cir 1975), <em>cert den, </em>423 US 1049 (1976) (\u201cThe general rule concerning admissions by silence or acquiescence is well established. When an accusatory statement is made in the defendant\u2019s presence and hearing, and he understands and has an opportunity to deny it, the statement and his failure to deny are admissible against him.\u201d). Even if the minimum conditions are satisfied, however, the statement still should be excluded if it appears that (1) the party did not understand the statement or its significance, (2) the party was prevented from replying by \u201csome physical or psychological force,\u201d (3) the speaker was someone whom the party would be likely to ignore, or (4) in the criminal context, the statement was made by law enforcement officers, or persons acting on their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>behalf, during custodial interrogation. Louisell and Mueller, 4 <em>Federal Evidence </em>\u00a7 424 at 268-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">The circumstances in this case satisfy the requirements for an adopted admission as outlined above. First, the trial court found \u2014 and the evidence supports \u2014 that defendant heard the victim\u2019s statements. The bar was relatively quiet that night, no music was playing, and defendant was sitting within hearing range of the victim. It is also beyond dispute that defendant had knowledge of the subject matter of the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Next, the statements did not occur in response to police questioning or, indeed, even in the presence of a police officer or under other circumstances where defendant might reasonably be expected to remain silent due to concerns that \u201canything he said could be used against him.\u201d This is far different from the circumstances of <em>Carlson, </em>in which the statements were made in the presence of police officers as they were investigating the defendant for possible criminal behavior.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Most importantly, the \u201coccasion and nature\u201d of the statements were such that a reply would be expected. Louisell and Mueller, 4 <em>Federal Evidence </em>\u00a7 424 at 268 (among the factors to be considered in determining whether a party\u2019s silence indicates adoption, perhaps most important is whether \u201cthe occasion and nature of the statement were such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>that the party would likely have replied if he did not mean to accept what was said\u201d). As the Second Circuit explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-4\">\u201cWhere the defendant\u2019s adoption of another person\u2019s statement purportedly is manifested by <em>silence, </em>or other ambiguous conduct, courts will consider the incriminatory content of the statement in order to determine whether the defendant actually has adopted the statement by his silence. The rationale of such cases is that a person ordinarily will respond to an incriminatory or defamatory statement with a denial, or at least with some indication that he objects to the statement as untrue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-5\"><em>United States v. Shulman, </em>624 F2d 384, 390 (2d Cir 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Here, the statements attributable to defendant were particularly inflammatory and portrayed defendant in the worst possible light \u2014 according to the victim, he said \u201c[h]e was going to kill her\u201d and \u201cif he couldn\u2019t have her then nobody else was going to.\u201d Those are precisely the type of words that would be expected to draw a reply if defendant did not mean to accept that he had said them. And, defendant had ample opportunity to reflect on what the victim said and to refute the statements. That is especially true in light of the fact that he was <em>prompted </em>to respond by the victim: When Pennington pointed out that defendant was sitting close enough to hear the victim, the victim responded, \u201cI don\u2019t care. He can hear. He knows what he did.\u201d Even so, defendant did nothing to deny or disavow that he had made such serious threats. Even after Pennington suggested to the victim that she contact the police, defendant did not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Still, the majority contends that the circumstances fail to establish that defendant\u2019s silence was \u201canything more than a \u2018mere listening presence.\u2019 \u201d 217 Or App at 484. The majority is apparently persuaded that defendant\u2019s lack of reply was explained by some psychological force or because the victim was someone whom defendant would likely ignore, <em>see </em>217 Or App at 484 n 3 (explaining other possible reasons for defendant\u2019s lack of response and recounting the testimony of one witness that \u201cit would not have been out of character for defendant to maintain silence in response to a negative statement that the victim made about him\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>That position is not supported by the record. As to this point, some elaboration of the facts recounted in the majority opinion is necessary. The majority relates that the victim and defendant were both at the Grove Tavern the night the conversation that is the subject of this appeal took place, and they were also both there a few nights later, the night of the victim\u2019s death. What is not readily apparent from the majority opinion, however, is that the Grove was essentially a home away from home for defendant and the victim and the \u201con again, off again\u201d relationship between them largely <em>existed </em>at the Grove, a small bar where the \u201cregulars\u201d all knew one another. The victim worked at the Grove as a cook and bartender and lived nearby; defendant, who was out of work, often just hung out there when the victim was working; and the two socialized there all the time, both together and independently. On the night of the victim\u2019s death, for example, although they had broken up a few weeks earlier, and the victim was not working that night, both defendant and the victim were at the Grove at around 5:00 to 6:00 in the evening, and they were still there when the bar got ready to close between 2:00 and 2:30 the following morning. They also were both present in the bar on the several nights before the crime occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">Testimony at trial revealed that the drama of their tumultuous relationship also often played out at the Grove. Indeed, the picture that had emerged at trial by the time the court admitted the disputed testimony was one of frequent\u2014 and loud \u2014 arguing and bickering <em>between </em>defendant and the victim. (As one witness indicated, \u201ceveryone knew they weren\u2019t getting along.\u201d) Defendant was not just a passive receptor for the victim\u2019s negative comments, as the majority would have us believe. For example, Newton, who also worked at the Grove, testified that, during one of their fights, defendant called the victim names, such as \u201cnasty fat bitch,\u201d loud enough for everyone to hear. Again, on the night before the crime, the victim was tending bar and defendant \u201ckept pestering her.\u201d According to Newton, \u201che would come in and say things and it would upset her.\u201d This went on for several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>hours, according to Newton. Ames, another frequenter of the Grove, described their arguments as \u201cmore of them saying smart comments to each other loud enough for the whole bar to hear.\u201d Rhodes, who also knew the victim and defendant from the Grove, testified that \u201c[t]here was fighting a lot,\u201d generally about money and flirting, and \u201c[i]f they\u2019d start raising their voices, I\u2019d leave.\u201d Similarly, the owner of the tavern described the arguments between them as \u201cairing their dirty laundry\u201d loud enough for others to hear.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">For the same reasons, defendant also cannot, as the majority suggests, be characterized as a \u201cbystander\u201d to the conversation. 217 Or App at 485. This is not a case, in the words of Mueller and Kirkpatrick, of \u201csaddl[ing] [defendant] with statements by outsiders to which [he has] a loose and uncertain connection.\u201d Mueller and Kirkpatrick, 4 <em>Federal Evidence </em>\u00a7 8:47 at 387. Defendant and the victim had an existing relationship. They were often at the Grove at the same time, and, whether they could be characterized as being there \u201ctogether\u201d on any particular day, it was not unusual for them to argue back and forth or to make negative comments about the other loud enough for the other to hear. At the time the statements in question were made, they were even seated very close \u2014 within a seat or two of one another \u2014 and, at some point during the evening, when the victim moved over a seat or two, defendant also moved over.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">In sum, while I am mindful that inferring adoption from silence in a criminal case must be approached with caution, given the totality of the circumstances of this case, I agree with the trial court that defendant\u2019s silence represented a \u201cclassic\u201d adopted admission by silence. In other words, I would affirm the ruling of the trial court because the evidence supports that defendant heard and understood the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>statement, it was of a type that a reasonable person would likely have responded to if untrue, defendant had an opportunity to deny, disavow, or explain the statement, but did not, and the statement was not made in the presence of police. None of the factors that might, nevertheless, suggest that exclusion would be appropriate, 217 Or App at 492-93 (Rosenblum, J., dissenting), is present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b527-5\">Haselton, Armstrong, and Ortega, JJ., join in this dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b521-6\"> FRCP 801(d)(2)(B) is essentially identical to OEC 801(4)(b)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b521-7\"> The most recent edition of the treatise, authored by Mueller and Kirkpatrick, contains a similar explanation, expressing the concept as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">\u201cThe philosophy of the adversary system and the underlying notion of personal responsibility do not extend so far as to suggest that parties should be saddled with statements by outsiders to which they have a loose and uncertain connection.
