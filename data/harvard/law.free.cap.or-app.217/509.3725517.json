On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying her motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude a crime laboratory report on the ground that ORS 475.235 unconstitutionally shifted the burden of production to defendant. The state concedes that, under <em>State v. Birchfield, </em>342 Or 624, 157 P3d 216 (2007), the trial court erred in admitting the report, but argues that the error was harmless. On the record before us, we agree with the state\u2019s concession. However, we disagree that the error was harmless, inasmuch as a central issue at trial was whether the state proved that the substance found in defendant\u2019s possession was a controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
