J.</author>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Defendant, who pleaded guilty to first-degree theft, ORS 164.055, appeals, challenging the trial court\u2019s imposition of an upward departure sentence based on defendant\u2019s \u201cpersistent involvement\u201d in similar offenses unrelated to the current crime. <em>See </em>OAR 213-008-0002(l)(b)(D). He argues that the \u201cpersistent involvement\u201d departure factor is unconstitutionally vague and, alternatively, that the evidence was insufficient to support the imposition of an upward departure sentence based on that aggravating factor. We reject both of those contentions and, consequently, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The circumstances material to our review are undisputed. Defendant pleaded guilty and waived his right to a sentencing jury. At sentencing, the court imposed an upward departure sentence of 26 months pursuant to ORS 137.717(3)(b), which permits the imposition, of a departure sentence \u201cauthorized by the rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission based on findings of substantial and compelling reasons.\u201d Specifically, the corut found as an aggravating factor that defendant had been persistently involved in similar offenses unrelated to the current offense. <em>See </em>OAR 213-008-0002(l)(b)(D). In so ruling, the court denied defendant\u2019s \u201cMotion to Dismiss Aggravating Factors on Grounds of Vagueness and Violation of Due Process\u201d and also denied defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal (MJOA) on the \u201cpersistent involvement\u201d aggravating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">On appeal, defendant renews both challenges. The state, besides joining issue on the merits, also contends, as a threshold matter, that defendant\u2019s challenges are not reviewable. The state\u2019s \u201cnonreviewability\u201d arguments here substantially parallel those in <em>State v. Gallegos, </em>217 Or App 248, 174 P3d 1086 (2007), and, for the reasons stated in <em>Gallegos, </em>we also reject them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">We first address defendant\u2019s nonconstitutional argument. Defendant contends that, for a sentencing court to impose a departure sentence based on a finding of \u201c[p]ersistent involvement in similar offenses,\u201d OAR 213-008-0002(l)(b)(D), the state must produce evidence other than the defendant\u2019s criminal history itself that demonstrates \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>separate malevolent quality in the offender [.]\u201d <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>113 Or App 134, 137, 831 P2d 712 (1992). That argument is conclusively answered by <em>State v. Bray, </em>342 Or 711, 160 P3d 983 (2007), in which the court addressed the content of the \u201cpersistent involvement\u201d aggravating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">In <em>Bray, </em>the Supreme Court considered whether the \u201cpersistent involvement\u201d factor \u201ccomes within the prior conviction exception to the rule in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 US 466, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000).\u201d <em>Bray, </em>342 Or at 714. The court concluded that it did not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">\u201cWe note, as an initial matter, that the use of the word \u2018persistent\u2019 implies that the defendant\u2019s involvement in those offenses must be recurring or continuing. <em>See Webster\u2019s [Third New Int\u2019l </em>Dictionary] 1686 [(unabridged ed 2002)] (defining \u2018persistent\u2019 as \u2018existing for a long or longer than usual time or continuously: ENDURING, LINGERING\u2019).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">\u201cIn determining whether the record establishes \u2018[p]ersistent involvement in similar offenses,\u2019 a sentencing court must do more than find that a defendant has two or more prior convictions for similar offenses. The trier of fact must infer from the number and frequency of those prior convictions whether the defendant\u2019s involvement in those offenses is \u2018persistent\u2019; that is, the trier of fact must determine whether the defendant\u2019s involvement in similar offenses is sufficiently continuous or recurring to say that it is \u2018persistent.\u2019 If, as the plurality explained in <em>Shepard </em>[v. <em>United States, </em>544 US 13, 125 S Ct 1254, 161 L Ed 2d 205 (2005)], the prior conviction exception includes only those facts that the conviction itself or the judicial record conclusively establishes, then it does not include inferences, such as persistent involvement in similar offenses, that a trier of fact may draw from a series of prior convictions. In short, we agree with the Court of Appeals that \u2018[p]ersistent involvement in similar offenses\u2019 presents a factual issue that, under <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>[v. <em>Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004)], a defendant may insist that a jury find beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 724 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Thus, under <em>Bray, </em>the determination of \u201cpersistent involvement\u201d is straightforward: The factfinder is to determine, from the \u201cnumber and frequency\u201d of defendant\u2019s prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>convictions for similar offenses whether defendant\u2019s involvement in those offenses was so \u201ccontinuous or recurring\u201d as to be \u201cpersistent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To the extent that any of our prior cases, including <em>Kennedy, </em>may have introduced any arguably ambiguous or extraneous \u201cgloss\u201d into the operative standard, the Supreme Court\u2019s elucidation in <em>Bray </em>remedied any such problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">Further, under <em>Bray, </em>although \u201cpersistent involvement\u201d is a factual determination, it is one that involves inferences that a trier of fact may draw from a series of prior convictions. That is, the state need not adduce evidence <em>beyond </em>the \u201cnumber and frequency\u201d of prior convictions in order for the trier of fact to find the requisite \u201ccontinuous or recurring\u201d involvement in similar offenses. Consequently, the state\u2019s proof in this case was sufficient, and the trial court properly denied the MJOA.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">We turn to defendant\u2019s constitutional vagueness challenge. Defendant argues first that the term \u201cpersistent involvement\u201d is innately vague and, thus, fails to give fair notice to potentially affected citizens and to afford adequate guidance for its principled application. Even assuming without deciding defendant\u2019s first premise,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that argument fails because the content of \u201cpersistent involvement\u201d can be readily ascertained from published substantive law. <em>See State v. Illig-Renn, </em>341 Or 228, 240-42, 142 P3d 62 (2006). There is nothing unconstitutionally vague about \u201cpersistent involvement\u201d as construed in Bray.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Defendant further argues that, in all events, the \u201cmalevolent quality\u201d aspect introduced by <em>Kennedy </em>renders \u201cpersistent involvement\u201d impermissibly vague. Again, to the extent that defendant\u2019s arguments simply attack our preBray decisions, Bray is dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b277-8\"> We note that textual ambiguity and unconstitutional vagueness are hardly congruent concepts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
