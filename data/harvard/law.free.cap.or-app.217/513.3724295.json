J.</author>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">This is a blended proceeding in which the trial court established dependency jurisdiction over child and both parents after having denied father\u2019s motion for a judgment of nonpaternity under Oregon Laws 2005, chapter 160, section 9, and for dismissal as to father.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court denied father\u2019s motion on the ground that, under ORS 109.070(l)(a) (2001), he was conclusively presumed to be the father of child, and the 2005 legislation did not authorize the court to disestablish his paternity. Father appeals, and we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Child was born on April 24, 2002. At the time of child\u2019s birth, mother and father were married but were no longer living together. However, mother and father were cohabiting at the time child was conceived. In January 2007, the Department of Human Services (DHS) filed a petition seeking to establish juvenile court dependency jurisdiction over child and both parents. Mother admitted certain allegations of the petition, and the court took jurisdiction over her and child. On March 27, father filed a motion for a judgment of nonpaternity and dismissal based on Oregon Laws 2005, chapter 160, section 9. Among other assertions, father stated in an affidavit supporting the motion that he had never had a relationship with child and that a DNA report issued in March 2007 showed a zero percent probability that he was child\u2019s biological parent. However, father did not assert that he was sterile or impotent at the time child was conceived.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Mother objected to father\u2019s motion on several grounds, and the court held a hearing. Child\u2019s attorney and the attorney for DHS appeared at the hearing but took no position on father\u2019s motion. Over mother\u2019s objection, the trial court determined that, even though child was born in Washington, Oregon law applied to the issue before the court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the court concluded that the law in effect at the time of child\u2019s birth, ORS 109.070 (2001), not the 2005 legislation, was controlling and that, under the 2001 version <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>of the statute, father was conclusively presumed to be child\u2019s biological parent. As a consequence, the court did not address father\u2019s motion on its evidentiary merits, nor did the court address mother\u2019s additional argument that father was precluded by laches from challenging his paternity because he had failed to avail himself of an earlier opportunity to do so in 2003. Father appeals from the judgment denying his motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Father\u2019s appeal presents an issue of statutory construction involving the interaction of several statutes, including different versions of some of those statutes. At the time of child\u2019s birth, ORS 109.070 (2001) provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">\u201c(1) The paternity of a person may be established as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">\u201c(a) The child of a wife cohabiting with her husband who was not impotent or sterile at the time of the conception of the child shall be conclusively presumed to be the child of her husband, whether or not the marriage of the husband and wife may be void.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">By contrast, ORS 109.070(l)(b) (2001) provided a \u201cdisputable presumption\u201d that a husband is the father of a child when the \u201cchild [is] born in wedlock, there being no decree of separation from bed or board, * * * whether or not the marriage of the husband and wife may be void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">In 2005, the legislature enacted Oregon Laws 2005, chapter 160, which became effective on January 1,2006. Section 9 of that chapter provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\">\u201c(1) As used in this section, \u2018legal father\u2019 includes a man whose paternity has been established under ORS 109.070(1) and a man who has been ordered to pay child support.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-10\">\u201c(2) After paternity has been established under ORS 109.070(1), if no blood tests, as defined in ORS 109.251, were performed to establish paternity, the mother or the legal father may petition the court to reopen the issue of paternity. The petitioner:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>\u201c(a) Must file the petition within two years after a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity is filed with the State Registrar of the Center for Health Statistics;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-4\">\u201c(b) Must file the petition within two years after paternity is established as a result of a default order or a default judgment that is no longer subject to appeal; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-5\">\u201c(c) May file the petition at any time if the legal father is the presumed father under ORS 109.070.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">\u201c(3) The petition must contain:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-7\">\u201c(a) An affidavit executed by the petitioner stating that the petitioner has discovered new evidence since paternity was established or that the legal father is the presumed father and the petitioner has not had an opportunity to challenge the paternity; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-8\">\u201c(b) the results of blood tests, administered within 90 days before the petition is filed, that show a zero percent probability that the legal father is the biological father of the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">In addition, subsection (7) of section 9 provides that, in a proceeding initiated by a petition filed in accordance with subsections (2) and (3), \u201c[t]he court shall make a determination of nonpaternity if* * *, based on all the evidence as provided in ORS 109.258,\u201d the court makes the findings specified in subsection (7)(a) - (g).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under section 10, section 9 \u201cis repealed on January 2, 2008.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>Section 11 of chapter 160, which also became effective on January 1, 2006, amended ORS 109.070(1) by deleting the conclusive-presumption-of-patemity provision of ORS 109.070(l)(a) (2001) and renumbering, but leaving in effect, the disputable-presumption-of-paternity provision of ORS 109.070(l)(b) (2001). As a consequence of section 11, ORS 109.070 (2005) provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-4\">\u201c(1) The paternity of a person may be established as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">\u201c(a) A child born in wedlock, there being no judgment of separation from bed or board, is presumed to be the child of the mother\u2019s husband, whether or not the marriage of the husband and wife may be void. This is a disputable presumption.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">However, section 17 of chapter 160 amended \u201cORS 109.070, as amended by section 11,\u201d by restoring the conclusive-presumption-of-patemity provision of the 2001 version of that statute. Under section 23 of chapter 160, the section 17 amendments were to become \u201coperative on January 2, 2008,\u201d that is, the same day on which section 9 was repealed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>The text and context of Oregon Laws 2005, chapter 160, section 9, demonstrate a legislative intent to afford relief under that section to a \u201clegal father\u201d for purposes of ORS 109.070(1) without regard to whether the child was born before the effective date of section 9 or whether paternity was established by the statutory presumptions in effect before that date. For example, section 9 provides that \u201cthe legal father may petition the court to reopen the issue of paternity\u201d and that a person who is the \u201clegal father\u201d because he is the \u201cpresumed\u201d father \u201cunder ORS 109.070\u201d \u201c[m]ay file the petition at any time.\u201d In addition, section 9 does not distinguish between men who are \u201cpresumed father[s]\u201d by operation of the statutory disputable presumption and those who are \u201cpresumed father [s]\u201d by operation of the statutory conclusive presumption. Furthermore, unlike section 17, section 9 does not specify that the references in section 9 to \u201cORS 109.070\u201d or \u201cORS 109.070(1)\u201d mean those provisions, \u201cas amended by section 11.\u201d Finally, if section 9 were intended to apply only to men who became \u201cpresumed father [s]\u201d after the effective date of the 2005 legislation, its provisions would be redundant in significant part. That is so because section 11 \u2014 which eliminated the conclusive presumption of paternity under subsection (l)(a) of ORS 109.070 and retained the disputable presumption of paternity under subsection (l)(b) \u2014 was in effect for the same period of time that section 9 was in effect, that is, from January 1, 2006 until January 2, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">The trial court ruled that, notwithstanding section 9, father could not seek to reopen the issue of paternity of child, who was born in 2002, because \u201c[ORS 109.070(l)(a) (2001)] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>operates as a conclusive presumption that [father] is the legal father of this child [.]\u201d However, as noted, subsection (2) of section 9 expressly provides that, \u201cafter paternity has been established under ORS 109.070(1), if no blood tests, as defined in ORS 109.251, were performed to establish paternity, * * * the legal father may petition the court to reopen the issue of paternity,\u201d and, \u201cif the legal father is the presumed father under ORS 109.070,\u201d he \u201c[m]ay file the petition at any time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Father is the \u201cpresumed [legal] father\u201d of the child by operation of either the presumption established by ORS 109.070(l)(a) (2001) or the presumption established by ORS 109.070(l)(a) (2005), no blood tests previously were performed to establish paternity, he timely filed a motion to reopen the issue of paternity, and the juvenile court had authority under ORS 419B.395 to enter a judgment of non-paternity. Accordingly, the trial court erred in denying father\u2019s motion for entry of a judgment of nonpaternity without first considering the merits of his request under section 9.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-7\"> The trial court was authorized to determine child\u2019s paternity in the context of this dependency proceeding pursuant to ORS 419B.395.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b545-8\"> That aspect of the trial court\u2019s decision is not before us on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b546-11\"> Although mother\u2019s and child\u2019s trial counsel were served with father\u2019s notice of appeal, neither mother nor child has appeared on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b547-10\"> Subsection (7) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-11\">\u201cThe court shall make a determination of nonpaternity if the court finds, based on all the evidence as provided in ORS 109.258, that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-12\">\u201c(a) The blood tests were properly conducted and documented;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-13\">\u201c(b) The legal father is not the biological father of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-14\">\u201c(c) The legal father has not adopted the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-15\">\u201c(d) The child was not conceived by artificial insemination while the legal father and the mother were married;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-16\">\u201c(e) The petitioner has not acted to prevent the biological father from asserting his parental rights;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-17\">\u201c(f) The petitioner, with knowledge that the legal father is not the biological father, has not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-18\">\u201c(A) Taken any action to affirm the legal father\u2019s parentage of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abh\">and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-20\">\u201c(B) Failed to respond to a judicial or administrative proceeding to establish paternity after receipt of proper notice and an opportunity to be heard; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOW\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>\u201c(g) In the absence of fraud, granting the petition would not cause undue harm to the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Subsection (8) of section 9 contains additional proof requirements that are not pertinent here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b548-11\"> In fact, section 17 itself was effectively repealed before it could take effect by Oregon Laws 2007, chapter 454, section 1, which further amends ORS 109.070, effective January 1,2008, to provide, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-12\">\u201c(1) The paternity of a person may be established as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-13\">\u201c(a) A man is rebuttably presumed to be the father of a child born to a woman if he and the woman were married to each other at the time of the child\u2019s birth, without a judgment of separation, regardless of whether the marriage is void.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-14\">The Oregon Law Commission drafted and developed the 2007 amendment. Although not at issue here, the rationale for the complex evolution of ORS 109.070(l)(a) is best explained in the report of the Commission\u2019s \u201cUniform Parentage Act Work Group.\u201d The 2007 amendment to ORS 109.070 reflected the Commission\u2019s view that \u201cgiven the availability of relatively inexpensive, reliable genetic testing, the absolute rule that a husband is father of his wife\u2019s children no longer expresses sound public policy and that only the rebuttable presumption should continue to be part of Oregon law.\u201d <em>Biennial Report of the Oregon Law Commission, </em>2005-2007,85. The Commission explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-15\">\u201cThe 2005 legislature amended SB 234, the bill regarding paternity in juvenile court that was developed by the OLC, to include changes regarding paternity disestablishment. These changes are effective only through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>January 2, 2008, because the legislature knew that this work group was going to reexamine the issues. The work group considered simply recommending that the changes be made permanent but decided to rethink the issues instead.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 91-92. And the Commission did rethink the requirements for rebuttal of the presumption of paternity. Effective January 1,2008, ORS 109.070(3) provides that, \u201c[i]f the court finds that it is just and equitable, giving consideration to the interests of the parties and the child, the court shall admit evidence offered to rebut the presumption of paternity in subsection (l)(a) or (b) of this section.\u201d Subsection (7) of chapter 454, section 9, provides additional proof requirements for vacating or setting aside a \u201cpaternity determination of [a] paternity judgment,\u201d and section 10 provides that \u201c[sjection 9 of this 2007 Act applies to all paternity judgments, as defined in section 9 of this 2007 Act, entered before, on or after the effective date of this 2007 Act.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b550-6\"> The trial court will have an opportunity to make any necessary factual determinations on remand.
