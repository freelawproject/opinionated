Ruggles, </em>214 Or App 612, 167 P3d 471 (2007), in which we held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to require additional chain-of-custody foundational evidence for admission of a blood alcohol testing report and that admission of that report through a witness certifying its content did not violate defendant\u2019s rights to confront witnesses under the state and federal constitutions. Defendant asserts that we misstated his assignment of error and that his constitutional claims go to the right to cross-examine the laboratory technologists who stored and tested his blood sample. We allow reconsideration and adhere to our opinion as modified below.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">As set out in the opinion, defendant was arrested for the crime of driving while under the influence of intoxicants, ORS 813.010. A specimen of his blood was taken to test for alcohol content and sent by the sampling hospital to Oregon Medical Laboratories (OML), a private, certified laboratory. A number of technologists stored and divided the specimen, prepared a sample for testing, and physically conducted the test. Following that physical test, the detector generated a printout of information about the alcohol content of the sample. That printout was restated in a short report to the hospital. The report set out the identification number of the sample, defendant\u2019s name and social security number, the dates on which the blood was drawn, received, and tested, the nature of the test (\u201clegal blood alcohol\u201d), and the results of the testing (\u201cethanol positive at 0.113 g/dL\u201d as \u201cconfirmed by gas chromatography\u201d). The report was signed by Andrew Mollahan, as having been \u201creviewed by\u201d him as the \u201ccertifying scientist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Before trial, defendant moved for an order \u201cdenying introduction of the State\u2019s proposed evidence regarding [defendant\u2019s] blood sample.\u201d The stated bases for the motion were that a \u201cproper foundation cannot be laid for the blood sample\u201d and \u201c[u]nder ORS 40.505 (OEC 901), the State cannot authenticate the blood sample\u201d without the testimony of all of the OML technologists who handled and tested the specimen. At the pretrial hearing on the motion, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>added the contention that his \u201cright to confrontation, to confront his witnesses\u201d includes \u201cthe people who tested the blood.\u201d The trial court denied the motion to exclude evidence regarding the blood sample. Defendant reiterated his \u201cprevious objection\u201d when the state sought to introduce the testing report at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">On appeal, defendant framed two assignments of error with regard to the admission of the laboratory report on the blood sample: that the admission of the report violated defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to confront witnesses and that the \u201cstate failed to provide adequate documentation of the chain of custody\u201d of the blood specimen. In support of the first assignment of error, defendant contended that \u201cadmission of the laboratory report violated defendant\u2019s right to confront witnesses\u201d and that the report itself \u201ccontained statements made by persons who were not available for cross-examination at trial.\u201d In his discussion of that assignment of error, defendant claimed that the. state failed to call witnesses who conducted the tests of the blood sample and that the failure to call those witnesses infringed on his right to confront the witnesses under the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Our opinion concluded that the report summarized Mollahan\u2019s personal observations of the readings generated by the testing device and that the report did not contain hearsay statements by other witnesses. 214 Or App at 619. Thus, its admission into evidence through the testimony of Mollahan did not implicate the confrontation clauses of the state and federal constitutions. In his petition for reconsideration, defendant asserts that we erred in concluding that Mollahan observed the results of the testing device and that his constitutional arguments, which pertained to Mollahan\u2019s foundational testimony about the procedures used by the laboratory to store and test defendant\u2019s blood sample, were unaddressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Mollahan testified that he reviewed the \u201cfinal data\u201d of the testing process and \u201cthe results of all of the tests.\u201d At the pretrial hearing, he specified that this information included a \u201cprintout\u201d from the testing device that was \u201cthe hard data, the actual data.\u201d As stated in our opinion, the report\u2019s recitation of the testing results is based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Mollahan\u2019s observations of the content of readings generated by a machine. The report does not recite the testimony of out-of-court declarants so as to raise issues about the right to confront witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">At trial, defendant did not object to Mollahan\u2019s testimony about the OML protocols used to store and test defendant\u2019s blood sample. Consequently, defendant did not preserve his objection that Mollahan\u2019s testimony about the testing procedures violated his right to confront the OML technologists who conducted those procedures. We decline defendant\u2019s invitation to address an argument that was not preserved or briefed. <em>Trotter v. Santos, </em>214 Or App 696, 167 P3d 488 (2007) (improper to address on reconsideration arguments not made in the briefing of a case).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">At trial, defendant did object to the admission of the testing report. On appeal, defendant\u2019s assignment of error largely complained about the receipt of the report into evidence. In that context, defendant argued in his opening brief that, without the testimony of the technologists, his rights to confront those witnesses were violated. Defendant\u2019s confrontation rights are implicated by the admission of evidence of an out-of-court declaration, not the failure to obtain the testimony of a particular witness. As noted in the opinion, the state and federal constitutional guarantees \u201climit the admissibility of out-of-court statements or declarations against a criminal defendant.\u201d <em>Ruggles, </em>214 Or App at 618. Defendant\u2019s confrontation rights were not violated by evidence that was not introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">We grant reconsideration to withdraw our conclusion that the testing report was not hearsay. Mollahan\u2019s trial testimony about the results of the testing was not hearsay for the reasons stated in the opinion. The report itself, however, was an out-of-court statement made by Mollahan and offered to prove the truth of the testing machine reading and is properly classified as hearsay under OEC 801(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Our conclusion that the \u201cwritten report was not a hearsay statement\u201d was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>incorrect. That error does not change the constitutional analysis. Assuming that the report was testimonial in nature, defendant was given the opportunity at trial to confront its author. That is all that the constitutions require.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">Reconsideration allowed; former opinion modified and adhered to as modified.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-7\"> The state also questions our characterization of the report as a \u201cstatement! ] made at trial.\u201d We agree that the report was written prior to trial and not made \u201cat trial.\u201d Our observation should have been that the report was introduced at trial, through-Mollahan\u2019s testimony, as a summary of his personal observations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
