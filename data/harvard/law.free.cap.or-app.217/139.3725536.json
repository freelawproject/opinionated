Defendant raises six assignments of error. We address the first assignment of error, that the trial court erred in failing to suppress evidence of defendant\u2019s inculpatory statements made to the police, and reject the other assignments of error without discussion. We affirm because any error in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Defendant was convicted of sexually abusing a five-year-old girl. He had been regularly employed to babysit the victim and her siblings. The victim reported the abuse to her mother, who reported the accusation to the Portland Police Bureau. The assigned officer, Detective Gossen, met with defendant at his former foster mother\u2019s home. Defendant agreed to move the interview to the police station because that setting was more private.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Defendant was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights at the station. After questioning defendant about his background, Gossen described the interview as \u201cconfidential.\u201d He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Did you ask him how he had first heard about the allegations against him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">\u201c[GOSSEN]: Well, he had told me he had a conversation with [the son of the victim\u2019s mother], but he also relayed that [his foster mother] had received a letter from the Department of Human Services basically telling him that his services were no longer required at the [victim\u2019s mother\u2019s] home. The content or context of that letter, I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: What was the next topic of conversation between the two of you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">\u201c[GOSSEN]: Well, I told [defendant] that I \u2014 He had shared with me, [his foster mother] had received the letter, and I told him I had no plans on talking with [his foster mother], because <em>our </em>\u2014 our <em>investigation and our interview was confidential. </em>I asked him if he knew what [confidential] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>meant, and he told me that confidential was an adjective, and no one else was going to find out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">(Emphasis added.) Over the course of the interview', defendant made inculpatory admissions about the abuse allegations. Defendant was later charged with three counts of sexual abuse in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence of the admissions made in defendant\u2019s police interview. Following a trial that included testimony of the victim and her mother, the court made oral findings and convicted defendant of two of the sexual abuse charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Article I, section 12, of the Oregon Constitution and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution separately preclude the use of a defendant\u2019s involuntary statements to the state in a criminal trial of that defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant contends that his admissions were involuntary and that the failure to suppress evidence of those admissions violates his rights against self-incrimination under those provisions. Defendant categorizes his admissions as involuntary as a matter of law because they were induced by a promise of confidentiality, and involuntary as a matter of fact because the circumstances of defendant\u2019s interrogation were sufficiently compelling. Defendant also asserts that Gossen\u2019s representation of confidentiality vitiated the <em>Miranda </em>warning that defendant\u2019s statements could be used against him in court and therefore precluded that use.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The state asserts that Gossen\u2019s representation of confidentiality was understood to be a narrow promise to keep the content of the interview secret from defendant\u2019s foster mother. Because that representation was not a broader <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>promise of confidentiality, the state maintains that the making of that representation did not induce defendant\u2019s confession and, in light of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings that defendant was given and understood, the incriminating evidence was not compelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">Defendant would not be aided even if his constitutional claims were correct. Any error in admitting his incriminating admissions was harmless. Under the Oregon Constitution, an error is harmless if there is little likelihood that the error affected the verdict. <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003). Under the United States Constitution, a constitutional error is harmless if the court concludes beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the factfinder\u2019s decision. <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 US 18, 24, 87 S Ct 824, 17 L Ed 2d 705 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">After making oral findings on the credibility of the victim and her mother and the weight of their testimony, the court rendered its verdict:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">\u201cBased upon what I have observed from [the testimony of the victim and the victim\u2019s mother], I would be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of [defendant\u2019s] guilt. However, his statements are solid corroboration of the evidence * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Thus, the trial court explicitly found that it would have convicted defendant of the charges against him, whether or not his statements had been introduced into evidence, because the testimony of the victim and the victim\u2019s mother had convinced the court of defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Given that express finding, we conclude that any potential constitutional error in admitting defendant\u2019s statements was harmless because it did not affect the trial court\u2019s \u2014 that is, the factfinder\u2019s \u2014 decision. Therefore, resolution of defendant\u2019s constitutional claims is not necessary to our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b168-8\"> Article I, section 12, of the Oregon Constitution provides, in part, that \u201c[n]o person shall be * * * compelled in any criminal prosecution to testify against himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in part, that \u201c[n]o person * * * shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides, in part, \u201cnor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
