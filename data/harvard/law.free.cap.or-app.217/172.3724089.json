J.</author>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Petitioner sought review of an order from the Oregon Department of Transportation, Driver and Motor Vehicle Services Division (DMV), in circuit court. The circuit court reviewed the order as a final order in other than a contested case pursuant to ORS 183.484 and rejected petitioner\u2019s challenges. On appeal, petitioner asserts eight claims of error. However, we write to address only whether petitioner is entitled to a contested case proceeding. Because we conclude that petitioner is entitled to a contested case proceeding, we vacate the circuit court\u2019s judgment and remand the case to DMV.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Petitioner was involved in an automobile accident. The person who struck petitioner\u2019s vehicle, a 1981 Datsun, was insured by North Pacific Insurance Company. After admitting liability on behalf of its insured, North Pacific determined that petitioner\u2019s vehicle was a \u201ctotal loss\u201d based on \u201cthe Actual Cash Value of [the] vehicle at the time of the loss as compared to the Repair cost to repair [the] vehicle safely to pre-loss condition.\u201d As required by Oregon statute, North Pacific notified DMV of its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">In response to North Pacific\u2019s notification, DMV placed a \u201cflag 15\u201d on its records of petitioner\u2019s title pursuant to ORS 819.030 and ORS 801.527. A \u201cflag 15\u201d is a DMV internal notice indicating that a vehicle has been declared a total loss and that no ownership information involving the vehicle has been received by DMV. In late June, DMV sent petitioner a letter, in response to her queries, informing her that ORS 819.030 required it to cancel her title and registration upon receiving notification that the vehicle had been declared a total loss. A \u201ctotaled\u201d vehicle is defined as \u201c[a] vehicle that is declared a total loss by an insurer that is obligated to cover the loss or that the insurer takes possession of or title to.\u201d ORS 801.527(1). Petitioner then sent a letter to DMV in early July requesting a contested case proceeding under the Oregon Administrative Procedures Act (APA) regarding whether her vehicle was properly declared \u201ctotaled.\u201d She additionally requested reconsideration of the June letter, asserting, \u201cI should be afforded a right to the review of your flagging of my vehicular records.\u201d In its response, DMV <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>refused her request for a contested case proceeding and reiterated that \u201c[n]o further registration will be issued to the vehicle until the vehicle has been retitled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Petitioner sought judicial review of DMV\u2019s actions in circuit court, asserting that she was entitled to a contested case proceeding before DMV. Petitioner asserted, in part, that DMV\u2019s actions violated applicable law and were unconstitutional. Petitioner filed her petition for judicial review on September 9, 2002, 74 days after DMV sent the June letter and 60 days after DMV sent the July response. The circuit court concluded that DMV\u2019s June letter was an \u201c \u2018other than contested case\u2019 order\u201d and that the petition for review of that order was timely filed. Specifically, the court reasoned that the petition was timely filed because petitioner\u2019s July letter requesting a contested case proceeding also requested reconsideration of DMV\u2019s June order. Thus, in its view, the filing deadline was extended to September 9, 60 days after service of DMV\u2019s July order denying reconsideration. After review, the circuit court entered a judgment dismissing North Pacific as a party for misjoinder and affirming DMV\u2019s order. Petitioner appeals from that judgment, arguing, in part, that she was entitled to a contested case proceeding before DMV.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Before discussing the issues raised on appeal in depth, we make some general observations. ORS 183.484 confers jurisdiction of judicial review of final orders of an agency in \u201cother than contested cases\u201d in the circuit court. But, if petitioner\u2019s argument that she was entitled to a contested case proceeding before DMV is correct, then the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to review the case because ORS 183.482 confers initial jurisdiction for judicial review of contested cases in this court only. That would mean that the circuit court\u2019s rulings are nullities because of lack of jurisdiction and that petitioner challenged DMV\u2019s actions in the wrong court. However, under ORS 14.165(1),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> this court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>jurisdiction even if the petition for judicial review was improperly filed in circuit court. <em>Wheaton v. Kulongoski, </em>209 Or App 355, 369, 147 P3d 1163 (2006). Under the terms of ORS 14.165(7),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> if a party wrongly files an action or proceeding in either the circuit court or this court, and does so reasonably and without prejudicing an adverse interest or the public interest, the tribunal with authority to decide the case is not deprived of jurisdiction to decide it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As in <em>Wheaton, </em>this case comes to us through a timely filed notice of appeal of the circuit court judgment, but, if petitioner is entitled to a contested case proceeding, that proceeding has not been provided by the agency.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under the circumstances, the appropriate disposition for this court would be to vacate the circuit court judgment and give petitioner the relief she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>would have received had she sought timely review from a contested case order in this court \u2014 a remand to the agency to offer petitioner the opportunity for a contested case proceeding. <em>Wheaton, </em>209 Or App at 371. Based on the above framework, there are two issues that we must decide to determine whether we should remand for a contested case proceeding: first, whether DMV\u2019s letters are \u201cfinal orders\u201d for purposes of a contested case; and second, whether petitioner was entitled to a contested case proceeding regarding those orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">The APA provides judicial review only for <em>final </em>orders, unless it is demonstrated that the agency is \u201cproceeding without probable cause\u201d or that \u201cthe party will suffer substantial and irreparable harm if interlocutory relief is not granted.\u201d ORS 183.480(3). An order is \u201cany agency action expressed orally or in writing directed to a named person or named persons, other than employees, officers or members of an agency.\u201d ORS 183.310(6)(a). A <em>final </em>order embodies \u201cfinal agency action expressed in writing[,]\u201d but not including any \u201ctentative or preliminary agency declaration or statement that * * * [p] recedes final agency action; or * * * [d]oes not preclude further agency consideration of the subject matter of the statement or declaration.\u201d ORS 183.310(6)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">In that light, we turn to the facts of this case. DMV\u2019s June letter was sent to petitioner \u201cin response to [petitioner\u2019s] questions regarding North Pacific Insurance Company declaring [her] vehicle as \u2018totaled.\u2019 \u201d That letter explained that \u201c[n]o further registration will be issued to the vehicle until the vehicle has been retitled.\u201d Petitioner responded, in her July letter, with a request for a contested case proceeding: \u201cI * * * formally request in writing that I be afforded either an administrative appeal from or a contested hearing on the third-party totaling of my vehicle by North Pacific Insurance Company * * Petitioner additionally requested reconsideration of the decision made in DMV\u2019s June letter: \u201cI should be afforded a right to the review of your flagging of my vehicular records * * DMV\u2019s July response to petitioner\u2019s requests stated, \u201cWe are unable to comply with your request for a contested case hearing regarding your vehicle being declared a \u2018totaled\u2019 vehicle,\u201d and it reiterated that \u201c[n]o further registration will be issued to the vehicle until the vehicle has been retitled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number> We conclude that both letters are \u201corders\u201d within the statutory definition because they express agency action in writing directed to a named person. Specifically, the June letter informed petitioner of DMV\u2019s decision that her title was subject to cancellation and that \u201c[n] o further registration will be issued to the vehicle until the vehicle has been retitled.\u201d And, the June letter constituted a <em>final </em>order because the above statement \u201cpreclude [d] further agency consideration of the subject matter of the statement or declaration.\u201d ORS 183.310(6)(b). That is, the June letter informed petitioner in part that no further agency action would take place to determine whether she would be allowed to renew her registration. When petitioner requested a contested case proceeding in response to that letter, DMV\u2019s July response informed her unequivocally that \u201c[w]e are unable to comply with your request for a contested case hearing * *</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">We now turn to the issue of whether petitioner was entitled to a contested case proceeding. A proceeding is a contested case proceeding if it satisfies one of four definitions set forth in ORS 183.310(2)(a) and does not fall within the definitional exception in ORS 183.310(2)(b). A contested case includes a proceeding before an agency</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\">\u201c[i]n which the individual legal rights, duties or privileges of specific parties are required by statute or Constitution to be determined only after an agency hearing at which such specific parties are entitled to appear and be heard [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">ORS 183.310(2)(a)(A). It is important to note that the characterization of the DMV order as either a \u201ccontested case\u201d order or an \u201corder [ ] [in] other than [a] contested case[ ]\u201d depends not on whether the agency actually provided petitioner with a contested case proceeding, but on whether the agency was required by a statutory provision to do so. <em>Patton v. St. Bd. Higher Ed., </em>293 Or 363, 366-67, 647 P2d 931 (1982); <em>Wheaton, </em>209 Or App at 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">In this case, petitioner has a right to a contested case proceeding under ORS 183.310(2)(a)(A) because ORS 809.100 requires a hearing when the Department of Transportation proposes to cancel or refuses to renew a vehicle\u2019s title or registration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>\u201cWhen the Department of Transportation proposes to cancel or refuse to issue or renew title or registration, opportunity for hearing shall be accorded as provided in ORS chapter 183.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">ORS 809.100(1). Here, both the June and July letters unequivocally stated that DMV was canceling petitioner\u2019s title and would not renew her registration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In sum, the plain text of ORS 809.100, when read together with ORS 183.310(2)(a)(A), would appear to compel the conclusion that DMV was required to provide the requested contested case proceeding after taking the above actions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See PGE v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number><em>Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610, 859 P2d 1143 (1993) (the first step in statutory construction is to consider the text and context of the statute); <em>see also Wheaton, </em>209 Or App at 361 (concluding that ORS 411.095(3) together with ORS 183.310(2)(a)(A) provide a right to a contested case proceeding because ORS 411.095(3) states that, in certain situations, the Department of Human Services \u201cshall provide an opportunity for a hearing under ORS chapter 183\u201d); OAR 461-025-0310(l)(n) (a petitioner has the right to a contested case proceeding when \u201c[t]he right to a hearing is otherwise provided by statute or rule\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Nevertheless, it could be argued that ORS 183.310(2)(b) excludes the proceeding at issue from the definition of a contested case. That subsection carves out from the definition of contested cases \u201cproceedings in which an agency decision rests solely on the result of a test.\u201d ORS 183.310(2)(b). Specifically, it could be argued that DMAs order \u201crests solely on the result of a test\u201d because ORS 801.527 limits DMAs inquiry to whether or not the Datsun was \u201cdeclared a total loss by an insurer that is obligated to cover the loss * *</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\"> To determine the scope of the statutory exception, it is necessary to apply the statutory construction methodology set forth in <em>PGE: </em>first, we examine the statutory text in context to determine if it is ambiguous; second, if the statutory \u25a0text is ambiguous, we examine the legislative history to resolve the ambiguity; and third, if the statutory text remains ambiguous, then we resort to canons of construction. 317 Or at 610-12. \u201cAmbiguity\u201d is a term of art that means there are at least two reasonable interpretations of the statutory terms. <em>State v. Cooper, </em>319 Or 162, 167, 874 P2d 822 (1994). A \u201creasonable interpretation\u201d is an interpretation that is not \u201cwholly implausible.\u201d <em>Owens v. MVD, </em>319 Or 259, 268, 875 P2d 463 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">In the first stage of our statutory construction analysis, we conclude that the use of the word \u201ctest\u201d in ORS 183.310(2)(b) is ambiguous because there are two reasonable interpretations. In construing the text and context, we first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>look to the \u201cplain, natural, and ordinary meaning\u201d of words. <em>PGE, </em>317 Or at 611. First, in ordinary usage, the word \u201ctest\u201d could describe any type of standardized analysis. <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>2361-62 (unabridged ed 2002) (a \u201ctest\u201d is \u201can act or process that reveals inherent qualities\u201d). Using that definition, the statutory procedure to determine whether a vehicle is totaled falls squarely within the exception from a contested case proceeding. Alternatively, the ordinary usage of \u201ctest\u201d could refer to a standardized test of a person\u2019s qualifications \u2014 such as the bar examination. <em>Id. </em>(a \u201ctest\u201d is also \u201ca technique for measuring objectively an individual\u2019s personal characteristics, potentialities, or accomplishments\u201d). Under that definition of the word \u201ctest,\u201d the procedure used by DMV to \u201ctotal\u201d a vehicle would fall outside the scope of the exception and entitle petitioner to a contested case proceeding. Because neither interpretation is \u201cwholly implausible,\u201d we proceed to the second stage of statutory construction \u2014 the legislative history underlying ORS 183.310(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">The legislative history of ORS 183.310(2)(b) resolves the ambiguity. In a discussion by Subcommittee Three of the House Judiciary Committee, a question was posed as to whether the word \u201ctest\u201d was intended to mean a \u201cwritten examination.\u201d Tape Recording, House Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee 3, HB 2497, Apr 5, 1979, Tape 38, Side 2. Chairman Frohnmayer explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">\u201cthe word comes from the Federal APA which excluded proceedings based upon test, inspections. * * * The reason is that * * * the best way to determine whether or not the person has failed the test is to retake the test or inspection and not to use a proceeding which is an adversary adjudicatory factfinding model to redetermine that issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-6\"><em>Id. </em>Thus, the legislative history indicates that the legislature intended the scope of the exception set out in ORS 183.310(2)(b) to be limited to the circumstances when \u201cthe best way to determine whether or not the person has failed the test is to retake the test * * Here, there was no test that petitioner could retake to obtain the registration of her vehicle or to avoid the cancellation of her title; rather, DMV\u201d s decision was final.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>We conclude for the above reasons that DMV\u2019s June and July letters are final orders, that this court, pursuant to ORS 14.165(7), has jurisdiction to review those orders, and that petitioner is entitled to a contested case proceeding regarding those orders. However, because we do not have the benefit of a final administrative order issued after a contested case proceeding, the matter must be remanded to the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Judgment vacated; remanded to the circuit court with instructions to remand to Department of Transportation, Motor Vehicle Services Division.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b203-7\"> ORS 14.165(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-8\">\u201cIf an action or other proceeding against a public body is filed in circuit court and the circuit court does not have authority to decide the case, the circuit court shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-9\">\u201c(a) Transfer the case to the court or tribunal authorized by law to decide the case if the circuit court determines that another court or tribunal is authorized by law to decide the case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>\u201c(b) Refer the question to the Court of Appeals if the circuit court is in doubt whether there is another court or tribunal authorized by law to decide the case; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxI\">\u201c(c) Dismiss the action or proceeding if the circuit court determines that no other court or tribunal is authorized by law to decide the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b204-6\"> ORS 14.165(7) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\">\u201cIf an action or proceeding against a public body is filed in circuit court or the Court of Appeals based on a reasonable interpretation of law, and the circuit court or the Court of Appeals determines that the case should be transferred under this section, the case shall be transferred to the appropriate court or tribunal in the manner provided by this section and may not be dismissed as not being filed within the time allowed by law if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\">\u201c(a) Under the interpretation of law made by the person filing the action or proceeding, the action or proceeding was filed in the proper court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-9\">\u201c(b) Under the interpretation of law made by the person filing the action or proceeding, the action or proceeding was timely filed in the transferring court; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-10\">\u201c(c) Any delay caused by the failure to file the action or proceeding within the time allowed for filing in the receiving court or tribunal does not substantially prejudice an adverse interest or public interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b204-11\"> DMV does not argue that we are without jurisdiction to decide whether petitioner was entitled to a contested case proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b204-12\"> DMV argues that, if its letters are final orders in other than a contested case, the circuit court did not have jurisdiction to review the June letter because petitioner did not file a timely petition for judicial review of that letter and the circuit court\u2019s review of the July letter was limited to whether DMV erred in denying petitioner\u2019s request for a contested case proceeding. We conclude, however, that petitioner\u2019s appeal was timely for two reasons. First, it was timely because petitioner requested reconsideration of DMVs June order, thereby extending the filing date for judicial review to 60 days after service of the order denying reconsideration. ORS 183.484. Second, it was timely because the July letter\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s request for a contested case proceeding was an appealable final order and petitioner filed her petition for review within the 60 days allowed under ORS 183.484.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b207-5\"> Specifically, DMV\u2019s June letter stated, in part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">\u201cORS 819.030 requires DMV to comply with procedures, upon receiving notice that the vehicle has been declared totaled in accordance with the provisions of ORS 819.010, 819.012 or 819.014.
