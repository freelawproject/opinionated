J.</author>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Defendant, who was convicted after a jury trial of first-degree sodomy, ORS 163.405, appeals, challenging the imposition of an upward departure sentence. He argues that the aggravating factors on which the trial court predicated the upward departure sentence \u2014 \u201cprior criminal justice sanctions have not deterred defendant\u201d and \u201cdefendant has a history of institutional or prison disciplinary problems\u201d \u2014 are unconstitutionally vague. We reject those arguments and, consequently, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The circumstances material to our review are undisputed. Defendant was convicted by a jury of first-degree sodomy of a fellow inmate at Oregon State Penitentiary. In the sentencing phase, the court submitted to the jury the determination of two sentence enhancement facts: \u201cPrior criminal justice sanctions have not deterred defendant\u201d and \u201cdefendant has a history of institutional or prison disciplinary problems.\u201d In doing so, the court rejected defendant\u2019s arguments that those factors were unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">During the sentencing phase, the state presented evidence that defendant had, as a prison inmate, committed 49 \u201cmajor rule violations\u201d in the four years preceding the trial, including 11 such violations in the year preceding the trial. The state also introduced evidence of defendant\u2019s prior convictions, including a 1988 conviction for second-degree assault, multiple convictions in 1991 for first-degree arson, and convictions in 1991 and 1997 for possession of a weapon by an inmate. Ultimately, the jury returned special verdict findings that defendant met both aggravating factors, and the court, without a determination that either factor was an independently sufficient basis, imposed an upward departure sentence of 122 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">On appeal, defendant renews his arguments that the two aggravating factors applied in this case were unconstitutionally vague because they fail to afford \u201cfair warning\u201d to potentially affected citizens and were susceptible to arbitrary and unprincipled application.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The state responds that defendant\u2019s challenges are not reviewable under ORS 138.222 and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>in all events, fail on the merits. We reject the state\u2019s nonreviewability arguments, <em>see State v. Gallegos, </em>217 Or App 248, 174 P3d 1086 (2007),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but agree that defendant\u2019s challenges lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">We understand defendant\u2019s vagueness challenges to the two aggravating factors here to be \u201cfacial\u201d challenges.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> With respect to provisions that do not implicate rights protected under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, it is axiomatic that \u201c \u2018[o]ne to whose conduct a statute clearly applies may not successfully challenge it for vagueness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, </em>455 US 489, 495 n 7, 102 S Ct 1186, 71 L Ed 2d 362 (1982) (quoting <em>Parker v. Levy, </em>417 US 733, 756, 94 S Ct 2547, 41 L Ed 2d 439 (1974)); <em>see also Maynard v. Cartwright, </em>486 US 356, 361, 108 S Ct 1853, 100 L Ed 2d 372 (1988) (due process vagueness challenges \u201crest on the lack of notice, and hence may be overcome in any specific case where reasonable persons would know that their conduct is at risk\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">That principle is decisive here. Even assuming, without deciding, that the operative language of the two departure factors might, as applied in some circumstances, be vague,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> there can be no question that defendant falls within their indisputable core. Here, defendant committed his crime while incarcerated for other crimes; indeed, he had a lengthy criminal history. Given those circumstances, defendant cannot plausibly claim that he lacked fair notice that he could be subject to enhanced punishment because \u201c[p]rior criminal justice sanctions [had] not deterred\u201d him or that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>application of that standard to him was arbitrary. Similarly, given his institutional disciplinary record \u2014 nearly 50 \u201cmajor rule violations\u201d in the four years preceding the trial \u2014 defendant, quintessentially, \u201chas a history of institutional or prison disciplinary problems.\u201d In sum, the trial court properly rejected defendant\u2019s vagueness challenges and submitted the departure factors to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-8\"> Defendant notes, in passing, that neither of the aggravating factors at issue here is among the \u201cenumerated\u201d factors specifically listed in OAR 213-008-0002(l)(b). We do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>not understand defendant to contend, as did the defendant in <em>State v. Gallegos, </em>217 Or App 248, 174 P3d 1086 (2007), that the \u201cnonexclusive\u201d aspect of OAR 213-008-0002(1) renders that provision unconstitutionally vague. In all events, we rejected that argument in <em>Gallegos.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b271-7\"> The state\u2019s \u201cnonreviewability\u201d argument here is one of several nonreviewability arguments that the state posited in <em>Gallegos.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b271-8\"> For example, defendant contends that \u201cthe terms \u2018sanctions,\u2019 \u2018deterred,\u2019 \u201chistory,\u2019 \u2018institutional,\u2019 \u2018disciplinary,\u2019 and \u2018problems\u2019 are not defined by law (statute, rule, or case law), and the plain meaning of the words fails to elucidate their legal meaning.\u201d Consequently, defendant argues that those terms are, individually and collectively, vague.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b271-9\"> Again, as in <em>State v. Schenewerk, </em>217 Or App 243, 247 n 1, 174 P3d 1117 (2007), we note that \u201ctextual ambiguity and unconstitutional vagueness are hardly congruent concepts.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
