We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The underlying facts are undisputed. In 1990, the Washington County Sheriffs Office hired petitioner as a corrections officer and in 1991, DPSST issued him a basic corrections certificate. In late January 1999, petitioner failed a drug-screening test, testing positive for marijuana. He initially lied about the use, but later, during an internal investigation, admitted that he had used the drug over a period of 30 days between December 1998 and January 1999. In March 1999, the Sheriffs Office fired petitioner for the drug use and lying about that use.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The Washington County Police Officers\u2019 Association (association) contested petitioner\u2019s firing by filing a grievance under the collective bargaining agreement between the association and Washington County, ultimately prevailing before the Supreme Court in <em>Washington Cty. Police Assn. v. Washington Cty., </em>335 Or 198, 63 P3d 1167 (2003). In accord with our subsequent decision on remand from the Supreme Court, <em>Washington Cty. Police Assn. v. Washington Cty., </em>187 Or App 686, 69 P3d 767 (2003), the Sheriffs Office reinstated petitioner in June 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">In January 2004, DPSST issued a notice of intent to revoke petitioner\u2019s basic corrections certification,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleging that petitioner failed to meet minimum standards of moral fitness established under OAR 259-008-0010(6) (Dec 22, 2003) because of his drug use and dishonesty about that use in December 1998 and January 1999. After a hearing in December 2004, the administrative law judge concluded that petitioner failed to meet minimum standards of moral fitness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>established under OAR 259-008-0010(6) and that revocation was the appropriate remedy. DPSST thereafter issued a final order in January 2006 revoking petitioner\u2019s basic corrections certificate. ORS 181.662(l)(c); OAR 259-008-0070(3)(a)(C) (Apr 11, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">On appeal, petitioner assigns error to DPSST\u2019s issuance of the final order revoking his certification. In his primary argument,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> petitioner asserts that DPSST lacked authority to revoke his certification pursuant to ORS 181.662(l)(c) based on conduct that predated the enactment of the statute. He argues that, at the time of his conduct, DPSST did not have authority pursuant to the applicable statutes and rules to revoke his certification; further, he argues that DPSST could not apply ORS 181.662(l)(c) to conduct that had occurred before the statute\u2019s 1999 enactment. In response, DPSST counters that it had implicit authority to revoke petitioner\u2019s certification at the time of his conduct, based on the legislative directive to DPSST and the Board of Public Safety Standards and Training (BPSST) to promulgate \u201creasonable minimum standards\u201d for moral fitness. <em>See </em>ORS 181.640(l)(a) (1997); OAR 259-008-0010(5) (June 30, 1998). DPSST further argues that, given that implied grant of revocation authority, ORS 181.662(l)(c) was enacted in 1999 as a remedial \u201chousekeeping\u201d measure that made explicit DPSST\u2019s implicit authority to enforce its moral fitness standards and therefore was to be given retrospective effect. We affirm for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">We review for errors of law, ORS 183.482(8)(a), and begin by stating the relevant statutes and rules, both those that were in effect at the time of petitioner\u2019s conduct in late 1998 and early 1999, and those on which DPSST relied in making its decision. At the time of petitioner\u2019s conduct, ORS 181.640(1) (1997) provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">\u201c[T]o promote enforcement of law * * * services by improving the competence of public safety personnel and their support staffs, * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>\u201c(a) [DPSST] shall recommend and [BPSST] shall establish by rule reasonable minimum standards of physical, emotional, intellectual and moral fitness for * * * corrections officers * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><em>Id. </em>Accordingly, BPSST had promulgated the following standards:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\">\u201cMoral Fitness (Moral Character). All law enforcement officers must be of good moral fitness as determined by a thorough background investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">\u201c(a) For purposes of this standard, lack of good moral fitness means conduct not restricted to those acts that reflect moral turpitude but rather extending to acts and conduct which would cause a reasonable person to have substantial doubts about the individual\u2019s honesty, fairness, respect for the rights of others, or for the laws of the state and/or the nation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">\u201c(b) The following are indicators of a lack of good moral fitness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-8\">\u201c(A) Illegal conduct involving moral turpitude.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-9\">\u201c(B) Conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-10\">\u201c(C) Intentional deception or fraud or attempted deception or fraud in any application, examination, or other document for securing certification or eligibility for certification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-11\">\u201c(D) Conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-12\">\u201c(E) Conduct that adversely reflects on his or her fitness to perform as a law enforcement officer. Examples include but are not limited to: intoxication while on duty, untruthfulness, unauthorized absences from duty not involving extenuating circumstances, or a history of personal habits off the job which would affect the officer\u2019s performance on the job which makes the officer both inefficient and otherwise unfit to render effective service because of the agency\u2019s and/or public\u2019s loss of confidence in the officer\u2019s ability to perform competently.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>OAR 259-008-0010(5) (June 30, 1998).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the time of petitioners\u2019 conduct, neither ORS 181.640 (1997) nor OAR 259-008-0010(5) (June 30, 1998) specifically set out the consequences for failure to meet minimum standards of moral fitness. Furthermore, although ORS 181.640(l)(e)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> authorized DPSST to deny or revoke certification, neither ORS 181.662(1) (1997)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6nor DPSST\u2019s rule on denial and revocation, OAR 259-008-0070 (June 30,1998), stated that a failure to satisfy minimum standards of moral fitness was a ground for revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">In 1999, the legislature amended ORS 181.662(1) by adding paragraph (c), which provided, in part, that DPSST could deny or revoke a public safety officer\u2019s certification on a finding that \u201c[t]he public safety officer * * * does not meet the applicable minimum [moral fitness] standards\u201d established pursuant to ORS 181.640, in OAR 259-008-0010(6).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, the question here is, to the extent that DPSST\u2019s application of ORS 181.662(l)(c) to conduct that occurred in 1998 and 1999 can be properly characterized as \u201cretroactive,\u201d whether that application was permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\"> Retroactive application of a statute or rule is not impermissible <em>per se. Delehant v. Board on Police Standards, </em>317 Or 273, 278, 855 P2d 1088 (1993). To determine whether a statute applies retroactively, we look to the legislative intent, determined in the usual manner of construing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>intended meaning of statutes by examining the text in context and, if necessary, the legislative history and other aids to construction. <em>See Strizver v. Wilsey, </em>210 Or App 33, 37-38, 150 P3d 10 (2006), <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 474 (2007) (describing methodology) (citing <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Nicholls, </em>192 Or App 604, 609-10, 87 P3d 680 (2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">There is no text in ORS 181.662(l)(c) explicitly indicating that the legislature intended for DPSST to apply the statute retroactively; along those lines, we find no clear contextual indication that the legislature intended the statute to apply to conduct that occurred before the statute\u2019s enactment. Likewise, nothing in the legislative history informs our inquiry. Thus, we rely on the relevant maxims of statutory construction. <em>See Robert Camel Contracting, Inc. v. Krautscheid, </em>205 Or App 498, 502, 134 P3d 1065 (2006) (citing <em>Vloedman v. Cornell, </em>161 Or App 396, 400, 984 P2d 906 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">As applied here, the pertinent maxim is that the legislature is presumed to intend that retroactive effect be given to statutes that are \u201cremedial\u201d or \u201cprocedural,\u201d as opposed to \u201csubstantive,\u201d in nature. Id.; <em>Vloedman, </em>161 Or App at 400. A law is substantive when application of it will \u201cimpair existing rights, create new obligations or impose additional duties with respect to past transactions,\u201d whereas \u201cremedial\u201d statutes \u201cpertain to or affect a remedy.\u201d <em>Strizver, </em>210 Or App at 38 (citations omitted). For the following reasons, we conclude that ORS 181.662(l)(c) is remedial, and therefore, has retroactive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">As an initial matter, ORS 181.662(l)(c) is not substantive in nature because it does not \u201cimpair existing rights, create new obligations or impose additional duties with respect to past transactions.\u201d <em>Strizver, </em>210 Or App at 38. As of the time of petitioner\u2019s conduct, DPSST and BPSST were required, by statute, to set minimum standards of moral fitness for its officers. Through OAR 259-008-0010(5) (June 30, 1998), DPSST and BPSST set forth those standards. In applying those standards, DPSST looked at past conduct through a \u201cthorough background investigation.\u201d Among the factors that indicated below-standard moral fitness were \u201c[c]onduct involving dishonest/\u2019 and \u201c[c]onduct that adversely reflects on his or her fitness to perform as a law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>enforcement officer\u201d such as \u201ca history of personal habits off the job [that] would affect the officer\u2019s performance on the job [and that] makes the officer both inefficient and otherwise unfit to render effective service because of the agency\u2019s and/or public\u2019s loss of confidence in the officer\u2019s ability to perform competently.\u201d OAR 259-008-0010(5) (June 30, 1998). Pursuant to that rule, it is reasonable to conclude that petitioner\u2019s conduct \u2014 using marijuana over a one-month period and subsequently lying about that use \u2014 was forbidden at the time that he engaged in it; furthermore, it is reasonable to conclude that, implicit in its overall authority to manage the certification system, DPSST could enforce its rule by denying or revoking petitioner\u2019s certification. In other words, at the time of his conduct, petitioner did not have a substantive right to obtain or retain certification when his conduct fell below the minimum standards set forth by the rule. Thus, ORS 181.662(l)(c) does not affect petitioner\u2019s existing rights; it is not substantive in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">Rather, in this case, two factors lead us to conclude that ORS 181.662(l)(c) is remedial in nature. First, as explained above, the statutory scheme at the time of petitioner\u2019s conduct requiring DPSST to create and maintain minimum standards of moral fitness carried with it an implicit authority to enforce those standards. By enacting ORS 181.662(l)(c), the legislature simply made explicit DPSST\u2019s authority to revoke an officer\u2019s certification for failure to meet minimum standards of fitness. In effect, the statute \u201cpertain[s] to or affect[s] a remedy\u201d for DPSST by specifically providing an enforcement mechanism by which it may uphold the moral fitness standards that the legislature required it to create.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Second, we observe that the overall statutory scheme governing DPSST reflects an overarching legislative concern for ensuring public and officer safety. That concern is apparent in the legislative requirement for DPSST to improve and maintain minimum moral fitness standards for corrections officers. <em>See </em>ORS 181.640(l)(a) (requiring DPSST and BPSST to establish minimum standards of moral fitness \u201cto promote enforcement of law * * * services by improving the competence of public safety personnel\u201d); <em>see also Bailey v. Board on Police Standards, </em>100 Or App 739, 742, 788 P2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>1022 (1990) (recognizing BPSST\u2019s mandate to establish minimum moral fitness standards). In light of that legislative concern, it is unlikely that the legislature intended the statute to apply only prospectively, so as to shield any conduct that occurred before the enactment from DPSST\u2019s scrutiny. The statutory text makes no such differentiation, and we can find no other support for that suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Indeed, testimony accompanying the bill indicates that the legislature viewed the statute as a remedial measure. Originating as Senate Bill (SB) 345 (1999), ORS 181.662(l)(c) was enacted along with a series of provisions that were, in large part, \u201chousekeeping\u201d in nature, as a result of the growth of DPSST from its role as the police academy to the agency responsible for establishing standards of fitness for and training \u201cnearly all public safety disciplines.\u201d Testimony, Senate Judiciary Committee, SB 345, Feb 3,1999, Ex D at 1 (statement of DPSST Director Dianne Middle). In her written testimony supporting the bill, Middle said the following about the addition of paragraph (c) to ORS 181.662(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\"><em>\u201c[It] states the obvious </em>that a person will not be granted certification just because they went through training. They must be able to demonstrate satisfaction of minimum standards and the basic levels of proficiency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 3 (emphasis added). That commentary that the statute \u201cstates the obvious\u201d link between an officer\u2019s certification with his or her satisfaction of the minimum standards further supports our conclusion that the legislature viewed the statute as a remedial measure, in the sense that the 1999 change both made explicit what had been implicit in DPSST\u2019s authority to maintain and promulgate moral fitness standards and advanced the legislature\u2019s overarching concern for ensuring public and officer safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Hence, we conclude that, to the extent that an application of ORS 181.662(l)(c) to conduct occurring before its enactment can be characterized as retroactive, that application is proper because the statute is remedial in nature and, accordingly, has retroactive effect. DPSST did not err in revoking petitioner\u2019s certification under ORS 181.662(l)(c) based on conduct that occurred in 1998 and 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b324-8\"> That notice of intent to revoke petitioner\u2019s certification was the second issued by DPSST. It issued the first in July 2002 on the ground that petitioner had been terminated for cause from his employment. ORS 181.662(3); OAR 259-008-0070(l)(a) (July 5,2002). Petitioner requested a continuance of the matter until the completion of the appellate process in the case regarding his termination. DPSST took no further action on the July 2002 order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b325-7\"> Petitioner raises a total of five arguments. We discuss only his first argument and reject the remaining four without discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b327-6\"> As of the date of DPSST\u2019s notice of intent to revoke petitioner\u2019s basic corrections certification, that rule was renumbered without any substantive changes as OAR 259-008-0010(6) (Dec 22,2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b327-7\"> At that time, ORS 181.640(l)(e) (1997) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">\u201cThe department shall revoke certification in the manner provided in ORS 181.661 to 181.664.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b327-9\"> At that time, ORS 181.662(1) (1997) provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-10\">\u201c[DPSST] may deny or revoke the certification of any * * * corrections officer * * * based upon a finding that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-11\">\u201c(a) The officer * * * falsified any information submitted on the application for certification or on any documents submitted to [BPSST] or [DPSST].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-12\">\u201c(b) The officer * * * has been convicted of a crime in this state or any other jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b327-13\"> DPSST later amended its rule on denial and revocation for consistency with the statute. <em>See </em>OAR 259-008-0070(l)(a)(C) (Apr 11, 2003) (failure to meet minimum standards as a ground for denial and revocation).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
