The petition below was premised on the contention that the appellant was not advised of his right to counsel. The District Court found after hearing and consideration of the proceedings at the arraignment that the appellant \u201cwas fully apprised of his right to counsel and was, in fact, offered counsel by the presiding judge.\u201d That finding is amply sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">The appellant for the first time here makes the further contention that he was induced to plead guilty by inducement of Government agents. With respect to that contention it need only be said that it is settled that \u201cQuestions cannot be presented on appeal that have not first been determined by the District Court, from which the appeal is taken.\u201d Bush v. United States, 347 F.2d 231, 232 (6 Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-12\">The Order of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
