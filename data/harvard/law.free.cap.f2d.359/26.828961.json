A similar request to the New York Supreme Court was also denied. On May 14, 1965 appellant was released, upon his own recognizance, pending trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-18\">On March 8, 1965 appellant wrote a letter in which he urged the district court to \u201cintervene in my behalf * * * and see that I am granted a trial by jury.\u201d Appellant now claims that his request should have been construed as a request for injunctive relief against a state statute, and a three-judge court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281, should have been convened.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-19\">The district court stated that the \u201cinformality of petitioner\u2019s papers makes classification a matter of conjecture.\u201d We will treat both Hall\u2019s petition and Judge Rosling\u2019s decision as coming within 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-20\">In Ex parte Poresky, 290 U.S. 30, 54 S.Ct. 3, 78 L.Ed. 152(1933) the Supreme Court held that a single judge could dismiss a petition for a three-judge court for want of jurisdiction. Although the 1942 amendment to \u00a7 2284(5) casts some doubt upon the continued validity of this rule, the Supreme Court has adhered to the <em>Poresky </em>doctrine. See Wright, Federal Courts \u00a7 50 at 166 (1963) and cases cited there. Idlewild Bon Voyage Liquor Corp. v. Epstein, 370 U.S. 713, 82 S.Ct. 1294, 8 L.Ed.2d 794 (1962), suggests that we can review the refusal to convene a three-judge court.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-21\">Hall\u2019s plea may be construed as a request for injunctive relief. But the district court had no jurisdiction to entertain this application because it does not, at least as presently before us, meet the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281, by-being specifically directed against <em>\u201cany officer of such State </em>in the enforcement or execution of * * * [a specific] <em>statute\u2019\u2019 </em>(emphasis added), nor was \u201cat least five days notice of the hearing * * * given to the governor and attorney general of the State,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2284(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-23\">In affirming the decision of the district court because of these deficiencies, we are observant of the admonition of the Supreme Court that the three-judge court act is not \u201ca measure of broad social policy to be construed with great liberality, but * * * an enactment technical in the strict sense of the term and to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>applied as such.\u201d Phillips v. United States, 312 U.S. 246, 251, 61 S.Ct. 480, 483, 85 L.Ed. 800 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Moreover, under long established principles, even if the appellant were to submit a new and technically correct application the district court should decline to interfere with the state proceedings. See Stefanelli v. Minard, 342 U.S. 117, 120, 72 S.Ct. 118, 96 L.Ed. 138 (1951); Douglas v. City of Jeannette, 319 U.S. 157, 163-164, 63 S.Ct. 877, 87 L.Ed. 1324 (1943). In Moss v. Hornig, 314 F.2d 89, 91 (2d Cir. 1963) this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">\u201cFederal courts of equity have always been loath to restrain criminal prosecutions by states, even on constitutional grounds, where all constitutional issues can be decided in the first instance as a matter of course by the state courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">For the same reason petitioner\u2019s claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
