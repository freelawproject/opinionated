There was certainly evidence from which as to any one of these the jury could have found for plaintiff; but there also was evidence as to each issue from which the jury could (as it did) find for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-22\">As to the fourth issue, plaintiff had himself given two statements which conflicted with his testimony at trial to such a degree that the jury could have disbelieved his claim of bad footing.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-23\">There is no doubt that plaintiff was seriously injured in the course of his employment. Congress has not, however, seen fit to provide a workmen\u2019s compensation statute for railroad employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-24\">The history and interpretation of the F. E. L. A. shows conclusively that it is <em>not </em>a workmen\u2019s compensation act, that the element of proof of fault on the part of the employer is necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>recovery, and that what injured railroad men have won in this legislation is a right to present their claims that the injuries arose <em>in whole or in part </em>from the negligence of the employer in a fairly conducted jury trial.

Prob. 160 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">We believe that this record discloses that this was such a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">We find no abuse of discretion or prejudicial error in the rulings of the District Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b835-25\">. 35 Stat. 65 (1908), as amended, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 51-60 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
