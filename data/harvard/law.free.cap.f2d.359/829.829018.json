Late in June of that year, at Immel\u2019s request, Union<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> activity was begun to organize the employees. After a meeting on June 22, 1963, of the employees and Union representatives, the Union filed a representation petition. A Direction of Election was issued on August 19, making all employees on the payroll for the period prior to August 19 eligible to vote. The mail ballot was counted on September 26, and the Union was selected as bargaining agent. The alleged \u00a7 8(a) (3) discriminatory conduct involves the discharges of Immel and Lowitz, and the failure to reinstate Toivonen \u2014 all in the period be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>tween the Union meeting and the direction of an election.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The question for us is whether there is substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support the findings that Lowitz, Immel and Toivonen were unlawfully discharged and that the reasons assigned by respondent for the discharges were \u201cpretexts\u201d to shield the motive based on their Union activities. NLRB v. Economy Food Center, Inc., 333 F.2d 468, 471 (7th Cir. 1964). While the issue of the 8(a) (1) violation is not before us, the anti-Union attitude implicit in that violation may be considered as a background against which the events occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">The three employees involved here attended the June 22, 1963, Union meeting. Clifford and Wiley Stafford, sons of respondent\u2019s president, Jack Stafford, attended also, but were asked to leave and did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">The Trial Examiner credited Lowitz\u2019 testimony that the night before the meeting President Stafford had interrogated him, accused him of being one of the Union instigators, and criticized him for his Union activities; threatened loss of working time for the employees and personal surveillance of their driving and lunching conduct; and threatened to have Lowitz fired because he was an insurance risk. To some extent Stafford corroborated Lowitz\u2019 testimony. Stafford testified he discharged Lowitz \u201cbecause of the insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">It is true that Lowitz had a poor driving record and his license was suspended for sixty days in the autumn of 1962. But he resumed work as a truck driver in December of 1962 and continued driving until his discharge. It is true also that in March, 1963, Stafford\u2019s \u201cthird\u201d successive insurer wrote Stafford\u2019s agent,</p>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">asking to be relieved of liability under the policy, citing three large losses on accidents,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and observing that Lowitz and employee Wakeman had fallen asleep at the wheel and \u201cit appears that this is an occupational hazard in this risk because of the unusual hours they keep.\u201d Respondent\u2019s insurance agent in late June or early July requested insurance reports on five drivers, and these reports, dated July 9, 1963, indicated that the driving records of both Lowitz and Wakeman were \u201cgenerally unacceptable.\u201d Lowitz was told the insurance risk was the reason for his discharge. But the reports were not dated until two days after the discharge on July 7, and Wakeman continued working after Lowitz\u2019 discharge. In addition, when Lowitz\u2019 license had been suspended in late 1962, he was retained on the payroll by respondent. His driving record, since recovering his license and again driving for respondent, was \u201cwithout blemish.\u201d The Examiner concluded and the Board agreed that respondent diseriminatorily discharged Lowitz in violation of \u00a7 8(a) (3) and (1) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">Immel began working for respondent in February, 1963. His testimony was substantially as follows: He started the Union activity and passed out cards to the employees. Stafford late in the night before the June 22 Union meeting asked Immel if he was going to the meeting and impliedly threatened him with reduction of working hours and said \u201cI don\u2019t know what you are going to do but I know what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d On Tuesday, August 13, Immel was sick and had his wife call respondent\u2019s office, and he heard her say that he was \u201csick and * * * felt weak and had a headache and * * * felt faint like,\u201d and wanted the afternoon off to see his doctor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That afternoon, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>their Doctor Cooney told him he was \u201ccoming down with the flu\u201d and to take the rest of the week off and \u201cget rested up.\u201d On Sunday, August 18, upon reporting to respondent that he wanted the next day off to go to his grandmother's funeral, Immel was told by Clifford Stafford that he could not return to work without a doctor\u2019s release so that respondent could find out why he \u201cwas fainting all the time.\u201d The following Tuesday Dr. Cooney gave him the release authorizing his return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">The testimony continues: Clifford Stafford rejected the release and told Immel that President Stafford wanted him to be examined by Dr. Henney, Stafford\u2019s own doctor, at the same clinic as Dr. Cooney. This doctor asked him about his \u201cfainting spells.\u201d Immel denied having had any. The doctor asked him if \u201cwe were having any union problems at the company.\u201d Dr. Henney certified that Immel was ready for work. President Stafford refused to reemploy him, stating he wanted Immel to go to Madison to determine whether he had a brain tumor, \u201cthen you can come back to work.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">Immel did not go to the Madison hospital and accordingly could not return to work. He could not afford the cost of this examination, and was not assured that anyone else would pay for it.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">It is true that on one previous occasion he had run his car into a ditch and the night before that event had \u201cpassed out\u201d in the Stafford garage. He denied that he had fainted, but stated he had gotten sick both times from driving a truck with a bad piston which resulted in diesel smoke and fumes in the truck cab. This was possible, according to testimony of Dr. Henney. The Examiner credited Immel on this factual question whether Immel had \u201cfainted\u201d or had \u201cfainting spells\u201d or, as Jack Stafford told Dr. Henney, \u201cblackout spells\u201d which worried Stafford about his driving. The Examiner, noting also respondent\u2019s \u201cstrong feeling against the Union,\u201d concluded, and the Board agreed, that respondent discriminated against Immel in violation of \u00a7 8(a) (3).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-12\">Toivonen went to work for respondent on May 6, 1963, signed a Union card and attended with the other drivers the June 22 meeting. He and two other Stafford drivers, all lowest in seniority and residing in Hurley, Wisconsin (about 235 miles from Portage), were laid off for lack of work on June 29,1963. The other two were called back two weeks later, after a week\u2019s notice. It is conceded that the layoff was justified and there is no claim that Toivonen was their senior, entitled to recall before them. Respondent did not communicate with Toivonen until Sunday afternoon, August 11, when Clifford Stafford called Toivonen at his home in Hurley and asked him to come back to drive a truck to Appleton \u201cthat night.\u201d Toivonen said he had no transportation to Portage, since his car was not operative. He testified that Clifford Stafford did not suggest that he drive down on Monday with another of the drivers from Hurley, but that Clifford said \u201cwe will figure something out.\u201d The following week another part-time employee, who had no part in the Union organizing activities, was assigned to full-time work Toivonen would otherwise have had. The Examiner found that respondent did not</p>\n<p id=\"agg-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>tell him he was to be taken back full-time.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\">The Examiner concluded from the testimony that Toivonen was not recalled because it was respondent\u2019s purpose \u201cto replace him with a man not tainted by the Union\u201d in order to eliminate a possible pro-Union vote at the impending representation election.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">The record shows that the two men who were laid off with Toivonen were also from Hurley and with him had commuted weekends from Portage to Hurley. They also had signed Union cards and attended the meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Clifford Stafford testified that he suggested to Toivonen that he ride down with the other two men on Monday and that Toivonen said he had work to do on his house and \u201cstuff\u201d about his car to straighten away and he could not come down for about a week. Clifford testified that he \u201cfigured it out, if he [Toivonen] didn\u2019t come down he could stay up there, then I wouldn\u2019t need him.\u201d There was testimony too that Mrs. Toivonen was unhappy about her husband\u2019s being away so much, and that Clifford Stafford stated to one of the other two drivers that \u201cthey were not going to beg\u201d Toivonen to come back to work. Toivonen testified he considered himself fired when he heard about this the following week. He never heard again from respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">Toivonen testified further that he \u201cmight have been working a little around the house\u201d that week and that \u201cI might have\u201d mentioned that to Clifford Stafford over the phone. He also testified that his wife was a \u201clittle disgusted,\u201d that he told Jack Stafford he might have to leave work because he could not find a home and that he \u201cmentioned\u201d he did not know how long he would be able to stay on. On August 11 he did not ask either of his fellow workers whether he could ride down to Portage with them, and he said he tried to reach Jack Stafford in Milwaukee several times on that Sunday, but did not call Monday or any other time.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">We think the record as a whole does not substantiate the inference drawn by the Examiner with respect to Toivonen. The record discloses at best a passive attitude on his part toward returning to his work, and that he had domestic problems which were probably at the root of his attitude. And if respondent was interested in eliminating possible pro-Union votes, why would it select and fail to reinstate him, instead of his two fellow townsmen, who had also attended the Union meeting?</p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">As to Lowitz and Immel, we think there is substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support the Examiner\u2019s findings and the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">The order as to Lowitz and Immel will be enforced; and as to Toivonen enforcement will be denied.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b884-10\">.

Mrs. Immel testified that she told the respondent\u2019s mechanic, who answered the phone, that her husband \u201chad fainted.\u201d After visiting the doctor with her husband, she phoned again and told Clifford Stafford their doctor said Mr. Immel was sick from over-exhaustion and the flu.
