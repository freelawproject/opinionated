The ultimate destination of the crated switchboard was Reno, Nevada. Pacific Express was to transport the crate from Chicago to Reno. Truck Insurance Exchange was the insurer of Pacific Express.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-16\">Lilbern Lemons was the driver of the Dohrn truck. He drove the truck to the Pacific Express Company\u2019s unloading dock at its terminal near Chicago. The District Court found that Lemons requested an employee of Pacific Express, one Joseph Nograsek, to assist in the unloading. Nograsek brought a fork lift truck owned by Pacific Express to the immediate vicinity of the Dohrn truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-17\">The fork of the lift was placed under the end of the crate closest to the rear of the truck while Lemons stood in the truck at the other end of the crate. The fork lift then began to back away from the Dohrn truck. The space between the truck and the dock was bridged by a metal plate which had been picked up at the dock and was the property of Pacific Express. When the crate was in a position over the plate, it missed a part of the plate and fell from the fork lift.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-18\">Jene Kirkendoll, a driver employed by a third trucking company, was seated on the rear of his truck which was parked adjacent to the Dohrn truck. When the crate fell, it struck him, causing injuries. He filed suit for damages against Pacific Express which tendered the defense of the suit to Liberty Mutual, but that Company declined to accept the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-19\">The damage suit was tried and resulted in a judgment of $65,000 in favor of Kirkendoll and against Pacific Express. This judgment was settled by Pacific Express and its insurer for $62,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>Pacific Express and Truck Insurance Exchange then brought a declaratory judgment suit against Liberty Mutual for the amount of the settlement plus costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. The instant case was tried on a stipulation of facts. The District Court entered judgment in favor of Pacific Express and Truck Insurance Exchange in the sum of $67,681.-16, plus costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">The critical question on appeal is whether Liberty Mutual\u2019s policy to Dohrn covered Pacific Express under the facts of this case. To be resolved is the question whether Pacific Express came within the policy\u2019s \u201cdefinition of insured.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is conceded that the unloading of the crate from the truck and on to the dock was the responsibility of Dohrn.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The last sentence of the second paragraph of Liberty\u2019s \u201cDefinition of Insured\u201d states: \u201cThe insurance with respect to any person or organization other than the named insured does not apply: * * * (a) except with respect to an employee of the named insured. * * * \u201d Thus, an employee of Dohrn would not be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The first question that arises is whether the party seeking coverage under Liberty\u2019s policy (Pacific Express) was an employee. It is clear that none of the usual tests of employment are present. Pacific Express was not hired by Dohrn; it could not have been discharged by Dohrn; it was not subject to Dohrn\u2019s control. Pacific Express was not, itself, an employee of Dohrn.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-13\">But the trial court held that Pacific Express\u2019 employee, Nograsek, had been acting as Dohrn\u2019s agent at the time of the accident. The Court considered this an important element, saying: \u201cPIE (Pacific Express) is involved here only because one of its employees, at the direction of a Dohrn driver and for the benefit of Dohrn, which had the duty to unload the crate, assisted Dohrn\u2019s driver in the unloading process. That employee * * was an agent of Dohrn while he assisted m the unloading of the Dohrn truck and was thereby covered by Liberty Mutual\u2019s policy to Dohrn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-15\">Although it is conceded that the unloading of the crate from the truck and on to the dock was Dohrn\u2019s responsibility, the precise status of Nograsek is shown by the stipulation of facts: \u201c(10). That Joseph Nograsek, an employee of Pacific Intermountain Express Company, with the permission of the Dohrn Transfer Company, proceeded to cooperate with Lilbern Lemons, the driver of the Dohrn Transfer Company aforesaid, in removing the aforesaid crate from the Dohrn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>Transfer Company truck.\u201d The stipulation of facts further demonstrates that Nograsek had not acted at the request of the driver of Dohrn\u2019s truck as stated by the Court. The stipulation stated that Nograsek \u201c * * * with the permission of the Dohrn Transfer Company, proceeded to cooperate with Lilbern Lemons, the driver of the Dohrn Transportation\u2019s truck. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Furthermore, the deposition of Lilbern Lemons shows that Nograsek had been summoned by a Pacific Express checker and not \u201cat the direction of a Dohrn driver\u201d as was suggested by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">The inference is that it was Nograsek who took the initiative in assisting Dohrn and that Dohrn consented to Norgrasek\u2019s aid. Furthermore, as hereinbefore stated, Lemons testified, \u201cWell, the checker (employed by Pacific Express) called for a fellow with a finger lift or a lift fork.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">We hold that Nograsek was neither an agent nor an employee of Dohrn and, therefore, focus our inquiry on the exclusionary conditions in Liberty\u2019s policy \u201cDefinition of Insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">It should be kept in mind that Pacific Express is seeking coverage under a policy of insurance that Liberty issued to Dohrn. Obviously, Pacific Express was not a party to that contract. But in this suit, Pacific Express seeks what has been referred to as \u201cgratuitous coverage\u201d under the provision of Liberty\u2019s policy designated \u201cDefinition of Insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">We agree with Liberty Mutual\u2019s arguments and hold that this provision extends coverage to other \u201ccommon carriers\u201d (such as Pacific Express) only if the three conditions set out in the provision are met. Since there is no argument concerning the second condition, a (2), only a(l) and a(3) need be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">The first condition necessary for Liberty\u2019s policy to extend coverage to a common carrier is that the particular vehicle must have been used exclusively in Dohm\u2019s own business at the time of the accident. There is much force in Liberty\u2019s argument that at the time the crate fell, the vehicle being used was in both Dohrn\u2019s and Pacific Express' business. This is shown by the fact that the Dohrn truck was being unloaded by a Pacific Express employee, at the direction of a checker employed by Pacific Express while at the Pacific Express terminal. However, as it is agreed that it was Dohrn\u2019s obligation to unload the truck, we do not choose to base a reversal in this case on the exclusion contained in the first condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-11\">We hold that the exclusionary language in sub-paragraph a (3) excludes Pacific Express because Pacific Express\u2019 own insurance coverage fails to provide protection to Dohrn when Pacific Express is using vehicles owned by Dohrn.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-12\">The third condition necessary for Liberty Mutual\u2019s policy to extend to a common carrier (Pacific Express) is that the carrier\u2019s own insurance policy (issued by Truck Insurance Exchange) protects Dohrn while said common carrier (Pacific Express) is using Dohrn\u2019s vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-13\">An examination of the Pacific Express policy with Truck Insurance Exchange reveals that it expressly excludes from its coverage the owners of hired vehicles which would mean exclusion of Dohrn while Pacific Express was using Dohrn\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-14\">Liberty specifically excluded those organizations which have failed to provide coverage for Dohrn while using Dohrn\u2019s vehicles. It is a blanket exclusion and specifically excludes such an organization from any coverage under Liberty\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-15\">Pacific Express makes some argument that it is only excluded when both sub-paragraphs a(l) and a(3) are called into force. However, the conjunctive \u201cor\u201d is used. We hold that Pacific Express is excluded if either a(l) or a(3) is not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-16\">The judgment of the District Court must be reversed. Judgment in favor of the defendant should be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-17\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b791-8\">. \u201cDefinition of Insured.
