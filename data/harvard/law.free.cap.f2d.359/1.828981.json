The dispute concerns construction work on the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Federal Office Building in Boston. Bateson is the gen-/ eral contractor and Aetna has a subcontract to install certain prefabricated and enamelled sheet metal enclosures surrounding window interiors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The appeal is from a decision of the district court dismissing the complaint on the ground that the parties have provided for arbitration machinery to resolve the points at issue and that it is not for the court to interfere in what are essentially procedural questions to be resolved pursuant to the method agreed upon by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The seeds of dispute lie in the changing technology of building construction. Interior window trim and panelling were formerly of wood, had to be fitted and joined on the premises, and were therefore traditionally the domain of carpenters. But with the wider use of prefabricated metal, the skills and claims of sheet metal workers have entered the scene.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Aetna, the subcontractor, acting in accordance with its prior practice on jobs in six other states and the District of Columbia and in what it claimed was conformity to the tradition established by the 1928 inter-union agreement (see note 3, supra), assigned to Carpenters \u201call moveable steel partitions, convector covers, pipe covers, and related interior work around windows * * * for installation.\u201d On the other hand, Sheet Metal claimed that there had been a custom in the Boston area for convector covers and Venetian blind pockets to be given to sheet metal workers (with no past area experience as to air induction covers, apparently a new item).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">From these seeds sprouted a vine of controversy, running through all levels of the newly established arbitration machinery set up to deal with jurisdictional disputes in the construction industry. This machinery is set forth in the \u201cPlan for National Joint Board for Settlement of Jurisdictional Disputes\u201d, an agreement between organizations representing the national building trades unions and building contractors, executed at the White House, and witnessed by the President on February 2, 1965. The Plan utilizes preexisting \u201cLocal Boards\u201d for adjusting jurisdictional dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>putes (in Boston, Chicago, and New York), establishes a National Joint Board for the Settlement of Jurisdictional Disputes, and creates an Appeals Board to decide appeals from both Local Boards and the Joint Board. It is empowered to prescribe rules and regulations subject to the approval of the Joint Negotiating Committee (representing the signatory organizations). The agreement took effect on April 1, 1965, by which time preliminary regulations for the operation of the Appeals Board had been established.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Notwithstanding this framework designed to expedite orderly resolution of problems of jurisdiction, each step taken by the parties widened the area of controversy. The following chronology is the only matter not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">1. Sheet Metal, hearing of Aetna\u2019s assignment of interior metal window work to Carpenters, after an abortive effort to communicate with Carpenters, filed a protest with the Local Board in Boston. The protest cited only \u201cThe installation of metal enclosures on metal Venetian blinds pockets and convector covers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">2. Hearing was held on April 27, 1965. All parties except Carpenters (apparently having withdrawn, along with some other craft unions, from the Boston Board) were present. Sheet Metal, although it had listed only the \u201cinstallation\u201d of two items in its protest, allegedly made clear by pictures and a mockup model that it was claiming all three items described in note 2, supra. The Boston Board\u2019s laconic decision of April 27 was: \u201cThe work in question is the work of the Sheet Metal Workers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-17\">3. Carpenters, alleging a delay in the mails, appealed the Boston Board decision to the Appeals Board seven days later. Sheet Metal objected that the appeal was untimely, not being within the two days set forth in Appeals Board regulations. The Appeals Board accordingly refused to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-18\">4. On July 2 Aetna notified Sheet Metal that it was complying with the April 27 decision by assigning installation of \u201cmetal enclosures on metal Venetian blinds pockets and convector covers\u201d to Sheet Metal. It was assigning installation of pipe covers (or air induction covers) and the unloading and distribution of all three items to Carpenters. This assignment literally complied with, the wording of both Sheet Metal\u2019s initial protest and the Boston Board\u2019s order. (Aetna, in effect, was playing Portia to Sheet Metal\u2019s Shylock.) Sheet Metal, however, claimed this violated uniform, custom that \u201chandling\u201d materials was included in \u201cinstallation\u201d and that it had been made clear that three items, not two, were in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-19\">5. Sheet Metal went on strike on July 15. The business manager of Sheet Metal, at the request of Bateson, went back to the Boston Board on July 20, orally requesting clarification of the April 27 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>decision. No notice of this meeting was given Carpenters. The Board heard Sheet Metal, Aetna, and Bateson. It thereupon issued another Delphic decision that: \u201cAll of the parties in interest be directed to comply with the April 27, 1965 decision of the Board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">6. On this occasion there was a timely appeal to the Appeals Board by Aetna,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> calling attention to the continuing work stoppage and the ambiguity of the July 20 decision. Carpenters joined, urging that \u201cthis entire matter\u201d be reviewed to eliminate confusion. Sheet Metal questioned the right of the Appeals Board to intervene at all, and cited as the only area of contention the question whether \u201chandling\u201d of items is automatically included with assignment of installation.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">7. Shortly thereafter, Bateson, to resolve the strike, made a written agreement with Sheet Metal to assign all the disputed work to it until the order of the Boston Board was reversed by a court, the Boston Board, or the Appeals Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">8. After hearing all parties, the Appeals Board issued a decision on August 12 which, after reciting the \u201cconfused situation\u201d resulting from the refusal of the Boston Board to clarify its earlier decision and to give guidance to the contractors, the work stoppage, the intervention of the National Labor Relations Board, and the \u201cstrained\u201d interpretation which Aetna had given the April 27 decision, took the jurisdictional bull by the horns. Saying that \u201csome definitive action * * * is long overdue to determine precisely how work shall proceed\u201d, it decided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">\u201cThe unloading, distribution and installation of convector enclosures comprised of sills and front pieces and grills shall be assigned to the sheet metal workers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-8\">\u201cThe unloading, distribution and installation of pipe enclosures, curve window trim and base, filler pieces behind plastered columns, Venetian blind pockets and metal partitions shall be assigned to the carpenters.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-12\">9. While this was a decision of the Appeals Board which by regulation was to \u201cbe complied with at once\u201d, Sheet Metal protested that the Appeals Board had jurisdiction only to decide whether the right to install items carried with it the right to unload and distribute them. Notwithstanding the absence of \u201cprotest\u201d procedure after decision, the Appeals Board held another hearing on August 27 and rehearsed the entire history. While observing that \u201cthe unhappy events affecting this project in July clearly required some firm resolution\u201d, it urged that the Joint Negotiating Committee \u201creview the type of circumstances involved\u201d to clarify during this \u201cformative period\u201d the authority of the Appeals Board to consider an appeal having once declined to act, \u201cin the face of subsequent developments of the sort\u201d which had been faced in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-13\">Plaintiff, Sheet Metal, argues that nothing done by the Appeals Board has validity because (1) it attempted to decide matters beyond the precise controversy referred to it; (2) having refused to take the first appeal, it was barred from rehearing the issue on the appeal from the \u201cclarifying\u201d decision; and (3) in any event its decision of August 12 was not final, being contingent on future deliberations of the Joint Negotiating Committee, and therefore the April 27 decision of the Boston Board should continue in effect.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-14\">We do not agree. We have set forth the tortuous history of this controversy at some length partly to indicate the inappropriateness of an excessively legalistic approach to the technical and pragmatic problems of arriving at fair and workable jurisdictional solutions. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>example, Sheet Metal, which invoked the arbitral apparatus without any exploratory consultations with Carpenters, was embarrassed by a protest phrased too narrowly. The posture of Carpenters in pretending that the Boston Board did not exist was hardly conducive to constructive arbitration. While Sheet Metal was quick to foreclose an appeal several days overdue, it nevertheless was offended by an obviously \u201cstrained\u201d reading of the April 27 decision by Aetna. Without probing other approaches, it resorted to a strike. Then, after going back to the Boston Board and opening the door to appeal, by requesting clarification, it tried to shut it once again as to all issues except one where it had nothing to lose. After the decision of August 12, the first thoughtful attempt to deal with the problem, it went outside all procedure, protested the decision, and obtained another hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Our approach to this tangled web is based on the assumption that no longer in the building industry should jurisdictional problems be approached like common law pleading. We prefer to base our decision on what seem to us to be a necessary respect of and tolerance for the arbitration process.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">It need hardly be stated that national policy strongly favors arbitration in labor disputes. The \u201cSteelworkers Trilogy\u201d clearly sets the tone. In United Steelworkers of America v. American Mfg. Co., 1960, 363 U.S. 564, 567, 80 S.Ct. 1343, 1346, 4 L.Ed.2d 1403, the Supreme Court, criticizing the lower courts for their \u201cpreoccupation with ordinary contract law\u201d compelled the submission to arbitration of even a possibly frivolous claim. In United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., 1960, 363 U.S. 574, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409, the Court required the company to go to arbitration on its action in contracting out maintenance work despite a provision excepting from arbitration matters which were \u201cstrictly a function of management\u201d. The Court referred to a collective bargaining agreement as \u201cmore than a contract; it is a generalized code to govern a myriad of cases which the draftsmen cannot wholly anticipate.\u201d 363 U.S. at 578, 80 S.Ct. at 1351. It added: \u201cArbitration is the means of solving the unforeseeable by molding a system of private law for all the problems which may arise and to provide for their solution in a way which will generally accord with the variant needs and desires of the parties.\u201d 363 U.S. at 581, 80 S.Ct. at 1352.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">In describing the scope of judicial review, the Court stated that inquiry \u201c * * * must be strictly confined to the question whether the reluctant party did agree to arbitrate the grievance or did agree to give the arbitrator power to make the award he made.\u201d 363 U.S. at 582, 80 S.Ct. at 1353. The Court stated the restriction in another way in United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., 1960, 363 U.S. 593, 597, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 1361, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424: \u201cWhen the arbitrator\u2019s words manifest an infidelity to this obligation [the collective bargaining agreement], courts have no choice but to refuse enforcement of the award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">We may observe that if such force is to be given to collective bargaining agreements between management and unions, no less support should be given agreements to which unions resort to resolve their jurisdictional disputes. There is no question here but that the dispute falls within the kinds of controversy envisaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-11\">Whether \u201chandling\u201d should accompany \u201cinstallation\u201d; whether metal enclosures on Venetian blind pockets are one or two items; whether convector covers, Venetian blind pockets, and air induction covers are indivisible or not; how, if divisible, they should be allocated \u2014 these are matters best handled by those acquainted with \u201cthe common law of the shop\u201d. The issue is whether, arbitration having aborted at the local level \u2014 with blame enough to be shared by all, the Appeals Board\u2019s decision should be declared a nullity for reasons of rejection of a prior appeal, scope of matters considered, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>a request to the Joint Committee for guidance for this type of problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">We are reluctant to appear to preempt the responsibilities of both the Appeals Board and the Joint Negotiating Committee. We therefore will not say that, when the regulations allow an appeal from a decision on a request for \u201cclarification\u201d, the Appeals Board is beyond the bounds of arbitrability in considering it. Sheet Metal cites the provision (see note 4, supra) saying that denial of an appeal does not foreclose an appeal \u201con a similar case in the future.\u201d From this, it concludes that an appeal is foreclosed on the same case in the present. But to say that because the Appeals Board will hear similar cases in the future, it will not entertain appeals from decisions on requests for reconsideration or clarification is to construe two regulations as having an internal inconsistency. Whatever the merits, it is clear that this is the kind of procedural question which should be left to the arbitrator (or, in this case, the system of arbitration) to decide. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Livingston, 1964, 376 U.S. 543, 557, 84 S.Ct. 909, 11 L.Ed.2d 898.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Neither will we say that the Appeals Board was guilty of \u201cinfidelity\u201d or abuse of power in trying to resolve a dispute by using a broader lens than that provided by the parties. If the purpose of the Appeals Board is to resolve disputes and improve relations between unions, we cannot deny it at least the same room for creative adjustment which an arbitrator between management and labor possesses.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Even appellate courts have power, on occasion, to note issues beyond those presented by the parties, in the interest of doing justice, e. g., Fed.R.Civ.P. 52. A fortiori, we should not impose a narrowed latitude on what should be a broader-ranging search for a workable result. On a matter no less important to the parties we have said, \u201cQuestions of arbitrability are not automatically resolved in the employer\u2019s favor by invoking the term \u2018jurisdiction\u2019. * * * Arbitrators, however, even as courts, Fauntleroy v. Lum, 1908, 210 U.S. 230, 28 S.Ct. 641, 52 L.Ed. 1039, have \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 to decide erroneously.\u201d Trailways of New England, Inc. v. Amalgamated Association, 1 Cir., 1965, 353 F.2d 180, 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">The final argument against the validity of the Appeals Board decision is that, while it appeared to be final on August 12, any vestige of finality was removed by the subsequent reference to the Joint Negotiating Committee. Sheet Metal draws from this \u201cstate of suspended animation\u201d tjie conclusion that it is entitled to have the Boston Board decision of April 27 complied with and the agreement with Bateson reactivated at least until such time \u201cas a <em>bona fide </em>final decision is issued\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">We have some sympathy with Sheet Metal on this point, for the Appeals Board has not made it crystal clear what it considers to be the state of its decision. Acting in obvious good faith it has sought to build confidence in its future operations by asking policy guidance for its action in \u201cthe type of circumstances involved in the present situation,\u201d so that any question of its authority be resolved. It would, we think, have been better practice to have made more clear the distinction between deciding a case before it and devising rules and procedures to cover anticipated situations in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>The key to the answer, however, has been supplied by the cogent arguments of Sheet Metal itself. For counsel has pointed out that the Joint Negotiating Committee\u2019s authority is described as approving rules as to types of cases accepted for review and procedural regulations, not as interpreting or revising rules on its own initiative. We might add that, if the August 12 decision is to be considered a nullity, every case of first impression may well go unresolved. For if the Appeals Board cannot dispose of such a case, absent prior rule, it is all the more clear that a rule subsequently devised cannot operate retroactively. Such an approach would be well calculated to insure the demise of the \u201cPlan\u201d. It is hard to believe that the signatory parties and unions represented would want their new system so reduced to impotency. On the other hand, the habit of going to court to test the propriety of every unprecedented or unforeseen step taken at any level in the arbitration system would \u201c * * * entirely eliminate the prospect of a speedy arbitrated settlement of the dispute, to the disadvantage of the parties * * * and contrary to the aims of national labor policy\u201d. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Livingston, supra, 376 U.S. at 558, 84 S.Ct. at 919.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Whatever may flow from the deliberations of the Joint Negotiating Committee, we think it clear that the Appeals Board decision of August 27 is the significant operative fact. It has not been revoked. It cannot be reversed by the Joint Negotiating Committee. At most the consultations may produce another decision, just as an appellate court occasionally reconsiders and changes its decisions. To be sure, if a different result ultimately ensues, there will have been much inconvenience suffered in the meantime, but no more so than granting Sheet Metal\u2019s request now, only to see the August 27 result reconfirmed at a later date.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">We affirm the action of the district court in dismissing the complaint on the ground that \u201cthe parties have provided in their agreement for administrative decision of the very question which plaintiff now asks the Court to determine\u201d. But we have felt it necessary to examine the present status of the August 12 decision, for a decision buttressed solely on respect for the arbitration process not yet completed might be read as indicating that the Appeals Board decision was of no effect, and that the earlier Boston Board decision should be carried out. In other words, we have intervened only to support the arbitral jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">The dismissal of the complaint must be affirmed for the reasons given in this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b56-7\">.

It also specified under what circumstances metal window frames would be set by each union. The agreement provided that in the event of a misunderstanding arising in carrying out the provisions, the two General Presidents would consult.
