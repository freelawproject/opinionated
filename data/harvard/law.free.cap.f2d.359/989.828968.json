White v. United States, 4 Cir., 317 F.2d 13. We vacated the summary judgment and remanded the case for trial on the issue of negligence. Thereafter, a full plenary hearing was had and evidence, including the testimony of expert witnesses, was introduced by both parties. Thereafter, the District Court made findings of fact and conclusions of law, and, upon their basis, it again entered judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-23\">We accept the District Court\u2019s findings of fact as not being clearly erroneous, and, on the basis those findings provide, its ultimate conclusion that there was no negligence in the care and treatment of Meeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-24\">While the issue would be highly debatable if before us de novo, we find no reversible error in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
