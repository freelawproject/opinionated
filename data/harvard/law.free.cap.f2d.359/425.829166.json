Petitioner had pleaded guilty to a one-count indictment charging him with the interstate transportation of a stolen motor vehicle in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 2312. He sought to have the conviction set aside on the ground that the plea of guilty had been induced by a promise of leniency on the part of a federal agent. The District Court held a full hearing on this point at which petitioner was represented by able counsel. The District Court chose to believe the testimony of the federal agent and to reject as incredible the petitioner\u2019s testimony after careful and painstaking review of the proceedings at the arraignment and sentencing. We cannot say that the District Court erred in resolving the issue of credibility, and in its fact-finding that the petitioner \u201cfreely, voluntarily and intelligently entered a plea of guilty, and that he did so without threats or promises of any kind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-21\">The Order of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
