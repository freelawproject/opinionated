We find nothing unfair in the submission of the case to the jury. Since the record clearly shows that the defendant was present when the jury was selected and the prospective jurors were asked to look upon him as he sat at the arm of his lawyer, we do not consider the defendant\u2019s unsubstantiated and unspecific claim, advanced for the first time in this Court, that he was not present.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
