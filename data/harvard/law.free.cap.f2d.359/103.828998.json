This is the second appearance of this case in this Court. See United States v. State of Mississippi, 339 F.2d 679 (5 Cir., 1964). Since our former decision, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1973 et seq. has become law. In our former decision the case was reversed and remanded to the district court. This appeal ensued after the trial court entered an order following our reversal and remand. Again the United States appealed, contending that the district court did not follow the mandate of our former decision. Pending the appeal, the Supreme Court rendered its opinion in State of South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 86 S.Ct. 803 (March 7, 1966), holding valid and constitutional the pertinent provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">When the case was called for argument in this Court, counsel for appellant and appellees entered into the following written stipulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-8\">\u201cSTIPULATION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-9\">It is hereby stipulated and agreed to by the parties that the proposed decree contained in Appendix \u2018B\u2019 of appellant\u2019s brief be entered by this Court as the final decree in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">The stipulation is approved by this Court. See United States v. Clement et al. (5 Cir. 1966) 358 F.2d 89 (March 14, 1966). Accordingly, the order entered by the District Court is hereby vacated, the judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded with directions to the District Court to enter the following final decree:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-12\">\u201cFINAL DECREE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-13\">I. This Court finds that the original defendant, John 0. Wood, has engaged in acts and practices which have deprived Negro citizens of Walthall County, Mississippi, of their rights, secured by 42 USCA \u00a7 1971 (a), to register to vote without distinction by reason of race, and that such deprivation has been pursuant to a pattern or practice of discrimination against Negro Citizens in the registration processes in Walthall County, Mississippi.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-14\">II. It is ordered, adjudged and decreed by the Court that the Defendant State of Mississippi and the Defendant Joe M. Stinson, Registrar of Voters of Walthall County, Mississippi, their agents, officers, employees and successors in office be and each is hereby enjoined from engaging in any act or practice which involves or results in distinctions based on race or color between Negro citizens and other citizens in the registration for voting process in Walthall County, Mississippi.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-15\">III.

It is further ordered, adjudged, and decreed by the Court that for the period specified in paragraph III, except to the extent that the State of Mississippi has obtained a declaratory judgment under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, 79 Stat. 439, that a qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice or procedure enacted subsequent to November 1, 1964 does not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color, or has submitted such qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice or procedure to the Attorney General of the United States and the Attorney General has not interposed an objection within sixty days after such submission, the Defendant State of Mississippi and the Defendant Joe M.

It is further ordered that defendant Joe M. Stinson, his agents, employees, and successors, in conducting registration of voters in Walthall County, Mississippi, are enjoined and ordered to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-13\">(a) Afford each applicant for registration an opportunity to apply and complete the application form whether either the registrar or deputy registrar is present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-14\">(b) Advise each applicant, when he or she applies, whether the applicant is accepted or rejected; if accepted, the applicant must be registered at that time; if rejected, the applicant must be informed of the reason or reasons for his rejection and must be advised of his right to apply directly to this Court to be registered as provided in paragraph VI hereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-15\">(c) Receive and process each applicant as expeditiously as possible to the extent that the physical facilities of the registration office permit but in no case less than three applicants at one time and in no case refuse to process fewer than three applicants at one time, and take all reasonable steps to insure that, whenever possible, each applicant is processed on the day he appears for registration. The office of the registrar shall be open during the office hours observed by defendant Stinson in his capacity as the clerk of the courts of Walthall County for regis-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>tration from Monday through Friday of each week except on holidays.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-4\">VI.

The Court or such referee shall register all such applicants who meet the standards established in this order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">VII. It is further ordered that the defendant Stinson, his agents, employees, and successors in office shall file a written report with the clerk of this Court and shall mail a copy thereof to the Plaintiff's attorneys on or before the fifth day of each month. Said reports shall contain the name and race of each applicant for registration from the previous monthly period, the date of the application, the action taken on the application, and if the applicant is rejected, the specific reason or reasons for rejecting the application.
