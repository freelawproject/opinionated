After a full evidentiary hearing, during which a number of witnesses appeared and substantial documentary evidence was presented, the District Court entered extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law holding that under the facts of the case the businesses involved do not constitute related activities performed through unified operation or common control for a common business purpose, and that the appellees do not constitute an enterprise within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">A careful review of the record convinces us that the facts found by the District Court are supported by substantial evidence and that the legal conclusions reached are supported by the facts so found. Wirtz v. Hardin &amp; Co., Inc., et al., 253 F.Supp. 579. The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"ACm\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b847-7\">.
