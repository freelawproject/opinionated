Following a full hearing, the District Court made full and complete findings of fact and concluded that appellant had failed to establish any basis for a collateral attack on his judgment of conviction and sentence by the State court. These findings cannot be said to be clearly erroneous, in light of the support for them found both at the District Court trial and in the State record.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-24\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
