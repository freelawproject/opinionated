It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>involves a \u201cvery close case of mental defect\u201d as the trial judge pointed out at bench conference following the jury\u2019s request for a supplementary instruction on insanity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AmW\">At arraignment on August 28, 1964, the presiding judge stated that he understood that appellant was undergoing treatment or examination at St. Eliza-beths Hospital and ordered commitment there for mental examination. In October the Superintendent of St. Elizabeths Hospital certified that appellant was competent to stand trial and was not then or on the date of the alleged offenses, July 17,1964, suffering from a mental disease or defect.</p>\n<p id=\"AOa\">On December 3, appellant\u2019s court-appointed attorney applied orally for an independent psychiatric examination, pointing out that St. Elizabeths diagnosed appellant as a \u201cborderline defect\u201d and that appellant had been discharged from the Navy as a moron with an IQ of 61. The motion was denied without prejudice, the District Court directing the prosecution t'o investigate the possibility of proceeding by civil commitment. On December 9, the prosecution advised the court that Dr. Platkin of St. Elizabeths reported that appellant\u2019s IQ was low, but \u201cnot low enough to consider him a mental deficient.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defense counsel requested that defendant be seen by the' Bureau of Mental Retardation, which he identified as a department at the D. C. General Hospital specializing in taking care of and judging mentally retarded individuals. He advised that a representative of that Bureau would come to see appellant in jail, without fee, \u201cand all that would be required would be a Court Order.\u201d The court said: \u201cThe report from the hospital says that this defendant is mentally competent to stand trial. That is enough. He will go to trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AEj\">The question of determination of mental competency was put over until December 11. No evidentiary hearing was held. Defense counsel referred to his requests for an independent examination. The court replied: \u201cI won\u2019t do that. Why should I ? He has been sent to the proper establishment, St. Elizabeths Hospital, and they have made a finding of competency. If we are going to start this business, we will never finish with it.\u201d The court held appellant competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"ApiG\">There can be little doubt that the presentation of the motion and ruling thereon would have been different if the court and counsel had been apprised of our subsequent <em>en banc </em>opinion in Whalem v. United States, 120 U.S.App.D.C. 331, 346 F.2d 812, cert. denied, 382 U.S. 862, 86 S.Ct. 124, 15 L.Ed.2d 100 (1965). And compare Pate v. Robinson, 86 S.Ct. 836 (March 7,1966).</p>\n<p id=\"AmV\">There can also be little doubt that if the assignment judge had been made aware, even reasonably well aware, of the nature of the evidence as developed at trial and available before trial, an expert would have been appointed to assist the parties and the court. Such information would doubtless have developed at the kind of evidentiary hearing on competency contemplated by <em>Whalem </em>in case of challenge of St. Elizabeths findings.</p>\n<p id=\"AJn\">The jury interrupted its deliberations to seek additional instructions on \u201cmental defect\u201d and, if found to exist, its possible sufficiency to justify a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. In addition to the mother\u2019s testimony as to the appellant's life-long inadequacy, the jurors knew the appellant had been discharged by the Navy on June 3, 1942, within three months after enlistment, and was then rated \u201cas mentally defective at the moron level,\u201d with an IQ of 61, and only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>third-grade reading ability. He had six years later been rejected as an enlistee in the Army, the report of which episode showed a history of long-standing neurotic disturbance, according to Dr. Platkin. The jurors in particular asked that they be supplied with a 1962 report of an examination of the appellant by Dr. Broucek, the Chief of Psychiatry at Atlanta Penitentiary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AGg\">We think that in the circumstances at bar it is in the interest of justice to reverse and remand for appropriate further action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This would embrace renewal, with the evidence indicated, of the motion for an order for a court-appointed expert pursuant to Rule 28. The report of such an expert, at least in supplementation of all other evidence mentioned, might have resulted in an evidentiary hearing pursuant to D.C. Code \u00a7 24-301 (1961), and in any event he would have been available as a witness at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AynG\">The injustice with which we are concerned was not obviated at the trial by permitting defense counsel to read aloud to the jury pertinent excerpts from the St. Elizabeths record containing the information related above. Thus we note that the trial judge pointed out to the jury that there was no testimony as to the meaning of Dr. Broucek\u2019s diagnosis, as to whether it amounts to a mental disease or defect or not.</p>\n<p id=\"A0u\">In view of our order we find it unnecessary to consider whether the trial court committed reversible error in limiting cross-examination of Dr. Platkin, or in his rulings and actions relating to the handling of the St. Elizabeths file.</p>\n<p id=\"An8\">For the reasons indicated, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"A3_\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AQB\">. The court recommended commitment to the Federal Reformatory at Petersburg, Virginia. On oral argument we were advised that the Attorney General had ordered commitment in the Atlanta, Georgia penitentiary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AVt\">. At the trial Dr. Platkin, the Government\u2019s key witness on the insanity defense, testified that the IQ test administered by the St. Elizabeths psychologist, which he did not supervise, showed an IQ of 75, which was borderline in terms of mental defect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AdF\">. Defense counsel had read to the jury the following excerpt from Dr. Broucek\u2019s report:</p>\n<p id=\"AMi\">Section 3 \u2014 Psychological Functioning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4p\">Language skills were poorly developed and the subject showed extreme eon-cretism in handling analogies and proverbs. His general fund of information was extremely meager. His memory for past events, dates and places is vague and generally poor, which is not surprising in view of his nomadism, alcoholism and generally disorganized life style. His immediate retention and recall were extremely poor. This subject\u2019s intellectual and emotional development appears to have been arrested at a very early level. He is a narcistic, schizoid individual with borderline intelligence who has little or no apparent impulse control, and no internalized system of values to aid him in evaluating his own behavior. The diagnosis: a sociopathic personality of severe type.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"As_\">. See Perry v. United States, 90 U.S.App.D.C. 186, 195 F.2d 37 (1952); cf.
