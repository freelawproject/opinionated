Code \u00a7 22-1107 (1961). The,case was heard on October 22, 1964, when this appellant appeared with present counsel. The evidence of record disclosed that there is a restaurant at 945 K Street, N. W. in the District of Columbia known as \u201cCrow\u2019s Toe.\u201d About 2:15 to 2:45 a. m., there were some 75 people present when this appellant read some twelve to fifteen poems, utilizing a public address system.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">At the conclusion of the evidence, and after hearing argument of counsel, the court found that appellant \u201cat 2:40 in the morning, blaring over a loud speaker,\u201d had used \u201cprofane and indecent, obscene words in a loud and boisterous voice\u201d and had engaged \u201cin loud and boisterous talking, and other disorderly conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Appellant was found guilty as charged and was sentenced to pay a fine of $25 or, in lieu thereof, to serve 10 days in jail. Appellant paid the fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Appellant\u2019s application for the allowance of an appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals sought review only of the finding of the trial court that the poems he had read over the public address system in the restaurant did not enjoy the protection of the First Amendment. Appellant testified, without contradiction, that the policeman told him at the time of arrest, \u201cWe are arresting you for using vulgar and obscene language in a public place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Nevertheless, the case was tried on an information that also charged loud and boisterous talking. The record discloses that appellant\u2019s loud and boisterous talking could be heard from the street, amplified as it was by the public address system then in use. The trial court found appellant guilty of using profanity and obscenity, but also found that, as charged in the information, he had engaged in loud and boisterous talking and other disorderly conduct. We conclude that this was an independent basis of appellant\u2019s conviction, distinct from his alleged use of profane, indecent and obscene words, and further conclude it was not an abuse of discretion for the District of Columbia Court of Appeals to have denied appellant\u2019s application for the allowance of an appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the view we take of the case it becomes unnecessary for us to reach appellant\u2019s First Amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-9\">.
