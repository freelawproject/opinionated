Williams v. Ribicoff, 5 Cir. 1963, 323 F.2d 231. The issue upon which Appellants\u2019 claim for benefits depended was whether their deceased mother was a partner with their father in the \u201cWilliams Rolling Store\u201d business. Since Appellants had been required to prove the existence of a partnership by \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence, we reversed so that the Secretary could evaluate the evidence under the proper standard by which Appellants must prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>their case by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">After remand, the Examiner took additional evidence, made findings that Appellants had not proved the' existence of a partnership by a preponderance of the evidence, and again recommended that the claimed benefits be denied, which was done by the Appeals Council and thus became the final decision of the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The District Court affirmed the denial of benefits on the sole issue before it, and before us, of whether there is substantial evidence to support the administrative determination. Clinch v. Cele-brezze, 5 Cir. 1964, 328 F.2d 778; Cele-brezze v. O\u2019Brient, 5 Cir. 1963, 323 F.2d 989.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">After a careful review of the administrative record, we conclude that the decision of the Secretary' is supported by substantial evidence, the District Court correctly granted summary judgment for the Secretary, and that judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
