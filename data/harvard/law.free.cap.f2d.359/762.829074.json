S.C.A. \u00a7 405(g), as amended, appeals from an order for summary judgment of the district court, affirming a final decision of the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, herein called \u201cSecretary\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-16\">Plaintiff filed an application to establish a period of disability under \u00a7 216(i) of the Act, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 416 (i), and for disability insurance benefits under \u00a7 223 (a) (1) thereof, ibid. \u00a7 423(a) (1). His application was denied. Thereupon, plaintiff exhausted his administrative remedies but the aforesaid decision became the \u201cfinal decision\u201d of the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-17\">Recovery under the applicable statutes required that plaintiff prove a \u201cdisability\u201d under \u00a7 223(c) (2) of the Act, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 423(c) (2), which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-18\">The term \u201cdisability\u201d means inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or to be of long-continued and indefinite duration. An individual shall not be considered to be under a disability unless he furnishes such proof of the existence thereof as may be required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-19\">The- medical evidence relative to plaintiff\u2019s alleged disability consisted of medical reports and letters from various doctors and two certificates from one medical clinic. None of the doctors testified orally at the hearing before the examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-20\">Dr. R. A. Fisher, the only physician to treat plaintiff during the period preceding September 30, 1956,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> found \u201cno disability from work\u201d. Dr. Olimpo Galindo, who first examined plaintiff in July, 1957, reported that plaintiff could \u201cnot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>perform any heavy or strenuous work\u201d. Dr. Harold A. Sofield wrote that, although he felt plaintiff had \u201ca real problem\u201d in 1963, he \u201ccould not give a definite date\u201d on which this problem arose. The remaining medical evidence consisted of two \u201ccertificates of out patient care\u201d submitted by Northwestern University Medical School Clinic and reports or letters from Doctors T. F. Zmigrodski, John B. Cavenagh, Oscar Sugar and John A. Weidemann, none of which referred to plaintiff\u2019s condition on or before September 30, 1956.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">In addition to the aforesaid medical evidence, plaintiff testified before the examiner that he had undergone four years of technical training at the Illinois Institute of Technology, and that his work history was varied. Among the jobs he had held were the following: tailor, real estate salesman, milkman, independent milk dealer, delicatessen operator, tool designer, cab driver and tool grinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">All of this medical evidence and work history was considered by the examiner, who found, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-6\">\u201c * * * Dr. Fisher made no objective or subjective findings in 1957. Dr. Galindo found moderate arthritis; no edema or dyspnea, cardiac or respiratory pathology was noted; he restricted the claimant to no heavy or strenuous work. All other medical reports are dated six (6) or seven (7) years after the expiration of the claimant\u2019s earnings requirements and the doctors stated the obvious \u2014 they had no opinion of the claimant\u2019s condition in 1956.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-7\">\u201c * * * there is insufficient evidence to prove that a physical condition existed of such severity on or before September 30, 1956, when the claimant last met the earnings requirements of the Social Security Act, so as to render him incapable of engaging in some type of substantial gainful activity, such as real estate salesman or delicatessen operator.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">El] Section 205(g) of the Act, 42 U. S.G.A. \u00a7 405(g), defines the limits of judicial review by providing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the \u201c * * * findings of the Secretary as to any fact, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive * Moreover, this court, in Moon v. Cele-brezze, 340 F.2d 926, 928 (1965), has recognized plaintiff\u2019s burden on judicial review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-10\">\u201c * * * an applicant [plaintiff] must show an inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or be of long-continued and indefinite duration. Degner v. Celebrezze, 317 F.2d 819 (7th Cir. 1963). * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">We hold that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the Secretary\u2019s findings, and that plaintiff has failed to show that he is entitled to disability benefits under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">The summary judgment order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-13\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b817-14\">. The Secretary asserts that plaintiff was required to prove that he was \u201cdisabled\u201d on or before this date. The examiner found that this was the date plaintiff last met the earnings requirements of the Act. Also, the Secretary pointed out that plaintiff took issue with this date for tbe first time in the amended complaint, and that, since said complaint indicates no dispute with respect to entries on plaintiff\u2019s earnings record, plaintiff cannot contend that he was insured after September 30, 1956.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
