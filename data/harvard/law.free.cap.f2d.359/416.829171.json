By order dated June 13, 1963, the Commission instituted a formal investigation entitled \u201cPacific Coast European Conference \u2014 Increased Handling Charges.\u201d The case was assigned to a hearing examiner and is still pending. On October 1, 1963, the Commission entered the order here in question. Petitioner moved to quash on October 15,1963; the motion was denied on April 2, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-16\">The pertinent provisions of section 21 are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The order recites that it is issued pursuant to section 21, and orders production of certain documents at the Commission\u2019s office in Washington, D. C. not later than October 15, 1963. It also recites:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-17\">\u201cThe above information is required to enable the Commission to complete its investigation in this proceeding to determine whether Agreement No. 5200 should be disapproved, cancelled or modified under section 15, Shipping Act, 1916, and/or whether any or all of the increased handling charges under investigation result in or involve rates, charges, or practices which may be violative of sections 15 and 18(b) (5) of the Shipping Act, 1916, as amended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-18\">\u201cThe data presently available to the Commission relating to these increased handling charges has been found insufficient to the development of a full record upon which to judge the handling charges in light of the applicable statutory requirements as set forth in the Commission\u2019s order of investigation. The Commission therefore requires additional relevant information regarding costs incurred in performing the services for which the charges are made; the manner in which these costs are determined, including the methods of allocating labor and other cost factors; the basis for segregating overlapping cargo handling operations; the actual per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>formance of the operations for which the handling charges were made; the effects of mechanization; agreements with third persons that may or do effect [sic] the charges under investigation; the discussions, agreements and actions by respondents in regard to the handling charges being investigated; and the effect of these charges upon the movement of cargo in the commerce of the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Petitioner\u2019s basic contention is that the Commission cannot use a section 21 order for the purpose of obtaining information to be used in a contested matter pending before it, in which it is asserted that the statute has been violated. Petitioner claims that the sole method whereby the Commission can obtain information for that purpose is provided in section 27 of the Act (46 U.S.C. \u00a7 826).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commission replies that it is entitled to use both methods of obtaining information.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">We agree. The Act does not in any way limit the purpose of a section 21 order. Obviously, it can relate only to matters falling within the jurisdiction of the Commission. The pending matter is clearly of that character. The following cases, we think, support the Commission\u2019s position: Isbrandtsen-Moller Co. v. United States, 1937, 300 U.S. 139, 144, 57 S.Ct. 407, 81 L.Ed. 562; Montship Lines, Ltd. v. FMB, 1961, 111 U.S.App.D.C. 160, 295 F.2d 147, 153; cf. Far E. Conference v. FMC, 1964, 119 U.S.App.D.C. 110, 337 F.2d 146; Pacific Westbound Conference v. United States, 9 Cir., 1964, 332 F.2d 49; Kerr S.S. Co. v. United States, 2 Cir., 1960, 284 F.2d 61; see also United States v. American Union Transp., Inc., 1946, 327 U.S. 437, 66 S.Ct. 644, 90 L.Ed. 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">The Shipping Act is not unique in conferring upon the Commission both the power to require reports from those subject to its jurisdiction and the subpoena power. The Federal Trade Commission Act gives that Commission the power to require reports (\u00a7 6(b), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 46(b)) and the subpoena power (\u00a7 9, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 49). It has been held that the Commission may, in an investigation of alleged violations of section 7 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 18), require the corporations under investigation to file section 6(b) reports. United States v. St. Regis Paper Co., 2 Cir., 1960, 285 F.2d 607, 611; see also United States v. Morton Salt Co., 1950, 338 U.S. 632, 70 S.Ct. 357, 94 L.Ed. 401.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">There is nothing in Petitioner\u2019s other principal contention that the order is prohibited by section 3(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(a). Cf. Far E. Conference v. FMC, supra, 337 F.2d at 151. Nor does the Commission\u2019s order \u201cflaunt this Court\u2019s still-warm decision in\u201d FMC v. Anglo-Canadian Shipping Co., 1964, 335 F.2d 255. What the Commission there attempted was not authorized by law: what it is doing here is authorized by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-11\">. \u201cThe Federal Maritime Board * * * may require any common carrier by water, or other person subject to this chapter * * * to file with it * * * any periodical or special report, * * * or any memorandum of any facts and transactions appertaining to the business of such carrier * * * subject to this chapter.
