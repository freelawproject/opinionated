The fact remains, however, that the merits have never been reached and for all that appears there may be a valid claim for breach of contract. We believe that one more opportunity ought to be given to straighten out the procedural preliminaries so that a trial on the merits can be had. To that end we reverse the orders of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-24\">The case arises out of two contracts entered into in November 1952, between Kongsung Dyestuff Co. Ltd., a Korean corporation, and Otto Gerdau Company, Inc., a New York corporation, for the sale of 19,000 tons of rice. Appellants seek to recover for a loss totaling $380,-000 allegedly sustained as a result of ap-pellees\u2019 breach of the contracts in 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-25\">Although succeeding events have been obscured by alternative and sometimes contradictory positions taken by appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>lants, the following seems to have occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">On September 17, 1956, Kongsung delivered to Overseas Juristical Agencies, a Korean law firm, an instrument designating</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">\u201cOverseas Juristical Agencies * * our true and lawful attorney in fact, for our organization or as individuals, and in our name, place and stead, to demand and institute legal proceedings for collecting and receiving all sums of money which [are] or may become due, owing, payable and belonging or assigned to us or detained for us by any and all persons whatsoever. And, upon receipt thereof, to execute and deliver effectual receipts, releases and discharges therefor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">On March 15, 1957, Overseas delivered to John W. Staggers, an attorney and resident of Maryland, an \u201cAssignment of Claim,\u201d which reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">\u201cWhereas Otto Gerdau Company and Sambodja Corporation of New York <em>is indebted to the said assignor </em>in the sum of Three Hundred Eighty Thousand Dollars ($380,000) for and on account of Letters of Credit furnished for the purchasing of rice and whereas the said assignor has agreed to assign the said debt to the said as-signee for the sum of One Dollar ($1.00).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">Now this indenture witnesseth, that <em>in consideration of the sum of One Dollar ($1.00) paid by the said as-signee, </em>the receipt whereof the said assignor hereby acknowledges, they the said assignors, doth [sic] hereby assign to the. said assignee the said debt of Three Hundred Eighty Thousand Dollars ($380,000) now owning [sic] to them by the said debtor, and <em>all their right, title and interest both legal and equitable </em>therein.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">By the first instrument Overseas received only a general power of attorney, whereas by the second it attempted to convey an \u201cAssignment of Claim.\u201d Appellants explain this by directing our at-</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">tention to a contract between Heu, the president of Kongsung (\u201cA\u201d party), and Wooh, the president of the Far Eastern Trading Co. Inc., and the Chairman of Overseas (\u201cB\u201d party), which was signed on December 8, 1952, and reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3c\">\u201c \u2018A\u2019 party promised to operate business with \u2018B\u2019 party as <em>mutual partners for procurement </em>of foreign rice sales of which are sold to the Office of Procurement, ROK, of contracts, dated, November 15th, 1952 for 10,000 metric tons of rice and November 25th 1952 for 9,000 metric tons of rice.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">The assignment to Staggers by Wooh, acting as Chairman of Overseas, is assertedly based on this contract. If it is found that Wooh had transferable rights in the contract between Kongsung and appellees, and that he intended to convey his own rights by the assignment, then Staggers must be considered an assignee. An assignee for collection may sue as the real party in interest. See Rosenblum v. Dingfelder, 111 F.2d 406, 407-408 (2d Cir. 1940). The affidavit of Marte Previti, the president of Raritan Chemical Corporation, the New York agent of Kongsung, quotes Wooh as believing that he had conveyed to Staggers a \u201cvested interest in the claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">On January 8, 1959, Staggers, represented by appellants\u2019 present counsel, commenced this action in the Southern District of New York, and indicated his uncertainty about his status by using the following caption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-13\">\u201cJohn W. Staggers, individually and/or as assignee of and/or attorney in fact for Young H. Wooh, doing business under the firm name and style of Overseas Juristical Agencies, as-signee of and/or attorney in fact for Kongsung Dyestuff Co. Ltd.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-14\">As part of the pre-trial discovery process, the appellees requested Staggers to produce \u201call documents\u201d upon which he intended to rely. With the exception of two letters of credit and a few cablegrams, all of the documents were in Korea, in the possession of Kongsung <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>or the government. After lengthy correspondence, Staggers obtained some of the necessary documents from Kongsung, but had to send his son-in-law, Lady, to Korea in order to locate and obtain documents and records (approximately 122 items were photocopied) from the Office of Procurement of the Korean Government. Lady spent several weeks in Korea. On March 12, 1964, at about the time these preparations had been completed, and copies of the documents delivered to ap-pellees\u2019 attorneys, Staggers died.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">On March 24, 1964, Lady was appointed administrator of Staggers\u2019 estate by The Orphan\u2019s Court of Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. On July 21, 1964, the Orphan\u2019s Court authorized Lady to apply, for substitution, pursuant to Rule 25(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. On July 27, 1964, Lady moved for substitution; on the return date of the motion, Lady did not appear and the motion was marked off the calendar \u201cwithout prejudice to movant to restore on proper notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">On March 9, 1965, appellants moved to restore Lady\u2019s motion for substitution to the calendar and asked that Lady be substituted as plaintiff.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The motion was denied. We believe that the relief sought should have been granted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The initial question presented is whether there was a final decision from which we can entertain an appeal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Judge Metzner, in an order dated February 26, 1965, granted summary judgment for appellees, \u201cunless a motion to amend is made no later than 10 days after the date of entry of this order.\u201d Appellants moved to amend within the ten day period. When Judge Metzner, by an order dated May 19, 1965, adhered to this February determination, the parts of appellants\u2019 motion which asked that the complaint be amended or that a substitution of plaintiffs be permitted, were still pending. Therefore, the May 19th order could not, in itself, have been final. Technically, Judge Ryan\u2019s order of August 16, 1965 was not final because dismissal was contingent on the failure of the appeal taken from the May 19th order of Judge Metzner.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">However, it seems clear that should we dismiss both of these appeals as not taken from a final decision, the district court would then formally dismiss the complaint and the case would come back before us in precisely its present posture. It is to avoid such time consuming and unnecessarily costly procedures that the Supreme Court has recently held that the \u201crequirement of finality is to be given a 'practical rather than a technical construction.\u2019 \u201d Gillespie v. United States Steel Corp., 379 U.S. 148, 152, 85 S.Ct. 308, 311, 13 L.Ed. 199 (1964); see Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). We therefore hold that the orders are appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-13\">On April 27, 1964 appellants\u2019 attorney filed an affidavit informing the district court of Staggers\u2019 death. The motion to substitute Lady was dated July 27, and served by mail on July 28, 1964. Rule 25(a) (1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-14\">\u201cSubstitution of Parties</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aao-dedup-0\">(a) Death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-15\">(1) If a party dies and the claim is not thereby extinguished, the court may order substitution of the proper parties. * * * <em>Unless the motion </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number><em>for substitution is made not later than 90 days after the death is suggested upon the record </em>* * * <em>the action shall be dismissed as to the deceased party. </em>As amended Jan. 21, 1963, eff. July 1, 1963.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AH5\">Appellants\u2019 motion under 25(a) (1) was thus two days late.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Appellees argue that \u201cJudge Metzner was required to dismiss this action in which no application for substitution was made before the expiration of 90 days.\u201d But the history of the 1963 amendment to Rule 25 makes clear that the 90 day period was not intended to act as a bar to otherwise meritorious actions. See 4 Moore, Federal Practice H 25.01-02 (2d ed. 1965 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Rule 25(a) (1) originally read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">\u201cIf a party dies and the claim is not thereby extinguished, the court within 2 years after the death may order substitution of the proper parties\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">In 1955, the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules recommended deletion of the inflexible two year period and the insertion of a \u201creasonable time\u201d standard. In 1963, the Advisory Committee suggested the present rule and noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJMB\">\u201cPresent Rule 25(a) (1), together with present Rule 6(b), results in an inflexible requirement that an action be dismissed as to a deceased party if substitution is not carried out within a fixed period measured from the time of the death. The hardships and inequities of this unyielding requirement plainly appear from the cases. * * * The amended rul\u00e9 establishes a time limit for the motion to substitute based not upon the time of the death, but rather upon the time information of the death is provided by means of a suggestion of death upon the record, i. e. service of a statement of the fact of the death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">See Notes of Advisory Committee on the Civil Rules, 28 U.S.C. Rule 25 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">Rule 6(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure was also amended in 1963 and the prohibition against extending the time for taking action under Rule 25 was eliminated. The Advisory Committee on the Civil Rules noted: \u201cIt is intended that the court shall have discretion to enlarge that period.\u201d The amendments of Rules 6(b) and 25(a) (1) provided needed flexibility. It was assumed that discretionary extensions would be liberally granted. Movants under Rule 25 can ordinarily control when a death is \u201csuggested upon the record\u201d and appellants\u2019 attorney was under no obligation to file his affidavit of Staggers\u2019 death on the date he did. He could have filed it later.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">Lady\u2019s motion for substitution should have been considered timely under Rule 6(b) (2). Lady had to obtain the permission of the Orphan\u2019s Court of Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, before applying for substitution; permission was obtained on July 21 and the application served July 28. The real parties in interest are difficult to ascertain even at this date, and numerous, widely dispersed potential claimants had to be consulted before appellants\u2019 attorney could ascertain who was to be substituted for Staggers. Of crucial importance is the fact that appellees suffered no prejudice from the two day delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">Appellants\u2019 application to amend the complaint to name new plaintiffs, Lady and Kongsung, pursuant to Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, should also have been granted. Rule 15(a) may be used to substitute new plaintiffs. See Hackner v. Guaranty Trust Co., 117 F.2d 95 (2d Cir.), cert, denied, 313 U.S. 559, 61 S.Ct. 835, 85 L.Ed. 1520 (1941) (new plaintiff allowed to come into a case by amendment, although action dismissed as to all original plaintiffs because of lack of jurisdictional amount).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-13\">The Supreme Court has recently admonished :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-14\">\u201cRule 15(a) declares that leave to amend \u2018shall be freely given when justice so requires\u2019; this mandate is to be heeded. See generally, 3 Moore, Federal Practice (2d ed. 1948), HIT 15.08, 15.10. If the underlying faets or circumstances relied upon by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>plaintiff may be a proper subject relief, he ought to be afforded an opportunity to test his claim on the merits. In the absence of any apparent or declared reason \u2014 such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc. \u2014 the leave sought should, as the rules require, be \u2018freely given.\u2019 Of course, the grant or denial of an opportunity to amend is within the discretion of the District Court, but outright refusal to grant the leave without any justifying reason appearing for the denial is not an exercise of discretion ; it is merely abuse of that discretion and inconsistent with the spirit of the Federal Rules.\u201d Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 230, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962). of</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-2\">Here the amendment was proposed approximately a year after Staggers\u2019 death. There is no hint of bad faith or indication that appellees were prejudiced by this delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\">Rule 15(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-4\">\u201cRelation Back of Amendments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">Whenever the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, the amendment relates back to the date of the original pleading.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">No matter who the plaintiffs are, the \u201ctransactions\u201d with which we are concerned are those which led to the establishment and breach of the two rice contracts, signed in November 1952, as set forth in the \u201coriginal pleading.\u201d There is no meaningful statute of limitations problem here; the claims of all potential plaintiffs relate back to the date of the original pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The documents, exhibits and affidavits submitted to the district court present a confusing picture as to who are the real parties in interest. For example, at various stages of the proceedings, both ap-pellees and appellants have argued that Staggers was not an assignee but merely an \u201cattorney in fact.\u201d Appellants presented a document, dated October 22, 1964, in which Kongsung assigned all its rights against appellees to Raritan Chemical Corporation. Our decision is in no way intended to resolve these factual disputes. Appellees may plead the assignment to Raritan Chemical Corporation as a defense against Kongsung. They may challenge the chain of title under which Lady claims as administrator. All of these are issues which can most appropriately be resolved by the trial court. At a trial the judge will be able properly to sift through the numerous documents involved, and can take the testimony of Wooh and others concerned with these transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-9\">. Throughout these proceedings Mr. Ramey has acted as attorney for all appellants. His motions were intended to protect the interests of Kongsung and Lady as well as those of Staggers and Raritan Chemical Corporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b349-10\">. Appellants also present several alternative arguments premised upon Staggers being an \u201cattorney in fact,\u201d and ending with a request that Raritan Chemical Corporation be substituted as plaintiff for Staggers. As to these arguments we need only note that both Raritan Chemical Corporation and appellee Otto Gerdau Company, Inc. are New York corporations. If Raritan Chemical Corporation were made a plaintiff the complete diversity necessary for this action to continue in federal courts would be lost.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
