Appellant claimed that heroin is not a narcotic drug within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4704(a) under which he was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>The Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4731(a) (2) defines a narcotic drug as including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-4\">\u201cAny compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, or preparation of opium, isonipecaine, coca leaves, or opiate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"abi-dedup-0\">Heroin is a derivative of opium, and therefore a narcotic drug within the purview of the relevant statute. See Naval v. United States, 278 F.2d 611, 612 n. 2 (9th Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Appellant in his second motion, Docket No. 30056, asserted that his guilty plea had been induced and coerced by promises of a suspended sentence made by appellant\u2019s court appointed counsel and an Assistant United States Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\"> A pre-sentencing colloquy between a trial judge and defendant, of the type \u201cconclusively\u201d relied upon by the district court here, is \u201cevidential on the issue of voluntariness, * * * not conclusive.\u201d United States ex rel. McGrath v. LaVallee, 319 F.2d 308, 314 (2d Cir. 1963); see United States v. Tateo, 214 F.Supp. 560, 564 (S.D.N.Y.1963). The \u201cmaking of such promises [as alleged here] in bad faith\u201d may be trickery so flagrant as to violate appellant\u2019s constitutional rights. United States ex rel. Wissenfeld v. Wilkins, 281 F.2d 707, 712 (2d Cir. 1960); see Machibroda v. United States, 368 U.S. 487, 82 S.Ct. 510, 7 L.Ed.2d 473 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">We reverse because the district court in rejecting appellant\u2019s petition did not have before it any reply by the government to the allegations of the petition either denying them or dealing with them otherwise. For all that appears from the record as we now have it, the government may be prepared to concede the validity of the petitioner\u2019s position. On remand, the district court, after receiving the government\u2019s reply, will be in a position to determine whether a hearing on appellant\u2019s motion is needed. See, United States ex rel. Rambert v. New York, 358 F.2d 715 (2d Cir. decided April 1, 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">The first order is affirmed; the second is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b474-10\">BLUMENFELD, District Judge (concurring) :</author>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">I concur in the reversal and remand for further proceedings, but I would make it plain that a hearing is required if the government denies the petitioner\u2019s allegation that an Assistant United States Attorney promised him that he would recommend a suspended sentence. See Walker v. Johnston, 312 U.S. 275, 287, 61 S.Ct. 574, 85 L.Ed. 830 (1941); United States v. Hayman, 342 U.S. 205, 223, 72 S.Ct. 263, 96 L.Ed. 232 (1952); United States v. Paglia, 190 F.2d 445, 448 (2d Cir. 1951).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
