The Commission, being of the view that CATV systems are not common carriers within the meaning of Title II, summarily dismissed the complaint. We affirm the Commission\u2019s action, for reasons developed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-22\">Petitioners urge that CATV systems are common carriers within the meaning of the Communications Act, and that the FCC is therefore required to apply the provisions of Title II of that Act, e. g., requiring CATV systems to obtain certificates of public convenience and necessity, and file charges with the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-23\">In approaching the problem of statutory interpretation before us, we show \u201cgreat deference to the interpretation given the statute by the officers or agency charged with its administration. \u2018To sustain the Commission\u2019s application of this statutory term, we need not find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>that its construction is the only reasonable one or even that it is the result we would have reached had the question arisen in the first instance in judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">We think such deference to the agency\u2019s interpretation of its governing statute is reinforced where, as here, the legislative history is silent, or at best unhelpful, with respect to the point in question. Congress in passing the Communications Act in 1934 could not, of course, anticipate the variety and nature of methods of communication by wire or radio that would come into existence in the decades to come. In such a situation, the expert agency entrusted with administration of a dynamic industry is entitled to latitude in coping with new developments in that industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\"> The Commission, responsive to the increasing impact of CATV, has undertaken a system of regulation in the public interest. It began with the CATV systems served by microwave carriers,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and it now has asserted jurisdiction over all CATV systems under the general provisions of the Act, and issued regulations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Commission had already announced proposed rules, predicated on such jurisdiction, at the time it dismissed petitioners\u2019 complaint.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Its holding that CATV systems are not common carriers thus comes before us in a context of regulation of the CATV systems under different provisions of the Communications Act. In a statutory scheme in which Congress has given an agency various bases of jurisdiction and various tools with which to protect the public interest, the agency is entitled to some leeway in choosing which jurisdictional base and which regulatory tools will be most effective in advancing the Congressional objective. It is the FCC\u2019s position that regulating CATV systems as adjuncts of the nation\u2019s broadcasting system is a more appropriate avenue for Commission action than the wide range of regulation implicit in the common carrier treatment urged by petitioners. This seems to us a rational and hence permissible choice by the agency.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"amv-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b338-6\">. Udall v.

We of course do not pass judgment on the validity of the broad jurisdictional base asserted by the Commission in its <em>Notice of Inquiry and Proposed Rulemalcing </em>of April 1965, and in the recently issued rules with respect to all CATV systems. See 1 F.C.C.2d at 478-82. But the basis is already established insofar as microwave-served CATV systems are concerned. Carter Mountain Transmission Corp. v. FCC, 116 U.S.App.D.C. 93, 321 F.2d 359, cert. denied, 375 U.S. 951, 84 S.Ct. 442, 11 L.Ed.2d 312 (1963); Idaho Microwave, Inc. v. FCC, 122 U.S. App.D.C. ___, 352 F.2d 729 (1965). Certainly the Commission\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction over CATV systems by its order of March 4, 1966, is substantial enough to serve as a basis for declining to regulate them as common carriers.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
