He stated he had an eighth grade education.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-18\">Plaintiff fell from a third story window, in May, 1962, and sustained a Colies fracture of the right wrist and fractures of the jaw and right femur. The bones were set and the fractures are now well healed. The pin has been removed from the leg. There is stiffness, however, in his right leg and his right wrist is weak. There was no evidence of any heart impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-19\">There is an absence of evidence that plaintiff\u2019s injuries have prevented him from engaging in any substantial gainful occupation. No physician stated that plaintiff was so disabled, and the Secretary made no finding to that effect. There was no substantial evidence of neurological abnormalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-20\">Under the circumstances we are of the opinion that it was error to remand for the allowance of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-21\">In our opinion, this cause must be remanded to the Secretary to permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>the taking of additional evidence by either party on the subject of disability, and the nature and extent thereof, whether it is such as to prevent plaintiff from pursuing his regular occupation, and if so, what other types of work he can perform and the availability of such work. The Secretary should make findings of fact on each of said subjects. Erickson v. Ribicoff, 305 F.2d 638 (6th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Secretary for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b902-22\">. The claimed injury to the left knee was doubtless a mistake since plaintiff\u2019s right leg, and not his left, was injured.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
