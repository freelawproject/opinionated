At the time of the theft the shipment was being transported from New Jersey to Arkansas by the defendant in his employer's truck. The only point of error urged on this appeal is the admission in evidence, over objection, of certain waybills or shipping orders pertaining to the interstate shipment prepared by the shippers and signed by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-21\">Upon consideration of the record, the briefs and oral arguments of counsel, we perceive no reversible error. Therefore, the judgment below will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
