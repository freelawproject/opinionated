The third trial is set for April 20, 1966. Appellant now moves to amend and clarify that part of our opinion in the second appeal which sustains the admissibility of certain confessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-21\">In both trials Lieutenant Culpepper\u2019s testimony of appellant\u2019s confessions was admitted in evidence. On the first appeal, decided April 13, 1962, the court <em>en banc, </em>reversing on other grounds, said of these confessions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-22\">\u201c * * * There was no suggestion on the record that the Naples statement was other than completely voluntary and spontaneous. The trial judge correctly ruled that the Naples admissions to Lieutenant Culpepper might be received in evidence.\u201d 113 U.S.App. D.C. 281, 283-284, 307 F.2d 618, 620-621 (1962).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-23\">On the second appeal, the admissibility of these confessions was again challenged. While reversing on other grounds, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-24\">\u201cOn the former appeal, we held the substance of this testimony was not excluded by Mallory v. United States, 354 U.S. 449, 77 S.Ct. 1356, 1 L.Ed.2d 1479 (1957). * * * Without considering the merits of this holding, we apply it as the law of the case to sustain admission of this testimony.\u201d 120 U.S.App.D.C. 123, 125, 344 F.2d 508, 510 (1964).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-25\">In any new trial, the \u201cpractice\u201d of the law of the case<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> would not operate to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>bar consideration of the admissibility of these confessions based upon material facts not heretofore adduced<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or supervening law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">The present motion to clarify is therefore denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">BASTIAN, Senior Circuit Judge, concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-17\">. The term \u201claw of the case\u201d \u201cmerely expresses the practice of courts generally to refuse to reopen what has been decided, not a limit to their power.\u201d Messenger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>v. Anderson, 225 U.S. 436, 32 S.Ct. 739, 56 L.Ed. 1152 (1912). Unlike <em>res judicata, </em>the practice of law of the ease does not compel rigid adherence to the prior decision \u201cbecause when a court becomes convinced that its declared law of the ease is erroneous and would work a grave injustice, it should have the power to apply a different rule of law in the interest of getting the very case before it settled in a just manner.\u201d IB Moore, Federal Practice f 0.404 [1], p. 405 (2d ed. 1965). Thus the practice is not to be followed in the face of a new and supervening rule of law. IB Moore, supra, IT 0.404 [10], at p. 575 and cases therein cited. Moreover, the practice only \u201capplies to principles of law\u201d enunciated by the court, IB Moore, supra, f 0.404 [1], at p. 402, and does not bar consideration of the prior decision in the light of new evidence.
