Rev. Code of 1954 Section 6321 against certain properties now owned by S. 0. and Maxine Smith. The Smiths acquired the properties from Maxine\u2019s uncle, Samuel R. Bradley, after the District Director had made assessment against Bradley, but before notice of the Government\u2019s claim was filed for record. The court below ruled that the Smiths were \u201cpurchasers\u201d of the properties, and thus protected from the Government\u2019s lien by virtue of Code Section 6323(a). Unable to ascertain error in the court\u2019s determination, we approve and affirm its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">The facts upon which this controversy arose may be simply stated. On April 15, 1960, Bradley was assessed for income taxes of $11,415.43. However notice of this claim was not filed for record until April 13, 1961. By instrument dated December 29, 1959, and recorded on August 20, 1960, Bradley assigned to the Smiths properties valued in excess of $25,000. As consideration for this assignment the Smiths paid Bradley $10 cash and assumed Bradley\u2019s indebtedness to the Hancock Bank of Gulfport, Mississippi, consisting of a demand note in the face amount of $10,000, but previously reduced to between $8,000 and $9,000. The Smiths were unaware of the Government\u2019s tax claim at the time of the assignment. At about the time it filed its tax claim, the Government notified the Smiths that it was asserting a lien against the properties assigned to them by Bradley. On March 12, 1963, the Government levied on the properties in question, precipitating this suit by the Smiths to remove the Government\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">Based on the pleadings, depositions, and affidavits, the Smiths moved for summary judgment, contending that they were \u201cpurchasers\u201d within the protection of Code Section 6323(a). The motion was denied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The case was then submitted to the court upon substantially the same record. The court ruled that the Smiths acquired the properties for a \u201cvalid, legal [consideration] * * * sufficient to give full effect and validity to the conveyance\u201d; found that they were \u201cpurchasers\u201d within Section 6323(a); and cancelled the Government\u2019s claim. The Government seeks reversal of this ruling, arguing that the consideration given by the Smiths was so inadequate as to prevent their being \u201cpurchasers\u201d within Section 6323(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">To assist the Government in its tax collection efforts, federal statutes long have provided for Government liens upon the properties of the delinquent taxpayer. Currently Section 6321, Int.Rev. Code of 1954, states that upon failure or refusal of a taxpayer to pay the taxes assessed against him, the Government shall have a lien on all property belonging to him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Taxes were assessed against Bradley at a time when he owned the properties here in question; upon Bradley\u2019s failure to pay the taxes, a lien arose in favor of the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">Section 6323(a) protects certain persons from the Government\u2019s otherwise all-inclusive lien; it reads \u201cthe lien imposed by section 6321 shall not be valid as against any mortgagee, pledgee, purchaser, or judgment creditor until notice thereof has been filed * * The Smiths acquired the properties in question from Bradley <em>prior to </em>the filing of the Government\u2019s lien. Purportedly this acquisition was by way of \u201cpurchase\u201d. Thus the pivotal question is whether the Smiths are \u201cpurchasers\u201d, for if they are, plainly the Government\u2019s lien is invalid.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b980-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>While Section 6323(a) excepts \u201cpurchasers\u201d from the Section 6321 lien, it does not define this term. Speaking to this point, the Supreme Court, in United States v. Scovil, 348 U.S. 218, 221, 75 S.Ct. 244, 247, 99 L.Ed. 271 (1955), declared that \u201c [a] purchaser * * * usually means one who acquires title for a <em>valuable consideration </em>in the manner of vendor and vendee.\u201d (Emphasis added). Accord, United States v. L. R. Foy Constr. Co., 300 F.2d 207, 210 (10th Cir. 1962); United States v. Hoper, 242 F.2d 468, 470-471 (7th Cir. 1957); Marteney v. United States, 245 F.2d 135, 138 (10th Cir. 1957); United States v. Hawkins, 228 F.2d 517, 519, 16 Alaska 36 (9th Cir. 1955); National Ref. Co. v. United States, 160 F.2d 951, 955 (8th Cir. 1947)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Of course determination of who are \u201cpurchasers\u201d does not depend upon classification under state law; the meaning of a federal statute is for the federal courts to decide.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But the Court\u2019s declaration clearly reflects its recognition that the class of persons who take priority over the Government\u2019s unrecorded tax lien under Section 6323(a) are those who are \u201cpurchasers\u201d in the ordinary sense. United States v. Hawkins, supra. Cf. United States v. R. F. Ball Constr. Co., 355 U.S. 587, 593, 78 S.Ct. 442, 2 L.Ed.2d 510 (1958) (dissenting opinion); United States v. Security Trust &amp; Sav. Bank, 340 U.S. 47, 52, 71 S.Ct. Ill, 95 L.Ed. 53 (1950) (concurring opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">The district court defined purchaser as \u201ca vendee or buyer who has purchased property for a valuable consideration.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus the legal standard whereby the court tested the Smiths\u2019 status as \u201cpurchasers\u201d was in complete accord with that established by the Supreme Court. The court carefully reviewed the facts presented to it. It then found that the consideration given by the Smiths, while small, was not nominal, but rather was a \u201cvaluable consideration.\u201d This finding was based on the fact that the Smiths not only paid $10 cash to Bradley, but also assumed Bradley\u2019s indebtedness to the Hancock Bank, and thereby became personally liable for this obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-11\">Quite obviously the Smiths got a bargain; indeed the consideration paid could hardly be termed \u201cadequate\u201d. But this does not, as apparently the Government contends, prevent the Smiths from being \u201cpurchasers\u201d within Section 6323 (a). Section 6323(a) does not require, nor do the decisions construing it, \u201cadequate\u201d consideration to make one a purchaser within its provisions. We see no reason to write into the language of this section something which Congress, although fully capable of doing so,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> chose to omit. See United States v. Beaver Run Coal Co., 99 F.2d 610, 613 (3d Cir. 1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-12\">A \u201cpurchaser\u201d remains one who acquires property for a valuable consideration. The district court concluded that valuable consideration was in fact given by the Smiths. We cannot say this finding is clearly erroneous. Accordingly we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b979-12\">. 233 F.Supp. 925 (S.D.Miss.1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b979-13\">.
