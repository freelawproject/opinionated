Securities and Exchange Commission, 353 F.2d 905 (D.C.Cir. 1965). Noting, as we do, that the Supreme Court has just denied certio-rari in the District of Columbia Circuit case, Alabama Electric Cooperative Inc. v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 86 S.Ct. 1273, and agreeing with the reasoning of the Court of Appeals in that case, we conclude that nothing would be gained by a further elaboration of the legal principles involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-17\">We affirm the order of the Securities and Exchange Commission of July 29, 1965 here complained of.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
