The evidence indicated that shortly before his discharge Robinson had solicited union memberships from several other employees. It further indicated that the discharge was summary and given without reason. The company later attributed the discharge to poor attitude and failure to maintain tire pressure on the truck driven by Robinson. These were not normally cause for discharge, and it appears that his check for final wages was being prepared at the same time as the tires on his truck were being checked.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-26\">We find that there is substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support the Board\u2019s finding that Robinson was discharged for union activity. The petition of the company to set aside the Board\u2019s finding and order is denied, and the cross petition of the Board to enforce its order granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-27\">Petition denied and order of the Board enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-28\">Petition denied, order of Board enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
