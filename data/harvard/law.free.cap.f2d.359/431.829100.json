The basis of the claim of negligence against the appellee ship owner was the alleged failure to provide proper medical care to the deceased seaman while aboard ship.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-26\">The District Court expressed doubt that there was sufficient proof of a causal connection between the seaman\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>death and his illness and treatment; but for the purpose of passing upon the appellee\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, assumed that such causal connection had been established. The motion for directed verdict was granted because the trial court concluded that there was a failure of proof of any negligence on the part of the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">In our review of the action of the trial court, all conflicts in the evidence, or in the inferences which may be drawn therefrom, must be resolved against the appellee and in favor of the appellant. A careful review of the record convinces us that the trial court did not commit error in granting the motion of the appellee for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
