The District Court ruled that the appellant\u2019s plea of guilty and his testimony corroborating statements which he had made in an earlier confession made immaterial his contentions that he was not represented by counsel at the preliminary hearing and arraignment when he, in each instance, pleaded not guilty. The District Court further found \u201cthere is no evidence whatever that the notes of testimony in the State Court have been changed or altered in any way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">On review of the record we find no error. The Order of the District Court denying the petition for a wit of habeas corpus will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
