That court declined to order support payments for petitioner because it found her husband was \u201cjustified in leaving the marital abode\u201d because of his wife\u2019s \u201cextravagance and cruel conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ALo\">The District of Columbia Court of Appeals (DCCA) affirmed. Lattisaw v. Lattisaw, 210 A.2d 11 (1965). On petition for allowance of an appeal to this court, we remanded the case so that the D. C. Court of Appeals might consider whether the denial of support to petitioner on the ground of misconduct was permissible, absent a determination of the effect of such denial on her ability to provide proper care for the children entrusted to her custody. Lattisaw v. Lattisaw, No. 19,417, Order of September 20, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-24\">On September 29, 1965, the D. C. Court of Appeals entered a memorandum adhering to its opinion, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-25\">In our opinion, the record makes plain that the trial court determined the greatest amount that the husband could reasonably pay, and ordered that such sum be paid for support of the children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlW\">With this amplification of the trial court\u2019s action,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the decision of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals does not merit further review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b313-12\">. D.C.Code \u00a7 16-415 (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b313-13\">. The trial court did not make specific findings of fact on the husband\u2019s earnings and ability to pay. Had it done so, petitioner\u2019s application for appeal could have been- given more expeditious treatment. Such specific findings have been held necessary as a predicate for a finding of contempt for failure to comply- with the order. See Truslow v. Truslow, 212 A.2d 763 (DCCA 1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b313-28\">. See Rule 1, Rules Governing Review of Cases from the DCCA. See also Mazique v.
