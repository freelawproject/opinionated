We vacated the judgments and remanded for entry of judgments in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdicts. 333 F.2d 621 (1964) cert. denied 379 U.S. 960, 85 S.Ct. 648, 13 L.Ed.2d 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-19\">Following the remand the District Judge entered judgments on the verdicts. Motions for a new trial were then filed and denied by District Judge Freeman in a well considered opinion. We are in full agreement with Judge Freeman\u2019s opinion, which we think adequately and correctly disposes of all issues property raised in the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-20\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
