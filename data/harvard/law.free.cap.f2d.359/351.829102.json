Fred Meyer, Inc., an Oregon corporation, operates a chain of thirteen retail supermarkets in Portland, Oregon, and the immediate vicinity, in which it sells grocery products, drugs, variety items, and a limited line of clothing. Its sales in 1957 exceeded $40 million, making it, during the relevant period, the second largest seller of all goods in the area. In 1960 it made one-fourth of all retail food sales in the Portland area, by its own claim selling to \u201c75% of Oregon\u2019s population\u201d through its supermarkets located \u201cin every neighborhood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-16\">In about 1936 petitioner commenced an annual promotion, called the \u201ccoupon book promotion,\u201d beginning in September and ending four weeks later. The mechanics of the coupon book are simple. Meyer prints a book, usually containing 72 pages, each page of which features a single product. These pages are the \u201ccoupons\u201d and each entitles the customer to the specially reduced price there stated. The customer buys the book for the nominal sum of ten cents and must surrender the appropriate coupon when making his purchase of goods. It is a successful promotion; Meyer sold 138,700 books in 1957 and 121,270 in 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>The cost of the books and related advertising expenditures<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was met only in part by revenue from their sale; the rest was supplied, in amounts approximating <em>total </em>costs, by participating suppliers who usually paid, at the very least, a flat rate of $350 per coupon page. These payments were made sometimes in cash, sometimes in price discounts on goods purchased for resale during the promotion, and sometimes by replacement of a predetermined portion of the goods so sold. Some of the suppliers further underwrote the promotion by granting volume-based reductions, replacing goods sold, or redeeming coupons in cash at an agreed rate. Certain of these, as well as other unrelated promotional payments which constitute part of the subject matter of the complaint, are detailed in Part I of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">As a consequence of the solicitation and receipt of these payments, the Commission issued a two-count complaint against petitioners. Count I, based on the coupon book promotion, charged a violation of section 2(f) of the Clayton Act by inducing and receiving \u201cdiscriminatory prices, discounts, allowances, rebates and terms and conditions of sale\u201d which they knew or should have known were granted in violation of section 2(a) of that Act. Count II charged a violation of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act by the inducement of promotional aid, of the type forbidden by section 2(d) of the Clayton Act, with reference to both the coupon book promotion and other, unrelated promotions. These statutes are set out in pertinent part in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">The Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision found the violations as charged. The Commission affirmed and issued the cease and desist order which, exceptions to it having been rejected, is now here for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">Meyer raises six basic questions here, and levels a broadside attack on the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the Commission\u2019s findings. Those questions are (1) whether the supplier payments here are cognizable at all under section 2(a), (2) whether section 2(d) requires suppliers to refrain from discriminating among customers who occupy different functional levels or varying combinations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>of functional levels, (3) whether Meyer knew or had reason to know of the unlawfulness of the payments it induced, (4) whether inducement of disproportionate promotional payments is cognizable under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, and (5) whether the Commission\u2019s cease and desist order was improperly directed to the corporation\u2019s officers as individuals, or (6) was improper for failure to reasonably relate to the practices found to be unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">I. THE EVIDENCE.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Complaint counsel chose transactions with five suppliers \u2014 Burlington Industries, Inc., Cannon Mills Company, TriValley Packing Association, Idaho Canning Company, and Phillip Morris, Inc. \u2014during 1956,1957, and 1958, to ground the complaint. Meyer asserts,, with respect to each supplier, that the proof is vitally insufficient to support the findings. We examine the transactions seri-atim, stating the facts as the Commission found them.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">A. <em>Burlington Industries, Inc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Azm\">Burlington participated in the 1957 and 1958 coupon book promotions, agreeing in the spring of each year to reduce its prices to Meyer by, respectively, 50-94 cents and 75 cents per dozen pairs of nylon hose. The disfavored customer, Lipman, Wolfe &amp; Co., a Portland retail department store, received no discount on its contemporaneous purchases.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Meyer argues first that since these purchases were arranged at times separated by substantial intervals, though completed by contemporaneous purchase orders and deliveries, there cannot be that comparability which the statute demands as a basis for a finding of discrimination and injury to competition. The Commission responds that the Act contemplates competition in distribution, which it found to exist, and that the time of purchase by different customers is only evidence bearing on the existence of that competition. Its contention finds support in Hartley &amp; Parker, Inc. v. Florida Beverage Corp., 5 Cir., 1962, 307 F.2d 916, 921. A substantial time interval indicates only that different, prices might have been caused by different market conditions, rather than by an accomplished intent to discriminate. Here the record indicates that market conditions had not changed materially.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such a determination is more properly for the Commission than, for the courts. See Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 1951, 340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456; Carter Prods., Inc. v. FTC, 9 Cir., 1959, 268 F.2d 461, 492, cert. denied, 1959, 361 U.S. 884, 80 S.Ct. 155, 4 L.Ed. 2d 120. We cannot say that the determination here is not supported by substantial evidence; it is, therefore, conclusive, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 21(c), 45(c); see Universal Camera, supra; cf. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1009(e) [Administrative Procedure Act \u00a7 10(e) (B) (5).] Atalanta Trading Corp. v. FTC, 2 Cir., 1958, 258 F.2d 365, cited by Meyer, is not contrary. There isolated and non-recurring sales of particular products had been made, without allowances, to competitors of the allegedly favored customer several months before and after the sales to the favored customer. The court, contrary to the Commission\u2019s construction of the law, held that these facts standing alone could not establish a prima facie case of discrimination because such a rule would force a supplier to elect to give promotional allowances at the time of the first sale of a product or not at all, a result which would \u201cstifle rather than encourage competition and have the practical effect of outlawing all promotional allowances.\u201d Id. at 371. But here the sales are of a single, fairly standardized item, widely sold in the area, and recur frequently during the years involved. Hence <em>Atalanta </em>is not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number><em>Meyer next </em>contends that the evidence fails to show that the hosiery purchased by it and by Lipman, Wolfe was of \u201clike grade and quality,\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 13(a), Atalanta Trading Corp. v. FTC, 2 Cir., 1958, 258 F.2d 365, 369-370) asserting that the fact that it had entered additional specifications on its purchase orders compels the conclusion that a different grade and quality resulted. However, the record fails to show that these changes, if in fact made, produced any difference in the marketability, appearance, durability, cost or manner of manufacture, or other indicia of \u201cgrade and quality\u201d of the goods. Moreover, in Burlington\u2019s invoices to both customers the hose are identified by identical style numbers. This, we think, is sufficient to permit the inference that the goods themselves were identical. Cf. Central Paper Co. v. Southwick, 6 Cir., 1932, 56 F.2d 593, 597-598; Straus v. Victor Talking Machine Co., 2 Cir., 1924, 297 F. 791, 804-805; see also United States v. Bryan, 1950, 339 U.S. 323, 332, 70 S.Ct. 724, 94 L.Ed. 884. That each customer specified and received private label packaging does not, without more \u2014 and \u25a0\u201cmore\u201d is lacking here \u2014 change that conclusion. See Hartley &amp; Parker, Inc. v. Florida Beverage Corp., 5 Cir., 1962, 307 F.2d 916, 923.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Finally, Meyer makes much of the disparity in quantities purchased by it and by Lipman, Wolfe &amp; Co., asserting that by reason of such disparity a presumption of cost justification arises which complaint counsel should but failed to rebut. Such arguments are properly addressed to the proposition that Meyer had no knowledge or reason to know that the .allowances it received were discriminatory, and so we relegate consideration of them to that portion of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">B. <em>Cannon Mills Company.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">Cannon Mills is said to- have violated sections 2(a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 2(d) of the Act by granting, at Meyer\u2019s instance, a 10 cents per dozen allowance on fingertip towels sold during the 1956 promotion. These towels, regularly sold at retail for 23 cents each, were advertised for sale at 7 for $1.00. Meyer purchased 2,000 dozen in March and another 5,500 dozen in October of 1956, while Roberts Brothers, the Portland retail department store allegedly discriminated against, purchased a total of 600 dozen (bearing the same style number as those purchased by Meyer) in April, June, and November of that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">Meyer again claims that identity of style numbers on billing invoices is insufficient proof of likeness of grade and quality. For the reasons already set out, we disagree. The Commission was justified in concluding that the towels were identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">A somewhat more substantial question is raised by the claim that the record fails to show simultaneity of stocking, handling, or resale of the towels, hence the required competition has not been proved. But again we think that the Commission, more expert than we in the mechanics of retail merchandising, could and did reasonably conclude that such competition existed. A knowledgeable witness, in fact, so testified, and we have previously held substantially identical evidence sufficient to uphold a similar finding, Tri-Valley Packing Ass\u2019n v. FTC, 9 Cir., 1964, 329 F.2d 694, 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>C. <em>Tri-Vattey Packing Association.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The Commission\u2019s case here is that Meyer purchased, for the 1957 coupon book promotion, 2,200 cases of its private label \u201cMy-Te-Fine\u201d fancy grade sliced and halved peaches from Tri-Valley, concededly at the same time that Hudson House, a disfavored wholesaler, purchased 175 cases of identically described merchandise under its own private label from the same source. TriValley agreed to pay Meyer $350 (in merchandise or cash, at its option) for a coupon page and to redeem, in merchandise, every third can sold on the coupon's \u201cBuy two cans and get one free\u201d offer. No such offer was made or made available on proportionally equal terms to Hudson House.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Meyer again founds its attack on the proposition that \u201clike grade and quality\u201d were not sufficiently proved, pointing to evidence in the record tending to show that the quality of peaches sold under the general classification of \u201cfancy\u201d varies according to where, when, and by whom the peaches were grown and packed.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">But a Portland retailer witness specifically testified that he competed directly, in peaches of the grade and quality purchased from Hudson House, with a nearby Meyer store. And the fact that the goods were identically described on the supplier\u2019s invoices to Meyer and to Hudson House sufficiently establishes commercial identity or commercial fungibility, which is all that the RobinsonPatman Act demands.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To require the level of proof for which Meyer contends would be to require the impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">Meyer further argues that the proof is insufficient because it is not shown that these Tri-Valley peaches made their way to customers of Hudson- House. We agree. <em>Tri-Valley Packing Ass\u2019n, </em>supra, at 708-711, made it clear that competition at the same functional level must be shown. Here, Meyer, an integrated operation, and Hudson House, a wholesaler, do not compete at the same functional level, hence Tri-Valley goods must be directly traced to Hudson\u2019s customers to show that Tri-Valley has dealt \u201cdirectly\u201d with them, that they are \u201cindirect customers\u201d of Tri-Valley and therefore in competition with Meyer in the sale of comparable goods. Ibid.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That has not been shown. In consequence, the proof must be held insufficient as to a 2(d)-2(f) charge involving Tri-Valley. Whether it is insufficient support for a 2(a)-2(f) charge or for a Federal Trade Commission Act \u00a7 5 charge is considered later in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-13\">D. <em>Idaho Canning Company.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-14\">Meyer'does not, as it cannot, dispute the sufficiency of proof of simultaneity of sale and comparability of grade and quality of canned corn sold to Meyer and to Hudson House and Wad-hams &amp; Co., the nonfavored wholesaler purchasers. Idaho Canning\u2019s participation in Meyer\u2019s 1957 coupon book promotion consisted of payment in merchandise of $350 for a coupon book page and redemption in free goods of coupons received by Meyer offering one free can of corn for every two purchased, a transaction substantially identical with that of Tri-Valley. Idaho\u2019s participation was solicited by Meyer, and it made no com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>parable offer to Hudson House or Wad-hams &amp; Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Equally here, the proof is vitally insufficient to support a 2(d)-2(f) charge in that the goods were traced only to the wholesaler. Robinson-Patman doctrine has not yet progressed to a point which allows the Commission to infer an \u201cindirect customer\u201d relationship from the mere fact that goods were supplied to a middleman, at least where those goods became inextricably mixed with other, identical goods purchased from other suppliers before their resale to retailers. No more than that has been proved here.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">E. <em>Phillip Morris, Inc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The complaint charges violations involving Phillip Morris of \u00a7 2(d) and of \u00a7 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, but not of \u00a7 2(a). These alleged violations were the solicitation and receipt by Meyer of (1) a $500 payment for participation in Meyer\u2019s 1956 \u201cGift Days\u201d promotion; (2) a $400 payment on April 26, 1957 in connection with Meyer\u2019s 1957 \u201cThrift Days\u201d promotion; (3) a payment of $800 (received on October 24, 1956) for Meyer\u2019s promotion of Parliament cigarettes during September, 1956; and (4) payment of $150 per month during most of 1956 for promotion of Phillip Morris tobacco products. Meyer does not contend that the payments were not made. It does say, however, that mere proof of payments is insufficient proof of a \u00a7 2(d) violation in the absence of a showing that proportionally equal payments were not made to competitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">The evidence before the Commission on this point is indeed scanty. Meyer\u2019s tobacco buyer testified that she had initiated the negotiations leading, upon submission of bills to Phillip Morris, to receipt of these payments. A Phillip Morris representative characterized these payments, by implication, as \u201cspecial deals.\u201d He testified that these \u201cspecial deals\u201d were not offered to his company\u2019s customers as a matter of course nor publicized in any way, and that he could not recall offering similar proposals to customers other than Meyer. The general manager of Oregon Piggly Wiggly Company, an allegedly disfavored Portland retailer, testified that that organization had received no promotional allowances from Phillip Morris in or for promotional activities during September, 1956 and that the only payment received<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> during the months of March through May of 1957 was a $357.75 contribution toward the cost of soft drinks given away on the sale of cigarettes. Testimony of personnel of United Grocers, the other Portland purchaser allegedly discriminated against, was to the general effect that that organization had received no promotional allowances during 1956 and 1957 other than the tobacco industry\u2019s normal promotional payments adverted to in note 9, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">On the basis of this evidence, the Commission concluded that the payments received by Meyer were <em>in addition to </em>\u201cregular\u201d promotional payments, that they were not made proportionally available to other, competing retailers of the same goods, and moreover, that they were \u201cvirtually incapable of being offered on proportionally equal terms.\u201d We cannot say that that conclusion was erroneous as a matter of fact.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-12\">This instance merely points out two factors common to Commission proceedings and to our review of them. First, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>those witnesses in possession of the most enlightening evidence are usually representatives of respondents or potential respondents, who have an interest in revealing only what they must and in volunteering nothing. Second, application of the Commission\u2019s reserve of expertise to this sometimes painfully extracted testimony may produce conclusions, and valid conclusions, quite different from those which an uninitiated fact-finder might reach. And, of course, the Commission and its Hearing Examiner are closer to the facts than we are, and we cannot discount the justifiable effect which weak and evasive responses, apparent even on the face of this cold record, may have had on them. It is worth noting, for example, that while the Commission set aside many of the conclusions of the Examiner here, it agreed with him that the Phillip Morris payments were not offered to other purchasers on a proportionally equal basis j both opinions relied heavily, perhaps primarily, on the testimony of Phillip Morris\u2019 representative, who nowhere testified affirmatively to such a state of facts. In sum, the evidence is weak but not insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Meyer, however, attacks on other grounds, claiming that the Commission erred in classifying United Grocers as a retailer rather than a wholesaler. If this is true, then it and Meyer compete at different functional levels and, according to petitioner, therefore there is no obligation on Phillip Morris (under <em>TriValley Packing Ass\u2019n, </em>supra) to offer it proportionally equal promotional benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">There is a broad gamut of possible organization of functions, and in that range a buying cooperative such as United Grocers may function as an agent of each retailer-member, as a wholesaler, or as something between those extremes. We think that, within limits, classification here is in the province of the finder of fact. While we have some difficulty ac-ceptmg the Commission\u2019s conclusion that United Grocers is \u201cplainly\" a retailer,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we find it unnecessary to decide the question ourselves since we uphold the Commission\u2019s finding of discrimination against Oregon Piggly Wiggly Company, concededly in functional competition with petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">The question of law which accompanies the foregoing factual determination, whether a 2(d) violation may exist where the favored and nonfavored customer inhabit different functional levels, was settled in Meyer\u2019s favor in Tri-Valley Packing Ass\u2019n v. FTC, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">II. ARE THE PAYMENTS RECEIVED FROM SUPPLIERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE COUPON BOOK PROMOTIONS COGNIZABLE UNDER SECTIONS 2(a) AND 2(f) OF THE CLAYTON ACT?</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">Meyer tenders, as the first of two \u201cthreshold questions,\u201d the proposition that no part of the payments here made by Burlington Industries, Tri-Valley, and Idaho Canning can be held violative of section 2(a) of the Clayton Act. This conclusion, it says, is compelled by the facts that \u201c(1) the coupon book promotion was an institutional promotion involving a combination of advertising and promotional services furnished by or through Fred Meyer \u2018in connection with the processing, handling, sale or offering for sale\u2019 of the individual supplier\u2019s products, and (2) the payment of each supplier was made pursuant to agreement with Fred Meyer which contemplated, and was tied directly to, the furnishing of promotional services and facilities by Fred Meyer in connection with the resale of the products of the participating suppliers.\u201d It reasons that the \u201cultimate legal question here involved\u201d is whether the payments made are to be classified as price reductions (cognizable under 2(a) and therefore under 2(f)) or promotion<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>al payments, that the latter classification is the proper one, and therefore that the purported violations are cognizable if at all only under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Several subsidiary arguments are advanced as well, and will be examined below.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Commission counsel respond that sections 2(a) and 2(d) are not mutually exclusive, that in fact they overlap in such a manner as to bring the payments here under the prohibition of both sections. There is some support in the commentators and case law for this position, see Austin, Price Discrimination and Related Problems Under the Robinson-Patman Act 126 (2d ed. 1959); cf. Elizabeth Arden Sales Corp. v. Gus Blass Co., 8 Cir., 1945, 150 F.2d 988, 990, 993, 161 A.L.R. 370, cert. denied, 326 U.S. 773, 66 S.Ct. 231, 90 L.Ed. 467; Sun Cosmetics Shoppe v. Elizabeth Arden Sales Corp., S.D.N.Y., 1949, 82 F.Supp. 687, 688, rev\u2019d on other grounds, 2 Cir., 1949, 178 F.2d 150, 13 A.L.R.2d 358; Conference Report, H.R. Rep. No. 2951, 74th Cong., 2d Sess. at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">However, it is not necessary that that question be decided here. We agree with the Commission that a multipartite transaction may in its separate parts violate separate prohibitions of the Robinson-Patman Act. So here. The Commission found that the first $350 payment by each supplier constituted a true promotional payment for which it received value in Meyer\u2019s promotional services rendered, and that the balance of each payment, tied as it was to the volume of goods sold and ranging in amount up to one-third of the regular price to Meyer of those goods, constituted a distinct price discrimination, cognizable under section 2(a). We cannot agree with Meyer that the Commission made this classification \u201carbitrarily.\u201d While it claims that the Commission erred in finding that all participating suppliers paid a flat rate of $350 per coupon book page, it does concede that a very substantial percentage of suppliers paid this or some similar flat rate. And while it is correct in asserting that services rendered need not be shown precisely to equal promotional payments received, see Giant Foods, Inc., 1961, 58 F.T.C. 977, 1010; Lever Bros., 1953, 50 F.T.C. 494, 511, the relationship between payments received and promotional services rendered cannot be unreasonable, see Giant Foods, Inc., supra. Here the payments received from Tri-Valley in 1957 exceeded $350 by $4,-814 (20,750 coupons redeemed in merchandise at $.232 per coupon), from Idaho Canning in 1957 by $2,585 (21,367 coupons redeemed at $.121), from Cannon Mills in 1956 by about $400, and from Burlington Industries in 1957 and 1958 by a total of about $2,800. In view of such substantial disparities between receipts and proved allocable expenses, we think the Commission correctly decided that these excesses were \u201coutright price concessions\u201d and, since the amounts were directly related to and dependent upon the amount of goods purchased and resold by Meyer, price concessions cognizable under section 2(a) rather than under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Cf. National Tea Co., 1950, 46 F.T.C. 829, order modified, 1951, 47 F.T.C. 1314.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">But, says Meyer, the Commission itself has determined, in proceedings against these suppliers, that some of the payments we consider here were promotional, not price concessions. This contention has no substance. We cannot concern ourselves with questions of Commission strategy or Commission decisions as to whom to prosecute and for what acts. Even a successfully completed proceeding against a supplier for \u00e1 2(d) violation would not necessarily foreclose a contemporaneous or subsequent action against an inducing buyer for a 2(a)-2(f) violation where the payments involved violate both sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">III. DOES SECTION 2(d) OF THE CLAYTON ACT REQUIRE A SELLER TO OFFER PROPORTIONALLY EQUAL BENEFITS TO ITS CUSTOMERS AT DIFFERENT FUNCTIONAL LEVELS?</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">This is the second \u201cthreshold question\u201d asserted by Meyer. The Commission con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>cedes that, to sustain the position taken by it in its opinion, we would have to \u201creconsider\u201d our decision in <em>Tri-Valley Packing Ass\u2019n, </em>supra, where we held, on facts essentially identical with those produced here, that \u201c[n]o section 2(d) violation was shown as to the wholesale operation of Hudson House, because that operation was not in functional competition with Meyer * * * \u201d, id., 329 F.2d at 710. However, it urges us to overrule <em>Tri-Valley </em>because, it says, the issue was not fully briefed or argued there, the result was plainly contrary to the language of the Clayton Act and was other than that intended by Congress when it passed the Robinson-Patman Act, and the effect of the case was to immunize a practice intended to be stamped out by that legislation, specifically, the bringing to bear of the economic power of the chains upon suppliers to wring from them prices lower than smaller and less powerful unorganized retailers can extract.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">But the issue was considered and considered at length, as a reading of that opinion demonstrates, the \u201cintent\u201d of Congress is not as clear as respondent asserts, and no concrete showing of any increase in abuse by large buyers of their inherent power has been made here. Consequently, we are not inclined after so short a time to re-examine that decision, and adhere to the result reached there.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">IV. DID MEYER KNOW OR HAVE REASON TO KNOW THAT THE CONCESSIONS IT INDUCED WERE DISCRIMINATORY AND UNLAWFUL?</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The Commission found that Meyer knew or had reason to know that the payments it received were unlawful. That is one of the elements of proof required by section 2(f) and given content by Automatic Canteen Co. of America v. FTC, 1953, 346 U.S. 61, 79-81, 73 S.Ct. 1017, 97 L.Ed. 1454. The Court also held that the ordinary elements of a section 2(a) case must be shown. As explained below, we think the 2(a) elements have been adequately proved, and that the only serious question is as to Meyer\u2019s knowledge. That, too, we resolve in the Commission\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">A. <em>The necessity of </em>\u201cpressure\u201d <em>or coercion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">Meyer seems to take the position that the Commission must establish that the buyer exerted \u201cpressure\u201d, see <em>Automatic Canteen, </em>supra, at 79, 73 S.Ct. 1017, amounting to outright extortion, conceding that in that case the coercion would render the buyer\u2019s claimed lack of knowledge culpable, see American News Co. v. FTC, 2 Cir., 1962, 300 F.2d 104, 107. We think that <em>Automatic Canteen </em>does not go so far.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">First, we do not understand the Court to have gone beyond the simple statutory requirement of \u201cinducing\u201d (and clearly petitioner \u201cinduced\u201d the payments it received here); we take its words as being more of description than of measurement. Second, \u201cpressure\u201d may be brought to bear in a variety of ways, overt and covert, and petitioner here obviously applied some pressure. This, the fact of Meyer\u2019s self-professed market power, and the Commission\u2019s superior fact-finding position are sufficient to persuade us not to declare groundless its finding that, whatever may be the degree of \u201cpressure\u201d necessary to sustain a . 2(f) violation, that pressure existed and was successfully applied.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>B. <em>The effect of quantity </em>differences.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Next, .Meyer points to <em>Automatic </em>Can<em>teen\u2019s </em>requirement that where the quantities sold to the favored and non-favored buyers are not the \u201csame\u201d \u2014 which we interpret as meaning substantially the same \u2014 the Commission must only show that such differences could not give rise to \u201csufficient [cost] savings * * * to justify the price differential\u201d and that the buyer should have so known. Meyer insists that the quantity differentials are too great here to permit the Commission\u2019s inference that Meyer had reason to know that the differentials could not be cost-justified, and therefore that Count I of the complaint must fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Those quantity differences were indeed large; large enough, we assume, to cast on the Commission the burden of showing that petitioner knew or should have known that they still could not be cost-justified. Was that burden carried here? We think it was. The Commission relied on several factors in reaching its conclusion that Meyer had reason to believe<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that its suppliers could have no cost justification defense. First, none of the suppliers involved grant quantity discounts. Second, Meyer itself pays the going price during the other eleven months of the year. From this the Commission infers, and fairly, that no measurable cost savings are produced by petitioner\u2019s somewhat larger sales and related purchases during the one-month promotion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It buttresses that conclusion by a similar inference drawn from the fact that, during those eleven months, Meyer\u2019s sizeable purchases and its competitors\u2019 substantially smaller purchases are made at the same price. Third, the price concessions Meyer obtained from Idaho Canning and Tri-Valley amounted to a full third of the regular price. This, with and particularly against the background of the other two factors, led the Commission to the conclusion that petitioner \u201cshould have known\u201d something was amiss. We cannot say that inference is unwarranted. That the Commission did not prove the costs of the suppliers is immaterial. Costs surveys are expensive and labyrinthine proceedings whose results are often dependent upon the cost accounting theory used. To require them in all proceedings, even againt buyers, would too often be an exercise in futility. At least where the facts and the inferences to be drawn are as clear as they are on this point, we think the method of proof adopted by the Commission here is appropriate to its end, that of showing that the buyer \u201cis not an <em>unsuspecting recipient </em>of prohibited discrim-inations,\u201d <em>Automatic Canteen, </em>supra, 346 U.S. at 81, 73 S.Ct. at 1028. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">Obedient to the command of <em>Automatic Canteen, </em>the Commission also inquired into possible cost differences to the seller in \u201csale or delivery,\u201d id. at 80, 73 S.Ct. 1017. However, in finding that there were no such savings, it relied only on (1) testimony of Meyer\u2019s employees to the effect that the increased purchases for the promotion resulted in no changes in Meyer\u2019s costs or procedures which might provide cost savings for the suppliers and (2) testimony of a supplier\u2019s employee which we think unsatisfactory. Meyer attacks the sufficiency of this evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>dence, pointing to other evidence in the record which does tend to show that its suppliers\u2019 methods of sale and intensity of sales effort differed as between Meyer\u2019s regular purchases and special promotion purchases. But we believe that the Commission could find, from the <em>elements </em>of the testimony referred to above, that Meyer continued for the most part to purchase in usual method, on its usual terms, and that such differences as might have existed were inconsequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">In summary, we consider that the evidence which supports- the Commission\u2019s finding that Meyer had reason to believe that the discriminatory terms and prices it received were not cost-justified is weak but not insufficient. This conclusion is buttressed by the fact that <em>Automatic Canteen </em>itself pointed out that \u2018\u2018[t]he showing of knowledge * * * will depend to some extent on the size of the discrepancy between cost differential and price differential * * *. A showing that the cost differences are very small compared with the price differential * * * should be sufficient.\u201d Id. at 80, 73 S.Ct. at 1028. Here the Commission had before it evidence from which it could infer that manufacturing, selling and delivery cost savings were negligible. The price differential amounted to as much as one-third of the regular price. That, in the circumstances of this case, is enough to satisfy <em>Automatic Canteen\u2019s </em>requirement of a cost/price comparison.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">C. <em>Competitive injury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Meyer also questions the reasonableness of the Commission's finding of competitive injury. It cites American Oil Co. v. FTC, 7 Cir., 1963, 325 F.2d 101, 106, cert. denied, 377 U.S. 954, 84 S.Ct. 1631, 12 L.Ed.2d 498 to support its conclusion and claims that the Commission\u2019s dismissal of a related proceeding, In re Cannon Mills Co., 1964, 3 CCH Trade Reg. Rep. [[16,878, on this ground constitutes an \u201cacknowledge [ment] that the nature of the concessions received by Fred Meyer for the coupon promotions were not such as to create a reasonable probability of substantial Injury to competition within the meaning of section 2(a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">But <em>American Oil </em>is not such substantial support as Meyer thinks. There a section 2(a) charge grew out of a retail gasoline price war, during the course of which American supplied its dealers in the battle zone at lesser prices than those it charged elsewhere. The conflict raged for only 17 days and every station in the area participated. On these facts the court held that only slight and non-recurring injury below the statutory level of notice took place and that it would have taken place whether or not American had lowered its own prices. The case is obviously different where the discrimination recurs regularly and has a substantial impact upon competition. This is the situation here. We think this case is closer to those systematic and permanent discriminatory pricing systems held invalid in such cases as FTC v. Morton Salt Co., 1948, 334 U.S. 37, 68 S.Ct. 822, 92 L.Ed. 1196 (discriminatory volume discounts) and Corn Prods. Ref. Co. v. FTC, 1945, 324 U.S. 726, 65 S.Ct. 961, 89 L.Ed. 1320 (systematic discrimination based on \u201cphantom\u201d freight charges and other factors) than to the one disclosed by <em>American Oil, </em>and so affirm the Commission\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">D. <em>The duty of inquiry.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">The Commission held that \u201ca buyer who initiates a promotional service and induces his suppliers to pay him for performing it has possessed himself of \u2018information sufficient to put upon it the duty of making inquiry to ascertain whether the suppliers were making such payments available on proportionally equal terms to [his] competitors,\u2019 \u201d relying on, inter alia, Giant Food, Inc. v. FTC, 1962, 113 U.S.App.D.C. 227, 307 F.2d 184, 187, cert. denied, 1963, 372 U.S. 910, 83 S.Ct. 723, 9 L.Ed.2d 718. The consequence of such a rule is that where sufficient facts exist, the buyer has that knowledge which section 2(f) \u2014 \u25a0 and F.T.C. Act \u00a7 5, under the general assimilation of Robinson-Patman standards of liability and proof \u2014 requires. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Meyer attacks that holding on a variety of grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">First, it says, that rule is applicable only where the buyer\u2019s receipt of payments is \u201cculpable,\u201d and cites a number of cases<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> for the proposition that \u201cthere is a presumption that men obey the law.\u201d But knowledge of probable illegality is equivalent to \u201cculpability\u201d, American Motor Specialties, Inc. v. FTC, 2 Cir., 1960, 278 F.2d 225, cert. denied, 364 U.S. 884, 81 S.Ct. 169, 5 L.Ed.2d 105; cf. Giant Food, Inc., supra, and Meyer had knowledge of at least sufficient facts to create a reasonable suspicion that the payments it received were probably illegal. Hence the \u201cpresumption\u201d whose benefit Meyer claims cannot apply. Rather, the duty to inquire arises. Giant Food, Inc. v. FTC, supra; see Grand Union Co. v. FTC, 2 Cir., 1962, 300 F.2d 92, 100; American News Co. v. FTC, 2 Cir., 1962, 300 F.2d 104, 110, cert. denied, 371 U.S. 824, 83 S.Ct. 44, 9 L.Ed.2d 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Second, Meyer claims error in the stated grounds for the Commission\u2019s finding that Meyer must have known the payments it received to be incapable of proportionalization. The Commission here appears to have relied on statements in petitioner\u2019s solicitation material requiring that \u201cOffer Must be Exclusive at Fred Meyer During the 4 Week Period\u201d and asserting that its coupon book scheme represented a \u201cunique\u201d promotional device, in reaching its conclusion that the coupon book payments <em>could, not be proportionalized. </em>It found support for this and for its holding that Meyer must have known that the payments solicited from Phillip Morris were disproportional in <em>Giant Food, Inc., </em>supra, 307 F.2d at 187. There an agreement in the buyer\u2019s promotional contracts with its sellers that \u201cThis contract does not alter or replace currently existing agreements between Giant Food Department Stores and participating manufacturers,\u201d was interpreted to mean that \u201cGiant\u2019s program was designed to exist independently of and/or coextensively with any of its suppliers\u2019 regularly available cooperative advertising programs.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> While we do not agree that a supplier could never proportionalize benefits to its other customers while participating in a program of the degree of \u201cuniqueness\u201d shown here, we do hold that in the circumstances, the Commission could find that benefits here could not be proportionalized, or at least that Meyer had reason to know of the high degree of unlikelihood that they could be. As the Commission\u2019s opinion points out, Meyer itself, for almost 30 years, has considered a four-week span in September and October to be the most propitious time for a promotion of this nature. Consequently a supplier\u2019s agreement with another customer to enter into an identical agreement at another time presumably would not result in equal benefit to either. And by petitioner\u2019s own claim, the coupon book plan assures the supplier of \u201cmass distribution of your product at the lowest possible cost.\u201d In the absence of contrary evidence, cf. R. H. Macy &amp; Co. v. FTC, 2 Cir., 1964, 326 F.2d 445, 450, the Commission was clearly entitled to take Meyer at its word and to draw the obvious inferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">Third, Meyer argues that the record shows only that it operated an extensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>information-gathering system, not that it learned by that system who its competitors in the sale of the goods involved here were nor what prices they actually paid. Therefore, it says, it could not know that it was receiving discriminatory prices, and the whole complaint must fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The Commission characterized Meyer\u2019s investigative activities as a \u201cvigorous in- ' telligence network,\u201d finding that Meyer regularly monitored all grocery retailer advertisements on both a local and national scale, engaged in \u201ccomparison shopping\u201d of competitive stores, purchased and tested competing goods, and regularly reviewed price bulletins distributed by suppliers and brokers serving the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">It must be remembered that the inquiry here is as to what petitioner knew <em>or had reason to know. </em>Meyer obviously had a great deal of the trade knowledge referred to in <em>Automatic Canteen, </em>supra. It is a fair inference that it was aware that, as several witnesses testified, both wholesalers and retailers in the grocery industry operate on a profit margin approximating 2%, that mark-ups on the goods in question are often lower than the price concessions it received, and that customers can be \u201cswitched\u201d from one retailer to another simply by reason of a few cents\u2019 difference in price on particular items. Meyer itself carefully required of its special promotion suppliers that \u201cOffer Must Be Exclusive at Fred Meyer During the 4 Week Period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Against this background the mere fact that the record fails to show exact knowledge by Meyer of the precise identity of each competitor in each particularized kind and grade of goods and of the prices paid by competitors for them cannot avail the petitioner: It had \u201creason to know.\u201d See Giant Food, Inc. v. FTC, supra; Grand Union Co. v. FTC, supra; American News Co. v. FTC, supra; cf. Automatic Canteen Co. v. FTC, supra, 346 U.S. at 79-80, 73 S.Ct. 1017; Tri-Valley Packing Ass\u2019n v. FTC, supra, 329 F.2d at 708-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">V. DOES FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION ACT \u00a7 5 REACH INDUCEMENT OF DISCRIMINATORY PROMOTIONAL ALLOWANCES?</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">We must resolve, for the first time in this circuit, the question whether the Commission may proceed against a buyer under \u00a7 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act for inducing and receiving a discriminatory promotional allowance, a practice not expressly declared unlawful, as to buyers, by the RobinsonPatman Act, nor to sellers where, as here, the discrimination is among purchasers at different functional levels of competition. Tri-Valley Packing Ass\u2019n v. FTC, 9 Cir., 1964, 329 F.2d 694, 708. The Commission takes the position that it has such power. Meyer disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">This is not an entirely novel question; two other Courts of Appeals have considered similar problems and side with the Commission, see R. H. Macy &amp; Co. v. FTC, 2 Cir., 1964, 326 F.2d 445; Giant Food, Inc. v. FTC, 1963, 113 U.S.App. D.C. 227, 307 F.2d 184, cert. denied, 1963, 372 U.S. 910, 83 S.Ct. 723; American News Co. v. FTC, 2 Cir., 1962, 300 F.2d 104, cert. denied 371 U.S. 824, 83 S.Ct. 44; Grand Union Co. v. FTC, 2 Cir., 1962, 300 F.2d 92; see also FTC v. J. Weingarten, Inc., 5 Cir., 1964, 336 F.2d 687, 693, cert. denied, 1965, 380 U.S. 908, 85 S.Ct. 890, 13 L.Ed.2d 796. No case has rejected the result these circuits have reached. We find the reasoning of those cases persuasive, and adopt it. We therefore sustain the Commission here.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">VI. THE COMMISSION\u2019S ORDER.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">Finally, Meyer challenges both the scope of the resulting order and the fact that it is addressed to the two senior officers of the corporation as well as to the corporation itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-14\">A. <em>The Officers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-15\">According to Meyer, the facts are that Fred G. Meyer, the chairman of the board of directors of Fred Meyer, Inc., owns only a minority of the outstanding shares (38.35%), \u201chas nothing to do with the advertising and sales poli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>cies of the corporate petitioner,\u201d and \u201cis not even familiar with the operation of the coupon book program.\u201d Earle A. Chiles, petitioner\u2019s president, concededly is \u201cgenerally responsible for merchandising operations, but only at a policy-making level,\u201d and owns 14.37 percent of the stock. These facts, it claims, are insufficient to support an order running directly to these men as individuals and officers of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">When these attributes are taken singly, petitioner\u2019s position may in some circumstances be correct, see Ostermoor &amp; Co. v. FTC, 2 Cir., 1927, 16 F.2d 962, 51 A.L.R. 327; In re Maryland Baking Co., 1956, 52 F.T.C. 1679, 1691. But the Commission found that this, a \u201cfamily\u201d corporation (the individuals and their families own almost all of the corporate stock), was \u201cnothing but the \u2018alter ego\u2019 of those two individual respondents.\u201d Moreover, Chiles himself testified that \u201cwe set the policies and review the practices.\u201d And Meyer was originally responsible for instituting the coupon book promotion. We think that, despite Meyer\u2019s denials of knowledge of the operations of the business, the Commission was justified in concluding that \u201cif \u2018a majority of Portland\u2019s 120,000 families\u2019 were apprised of the details of these programs, we think it is a fair inference that the Chairman of the Board also knew about them,\u201d [r. 138.] and in joining both as respondents. See Mandel Bros., Inc. v. FTC, 7 Cir., 1958, 254 F.2d 18, 22, rev\u2019d on other grounds, 1959, 359 U.S. 385, 79 S.Ct. 818, 3 L.Ed.2d 893; cf. Western Fruit Growers Sales Co. v. FTC, 9 Cir., 1963, 322 F.2d 67, 69-70, cert. denied, 376 U.S. 907, 84 S.Ct. 661, 11 L.Ed.2d 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">B. <em>The Scope of the Order.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The Commission\u2019s Final Order commands that the corporate petitioner and' its two named officers cease and desist from</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">\u201cKnowingly inducing, or .knowingly receiving or accepting, any discrimination in the price of such products by directly or indirectly inducing, receiving, or accepting from any seller a net price respondents know or should know is below the net price at which said products of like grade and quality are being sold by such seller to other customers where respondents are competing with the purchaser paying the higher price or with a customer of the purchaser paying the higher price.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">This we refer to as the 2(a)-2(f) order. They are further ordered to cease and desist from</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-10\">\u201cInducing and receiving anything of any value from any supplier as compensation or in consideration for services or facilities furnished by or through respondents in connection with the processing, handling, sale or offering for sale of products purchased from such supplier, when respondents know or should know that such compensation or consideration is not being affirmatively offered or otherwise made available by such supplier on proportionally equal terms to all of its other customers competing with respondents in the sale and distribution of such supplier\u2019s products, including other customers who resell to purchasers who compete with respondents in the resale of such supplier\u2019s products.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">This we refer to as the \u00a7 5 order. Meyer attacks both orders on the grounds that they bear no reasonable relationship to the practices found to be unlawful and that they fail to mention or limit themselves to the coupon book promotion. Moreover, it says, the 2(a)-2(f) order is too broad in that it is not confined to the narrow product categories in suit, and because (as we make out the argument) Meyer might not know that products of like grade and quality being sold in competing outlets were sold to those outlets by its own seller. The section 5 order is claimed to be improper because it is not limited to the specific unlawful practices found here and because it applies to \u201cother customers who resell to purchasers who compete with respondents,\u201d i. e., those wholesalers whom we held to be not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>under the protection of section 2(d) in <em>Tri-Valley Packing Ass\u2019n, </em>supra.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Under what is sometimes called the Clayton Finality Act, adopted in 1959,15 U.S.C. \u00a7 21, the Commission\u2019s order, when it becomes final, subjects respondents to a $5,000 penalty for each violation, and, where the violation is continuing, to $5,000 per day penalty while it continues. This, we think, requires that Commission orders be more carefully framed than formerly, and that they no longer be a mere command to obey the statute. This, we think, is the effect of Mr. Justice Brennan\u2019s caveat in FTC v. Henry Broch &amp; Co., 1962, 368 U.S. 360, at 367-368, 82 S.Ct. 431, 436, 7 L.Ed.2d 353. There he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">\u201cWe do not wish to be understood, however, as holding that the generalized language of paragraph (2) would necessarily withstand scrutiny under the 1959 amendments. The severity of possible penalties prescribed by the amendments for violations of orders which have become final underlines the necessity for fashioning orders which are, at the outset, sufficiently clear and precise to avoid raising serious questions as to their meaning and application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">In Swanee Paper Corp. v. FTC, 2 Cir., 1961, 291 F.2d 833, 837-38, cert. denied, 1962, 368 U.S. 987, 82 S.Ct. 603, 7 L.Ed. 2d 525, a \u00a7 2(d) case, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-10\">\u201cAdministrative agencies have wide discretion in framing their orders and are empowered to enjoin other related unlawful acts which may occur in the future * * * but there must be some relation between the facts found and the breadth of the order. * * * Moreover, the order is not even limited to related activities but enjoins Swanee from violating Section 2(d) in the very words of the statute. * * * Moreover, the order as written is so broad that, under the new enforcement provisions of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 21), the duty of enforcing the prohibitions of Section 2(d) as to Swanee is shifted from the Commission to the federal courts, which may in the future be forced to decide the very issues that Congress has entrusted the Commission to determine. * * * [W]e therefore hold that the order should be limited to the particular practice found to violate the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-16\">The court directed, under its rule 13(1), that the Commission prepare an order in conformity with the court\u2019s opinion. A similar result was reached in Grand Union Co. v. FTC, 2 Cir., 1962, 300 F.2d 92, 101-2, a \u00a7 5 case involving, as this one does, violation of \u00a7 2(d), and for similar reasons. To the same effect is American News Co. v. FTC, 2 Cir., 1962, 300 F.2d 104, 111, also a \u00a7 5-\u00a7 2(d) case. See also Joseph A. Kaplan &amp; Sons, Inc. v. FTC, 1965, 121 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 347 F.2d 785, 788-791.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-17\">We think that the order here is subject to many of the stictures levelled by the courts at the orders involved in the foregoing cases. We reject, however, the contention that the order should be restricted to the specific products involved in the violations proved, or to any specific product. The scheme involved is much broader, and an order can properly be directed against such a scheme or comparable ones. We think that the order goes much beyond that and should be so limited. The 2(a)-2(f) order also seems, on its face, to exclude the normal defenses to a section 2(a) violation charge. This, we think, is improper. The section 5 order covers \u201cprocessing, handling,\u201d not here involved. The language in that order: \u201cincluding other customers who resell to purchasers who compete with respondent in the resale of such suppliers\u2019 products\u201d must be stricken. The order is also overly broad as to the two individuals; it should be limited to ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>tivities related to the business of Fred Meyer, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">The Commission knows how to draw narrower orders.

The Commission has long held that brand differences alone do not necessarily compel the conclusion that the products are not of \u201clike grade and quality\u201d and that brand identity may overcome insignificant physical differences in the goods or their containers, see Rowe, Price Discrimination, Under the Robinson-Patman Act 69-73 (1962, Supp.1964) and cases cited there.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b412-12\">. A subsequent proceeding against Cannon Mills, Cannon Mills Co., FTC Dkt. 7494, 3 CCH Trade Reg.Rep. fl6,878 (1964), resulted in dismissal of the complaint because competitive injury had not been shown.
