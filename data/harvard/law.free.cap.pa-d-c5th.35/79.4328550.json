The patent was issued to Spireas and Bolton in October of 1998. Subsequent patents were issued to Spireas and Bolton which also involved liquisolid technology.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">In June of 1998 a license agreement was executed between Mutual Pharmaceutical Company, Inc. (\u201cMutual\u201d) and Hygrosol Pharmaceutical Corporation (\u201cHygrosol\u201d), Spireas, and Bolton for the use and commercialization of liquisolid technologies. Mutual entered into an agreement in March of 1999 to employ Spireas as Vice President of Research and Development of Mutual. Additionally, Mutual entered into a development agreement with SigmaPharm, Inc. Spireas\u2019 consulting company, a corporation engaged in the development of other new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>pharmaceutical technologies.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-3\">On January 29, 2010 plaintiffs Spireas, Bolton, and Hygrosol, through named plaintiff SigmaPharm, sued Mutual and King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\u201cKing\u201d) in the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. In the District Court action Spireas, through SigmaPharm, alleged that both Mutual and King prevented generic competition for Skelaxin, a muscle relaxant, and thereby violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a71. On March 2, 2011, the District Court dismissed the SigmaPharm complaint finding that SigmaPharm did not suffer an antitrust injury, and therefore lacked standing. The United States Supreme Court denied SigmaPharm\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">On May 6, 2011 Mutual filed a complaint in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas against Spireas and Bolton. All of the claims alleged in Mutual\u2019s complaint, as well Spireas\u2019 counterclaims, relate to the 1998 license agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">In the 2011 action, <em>Mutual </em>v. <em>Spireas, Bolton and </em>Hygrosol<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, Mutual alleged that Spireas and Bolton breached the terms of the 1998 license agreement by making false representations as to ownership of the liquisolid technology. Mutual maintained that Spireas and Bolton represented that they were the exclusive and sole owners of all rights and interests in the patent, processes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>and technology for liquisolid. Mutual alleged, however, that all such rights are, and continue to be, owned by St. John\u2019s University.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\">On January 6, 2012 Spireas filed an answer to Mutual\u2019s complaint asserting counterclaims against Mutual and United Research Laboratories, Inc. (\u201cURL\u201d). Spireas claimed that he owned the liquisolid technology.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Spireas counterclaimedthat Mutual breached the license agreement by failing to pay Hygrosol in connection with the license agreement, disclosing confidential information to King in violation of the license agreement, failing to pay licensing fees required under the license agreement, and failing to account for products developed under or using the patent as required by the license agreement. Additionally, Spireas counterclaimed for conversion, accounting, fraud in the inducement, and unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">On January 7, 2012 Spireas filed a third-party complaint naming Mutual, URL, Richard Roberts (\u201cRoberts\u201d), Pharmaceutical IP Holdings (\u201cPharma IP\u201d), Pharmaceutical Holdings (\u201cPharma Holdings\u201d), King, and King Pharmaceutical Research and Development, Inc. (\u201cKing R &amp; D\u201d) as third-party defendants. In the third party complaint Spireas alleged violations of \u00a7 1962(a)-(d) of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, as well as counts for restraint of trade under Pennsylvania law, unlawful and unfair competition under the California Business and Professions Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>breach of contract under Pennsylvania Law, breach of license agreement, and civil conspiracy to commit barratry, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty. Shortly thereafter, on January 9,2012, SigmaPharm filed a Petition to Intervene as a Third Party Plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-3\">On February 15, 2012 third party defendant King filed a notice of removal to remove the action to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. King argued that removal to federal court was appropriate because the federal RICO claims and related allegations in the third party complaint asserted against King and other third party defendants were separate and apart from the underlying state law breach of contract claims. On July 3,2012 the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania remanded the third party complaint back to the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas. The District Court concluded that neither counterclaim defendants, nor third party defendants, may remove a civil action from a state court to federal court because they are not \u201cdefendants\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a) which states that \u201cany civil action brought in a state court of which the district courts of the united States have original jurisdiction, may be removed by the defendant or the defendants...\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Consequently, in order for King defendants to make a successful application for removal of the case to federal court the cases would need to be severed, putting King defendants in the position of defendant rather than third party defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">On August 16, 2012 a motion to sever the third-party Complaint was filed as well as preliminary objections to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>the third-party complaint. The motion to sever, filed by third party defendants, argued that the two complaints addressed fundamentally different issues between different parties over different periods of time which requires different evidence. On September 28, 2012 Spireas filed amended counterclaims against Mutual and URL. The amended counterclaims included violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(a)-(d) and NJ.S.A. 2C:41-2(a)-(d)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and claims for breach of license agreement, accounting, barratry and civil conspiracy, conversion, and unjust enrichment. On September 28, 2012 Spireas also filed an amended third party complaint as to Roberts, Pharma IP, Pharma Holdings, King, and King R&amp;D. The amended third party complaint alleged violations of NJ.S.A. 2C:41-2(a)-(d) and claims for interference with contractual rights. The September 28, 2012 amended third party complaint, by rule, had to have preliminary objections filed by October 18, 2012. The preliminary objections would have been assigned to me shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-3\">On October 3, 2012 while the response time for the amended third party compliant was still existent, the court granted Mutual\u2019s motion to sever the third-party complaint requiring plaintiffs to refile their third-party claims as a separate action.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This had the effect of separating the breach of license agreement claims and the NJ RICO claims. On October 11, 2012 Hygrosol and Spireas filed a motion to vacate the court\u2019s October 3rd order. These third party plaintiffs argued that the third party defendants\u2019 motion to sever addressed third party plaintiffs\u2019 original complaint, filed January 7, 2012, and not their pending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>amended complaint. On October 19, 2012 the court denied third party plaintiffs motion to vacate the October 3, 2012 order, but clarified that the severance was to apply to the September 28, 2012 amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Pursuant to the severance order, plaintiffs instituted the present action on November 5, 2012 by filing a complaint asserting claims for violations of NJ.S.A. 2C:41-2(a)-(d), interference with contractual rights against Roberts, Pharma IP, Pharma Holdings, King, and King R &amp; D.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Defendants filed preliminary objections to the complaint on December 14, 2012.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On January 16, 2013 the parties stipulated that the Defendants\u2019 preliminary objections would be deemed moot without prejudicing defendants\u2019 right to refile preliminary objections following plaintiffs\u2019 submission of an amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on January 24, 2013 restating the NJ RICO and tortious interference claims and adding a claim for civil conspiracy. In the amended complaint plaintiffs allege four counts of New Jersey Civil RICO violations. It alleges defendants engaged in a pattern of racketeering by using, or causing another to use, the mails and interstate wires of the United States to transmit documents or information which, among other things: generated investment proceeds, as alleged in Count I; served to facilitate defendants\u2019 control over the enterprises, as alleged in Count II; were connected to defendants\u2019 participation in the enterprises, as alleged in Count III;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>and were done pursuant to a RICO conspiracy, as alleged in Count IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Defendants filed preliminary objections to plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint on March 1, 2013. The court issued an order on May 1, 2012 sustaining in part defendants\u2019 preliminary objections. This had the effect of eliminating plaintiffs\u2019 RICO claims as to all defendants and eliminating the interference with contractual rights and civil conspiracy claims as to all defendants except King and King R&amp;D.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Plaintiffs now file the instant motion for clarification and/or reconsideration. The court\u2019s May 1, 2013 order is clarified and reconsidered as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">I. New Jersey RICO:</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Under NJ RICO an enterprise is defined as \u201cany individual, sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, business, or charitable trust, association or other legal entity, any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity, and it includes illicit as well as licit enterprises and governmental as well as other entities.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 have asserted that defendants\u2019 are enterprises within the meaning of NJ RICO.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> I am not convinced that Plaintiffs have appropriately alleged that all defendants are individual enterprises, and that they also became one association-in-fact enterprise.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">Under NJ RICO, to prove that a defendant has engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>in a pattern of racketeering activity plaintiff must show: (1) defendant has engaged \u201cin as least two incidents of racketeering conduct one of which shall have occurred after the effective date of this act and the last of which shall have occurred within 10 years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after a prior incident of racketeering activity;\u201d and (2) that \u201cthe incidents of racketeering activity embrace criminal conduct that has either the same or similar purposes, results, participants or victims or methods of commission or are otherwise interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated incidents.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> N.J.S.A. 2S:41-4 allows for civil remedies under NJ RICO. Plaintiffs\u2019 have alleged counts under NJ.S.A. 2C:41-2(a)-(d), Prohibited Activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">A. N.J.S.A. \u00a7 2C:41-2(a):</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint asserts a count for violations for N.J.S.A. 2C:41-2(a) against all defendants.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The court\u2019s May 1, 2013 order sustained defendants\u2019 preliminary objections as to all defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Pursuant to N. J.S.A. \u00a7 2C:41-2(a) \u201cIt shall be unlawful for a person who has received any income derived, directly or indirectly, from a pattern of racketeering activity... to use or invest, directly or indirectly, any part of the income, or the proceeds of the income, in acquisition of any interest in, or the establishment or operation of any enterprise which is engaged in or the activities of which affect trade or commerce.\u201d This is known as an \u201cinvestment injury\u201d. As such, a defendant must not only have received income from a pattern of racketeering activity, but must also have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>used or invested that income in a manner that <em>harms </em>plaintiff.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\">In the amended complaint plaintiffs allege defendants engaged in RICO predicate acts through mail and wire fraud by asserting the following: (1) fraud on the courts; (2) communications with the Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d); (3) communications with the Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cPTO\u201d); (4) communications to the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d); and communications with the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Plaintiffs allege that defendants manufactured and sold adulterated drugs, and made fraudulent representations to the FDA regarding those drugs<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>; that defendants submitted sham patent applications to the PTO<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>; and that defendants\u2019 entered into an improper agreement which they filed with the SEC, in a heavily redacted form, making it misleading.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">B. N.J.S.A. \u00a7 2C:41-2(b):</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint asserts a count for violations of N.J.S.A. 2C:41-2(b) against all defendants.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The court\u2019s May 1, 2013 order sustained defendants\u2019 preliminary objections as to all defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Pursuant to N.J.S.A. \u00a7 2C:41-2(b) \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt to acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>of any enterprise which is engaged in[,] or activities of which affect[,] trade or commerce.\u201d This is known as an \u201cacquisition injury.\u201d Essentially, a plaintiff must allege that its injury, apart from injuries caused by the RICO predicate acts themselves, results from defendant\u2019s acquisition or maintenance of an interest in, or control over, an enterprise.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">C. NJ.S.A. \u00a7 2C:41-2(c):</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint asserts a count for violations of N.J.S.A. 2C:41-2(c) against all defendants<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The court\u2019s May 1, 2013 order sustained defendants\u2019 preliminary objections as to all defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Pursuant to NJ.S.A. 2C:41-2(c) it \u201cshall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in activities of which affect trade or commerce to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.\u201d In other words, in order for a plaintiff to make a claim under NJ RICO, the plaintiff must allege an injury that flows from the commission of RICO predicate acts.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">D. N.J.S.A. \u00a7 2C:41-2(d):</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint asserts a count for violations of N.J.S.A. 2C:41-2(d) against all defendants.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The court\u2019s May 1, 2013 order sustained defendants\u2019 preliminary objections as to all defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>N.J.S.A. 2C:41-2(d) states it \u201cshall be unlawful for any person to conspire as defined by N.J.S. 2C:5-2, to violate [New Jersey RICO (a), (b), or (c)].\u201d To assert a claim under N.J.S.A. 2C:41-2(d) a plaintiff must allege a conspiracy which claims an injury resulting from an act prohibited under RICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">DISCUSSION OF RICO CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"AW\">1. STANDING</p>\n<p id=\"ACs\">a. Predicate Acts</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">As stated in <em>Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc. </em>a RICO \u201cplaintiff only has standing if, and can only recover to the extent that, he has been injured in his business or property by the conduct constituting the violation.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> One of the critical requirements is, therefore, that the predicate act conduct itself causes an injury. One of the fundamental failures of Plaintiffs\u2019 RICO claims in this case is that the individual predicate offenses of mail and wire fraud did not, in fact, directly cause injury to Plaintiffs\u2019 business.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The amended complaint, read in a light favorable to plaintiffs, establishes that plaintiffs and the Mutual defendants entered into a contract, and that the Mutual and King defendants thereafter engaged in fraudulent conduct which prevented plaintiffs from receiving what was due them under the contract. Although a number of the acts which helped perpetrate the fraud can be considered to be mail and wire fraud, the <em>acts themselves </em>did not cause the pecuniary injury. It was the breach of contract which caused the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number><em>Bridge </em>v. <em>Phoenix Bond &amp; Indemnity Co. </em>is one of the more recent Supreme Court cases which discusses this concept.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> It should first be noted that the holding of the cas\u00e9 was that a plaintiff can recover under RICO, even when the predicate act of mail fraud was directed to a third party, and the misrepresentation in that third party communication was not \u201crelied upon\u201d by plaintiff This holding resolved a circuit courts\u2019 conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Plaintiffs have relied upon language in <em>Bridge </em>to support its contention that so long as it is \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d that harm would result to plaintiff from a defendant\u2019s mail fraud, causation of the fraud is satisfied. This is not the state of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">In Bridge, individual contracts<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> were being \u201clet out\u201d to qualified parties on a rotational basis. So that the contracts could be distributed on a proportionate basis to all qualified parties, a county rule prohibited qualified parties from submitting multiple bids using apparent agents, or related entities. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants submitted perjured compliance attestations so that defendants would obtain more contracts that the rules allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The complete quote concerning causation is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-8\">[Plaintiff\u2019s] alleged injuiy \u2014 the loss of valuable [contracts] \u2014 is the direct result of [defendant\u2019s] fraud. It was a foreseeable and natural consequence of [defendant\u2019s] scheme to obtain <em>more </em>liens for themselves [,] that other bidders would obtain <em>fewer </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>liens.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-3\">The requirement of a \u201cdirect injury\u201d is noted at least a half dozen times throughout the opinion. Under the circumstances, the multiple fraudulent bids <em>directly, </em>and at <em>that immediate time, </em>caused the plaintiff to <em>actually lose </em>identifiable valuable contracts. The language of \u201cforeseeable and natural consequence of [defendant\u2019s] scheme\u201d can only refer to <em>defendants\u2019 </em>required mens rea; i.e., the fact that there would be a direct injury to the plaintiff was reasonably <em>known </em>to the <em>defendant, </em>as opposed to a direct injury occurring to the plaintiff in some unusual manner that could not reasonably be foreseen by a defendant. This lack of foreseeability could possibly negate a fraudulent mens rea, by a defendant arguing that the direct result was unforeseeable and unintended.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Additionally, the <em>Bridge </em>case specifically prohibits a \u201cbut for\u201d test.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">In the case at bar, plaintiffs have simply listed a series of events that ultimately, and in their totality, allowed defendants to breach the licensing agreement; as opposed to showing that any predicate act <em>directly </em>caused any <em>particular </em>pecuniary damage to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Consequently, plaintiffs do not have standing to bring a RICO action, and no amendment to the complaint can cure this.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">b. 2C:41 \u2014 2(a) Investment Injury<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>It is insufficient to allege that a RICO defendant simply reinvested racketeering proceeds into its already existing ongoing business,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and the Third Circuit requires an injury resulting from the investment of racketeering income distinct from an injury caused by the predicate [racketeering] acts themselves.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The reason for this is 2C:41-4. Not only must one prove a 2C:41-2(a) investment violation, but 2C:41-4 requires a plaintiff to show that it sustained injury <em>because of </em>it. There simply must be something beyond an ongoing business remaining an ongoing business, to maintain a RICO action. The income must be used or invested in a manner that harms plaintiff.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">It should also be noted that plaintiffs agree that most of Mutual\u2019s \u201clegitimate\u201d income was derived from legitimate sales.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Finally, there is also the fact that essentially all of the other income the Mutual defendants received was through a contract or other dealings with the King defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">This reinforces my belief that this case is a breach of contract case, with common law fraud and fiduciary elements also existing. Plaintiffs\u2019 harm, as alleged, is that the Mutual defendants and the King defendants entered into a private contract, which breached the licensing agreement with plaintiffs and profited themselves at plaintiffs\u2019 expense.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>c. 2C:41 \u2014 2(b) Acquisition Injuiy</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-3\">Again, the analysis is similar to Investment Injury.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-4\">d. 2C:41 \u2014 2(c) Participation Injury</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-5\">I rely upon discussion l.a. Predicate Acts, <em>supra.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-6\">e. 2C:41 \u2014 2(d) Conspiracy</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">As the allegations of 2C:41 2(a), 2(b), and 2(c) are infirm, the conspiracy to do so also fails.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">2. FINAL REASONING</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">Although the preceding discussion fully disposes of the RICO claims, I feel compelled to make a further observation not specifically put forward by Mutual and King (for obvious reasons).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">While not necessarily being an independent reason for dismissal of the RICO claims, I am again reinforced in believing that dismissal is proper. I am referring to the manner in which plaintiffs and Mutual arrived at their licensing agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">Plaintiffs fully admit throughout their amended complaint not only that they believed Mutual capable of unethical and criminal conduct;<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> but also that they essentially gave Mutual the contractual powers, through the license agreement, to do exactly what Mutual eventually did;<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and that Dr. Spireas actually did certain actions that helped Mutual and King\u2019s schemes.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> After all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>of this, plaintiffs take the position that they were surprised that Mutual engaged in the exact conduct plaintiffs knew about, enabled, and helped.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Thereafter, plaintiffs essentially admit that their damages are for breach of the licensing agreement.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\">Interference With Contractual Rights and Civil Conspiracy</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">With regard to tortious interference with contract, I had originally sustained the preliminary objections with respect to Pharma defendants, stating that a party cannot interfere with its own contract. I had also sustained the preliminary objections with regard to civil conspiracy, much for the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Upon reconsideration, there are a sufficient number of Pharma defendants wherein there might exist a viable interference with contract by a number of Pharma defendants other than the actual Pharma defendant contract signatory. Consequently, Count V and Count VI are reinstated, and the preliminary objections to these counts are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Conclusion:</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The court\u2019s May 1, 2013 order sustaining in part defendants\u2019 preliminary objections is clarified and reconsidered. All RICO claims are dismissed. The tortious interference with contract and civil conspiracy claims are reinstated, as plead, with respect to all defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b110-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>And now, this 13th day of December, 2013, upon consideration of plaintiffs\u2019 motion for clarification and/ or reconsideration of the court\u2019s May 1, 2013 order sustaining in part defendants\u2019 preliminary objections, and any response in opposition thereto, it is hereby ordered that the motion is granted in part. The court\u2019s May 1,2013 order is clarified as follows<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>:</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\">(1) Plaintiffs\u2019 Count I, N.J.S.A. \u00a7 2C:41-2(a), is dismissed as to all defendants;</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">(2) Plaintiffs\u2019 Count II, NJ.S.A. \u00a7 2C:41-2(b), is dismissed as to all defendants;</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">(3) Plaintiffs\u2019 Count III, NJ.S.A. \u00a7 2C:41-2(c), is dismissed as to all defendants;</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">(4) Plaintiffs\u2019 Count IV, NJ.S.A. \u00a7 2C:41-2(d), is dismissed as to all defendants;</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">The court\u2019s order is reconsidered as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Count V, Interference with Contractual Rights, is reinstated.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Count VI, Civil Conspiracy, is reinstated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-10\">The remainder of the motion is denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-11\">Plaintiffs may not file a second amended complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-12\">Defendants have thirty days from the docketing of this order to file answers to the amended complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b95-6\">. Although defendants have requested that I also dismiss the second amended complaint on the grounds of <em>res judicata </em>because of the federal dismissal and affirmances; I decline to so hold because I do not believe I have the present ability to make such a determination. However, the Sherman Act dismissal does reinforce my belief as to the appropriateness of my current order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b95-7\">.
