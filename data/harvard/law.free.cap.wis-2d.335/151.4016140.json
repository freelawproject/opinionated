This matter was here before. <em>Estate of Kriefall ex rel. Kriefall v. Sizzler USA Franchise, Inc., </em>2003 WI App 119, \u00b6 1, 265 Wis. 2d 476, 483, 665 N.W.2d 417, 421, held that claims by the estate of a child alleged to have died as the result of, and persons alleged to be injured by, contaminated meat sold by Excel Corporation were not barred by federal preemption. The claims of the Kriefalls and the others alleged to be injured by the meat were settled. This appeal concerns disputes between the Sizzler parties and Excel.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">\u00b6 2. The parties to this appeal are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-8\">\u2022 Excel and its insurer, American Home Assurance Company;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-9\">\u2022 E&amp;B Management Company, Waukesha, d/b/a Sizzler, the owner of the two Sizzler restaurants where the customers ate food contaminated by <em>E. coli </em>0157:H7 bacterium alleged to have been on Excel meat delivered to the E&amp;B Sizzler restaurants, and E&amp;B's insurer, Secura Insurance; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>\u2022 Sizzler USA Franchise, Inc., the company that franchised the E&amp;B Sizzler restaurants. Sizzler USA Franchise is mostly referred to by the parties as simply \"Sizzler.\" For clarity, however, we refer to it as Sizzler USA Franchise to distinguish it from its parent company, Sizzler International, Inc., which is not a party to this appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">\u00b6 3. The jury found the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">1. Excel breached \"an implied warranty of merchantability or implied warranty for the sale of food\";</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">2. Excel's breach was \"a cause of damage\" to Sizzler USA Franchise;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">3. As a result of the breach, Sizzler USA Franchise was entitled to $6,500,000 for \"[l]ost profits attributable to company-owned stores,\" $350,000 for \"[l]ost franchise royalties,\" and $311,000 for \"[o]ut of pocket expenses\";</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">4. Excel was \"negligent in selling meat adulterated with E. coli 0157:H7\";</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-9\">5. Excel's negligence in selling adulterated meat was \"a cause of injuries to the patrons of' the two E&amp;B Sizzler restaurants;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-10\">6. E&amp;B was negligent \"[a]t the time of the E. coli 0157:H7 outbreak\";</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-11\">7. E&amp;B's negligence was \"a cause of injuries to the patrons of' the two E&amp;B Sizzler restaurants;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-12\">8. Sizzler USA Franchise was not negligent \"as a franchisor\";</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-13\">9.

(Underlining in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\u00b6 4. Excel and American Home Assurance appeal the trial court's judgments and some orders. E&amp;B and Secura cross-appeal a judgment and some orders. Sizzler USA Franchise cross-appeals two orders. We affirm the judgments and orders except: (1) We reverse the trial court's order permitting E&amp;B and Secura to recover from Excel the money Federal Insurance Company, Sizzler USA Franchise's insurer, paid to Secura; and (2) We reverse the trial court's order rejecting Sizzler USA Franchise's equitable-indemnity claim against Excel. Part I discusses Excel's appeal; Part II discusses E&amp;B's cross-appeal; and Part III discusses Sizzler USA Franchise's cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">\u00b6 5. The appeal and cross-appeals require that we interpret and apply statutes and contracts. In doing so, our review of what the trial court did is <em>de novo. See Edwards v. Petrone, </em>160 Wis. 2d 255, 258, 465 N.W.2d 847, 848 (Ct. App. 1990) (contract); <em>Village of Shorewood v. </em>Steinberg, 174 Wis. 2d 191, 201, 496 N.W.2d 57, 61 (1993) (statute). Further, we apply a statute as it is written unless it is constitutionally infirm or its text does not reveal the legislature's intent. <em>See State ex rel. Kalal v. Circuit Court for Dane </em>County, 2004 WI 58, \u00b6\u00b6 43-44, 271 Wis. 2d 633, 661-662, 681 N.W.2d 110, 123-124. Moreover, ambiguous provisions must be both inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>preted and applied so they are consistent with the statute read as a whole. <em>Id., </em>2004 WI 58, \u00b6 46, 271 Wis. 2d at 663, 681 N.W.2d at 124. The appeal and cross-appeals also require that we assess the trial court's rulings on evidence and its decisions on scheduling. Our review of those matters is limited to whether the trial court erroneously exercised its discretion. <em>State v. Sullivan, </em>216 Wis. 2d 768, 780, 576 N.W.2d 30, 36 (1998) (Receipt of evidence is vested in the trial court's reasoned discretion.); <em>Hefty v. Strickhouser, </em>2008 WI 96, \u00b6 31, 312 Wis. 2d 530, 546-547, 752 N.W.2d 820, 828 (Trial courts have both inherent and statutory discretion to control their dockets.); <em>Teff v. Unity Health Plans Ins. Corp., </em>2003 WI App 115, \u00b6 29, 265 Wis. 2d 703, 724, 666 N.W.2d 38, 49 (\"trial court has broad discretion in deciding how to respond to untimely motions to amend scheduling orders\"). We will sustain a discretionary determination if \"the circuit court examined the relevant facts; applied a proper standard of law; and using a demonstrative rational process, reached a conclusion that a reasonable judge could reach.\" <em>Sullivan, </em>216 Wis. 2d at 780-781, 576 N.W.2d at 36. Additionally, when more than one analysis supports our decision on the many issues presented by the appeal and cross-appeals, we discuss the dispositive analysis and not others. <em>See Gross v. Hoffman, </em>227 Wis. 296, 300, 277 N.W. 663, 665 (1938) (only dispositive issue need be addressed).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">(Appeal by Excel and American Home)</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">A. <em>Excel's Liability for Consequential Damages.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">\u00b6 6. Excel contends that the trial court erred in not dismissing Sizzler USA Franchise's implied-warranty consequential-damages claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>\u00b6 7. Sizzler USA Franchise cross-claimed against Excel seeking, among other things, damages it contended resulted from Excel's breach of Excel's express warranty that Excel's meat would be wholesome and safe. Sizzler USA Franchise also alleged that Excel breached its implied warranties that Excel's meat was merchantable, was fit to be used in the Sizzler restaurants, and was \"safe and fit for human consumption.\" Sizzler USA Franchise's cross-claim against Excel sought, among other things, \"direct, consequential, and incidental damages\" suffered by Sizzler USA Franchise as a result of Excel's alleged breach of the warranties.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\u00b6 8. The express-warranty claim was based on a 1997 document titled \"Continuing Guaranty\" (upper-casing omitted). The guaranty was between Excel as \"Seller\" and Sizzler International, Inc., which, as already noted, is the parent company of Sizzler USA Franchise. The guaranty, dated September 22, 1997, provided, as material:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-5\">The undersigned, Excel Corporation (Seller), hereby states that each and every article contained in and comprising each shipment or other delivery hereafter made by Seller, to or on the order of Sizzler International, Inc. (Buyer), is hereby guaranteed, as of the date of each such shipment or delivery, to be: 1. Not adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended (if applicable).... This Guaranty shall not render Seller liable for any incidental or consequential damages of whatsoever nature nor shall it extend to the benefit of persons or corporations other than Sizzler International, Inc. or its affiliates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">(Bolding omitted, paragraphing altered.) The trial court held on summary judgment that Excel's liability for consequential damages was specifically excluded from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>this Continuing Guaranty by the last sentence, and dismissed Sizzler USA Franchise's express-warranty claim. It also held, however, that this clause did not affect either Excel's duties under the implied-warranty provisions of Wisconsin's Uniform Commercial Code, or Sizzler USA Franchise's remedies under the Code. We look at these provisions before we assess Excel's contentions that the trial court erred in not dismissing Sizzler USA Franchise's implied-warranty consequential-damages claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">\u00b6 9. Wisconsin Stat. \u00a7 402.314 provides as material:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">(1) Unless excluded or modified (s. 402.316), a warranty that the goods shall be merchantable is implied in a contract for their sale if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind. Under this section the serving for value of food or drink to be consumed either on the premises or elsewhere is a sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">(2) Goods to be merchantable must be at least such as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">(c) Are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used.[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Wisconsin Stat. \u00a7 402.315 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-4\">Where the seller at the time of contracting has reason to know any particular purpose for which the goods are required and that the buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods, there is unless excluded or modified under s. 402.316 an implied warranty that the goods shall be fit for such purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>\u00b6 10. The Excel meat that made it into the E&amp;B Sizzler restaurants and gave rise to these actions was sold by a document sent to \"Sizzler Franchise Distributors\" by Sizzler USA Franchise in February of 2000. The document, titled \"Boxed Beef Sales Confirmation and Contract\" (uppercasing omitted), identified the \"Buyer\" as \"Sizzler USA, Inc. c/o Franchisees and Distributors.\" In \"Addendum A'\" to the contract, the various distributors and franchise owners on whose behalf the contract with Excel was negotiated, indicated that \"[b]y signing where indicated below [a series of signature pages attached to the contract], the distributor and franchisee owner are responsible for carrying out the terms and conditions of [the contract].\" Sysco Corporation, a food distributor for the E&amp;B Sizzler restaurants, signed as \"Sysco \u2014 Baraboo, W[i]s.\"; a handwritten note on that signature page reads \"Sysco/Eastern Wisconsin.\" The Addendum also recited that the contract was \"entered into between Excel Corporation and Sizzler Int'l\" on the date shown. Again, Sizzler International is the parent company of Sizzler USA Franchise.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\u00b6 11. As noted, the trial court ruled that Sizzler USA Franchise was entitled to recover its consequential damages suffered as a result of Excel's alleged breach of its implied warranties under the Uniform Commercial Code. The jury awarded significant damages. Excel gives four reasons, which we analyze in turn, why it believes that the trial court was wrong.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">1. <em>Exclusion of consequential damages in the \"Continuing Guaranty,\" Excel's express-warranty undertaking.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\u00b6 12. Excel claims that a clause in the Continuing Guaranty (\"This Guaranty shall not render Seller liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>for any incidental or consequential damages of whatsoever nature nor shall it extend to the benefit of persons or corporations other than Sizzler International, Inc., or its affiliates\") removed consequential damages from the implied warranties as well. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u00b6 13. \" 'In construing the terms of a contract, where the terms are plain and unambiguous, it is the duty of the court to construe it as it stands, even though the parties may have placed a different construction on it.'\" <em>Algrem v. Nowlan, </em>37 Wis. 2d 70, 79, 154 N.W.2d 217, 221 (1967) (citation omitted). <em>See also Eddy v. B.S.T.V., Inc., </em>2005 WI App 78, \u00b6 2, 280 Wis. 2d 508, 511, 696 N.W.2d 265, 267. This means that \"[w]hen the language is unambiguous, we apply its literal meaning.\" <em>Farm Credit Services of North Cent. Wisconsin, ACA v. Wysocki, </em>2001 WI 51, \u00b6 12, 243 Wis. 2d 305, 314, 627 N.W.2d 444, 448. As the trial court recognized, the phrase in the Continuing Guaranty excluding the right of Sizzler USA Franchise to recover consequential damages is hardly ambiguous and encompasses only the express warranties undertaken by the Continuing Guaranty: <em>\"This Guaranty </em>shall not render Seller liable for any incidental or consequential damages of whatsoever nature.\" (Emphasis added.) Stated another way, incidental and consequential damages are excluded from those damages that might be recovered <em>if </em>the express warranties in the Continuing Guaranty were breached. Excel argues that the Continuing Guaranty's consequential-damages exclusion should apply to the implied warranties under the Uniform Commercial Code because, as Excel writes in its main appellate brief, the exclusion represents the parties' \"bargained for allocation of risk.\" (Capitalization omitted.) The parties specifically limited their \"allocation of risk\" in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>connection with consequential damages, however, to the express warranties agreed-to in the Continuing Guaranty. We may not re-write a contract to do what one of the parties now wishes in retrospect it had done before. <em>See Hortman v. Otis Erecting Co., Inc., </em>108 Wis. 2d 456, 461, 322 N.W.2d 482, 484-485 (Ct. App. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\u00b6 14. Further, the incidental-and-consequential-damages clause does not purport to encompass implied warranties created elsewhere \u2014 here the Uniform Commercial Code. As we explain in the next subsection, nothing in the Uniform Commercial Code incorporates into the Code's implied-warranty provisions the Continuing Guaranty's express-warranty incidental-and-consequential-damages exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">2. <em>Implied Warranties Under the Uniform Commercial Code.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u00b6 15. As we have seen, Excel's delivery of contaminated meat to the E&amp;B Sizzler restaurants breached implied warranties recognized by Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 402.314 and 402.315. In support of its contention that the trial court erred in not dismissing Sizzler USA Franchise's claim for implied-warranty consequential damages, Excel points to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 402.719(3), which permits a contract to limit or exclude consequential damages. Section 402.719 reads in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">(1) Subject to subs. (2) and (3) and to s. 402.718 on liquidation and limitation of damages:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\">(a) The agreement may provide for remedies in addition to or in substitution for those provided in this chapter and may limit or alter the measure of damages recoverable under this chapter, as by limiting the buyer's remedies to return of the goods and repayment of the price or to repair and replacement of nonconforming goods or parts; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>(b) Resort to a remedy as provided is optional unless the remedy is expressly agreed to be exclusive, in which case it is the sole remedy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-4\">(2) Where circumstances cause an exclusive or limited remedy to fail of its essential purpose, remedy may be had as provided in chs. 401 to 411.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">(3) Consequential damages may be limited or excluded unless the limitation or exclusion is unconscionable. Limitation of consequential damages for injury to the person in the case of consumer goods is prima facie unconscionable but limitation of damages where the loss is commercial is not.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>\u00b6 16. As we noted in subpart 1, the incidental- and-consequential-damages limitation in the Continuing Guaranty applies only to any breach of express warranties <em>created </em>by that agreement (\"This guaranty shall not render Seller liable for any incidental or consequential damages\") and thus the limitation did not extend beyond the four corners of the Continuing Guaranty. Equally significant, Wis. Stat. \u00a7 402.719 applies <em>by its terms </em>to contracts for sale that create or modify \"remedies\" authorized by the Code (\"The agreement [between the parties] may provide for remedies in addition to or in substitution for those provided in this chapter and may limit or alter the measure of damages recoverable under this chapter.\"), and subsection (3) addresses the limitation or exclusion of consequential damages in such an \"agreement.\" Excel has pointed to none of the pertinent contracts of sale that even addresses consequential damages resulting from a <em>breach of the Uniform Commercial Code's implied warranties </em>in Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 402.314 and 402.315.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">\u00b6 17. Significantly, Excel could have under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 402.316 both: (i) sought \"to exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchantability\" as well as \"any implied warranty of fitness,\" <em>see </em>\u00a7 402.316(2) &amp; (3); and (ii) limited or modified remedies for their breach, <em>see </em>\u00a7 402.316(4) (\"Remedies for breach of warranty can be limited in accordance with ss. 402.718 and 402.719 on liquidation or limitation of damages and on contractual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>modification of remedy.\"). <em>See Murray v. Holiday Rambler, Inc., </em>83 Wis. 2d 406, 414-419, 265 N.W.2d 513, 517-520 (1978) (discussing \u00a7\u00a7 402.316 and 402.719). Excel put nothing into any of the contracts of sale (other than, as already noted at length, the Continuing Guaranty, which, as we have explained, does not modify the implied warranties recognized by the Uniform Commercial Code) that even purports to disclaim, modify or limit either the implied warranties or the remedies for their breach. This is what distinguishes what we have here from <em>Wyatt Industries, Inc. v. Publicker Industries, Inc., </em>420 F.2d 454 (5th Cir. 1969), on which Excel relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">\u00b6 18. In <em>Wyatt Industries, </em>Publicker hired Wyatt to build a pressure vessel that Publicker was going to use in order to process synthetic ethanol. <em>Id., </em>420 F.2d at 455. Wyatt warranted \"the completed work against defective material and workmanship, exclusive of corrosion or erosion, for the period of one year from completion thereof.\" <em>Id., </em>420 F.2d at 456. The guarantee also provided that Wyatt's \"liability under this warranty shall be limited to the replacement within the aforesaid time of any defective work or material f.o.b. Fabricator's shop, and Fabricator shall be liable for no other damages or losses.\" <em>Ibid. </em>If that were all to Wyatt's undertaking, the limitation would have been effective. But, as the building and testing of the pressure vessel showed cracks and leaks, Publicker agreed to accept delivery only if the guarantee was modified. <em>Ibid. </em>It was modified: \"an agreement was reached whereby the cracks would be repaired and the vessel would be shipped 'as is' on the condition that Wyatt would be absolved of liability for damage claims or repair costs in excess of $25,000.\" <em>Ibid. </em>The phrase \"as is\" is, of course, one of the ways the Uniform Commercial Code recognizes that warranties may be excluded or modified. <em>See </em>Wis. Stat. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>\u00a7 402.316(3)(a). The pressure vessel was apparently still flawed, and when Wyatt sued to recover its purchase price, Publicker counterclaimed \"for loss of profits due to business interruptions occasioned by defects\" in the pressure vessel, and also expenses it claimed for replacing and making serviceable a new pressure vessel. <em>Wyatt Industries, </em>420 F.2d at 456. <em>Wyatt Industries </em>held that the express \"as is\" agreement, which modified the original guaranty, was effective under \u00a7\u00a7 2-316 and 2-719 Uniform Commercial Code (substantially identical to Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 402.316 and 402.719). There was no similar modification by Excel of the Code's implied warranties so as to limit the remedy for their breach.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-4\">3. <em>May Sizzler USA Franchise Sue for Breach of Implied Warranties under the Uniform Commercial Code?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\u00b6 19. Excel argues that Sizzler USA Franchise, although listed as \"Buyer\" in the \"Boxed Beef Sales Confirmation and Contract\" (uppercasing omitted), was not the buyer of the meat under the Uniform Commercial Code because it \"never took possession of Excel's <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>beef and never paid Excel for the beef.\"<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, Excel contends, Sizzler USA Franchise cannot sue for breach of the Code's implied warranties. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\u00b6 20. Whether Sizzler USA Franchise is a \"buyer\" under Wis. Stat. ch. 402, which \"applies to transactions in goods,\" Wis. Stat. \u00a7 402.102, \"is easily decided from the language of the statute,\" <em>see Hemberger v. Bitzer, </em>216 Wis. 2d 509, 516, 574 N.W.2d 656, 659 (1998) (statutory interpretation in general), to which we now turn. Wisconsin Stat. \u00a7 402.103(l)(a) defines \" 'Buyer'\" as \"a person who buys or <em>contracts to buy goods\" </em>\"unless the context otherwise requires.\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, so far, Sizzler USA Franchise qualifies as a \"buyer\" because it contracted to buy the Excel meat, and it was entitled to delegate to the distributors and franchisees acceptance of the contracted-for-meat. <em>See </em>Wis. Stat. \u00a7 402.210(1) (\"A party may perform that party's duty through a delegate unless otherwise agreed or unless the other party has a substantial interest in having his or her original promisor perform or control the acts required by the contract.\") Although Wis. Stat. \u00a7 402.106(6) tells us that \"[a] 'sale' consists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price (s. 402.401),\" the passing of title is not always required because \u00a7 402.106's introductory phrase notes that the definitions in \u00a7 402.106 apply \"unless the context otherwise requires.\"<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, Wis. Stat. \u00a7 402.401, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>is specifically referenced in \u00a7 402.106(6), tells us: \"Each provision of this chapter with regard to the <em>rights, obligations, and remedies of the seller, the buyer, </em>purchasers, or other 3rd parties <em>applies irrespective of title to the goods </em>except where the provision refers to such title.\" (Emphasis added.) Since a \"buyer\" can be, as we have seen, \"a person who . . . contracts to buy goods,\" Sizzler USA Franchise qualifies and passing of title to it is not a prerequisite to its recovery of damages flowing from Excel's breach of its implied warranties.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u00b6 21. Equally significant, Wis. Stat. ch. 402 does not just apply to a \"sale,\" as that term is defined by Wis. Stat. \u00a7 402.106(6), but to the more general aspect of commerce: \"transactions in goods.\" Wis. Stat. \u00a7 402.102. Thus, the law generally recognizes that Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code is not limited to \"sales\" per <em>se. See Mieske v. Bartell Drug Co., </em>593 P.2d 1308, 1312 (Wash. 1979). <em>Mieske </em>explains: \" 'It is now clearly established that the reach of Article 2 [adopted in Wisconsin as ch. 402,] goes considerably beyond the confines of that type transaction which the Code itself defines to be a \"sale\"; namely, the passing of title from a party called the seller to one denominated a buyer for a price.'\" <em>Mieske, </em>593 P.2d at 1312 (quoting treatise) (bailment within Article 2). This is consistent with the provision in Wis. Stat. \u00a7 402.401 that passing of \"title\" is not always required.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u00b6 22. Finally, nothing in Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 402.314 or 402.315, restricts <em>in haec verba </em>the implied-warranties in those sections to \"buyers.\" Rather, \u00a7 402.314 tells us that the implied warranty of merchantability applies \"in a contract for [the \"sale\" of \"goods\"] if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind.\" Excel does not dispute that it is the \"seller\" in connection with the Boxed Beef Sales Confirmation and Contract for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>meat packages destined for the Sizzler franchisees, and that the document was, as \u00a7 402.314 requires, \"a contract for their sale.\" Similarly, \u00a7 402.315 tells us that the implied warranty of fitness applies: \"[w]here the seller at the time of contracting has reason to know any particular purpose for which the goods are required and that the buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods.\" Since as we have already seen, under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 402.103(l)(a) a \"Buyer\" can be \"a person who ... contracts to buy goods,\" and Excel as the \"seller\" had \"reason to know\" both (i) what would be done with the meat it sold and (ii) that Sizzler USA Franchise (the entity \"contracting ]to buy\") was \"relying on [Excel]'s skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods,\" the implied warranty recognized by \u00a7 402.315 applies to the meat making it into the E&amp;B Sizzler restaurants even though Sizzler USA Franchise did not, itself, take delivery (which, as we have seen, it was permitted to do under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 402.210(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">4. <em>Privity of Contract.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">\u00b6 23. Excels argues that Sizzler USA Franchise's \"warranty claims also fail because Excel and Sizzler [USA Franchise] are not in privity of contract.\" This is a puzzling assertion because, as we have seen at some length, the \"Boxed Beef Sales Confirmation and Contract\" (uppercasing omitted) was between Excel and Sizzler USA Franchise. The nub of Excel's contention, though, is that Sizzler USA Franchise did not itself take delivery of the meat under the contract.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But, as we have already discussed in detail, Sizzler USA Franchise need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>not have received either the meat or title to the meat; it is sufficient under the Code that it \"contract[ed] to buy\" the meat. <em>See </em>Wis. Stat. \u00a7 402.103(1)(a) (defining \"[b]uyer\"). Further, there is evidence in the Record that although the Boxed Beef contract required the Sizzler franchisees to pay their distributors for the Excel meat, Sizzler International, Sizzler USA Franchise's parent, remained on the hook to Excel if a franchisee or distributor did not pay Excel. Moreover, as we have seen, Wis. Stat. \u00a7 402.210(1) recognizes, with an exception not relevant, that \"[a] party may perform that party's duty through a delegate unless otherwise agreed.\" This is the resulting syllogism:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-4\">\u2022 It was in Sizzler USA Franchise's interest for its franchisees to get meat because a franchiser in the business of having franchisees who sell meat products must ensure that the franchisees have a ready source of meat at a competitive price.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">\u2022 Sizzler USA Franchise therefore negotiated with Excel for delivery of meat that, under the Uniform Commercial Code, was subject to implied warranties of merchantability and fitness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">\u2022 The very nature of the franchise business is that the franchisor generally delegates to its franchisees the receipt, use, and payment for materials used by the franchisees, even though the franchisor will generally negotiate for purchase of the products used by the franchisees in order to get the benefits of economy-of-scale purchasing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Excel's sale of meat under its contract with Sizzler USA Franchise as franchisor was obviously designed to benefit both Sizzler USA Franchise and its franchisees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>because a franchise operation that sells meat products needs a supply of meat. Indeed, Excel noted during oral argument that it is \"standard\" for franchisors to contract for the sale of product to its franchisees. Excel cannot avoid the consequences of its breach of the implied warranties by fogging the issue with strained analysis. <em>See U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. City of Milwaukee, </em>2003 WI App 220, \u00b6 8, 267 Wis. 2d 718, 730, 672 N.W.2d 492, 497. Thus, analogously, in <em>Los Angeles Paper Bag Co. v. James Talcott, Inc., </em>604 F.2d 38 (9th Cir. 1979), a food store ordered bags from its distributor, which placed the order with the manufacturer. <em>Id., </em>604 F.2d at 39. The manufacturer shipped the bags to the food store directly. <em>Ibid. </em>The distributor's check bounced. <em>Ibid. Los Angeles Paper Bag </em>held that a financing company's security interest in the distributor's \"inventory, after-acquired property, and accounts receivable\" was superior to the manufacturer's claim for the bounced check <em>even though </em>the bags \"never became inventory in the physical possession of' the distributor. <em>Id., </em>604 F.2d at 39-40:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-4\">In substance, if not in form; the transaction at issue here is just the same as if the paper goods had been warehoused temporarily by [the distributor] and then delivered to [the food store] . Delivery of goods to a third party pursuant to a buyer's instructions is sufficient delivery to pass whatever rights and title the buyer might have had in the goods to the third party, just as if the delivery had been made by the buyer himself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-5\"><em>Id., </em>604 F.2d at 40. Excel's contention that Sizzler USA Franchise cannot recover for breach of the Code's implied warranties for damages it sustained as a result of Sizzler USA Franchise's contract with Excel is without merit. The trial court did not err.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>B. <em>Excel's Obligation to Indemnify E&amp;B and Secura for their Payments under Pierringer Releases to the non-Kriefall claimants.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\u00b6 24. E&amp;B and Sizzler USA Franchise and their insurers settled with the non-Kriefall claimants under releases authorized by <em>Pierringer v. Hoger, </em>21 Wis. 2d 182, 124 N.W.2d 106 (1963). <em>See id., </em>21 Wis. 2d at 184-185, 191-192, 124 N.W.2d at 108, 111-112 (A <em>Pierringer </em>release bars contribution actions that the non-settling defendants might have against the settling defendants.); <em>see also VanCleve v.

A <em>Pierringer </em>release thus satisfies \"that portion of the plaintiffs cause of action for which the settling joint tortfeasor is responsible, while at the same time reserving the balance of the plaintiffs cause of action against a nonsettling joint tortfeasor.\" <em>Imark Industries, Inc. v.

E&amp;B and Secura sought indemnification from, and tendered its defense to, Excel under the 1993 \"Hold Harmless Agreement and Guaranty/Warranty of Product\" that Excel gave to Sysco. (Uppercasing omitted.) Excel accepted the tender \"under a reservation of rights,\" which, among other things, asserted \"that the 1993 Hold Harmless Agreement and Guaranty/Warranty of Product\" did not apply. The Hold Harmless Agreement guaranteed, as material, that \"articles contained in any shipment or delivery made by\" Excel \"to or on the order of Sysco\" was not \"adulterated or misbranded.\" Under the Hold Harmless Agreement, Excel \"agree[d] to defend, indemnify and hold harmless [Sysco] and its ... customers ... from all actions, suits, claims and proceedings (\"Claims\"), and any judgments, damages, fines, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>suiting therefrom.\" Excel concedes that E&amp;B and Sizzler USA Franchise are \"customers\" of Sysco in connection with the tainted meat it shipped to the E&amp;B Sizzler restaurants.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">\u00b6 26. The agreement then fleshed out, as material here: (1) the nature of the \"Claims\" that would trigger Excel's obligations under the Hold Harmless Agreement, and (2) the scope of those obligations. It covered claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">(ii) brought or commenced by any person or entity against any [customer] for the recovery of damages for the injury, illness and/or death of any person or damage to property arising out of or alleged to have arisen out of (a) the delivery, sale, resale, labeling, use or consumption of any Product, or (b) the negligent acts or omissions of [Excel]; provided, however, that [Excel]'s indemnification obligations hereunder shall not apply to the extent that Claims are caused by the negligent acts or omissions of [Sysco] or any other third party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Excel contends that it is not liable under the Hold Harmless Agreement because (1) the jury found that E&amp;B was twenty-percent contributorily negligent, and (2) settlements made in exchange for <em>Pierringer </em>releases are not, as they express it in their main brief on this appeal, \"recoverable under the 1993 Hold Harmless Agreement.\" (Some capitalization omitted.) We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">1. <em>E&amp;B's Contributory Negligence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">\u00b6 27. The jury found that E&amp;B was twenty-percent contributorily negligent, and Excel was eighty-percent contributorily negligent, in connection with the death and illnesses caused by the <em>E. coli </em>pathogen. Under the Hold Harmless Agreement's unambiguous language, however, Excel is only relieved of its indemnity obligations \"to the extent\" that the harm was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>contributed-to by the negligence of \"any other third party.\"<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, under the Hold Harmless Agreement, Excel has to indemnify E&amp;B for harm attributable to Excel's eighty-percent negligence. Excel contends, however, that the Pierringer-release settlements \"are, as a matter of law, attributable to E&amp;B and [Sizzler USA Franchisees causal negligence,\" so that Excel's liability to E&amp;B under the Hold Harmless Agreement is zero.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We analyze this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">2. <em>The Pierringer releases.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\u00b6 28. As we have seen, a <em>Pierringer </em>release bars a <em>non-settling defendant </em>(here, Excel) from seeking contribution from the <em>settling defendant </em>(here, E&amp;B) for damages that a plaintiff might recover that are attributable to the <em>settling defendant's </em>causal negligence (here, 20%) because the plaintiff has, by virtue of the <em>Pierringer </em>release, agreed to indemnify the settling defendant (E&amp;B) to the extent that the settling defendant (E&amp;B) is found to be causally negligent. Thus, by virtue of the <em>Pierringer </em>releases, Excel's financial responsibility for the non-Kriefall claimants' injuries is reduced by the twenty-percent of fault attributed to E&amp;B.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">\u00b6 29. Excel argues, however, that because E&amp;B and Secura bought their peace by settling with the non-Kriefall claimants under a <em>Pierringer </em>release, thus extinguishing the percentage of damages that was attributable to E&amp;B, E&amp;B may not get any indemnity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>from Excel because of the interplay between the Hold Harmless Agreement and the <em>Pierringer </em>release. Excel relies mainly on <em>Unigard Ins. Co. v. Insurance Co. of North America, </em>184 Wis. 2d 78, 516 N.W.2d 762 (Ct. App. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\u00b6 30. Unigard settled with a <em>Pierringer </em>release its liability and the liability of its insured. <em>Id., </em>184 Wis. 2d at 83, 516 N.W.2d at 764. The <em>Pierringer </em>release specifically reserved Unigard's right to seek contribution from others who could not be made parties in the settled action, and provided that Unigard and its insured were \" <em>'not releasing any rights, claims or causes of action of any nature they may have against any other person or entities.' </em>\" <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis by <em>Unigard). </em>Unigard thus contended that \"the <em>Pierringer </em>release only prevented contribution or indemnification actions against the nonsettling parties <em>named </em>in the lawsuit.\" <em>Id., </em>184 Wis. 2d at 83-84, 516 N.W.2d at 764 (emphasis by <em>Unigard). </em>There was an additional clause in the release, however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">As a further consideration, the releasing parties agree to indemnify the released parties released herein and to save them harmless <em>from any claims for contribution made by others so adjudged jointly liable </em>with the parties being released, and releasing parties agree to satisfy any judgment which may be rendered in their favor, <em>satisfying such fraction, portion or percentage of the judgment as the causal negligence of all adjudged tortfeasors.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-6\"><em>Id., </em>184 Wis. 2d at 84, 516 N.W.2d at 764 (emphasis by <em>Unigard). Unigard </em>held that despite the settling defendants' (Unigard and its insured) attempt to preserve their rights of contribution against the non-party tortfeasors, contribution was barred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">Equity, logic and common sense convince this court that the body of law interpreting the consequences of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number><em>Pierringer </em>release should not have any different application to a nonparty tort-feasor versus a named party tort-feasor. Simply put, because the <em>Pierringer </em>release protects a settling defendant from contribution or indemnification claims of nonparty tort-feasors, the settling defendant's own claims for contribution or indemnification against nonparty tort-feasors are likewise barred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><em>Id., </em>184 Wis. 2d at 87-88, 516 N.W.2d at 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\u00b6 31. Excel invokes <em>Unigard, </em>and argues that since \"amounts paid in exchange for <em>Pierringer </em>releases are payments attributable to that portion of [the nonKriefall] plaintiffs' claims attributable to E&amp;B,\" the settlement \"payments for which E&amp;B seeks recovery are not even covered under the hold harmless agreement\" because the Agreement, as we have seen, specifically removes \"Claims [that] are caused by the negligent acts or omissions of. .. any other third party\" from Excel's duty to indemnify. In essence, Excel contends that even though the jury determined that it was eighty-percent negligent in connection with the harm caused by the <em>E. coli </em>pathogen that made it to the E&amp;B Sizzler restaurants, it is not liable for that eighty-percent in connection with the money E&amp;B and Secura paid to settle with the non-Kriefall claimants. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\u00b6 32. First, if E&amp;B and Secura had not settled with the non-Kriefall claimants, and had the jury awarded damages to the non-Kriefall claimants, and had the jury apportioned the negligence as it did here (20% for E&amp;B, and 80% for Excel), there is no doubt but that E&amp;B and Secura would have a right to be indemnified under the Hold Harmless Agreement for all \"damages for the injury, illness and/or death of any person\" caused by the pathogen, but only \"to the extent\" that those damages were not \"caused by the negligent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>acts or omissions of1 E&amp;B. This means that Excel would have been liable under the Agreement for eighty-percent of the damages awarded to the non-Kriefall claimants. It would be odd indeed, if E&amp;B's <em>Pierringer</em>release settlement could wipe out all of Excel's liability to E&amp;B under the Hold Harmless Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u00b6 33. Second, the mix of the non-Kriefall claimants' <em>tort </em>claims against Excel and E&amp;B, and E&amp;B and Secura's <em>contract </em>claims for indemnity under the Hold Harmless Agreement, is a mix of, to use the clich\u00e9, apples and oranges. In the traditional Pierringer-release situation, the plaintiff has tort claims against a group of defendants, some of whom settle with the plaintiff. Absent a <em>Pierringer </em>release, the non-settling defendants would, if they were found liable at trial, have contribution rights against the settling defendants. <em>See Unigard, </em>184 Wis. 2d at 85-86, 516 N.W.2d at 765. The <em>Pierringer </em>release wipes that out by, as we have already seen, imputing \"to the settling plaintiff whatever liability in contribution the settling defendant may have to non-settling defendants and to bar subsequent contribution actions the non-settling defendants might assert against the settling defendants.\" <em>See VanCleve, </em>2003 WI 2, \u00b6 39, 258 Wis. 2d at 100, 655 N.W.2d at 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\u00b6 34. The situation here is, however, different than the tort triangle where <em>Pierringer </em>releases are used (plaintiff settling with some tortfeasors and prevailing at trial against non-settling tortfeasors who, absent a <em>Pierringer </em>release, could seek contribution from the settling tortfeasors) because here we have Excel's <em>contractual </em>undertaking to indemnify E&amp;B for harm caused by Excel. Thus, as <em>Eden Stone Co., Inc. v. Oakfield Stone Co., Inc., </em>166 Wis. 2d 105, 120, 479 N.W.2d 557, 563-564 (Ct. App. 1991) recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>It is axiomatic that a <em>Pierringer </em>release can only function in a setting involving joint tortfeasors. <em>See Pierringer v. Hoger, </em>21 Wis. 2d 182, 124 N.W.2d 106 (1963). We see nothing in the <em>Pierringer </em>decision which envisions the use of such releases in any other setting. And the ensuing development of <em>Pierringer </em>law has never extended or recognized the use of such releases where one defendant is sued in contract and another in tort.[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">We agree. Simply put, Excel promised to pay for the breach of its Hold Harmless Agreement \"to the extent\" it was, compared to the \"Buyer and other third parties\", responsible; the law holds Excel to that promise. The trial court correctly refused to dismiss <em>in toto </em>the indemnity claims of E&amp;B and Sizzler USA Franchise against Excel under the 1993 Hold Harmless Agreement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>3. <em>Contribution by Federal Insurance to the PierringerRelease Settlement with the Non-Kriefall Claimants.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u00b6 35. Federal Insurance paid $1 million to Secura to help Secura settle with the non-Kriefall claimants. Even though there is no evidence in the Record that Secura either repaid that money, or is obligated to do so, the trial court held that E&amp;B could get that money from Excel by virtue of the Hold Harmless Agreement. We disagree because there is nothing in the Hold Harmless Agreement that justifies that windfall, and because the collateral-source rule, which permits windfalls under certain circumstances, is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">\u00b6 36. The collateral-source rule is an equitable doctrine that prevents a tortfeasor from benefiting if a plaintiff gets money from either: (1) an entity obligated to reimburse the plaintiff for damages sustained as the result of something the tortfeasor did (an insurance company, for example, that pays for medical expenses the plaintiff incurred as the result of something the tortfeasor did), or (2) a volunteer that helps the plaintiff with expenses (a charity, for example, that buys food and pays rent for a plaintiff unable to work as the result of something the tortfeasor did), <em>see Fischer v. Steffen, </em>2011 WI 34, \u00b6\u00b6 30, 34, 333 Wis. 2d 503, 515, 797 N.W.2d 501, 506 (\"In general, the collateral source rule provides that a tortfeasor's liability to an injured person is not reduced because the injured person receives funds from other sources.\") (footnote omitted) (collateral-source rule is an equitable doctrine); <em>Ellsworth v. Schelbrock, </em>2000 WI 63, \u00b6 14, 235 Wis. 2d 678, 687, 611 N.W.2d 764, 768 (\"[T]he collateral source rule is invoked when a third party pays <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>or gratuitously provides or pays for benefits to the injured party.\"). E&amp;B, however, is not the type of party that the collateral source rule was designed to benefit\u2014 E&amp;B is a <em>tortfeasor, </em>not an injured party. As between giving a windfall to either an injured claimant or to the tortfeasor that caused the claimant's injuries, the collateral -source rule gives the windfall to the injured claimant. <em>See Voge v. Anderson, </em>181 Wis. 2d 726, 732-733, 512 N.W.2d 749, 751-752 (1994). Federal Insurance is not seeking from Excel the money it paid to Secura. Federal Insurance is also not seeking to get that money from Secura. To allow E&amp;B to collect from Excel the money Federal Insurance paid to Secura would thus give E&amp;B a windfall, and there is nothing in logic or in the law to which E&amp;B and Secura have pointed or that we have found that permits such a bizarre result.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's order permitting E&amp;B to recover from Excel the money Federal Insurance paid to Secura.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">C. <em>Evidentiary Issues.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">\u00b6 37. Excel contends that the trial court erroneously exercised its discretion in connection with several evidentiary issues. We analyze these matters in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">1. <em>Testimony of Michael Schwochert.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">\u00b6 38. Schwochert was an employee of the United States Department of Agriculture assigned to Excel's meat-processing plant that is implicated in this case. He was, according to his testimony, a \"supervisory veterinarian medical officer\" and described for the jury the plant's <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>meat processing and whether, during the time he was an inspector at the plant, which ended shortly before the plant processed the meat that was delivered to the E&amp;B's Sizzler restaurants, to what extent the plant complied with its Hazard Analysis And Critical Control Point System. <em>See Kriefall, </em>2003 WI App 119, \u00b6 19, 265 Wis. 2d at 497-498, 665 N.W.2d at 428 (discussing the federal requirement that meat-processing plants devise and follow Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point Systems). Although Sizzler USA Franchise identified Schwochert as a trial witness, it did not designate him as an expert witness to give opinions within the scope of then-extant Wis. Stat. Rule 907.02.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Excel did not depose Schwochert.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\">\u00b6 39. Excel contends that the trial court improperly permitted Schwochert to testify as an expert, in violation of the trial court's scheduling order, which required that persons to be called to give expert testimony be identified as such. Specifically, Excel points to Schwochert's opinion that, as phrased by its main brief on this appeal, \"it would take 'someone being killed' before the meat processing industry would implement procedures whereby it could produce a non-defective product.\" (Quoting Schwochert's testimony.) Excel points to nothing else in Schwochert's testimony that it claims was an opinion within the scope of Wis. Stat. Rule 907.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\u00b6 40. Assuming with some skepticism but not deciding one way or another that the quoted testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>was an \"expert\" opinion, the problem with Excel's appellate argument is that it does not point to any place during the trial (or before, via a motion <em>in limine) </em>where it contemporaneously objected to that opinion or to any question on the ground that the question called for Schwochert's \"expert\" opinion. A witness's ability to testify about a matter, whether a non-expert observation or an expert opinion, is decided question-by-question. <em>See Brown County v. Shannon R., </em>2005 WI 160, \u00b6 36, 286 Wis. 2d 278, 300, 706 N.W.2d 269, 281 (\"An expert witness is qualified if 'he or she has superior knowledge in the area in which the precise question lies.' An expert witness, though qualified to testify, may not be qualified to testify with regard to a particular question.\") (quoted sources and footnotes omitted); Wis. Stat. Rule 906.02 (\"A witness may not testify <em>to a matter </em>unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support <em>a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter. </em>Evidence to prove personal knowledge may, but need not, consist of the testimony of the witness. This rule is subject to the provisions of s. 907.03 relating to opinion testimony by expert witnesses.\") (emphasis added). The day after the \" 'someone being killed'\" comment, Excel's lawyer complained to the trial court that what the lawyer was \"concerned about is just the unfairness to us of having a person who was not identified as an expert offering expert testimony, especially if that person was never deposed.\" A little later in the transcript, Excel's lawyer appeared to withdraw whatever objection he had just made, by telling the trial court: \"If they put it in through him [Schwochert], that's fine.\" Excel did not ask the trial court to strike whatever expert-opinion testimony Schwochert might have given.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>\u00b6 41. By not contemporaneously objecting to any expert testimony Schwochert was asked to give, or, at the very least, seeking to have the trial court strike the allegedly offending testimony, Excel cannot now complain that receipt of that testimony was error. Wisconsin Stat. Rule 901.03 is specific:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-4\">Error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">(a) <em>Objection. </em>In case the ruling is one admitting evidence, a timely objection or motion to strike appears of record, stating the specific ground of objection, if the specific ground was not apparent from the context.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Accordingly, we reject Excel's claim of trial-court error in connection with Schwochert's testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">2. <em>Testimony ofAjaib Singh.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">\u00b6 42. Dr. Singh is a microbiologist with the Wisconsin Department of Health. As part of his work for the Department, he had identified the <em>E. coli </em>pathogen as the cause of illness at the E&amp;B Sizzler restaurants. Excel named him as a fact witness, not as an expert witness. Sizzler USA Franchise deposed Dr. Singh about his work and what he discovered in connection with the illness. At trial, Excel wanted to call Dr. Singh as an expert witness to testify about whether it was possible for the <em>E. coli </em>pathogen to travel in the air from meat to the food eaten by those who got sick at the E&amp;B Sizzler restaurants. Unlike the situation with Schwochert, however, Sizzler USA Franchise and E&amp;B objected to this proposed testimony <em>before </em>Dr. Singh testified. They argued that Dr. Singh never disclosed in any report or at his deposition that he had an opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>on whether the pathogen could travel in the air from the meat to other food in the restaurants. Sustaining their objections, the trial court did not permit Dr. Singh to testify about whether the pathogen's aerosolization was possible. It explained why, and we reprint the pertinent parts of the trial court's analysis because, as noted earlier, whether to allow receipt of evidence is within the trial court's discretion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-4\">Dr. Singh is \u2014 will be allowed to testify as a fact witness as to the facts but will not be allowed to go beyond whatever report he submitted ... with respect to questions as an expert microbiologist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\">Dr. Singh may be an expert microbiologist, but he was never designated as such and he never supplied a report as such....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">[T]o allow Dr. Singh to testify on this question of aerosolization would, in fact, be trial by ambush ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-7\">I want to point out one other thing: The question of aerosolization is nothing new or surprising in this case .... Although it hasn't been directly stated, I think it's legitimate for Excel to assert that Dr. Singh would not be called as a probative expert, but called only in rebuttal to the testimony that's already been given .... But as a rebuttal witness, it would still be trial by ambush to have Dr. Singh come in and testify about something that has been a key primary issue in this lawsuit, a whole \u2014 a huge really hook here as to E&amp;B's \u2014 the possibility of E&amp;B's negligence. And that, of course, is how did the bacteria get to the salad bar or to the watermelon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-8\">And if Excel intended to present an opinion on the subject through Dr. Singh, that opinion, the scheduling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>order clearly required that that be disclosed. And not only that, but we've had years of time since the first scheduling order was issued. One year together, which we've all worked intensively to get this thing ready to go, dozens upon dozens of motions in limine. And certainly Excel could have present \u2014 could have obtained a written report and presented it to the other parties well in advance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">The trial court assessed Excel's passing argument that Dr. Singh's testimony about aerosolization would merely be \"rebuttal,\" noting, as we see, that the issue was in the case for a long time. Thus, the trial court recognized that the matter was not new and that it did not enter the case as a surprise to Excel. This is fully consistent with established law. <em>See Rausch v. Buisse, </em>33 Wis. 2d 154, 167, 146 N.W.2d 801, 808 (1966) (\"The general rule is that the plaintiff, in his rebuttal, may only meet the new facts put in by the defendant in his case in reply.\"). The trial court also asked Sizzler USA Franchise and E&amp;B: \"So do you want time to depose Dr. Singh before the trial?\" The question, however, was, apparently lost amidst the ensuing discussion about Dr. Singh and other witnesses, and Excel never offered that as a solution to the trial court's order preventing Dr. Singh from giving an expert opinion about aerosolization. As evident from the trial court's careful analysis, Excel's contention that the trial court erroneously exercised its discretion in connection with the testimony of Dr. Singh is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">3. <em>Other-Acts Evidence under Wis. Stat. Rule 904.04(2)(a).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\u00b6 43. Excel argues that the trial court erroneously exercised its discretion when it permitted the jury to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>learn of the abysmal sanitary conditions at the Excel plant that produced the meat delivered to the E&amp;B Sizzler restaurants. Specifically, Excel contends that the trial court should have excluded evidence of Noncompliance Records issued to the Excel plant by the Department of Agriculture for the years 1997 to 2000 because carcasses were contaminated by fecal matter, contrary to the required \"zero tolerance\" we discussed in <em>Kriefall, </em>2003 WI App 119, \u00b6 34, 265 Wis. 2d at 511-512, 665 N.W.2d at 435, as well as because the plant's employee-restroom facilities were horrifically unsanitary, a condition that could, according to the testimony, result in the transfer of <em>E. coli </em>from human waste to the meat being processed. As a result of the violations, the plant was both involuntarily and voluntarily shut down for short periods in 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\u00b6 44. The trial court determined that this evidence was admissible under Wis. Stat. Rule 904.04(2)(a). The Rule provides, as material:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-5\">[E]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith. This subsection does not exclude the evidence when offered for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">A trial court applying this Rule must go through a three-stage analysis: (1) \"Is the other acts evidence offered for an acceptable purpose\" under the Rule?; (2) \"Is the other acts evidence relevant\" under Wis. Stat. Rule 904.01?; and, if (1) and (2) are satisfied, (3) \"Is the probative value of the other acts evidence substantially outweighed by\" the factors in Wis. Stat. Rule 904.03? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number><em>See </em>Sullivan, 216 Wis. 2d at 772-773, 576 N.W.2d at 32-33 (1998).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The trial court did that here.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\u00b6 45. Although opining that all nine of the examples listed in Wis. Stat. Rule 904.04(2) (a) applied, the trial court focused on three, noting that the core issue of the case was whether and to what extent Excel was negligent (in comparison with the alleged negligence of E&amp;B and Sizzler USA Franchise): (1) \"motive,\" that is financial gain, which the trial court explained gave context to Excel's cutting corners and having an assembly line moving the carcasses past the inspectors so fast that it was hard for them to detect fecal contamination; (2) \"opportunity,\" that is whether Excel would have been able to correct the many problems and was negligent for not doing so; and (3) \"intent,\" that is why Excel chose to not \"eliminate the need for\" issuance of the deficiency reports that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>highlighted conditions that were conducive to the production of contaminated meat. This is true despite Excel's contention in its reply brief that the human-waste evidence was not admissible because there was no evidence \"that any Excel employee was infected with 0157:H7,\" and no one \"testified that the condition of the restrooms caused <em>E. coli </em>contamination on any Excel product.\" As we have seen, however, there <em>was </em>testimony that human waste could contaminate meat with the <em>E. coli </em>pathogen.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u00b6 46. The trial court also opined that the \"other acts\" were \"relevant,\" the second part of the <em>Sullivan </em>analysis. It also implicitly held that the probative value of the \"other acts\" was not, to use the language of Wis. Stat. Rule 904.03, \"substantially outweighed by the danger[s]\" set out in the rule, noting that \"all of the three factors in the <em>Sullivan </em>analysis apply here.\" The trial court did not erroneously exercise its discretion in denying Excel's motion <em>in limine </em>seeking to exclude the \"other-acts\" evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">4. <em>Alleged Incidents of Norovirus Illness at One of the E&amp;B Sizzler Restaurants.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">\u00b6 47. Excel wanted to introduce evidence that some patrons at one of the E&amp;B Sizzler restaurants got a Norovirus from poor sanitary and food-handling in order to impeach the testimony of one of E&amp;B's principals and an E&amp;B manager that the E&amp;B Sizzler restaurants were well-run and were safe places to eat. This is how Excel's lawyer explained it to the trial court reading a page of the report prepared by Excel's proposed witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">\"It is hypothesized that the Mayfair Sizzler outbreak was caused by two distinct human pathogens, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Norwalk-like [Norovirus] virus and E. coli 0157:H7. Based on the incubation period, signs and symptoms of MRSR, patrons, and the case-control statistical analysis, it is most likely that the 19 patrons with shorter incubation illnesses became ill following consumption of lettuce that was contaminated with Norwalk-like virus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\">There are many reports in the literature which document the transmission of Norwalk-like viruses from the bare hands of symptomatic food handler\" \u2014 excuse me \u2014 \"from the bare hands of symptomatic food handlers to raw fruits and vegetables.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">There are also reports in the literature which document the continued shedding of Norwalk-like virus in the stool of individuals for periods of up to two weeks following cessation of diarrhea.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">And then the next paragraph deals with the two laboratory-confirmed \u2014 the two lab-confirmed cases of E. coli found at Mayfair.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">We set out Excel's offer-of-proof in full because an offer of proof is critical to a trial court's determination whether to receive or exclude evidence, as well as any appellate review. Thus Wis. Stat. Rule 901.03(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-8\">Error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected; and ... . (b) <em>Offer of proof. </em>In case the ruling is one excluding evidence, the substance of the evidence was made known to the judge by offer or was apparent from the context within which questions were asked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">(Paragraphing altered.) <em>See also State v. Robinson, </em>146 Wis. 2d 315, 329, 431 N.W.2d 165, 170 (1988) (Offer of proof requires an \"evidentiary hypothesis underpinned by a sufficient statement of facts to enable [a] court to conclude with reasonable confidence that the evidentiary hypothesis could be sustained.\").</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>\u00b6 48. The trial court denied Excel's motion to receive the Norovirus evidence, noting that \"this is a trial about E. coli; it is not a trial about anything else.\" Further, the trial court opined that insofar as the offer-of-proof indicated that there might have been improper food handling at the E&amp;B Sizzler restaurant, the evidence, if probative, was cumulative: \"And in terms of in general what Excel might regard as sloppy practices in either of the Sizzler restaurants, there is plenty already with all the health department reports and the citation, as well as the careful, thorough cross-examination of the E&amp;B witnesses.\" This is paradigm of a careful balancing under Wis. Stat. Rule 904.03 (\"Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\") The trial court did not erroneously exercise its discretion in denying Excel's motion to inject the Norovirus matter into the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">5. <em>Excel's Request that We Order a New Trial Under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 752.35.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">\u00b6 49. Excel asserts that \"[g]iven the multiple trial errors, the real controversy was not tried.\" It points to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>matters that we have already decided were not257 trial-court error: receipt of the \"other-acts evidence\"; exclusion of the Norovirus evidence; not excluding parts of Schwochert's testimony; and exclusion of Dr. Singh's aerosolization testimony. Although Wis. Stat. \u00a7 752.35 gives us discretion to order a new trial if it appears from the Record that: (1) \"the real controversy has not been fully tried\" or; (2) \"it is probable that justice has for any reason miscarried,\" <em>Vollmer v. Luety, </em>156 Wis. 2d 1, 16, 456 N.W.2d 797, 804 (1990), use of that section is reserved for \"exceptional cases,\" <em>State v. Cuyler, </em>110 Wis. 2d 133, 141, 327 N.W.2d 662, 667 (1983). We will not order a new trial under \u00a7 752.35 where the request is based on contentions that we have already rejected, as Excel asks us to do. <em>See State v. Arredondo, </em>2004 WI App 7, \u00b6 56, 269 Wis. 2d 369, 405, 674 N.W.2d 647, 663-664. Excel's call for a new trial under \u00a7 752.35 is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">D. <em>Verdict Form and Jury Instructions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">1. <em>Jury Instruction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">\u00b6 50. Our standard of review is plain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">A trial court has broad discretion in instructing a jury but must exercise that discretion in order to fully and fairly inform the jury of the applicable rules of law. Whether a jury instruction is appropriate, under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>given facts of a case, is a legal issue subject to independent review. On review, the challenged words of jury instructions are not evaluated in isolation. Rather, jury instructions \"must be viewed in the context of the overall charge.\" Relief is not warranted unless the court is \"persuaded that the instructions, when viewed as a whole, misstated the law or misdirected the jury.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><em>State v. Ellington, </em>2005 WI App 243, \u00b6 7, 288 Wis. 2d 264, 272, 707 N.W.2d 907, 911 (quoted sources omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\u00b6 51. Excel complains that the trial court told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">A producer or manufacturer may not delegate or shift to a buyer or its \u2014 sorry, shift to a buyer its duty to produce a reasonably safe product. One who produces an unreasonably dangerous product is not entitled to expect that others will make it safe. You may consider this in determining whether any party was negligent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">This accurately stated the law, <em>see Deminsky v. Arlington Plastics Machinery, </em>2003 WI 15, \u00b6 21, 259 Wis. 2d 587, 604-605, 657 N.W.2d 411, 420 (recognizing, however, that although the duty to sell a product that is not unreasonably dangerous may not be delegated, ultimate financial liability can be shifted to another via an indemnity agreement), especially since here, as we have already pointed out, Excel could not under the law sell contaminated meat. Excel complains, however, that the \"instruction incorrectly instructed that Excel could be found liable even if E&amp;B's and [Sizzler USA Franchisees negligence contributed to the injury.\" But that is what the law requires when the negligence of more than one party may be a cause of an injury. Thus, the trial court correctly told the jury that restaurants <em>also </em>have a duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>\"to exercise ordinary care in the preparation and processing of [sold or served] food so as to render the [food] reasonably safe for human consumption.\" The trial court explained to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\">The test in determining whether a restaurant operator is negligent in permitting harmful substances to remain in the final food product is not whether the substance may have been natural or proper at some time in the preparation of the food but whether the presence of such substance is natural and ordinarily expected to be found on the final product as served.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">A restaurant operator is not an [finsurer of the reasonable fitness for human consumption of the food prepared by him or her for the sale or service but has a duty of ordinary care to eliminate, remove \u2014 eliminate or remove, during the preparation of the food he or she serves or sells, such harmful natural substance as the consumer of the food, as served, would not ordinarily anticipate and guard against.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">In certain circumstances, a franchisor has a duty to exercise ordinary care in the supervision of its franchisees. To find that a franchisor negligently supervised its franchisee, you must find, one, that the franchisor retained some supervisory control over the manner in which the franchisee's work was done; two, that the franchisee committed a wrongful act; and, three, that the franchisor's failure to exercise ordinary care was caused by [sic \u2014 probably should be \"was a cause of'] the franchisee's wrongful act.[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>As we have seen, the jury apportioned causal negligence for the <em>E. </em>eoZZ-contamination between Excel and E&amp;B, and found that Sizzler USA Franchise, the franchisor, was not negligent at all. On our <em>de novo </em>review of the legal matter in the instructions, we agree that the trial court fully and thoughtfully exercised its discretion in telling the jury about standards it had to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">2. <em>Jury Verdict</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\u00b6 52. Excel complains that the trial court did not put on the verdict or tell the jury that the Rriefall plaintiffs settled the case for $8.5 million, pointing out that ordinarily a jury is asked to determine whether a settlement is reasonable. <em>See United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v. Milwaukee &amp; Suburban Transport Corp., </em>18 Wis. 2d 1, 13, 117 N.W.2d 708, 715 (1962) (\"The joint tort-feasor's liability [in contribution] is based in part on the reasonableness of the settlements. To find whether the settlements were reasonable is properly within the scope of the jury. Any competent evidence is admissible showing the amounts of the settlements or their reasonableness and, likewise, their unreasonableness.\"). The trial court recognized the general rule, but determined that <em>as a matter of law </em>the $8.5 million was <em>not </em>reasonable: \"The evidence of Brianna Kriefall's pain and suffering is not sufficient to support $8.5 million in recovery. No reasonable jury could make that determination. Even if you add 500,000 for the loss of society and companionship for the parents, that's not possible.\" (Paragraphing altered.)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">\u00b6 53. It is axiomatic that a trial court may only let the jury decide an issue if there is evidence in the Record that would support the answer sought by the proponent. <em>See Berner Cheese Corp. v. Krug, </em>2008 WI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>95, \u00b6 66, 312 Wis. 2d 251, 280, 752 N.W.2d 800, 815. In essence, the decision the trial court must make is akin to a decision whether to grant or deny a motion for summary judgment, where the proponent must show that there is enough evidence to get a trial on an issue. <em>See Transportation Ins. Co. v. Hunzinger Constr. Co., </em>179 Wis. 2d 281, 291-292, 507 N.W.2d 136,140 (Ct. App. 1993) (burden of demonstrating sufficient evidence to go to trial on party who has burden of proof on issue at trial). Here, the trial court determined that there was <em>not </em>sufficient evidence to support an $8.5 million award to the Kriefalls. Although Excel says this was error, it does not even attempt to show that there was sufficient evidence to support an $8.5 million award. Thus it has not shown that the trial court erred, whether our review of that issue is <em>de novo </em>(as it would be in a review of a decision to grant or deny summary <em>judgment </em>\u2014 see <em>Flejter v. West Bend Mut. Ins. Co., </em>2010 WI App 174, \u00b6 5, 330 Wis. 2d 721, 727, 793 N.W.2d 913, 915) or deferential.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\u00b6 54. Further, as we have already seen, whether to receive evidence is within the trial court's discretion and subject to the balancing required by Wis. Stat. Rule 904.03. The trial court in essence also determined under the unique circumstances it identified that allowing the jury to see what the Kriefalls were paid to settle their claims, and allow argument as to whether <em>that </em>amount was right or fair or justified, would divert the jury's real task of deciding what <em>was </em>a reasonable settlement. The trial court did not erroneously exercise its discretion in making this determination.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">(Cross-Appeal by E&amp;B and Secura)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">A. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence to Support the Jury's Finding that E&amp;B was 20% Causally Negligent for the E. coli-related Injuries to the Patrons of its Sizzler Restaurants.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">\u00b6 55. E&amp;B contends that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to find that it was causally negligent. It focuses on what it argues was the lack of expert testimony tying the <em>E. </em>coZZ-contamination of E&amp;B's non-meat products to what E&amp;B did or did not do to. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">\u00b6 56. Our review of a jury's verdict is circumscribed by the realization that a jury is better able to get a sense of the trial's flow and the witness's credibility than is an appellate court faced with a transcript:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-10\">The scope of our review of the jury's verdict is narrow. \"No motion challenging the sufficiency of the evidence as a matter of law to support a verdict, or an answer in a verdict, shall be granted unless the court is satisfied that, considering all credible evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is made, there is no credible evidence to sustain a finding in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>favor of such party.\" Rule 805.14(1), Stats. Special deference is given to a jury verdict that is approved by the trial court. Thus, where, as here, the trial court has approved the jury verdict, the scope of our review is even narrower: the verdict may not be overturned unless \"there is such a complete failure of proof that the verdict must be based on speculation.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><em>Kuklinski v. Rodriguez, </em>203 Wis. 2d 324, 331, 552 N.W.2d 869, 872 (Ct. App. 1996) (other than to Rule 805.14(1), citations and quoted sources, omitted). Further, in reviewing a verdict to ascertain whether, under our very narrow scope of review, there is sufficient evidence to support a verdict, we must also see whether circumstantial evidence supports the verdict \u2014 this is the rule even in criminal cases, where, of course, a jury may not find a defendant guilty unless the evidence proves the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt (as opposed to the much lower preponderance-of-the-evidence standard applicable here). <em>See State v. Poellinger, </em>153 Wis. 2d 493, 507-508, 451 N.W.2d 752, 758 (1990). Thus, <em>Poellinger </em>teaches \"that circumstantial evidence is oftentimes stronger and more satisfactory than direct evidence.\" <em>Id., </em>153 Wis. 2d at 501, 451 N.W.2d at 755. Finally, in assessing a jury verdict we must look for evidence that will support it, not overturn it. <em>Reuben v. Koppen, </em>2010 WI App 63, \u00b6 19, 324 Wis. 2d 758, 774, 784 N.W.2d 703, 711. There was no \"complete failure of proof' supporting the jury's finding that E&amp;B was contributorily negligent; indeed the evidence was far more than sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">\u00b6 57. As material, our analysis has two parts: (1) Whether there was sufficient evidence that E&amp;B knew or should have known that using knives and cutting boards to both prepare raw meat and foods that would not be cooked \u2014 here, fruits and vegetables\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>could result in dangerous cross-contamination, that is the contamination of the fruits and vegetables from pathogens on the meat; and (2) Whether there was sufficient evidence that E&amp;B permitted its employees to use knives and cutting boards for both raw meat and fruits and vegetables. The answer to both these inquiries is \"yes.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\u00b6 58. The jury heard from John Antosiewicz, who had extensive experience in the restaurant business. He was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">\u2022 a \"manager1 with Rustler Steakhouse, which Antosiewicz said was taken over by \"Sizzler\" in 1985;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">\u2022 a Sizzler \"[slystem manager, restaurant manager, training unit manager, regional training supervisor, [and] franchise consultant\" from 1985 to 2003;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">\u2022 \"certified to be an instructor\" in a Food and Drug Administration \"Serve Safe\" food code that was a \"[Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point] guidelines, food safety and sanitation\" system for restaurants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Antosiewicz was a \"franchise consultant\" with Sizzler in 1999 and 2000. As such, he \"was dealing with\" the E&amp;B Sizzler restaurants within \"[a] year or two\" before the <em>E. coli </em>outbreak at the restaurants in the summer of 2000. He testified that his job in connection with the E&amp;B Sizzler restaurants was \"[t]o visit the restaurants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>do their operations evaluations, assist the franchisee in any way I could to help improve their operations, profitability.\" He described one of the critical aspects of food-safety handling as set out in a September 1998 restaurant Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point checklist:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\">[Djifferent food groups should be handled separately. After preparing one of those items, the area should be cleaned and sanitized prior to preparing a different type of item. Especially high protein items such as beef and chicken should be separate from lettuces and salad bar items and things like that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Antosiewicz explained that separation was necessary, \"[b]ecause different foods contain different bacterias and can be transmitted into other foods and sometimes bacteria can grow more rapidly and, you know, in certain types of foods.\" He said that he knew all of this before \"the summer of 2000.\" Antosiewicz also testified that in 1998, \"Sizzler\" told its franchisees to follow the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point in connection with the handling food.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\u00b6 59. E&amp;B does not question Antosiewicz's ability to testify under the then extant version of Wis. Stat. Rule 907.02.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> E&amp;B also does not dispute that it was told the things Antosiewicz said it was told. Moreover, and significantly, the label on the Excel meat delivered to the E&amp;B restaurants warned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>Some food products may contain bacteria that could cause illness if the product is mishandled or cooked improperly. For your protection, follow these safe handling instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-4\">Keep raw meat and poultry separate from other foods. Wash working surfaces (including cutting boards), utensils, and hands after touching raw meat or poultry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The jury thus had sufficient evidence that restaurant managers either knew or should have known that meat should be kept away \"from lettuce and salad bar\" foods.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">\u00b6 60. Further, although Antosiewicz was a qualified expert witness, \"expert testimony is <em>required </em>only if the issue to be decided by the jury is beyond the general knowledge and experience of the average juror.\" <em>State v. </em>Whitaker, 167 Wis. 2d 247, 255, 481 N.W.2d 649, 652 (Ct. App. 1992) (emphasis by <em>Whitaker). </em>The need to keep raw meat away from foods that are not going to be cooked is something within an average juror's \"general knowledge and experience,\" especially given the drumbeat of warnings about cross-contamination that pervades the media, a matter about which we can take judicial notice. <em>See </em>Wis. Stat. Rule 902.01(3) (\"A judge or court may take judicial notice, whether requested or not.\").<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus, a federal-government site on food safety advises that \"The Basics\" are: Clean, Separate, Cook <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>and Chill.\" http://foodsafety.gov/keep/basics/index.html (last visited June 1, 2011) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\u00b6 61. The jury also had extensive evidence that E&amp;B did not heed the warnings on the Excel label and keep separate from salad-bar items equipment used to prepare raw meat. Thus, a report prepared by the Communicable Disease Epidemiology Section of the Wisconsin Division of Public Health's Bureau of Communicable Diseases in the Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services, indicates that its investigators looking into the \"Outbreak of Gastrointestinal Illness at the Mayfair Road Sizzler Restaurant, Wauwatosa, WI; July - August, 2000\" either saw or were told by E&amp;B employees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>\u2022 \"Vegetables (lettuce) are routinely washed and chopped in the same room that meat is tenderized in.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-4\">\u2022 A person working at the restaurant's salad bar told an investigator, as phrased by the Report: \"Cutting boards should be checked, she thinks meat cutter uses same board to cut meat and ready-to-eat foods.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">\u2022 A \"slicer was used for raw rib-eye meats and ready-to-eat foods. It contained observed food debris.\"<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-6\">\u2022 \"(In the general preparation line of counters area, where salads are prepared.) The Hobart mixer had the meat grinder attached to it at this time. When asked what it was used for, the manager revealed that the leftover raw meat and meat tips were ground for the taco meat with this attachment. This occurs 1 or 2 times/week. When asked what occurs in the bowl of the Hobart mixer (directly beneath the grinder), the manager revealed that butter/cream was whipped there. The bowl had a metal spatter guard on it that covered about a two-inch periphery of the bowl. It would be difficult to observe the contents of the bowl with the spatter guard attached. (*Dripped raw meat juices or meat debris in the bowl would be unnoticeable, even to the user of the grinder with this bowl and guard attached!).\" (Asterisk and parentheticals in original.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">\u2022 \"Raw meat was being processed in the same area as the processing of ready-to-eat salad ingredients.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>\u2022 \"The lettuce chopper was located in the meat room on the counter where meat processing occurred.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-4\">\u2022 \"The only lettuce/vegetable cleaning sink was located in the meat room.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">\u2022 \"There was no handwash sink in the meat room.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">\u2022 \"There would be concerns for employees using the sink in the meat room for interchangeable hand-washing and food cleaning.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Among other things, the Report recommended that <em>\"Designated cutting boards </em>should be used, cleaned and stored separately. Interchangeable use <em>should be discontinued.\" </em>(Underlining in original; emphasis added.).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>\u00b6 62. Mary Proctor, Ph.D., who, when she was a supervisor in the Communicable Disease Epidemiological Section, had a significant role in preparing the reports in connection with the gastrointestinal-illness outbreaks at the E&amp;B Sizzler restaurants, testified that taco meat, which tested positive for <em>E. coli </em>0157-.H7, \"was the source for the 0157:H7 in the [Layton Avenue E&amp;B Sizzler] restaurant.\" As we have seen, the Report indicated that an E&amp;B manager admitted that the Hobart mixer was used to both grind taco meat and whip \"butter/cream.\" Dr. Proctor also testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-4\">\u2022 The <em>E. coli </em>outbreak at the Mayfair E&amp;B Sizzler restaurant was caused by cross-contamination of multiple salad bar items with raw meat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">\u2022 That in both E&amp;B Sizzler restaurants there were the following food-safety problems: \"Raw food being prepared on chopping boards right next to a grinder where meat was prepared; using the same knives for cutting raw produce with meat product; stirring; cutting boards and knives in standing water so that they could become cross-contaminated; lack of adequate hand-washing after handling meat products and the handling of other things.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">\u2022 The Mayfair Sizzler outbreak, as the Report, as read to her during her testimony indicated,\" 'was caused by cross-contamination of multiple salad bar items with raw meat.'\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">\u2022 The Layton Avenue Sizzler outbreak, as the Report, as read to her during her testimony indicated, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>also caused by the handling in the restaurant of raw Excel meat: \" 'Cross-contamination of fresh watermelon with raw meat product was the mechanism by which the vehicle [that is, the vehicle for the infection \u2014 the watermelon] became contaminated, and the raw [Excel] sirloin tri-tips were the source of the E. coli 0157:H7 organisms in this outbreak.'\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Dr. Porter then explained why the food-handling layout of both the E&amp;B Sizzler restaurants was unsafe:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">The fact that, as I mentioned very early on this morning, the cutting up the raw fruit and vegetables on cutting boards next to the mixer where the taco meat would be ground, storing cutting boards and knives in water in the sink, using them for both meat and for \u2014 you don't have a designated knife for meat and a designated one for raw produce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">There was more than enough evidence to support the jury's verdict that E&amp;B was contributorily negligent.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">B. <em>Whether Excel's Guaranty to Never Ship Contaminated Meat Made E&amp;B Not Negligent as a Matter of Law.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">\u00b6 63. E&amp;B contends that because, as <em>Deminsky </em>recognized, a manufacturer of an unsafe product cannot delegate to a buyer its duty to make a safe product, Excel's undertaking to produce pathogen-free meat relieves E&amp;B from its causal contributory negligence for the illness suffered by E&amp;B's patrons. <em>See Deminsky, </em>2003 WI 15, \u00b6 21, 259 Wis. 2d at 604-605, 657 N.W.2d at 420. E&amp;B seeks to have us \"hold that, as a matter of law, Excel may not reduce its indemnification obligation under the 1993 Agreement because it delivered adulterated meat.\" This contention is a non-starter.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>\u00b6 64. First, as we have seen, the 1993 Hold Harmless Agreement specifically provided that \" [Excel]'s indemnification obligations hereunder shall not apply <em>to the extent </em>that Claims are caused by the negligent acts or omissions of [Sysco] or any other third party.\" (Emphasis added.) As we have already seen, E&amp;B does not contend that it is not an \"other third party.\" The jury found that to \"the extent\" of twenty-percent, E&amp;B's negligence caused the injuries (or, as the Agreement refers to such matters, \"Claims\").</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">\u00b6 65. Second, holding E&amp;B twenty-percent responsible for the \"Claims\" does not impose a duty on <em>it </em>to make Excel's meat safe; holding E&amp;B causally negligent merely recognizes that E&amp;B's negligence created the opportunity for Excel's unsafe meat to actually cause harm. Here, the jury found a confluence of events jointly caused the \"injuries\": <em>E. </em>co/i-tainted meat <em>and </em>E&amp;B's unsafe food handling. E&amp;B's contention that it is relieved as a matter of law of its contributory responsibility for the \"Claims\" is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">C. <em>Excel's Claim Against E&amp;B for Contribution.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">\u00b6 66. As we have seen, under the Hold Harmless Agreement, Excel promised to indemnify E&amp;B for \"Claims\" but only \"to the extent\" that the damages for those \"Claims\" were not caused by E&amp;B's negligence. Pursuant to this undertaking, Excel settled claims asserted by the Kriefall plaintiffs, and sought contribution from E&amp;B because, Excel contended, Excel paid more than its fair share (100% rather than 80%) in light of the jury's finding that E&amp;B was twenty-percent causally negligent with respect to those claims. E&amp;B argues that the trial court erroneously refused to dismiss Excel's claim for contribution in connection with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>the Kriefall settlement, contending, as phrased by its main brief on this appeal, that \"Excel reserved only the right to reduce its indemnification obligation \u2014 to the extent that it proves third-party [E&amp;B] causal negligence.\" We disagree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-4\">A right to contribution may be based on an express contract between the parties. It may also arise by operation of law to rectify an inequity resulting when a co-obligor pays more than a fair share of a common obligation. In the latter instance, the contract is implied by law. When no express agreement confers a right of contribution, a partys right to seek contribution against another is premised on two conditions: (1) the parties must be liable for the same obligation; and (2) the party seeking contribution must have paid more than a fair share of the obligation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-5\"><em>Kafka v. Pope, </em>194 Wis. 2d 234, 242-243, 533 N.W.2d 491, 494 (1995) (footnote and internal citation omitted). Thus, a party that pays more than it contracted to pay under a guaranty may recover in contribution against the other party to the guaranty if the first party paid more than its fair share of the obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\u00b6 67. E&amp;B disputes the rule we see in <em>Kafka, </em>however, and relies on Restatement (Second) Torts \u00a7 866A(4) for the proposition that <em>any </em>indemnification agreement cuts off <em>any </em>right to contribution: \"When one tortfeasor has a right of indemnity against another, neither of them has a right of contribution against the other.\" But this <em>only </em>applies when the \"indemnity\" is for the <em>full amount </em>of the liability, which, of course, is not the case here. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) Torts \u00a7 866A cmt. 4 (\"Indemnity, which shifts the entire loss from one tortfeasor to another, and contribution, which shifts only a proportionate share of that loss, are mutually inconsistent remedies. When there is a right of indem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>nity, it controls, and neither tortfeasor has a right of contribution against the other.\"). This is the same reason why <em>Callahan v. A.J. Welch Equipment Corp., </em>634 N.E.2d 134 (Mass. App. Ct. 1994), relied on by E&amp;B also is not helpful. <em>Callahan </em>denied contribution because the party seeking contribution agreed to totally indemnify the party from whom it sought contribution; a Massachusetts statute made total indemnity and contribution mutually exclusive remedies. <em>Id., </em>634 N.E.2d at 138 (\"General Laws c. 231B, \u00a7 1(e) simply provides that there is no contribution in cases where a right of indemnity exists.\"). We set out the entire section in the footnote.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>\u00b6 68. Here, Excel had an obligation to indemnify E&amp;B to the extent that E&amp;B's negligence did not cause the damages. The Record indicates that it paid the full amount of the settlement with the Kriefall plaintiffs. Indeed, as we have seen, E&amp;B sought indemnity from, and to tender its defense to, Excel under the Hold Harmless Agreement. As we have also seen, Excel acquiesced \"under a reservation of rights,\" which, among other things, contended \"that the 1993 Hold Harmless Agreement and Guaranty/Warranty of Product\" did not apply. In any event, Excel's contribution claim against E&amp;B is limited to the amount Excel paid in settlement that was more than Excel's fair share of what must be a \"reasonable settlement.\" <em>See Fire Ins. Exchange v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., </em>2000 WI App 82, \u00b6 8, 234 Wis. 2d 314, 322, 610 N.W.2d 98, 103 (A \"settling party\" seeking contribution must \"prove that: (1) both parties were obligated to the payee; (2) the amount of the payment was reasonable; and (3) the proportionate fault with negligent tortfeasors.\") The trial court did not err in refusing to dismiss Excel's contribution claims against E&amp;B.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>D. <em>E&amp;B's Claim for Business Damages.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\u00b6 69. E&amp;B contends that the trial court erred in not concluding that the 1993 Hold Harmless Agreement covered E&amp;B's business losses and not just money that E&amp;B might owe in connection with claims asserted by injured persons. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\u00b6 70. As we have seen, under the Hold Harmless Agreement, as material to this part of the opinion, Excel \"agree[d] to defend, indemnify and hold harmless [E&amp;B] from all actions suits, claims and proceedings (\"Claims\"), and any judgments, damages, fines, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting therefrom.\" As we have also seen, the Agreement covered claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">(ii) brought or commenced by any person or entity against any [customer] for the recovery of damages for the injury, illness and/or death of any person or damage to property arising out of or alleged to have arisen out of (a) the delivery, sale, resale, labeling, use or consumption of any Product, or (b) the negligent acts or omissions of [Excel]; provided, however, that [Excel]'s indemnification obligations hereunder shall not apply to the extent that Claims are caused by the negligent acts or omissions of [E&amp;B],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">E&amp;B's contention that the Agreement is not limited to \"damages for the injury, illness and/or death of any person or damage to property,\" is belied by the words, which set the parameters of what the Agreement covered because the \"damages, fines, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees)\" is not a stand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>alone listing, but, rather, is tied to <em>\"resulting therefrom,\" </em>(Emphasis added.) This means, as the trial court pointed out, that the items in the listing <em>must be consequential to personal-injury or property-damage claims. </em>On our <em>de novo </em>review of the trial court's application <em>of </em>the Agreement's clear language, we affirm its denial of E&amp;B's request for business damages that did not flow from the personal-injury \"Claims.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">E. <em>E&amp;B's Motion to Amend its Complaint Against Excel to Add a Claim for Breach of Implied Warranty.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u00b6 71. E&amp;B sought to amend its complaint some three years after the time for doing so expired. The trial court, however, did not deny E&amp;B's motion because it was untimely, but, rather, denied it because it viewed the implied-warranty claim E&amp;B sought to assert against Excel as not a \"viable cause of action.\" On our <em>de novo </em>review of this legal issue, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\u00b6 72. \"Wisconsin has always required privity of contract in an action for a breach of implied warranty.\" <em>Dippel v. Sciano, </em>37 Wis. 2d 443, 449,155 N.W.2d 55, 57 (1967). Wisconsin still does, <em>see Northridge Co. v. W.R. Grace and Co., </em>162 Wis. 2d 918, 938 n.15, 471 N.W.2d 179, 187 n.15 (1991), and we are bound, of course, by supreme court decisions, <em>State v. Jones, </em>2010 WI App 133, \u00b6 21, 329 Wis. 2d 498, 510, 791 N.W.2d 390, 396. Although E&amp;B was a foreseeable, indeed, an intended, recipient of the Excel meat, Excel's contracts were with Sizzler International and Sysco, not E&amp;B: The 1997 Continuing Guarantee was between Excel and Sizzler International, and, as we have already seen, the Continuing Guarantee excludes liability for \"consequential damages.\" The 1993 Hold Harmless Agreement was between Excel and Sysco, and was also for the benefit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Sysco's customers, which includes E&amp;B. Although, of course, this would make E&amp;B an intended beneficiary of the Hold Harmless Agreement, E&amp;B <em>was already covered by its terms. </em>Third-party beneficiaries (and E&amp;B asserts that it is one), succeed to the rights of the contract that is intended to benefit them, and nothing more. <em>See Milwaukee Area Technical College v. Frontier Adjusters of Milwaukee, </em>2008 WI App 76, \u00b6 20, 312 Wis. 2d 360, 377, 752 N.W.2d 396, 404 (\"A person may enforce a contract as third-party beneficiary if the contract indicates that he or she was either specifically intended by the contracting parties to benefit from the contract or is a member of the class the parties intended to benefit.\"). It would also distort the law if an intended beneficiary of an express warranty <em>that excluded damages </em>sought by the intended beneficiary (as does the Continuing Guarantee) could boot-strap entitlement to those damages through that express warranty. Stated another way, as recognized by <em>AT&amp;T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, </em>563 U.S. _, 131 S. Ct. 1740 (2011), it makes no sense to have something (in our case, an express warranty; in <em>AT&amp;T Mobility, </em>a statute) that negates a remedy only to have that something be a conduit for the enforcement of that remedy. <em>See id., </em>563 U.S. at_, 131 S. Ct. at 1748 (\"In other words, the act cannot be held to destroy itself.\") (internal quotation marks and quoted sources omitted) (applying the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16).

By offer of settlement dated March 23, 2007, sent to Excel, Secura offered \"to settle all claims asserted against\" Excel for $1,850,000.

The $800,000 came into play in connection with the \u00a7 807.01(4) offer of settlement because, as we have also seen, the trial court held that Secura was entitled to recover that money from Excel although, it was, as we have pointed out, essentially a gift to Secura because Federal Insurance never sought to get it back from Secura or to recover the money from Excel. In light of our ruling that the trial court erred in letting Secura recover the money from Excel, the offer-of-settlement issue is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">(Cross-Appeal by Sizzler USA Franchise)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">A. <em>Continuing Guaranty.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\u00b6 74. Sizzler USA Franchise complains that the trial court improperly enforced the provision in the 1997 Continuing Guaranty that excluded \"incidental or consequential damages,\" claiming that, contrary to the trial court's conclusion, the exclusion was \"unconscionable\" and, therefore, not enforceable. In light of our determination that Sizzler USA Franchise may recover its incidental and consequential damages <em>via </em>the implied-warranty route mapped by the Uniform Commercial Code, discussed earlier, whether the trial court correctly upheld the exclusion clause in the Continuing Guaranty is moot. <em>See Gross, </em>227 Wis. at 300, 277 N.W at 665 (only dispositive issue need be addressed).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>B. <em>Equitable Indemnity.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">\u00b6 75.

In its oral decision on Sizzler USA Franchise's equitable-indemnity request, the trial court noted that the jury had considered whether Sizzler USA Franchise should be reimbursed for that money:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">In the course of the trial, the jury determined that Sizzler USA [Franchise] was \u2014 did suffer the loss of profits, six and a half million dollars of profits, the loss of franchise royalties, $350,000 and out-of-pocket expenses as a result of the outbreak [attributable] to the negligent parties. One of the out-of-pocket expenses presented to the jury for this consideration was this one and a half million dollars in advance payment made to the Kriefall family based upon a mathematical calculation of the out-of-pocket expenses that were presented by Sizzler USA [Franchise] to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">It is evident that the jury chose to compensate Sizzler USA [Franchise] for the line item out-of-pocket expenses advocated by [Sizzler USA Franchise's lawyer] on behalf of Sizzler [USA Franchise] except for the one and a half million dollars advance payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The trial court then analyzed whether it should \"as a separate and distinct matter of law and exercise of discretion,\" \"make a determination that in fairness and equity that Sizzler [USA Franchise] is entitled to reimbursement of that money along with its reasonable attorney fees.\" The trial court held that Sizzler USA Franchise was not entitled to the reimbursement. The trial court did not rely on the jury's rejection of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>claim, and Excel does not argue that the jury's rejection makes equitable indemnity unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\u00b6 76. Equitable indemnity kicks in when \" 'one person is exposed to liability by the wrongful act of another in which he does not join.'\" <em>Brown v. LaChance, </em>165 Wis. 2d 52, 64, 477 N.W.2d 296, 302 (Ct. App. 1991) (quoted source omitted). As we have seen, the jury vindicated Sizzler USA Franchise's contentions that it was not liable for the <em>E. </em>coZZ-contamination and the resulting death of Brianna Kriefall and the illnesses of the other patrons of the two E&amp;B Sizzler restaurants. It thus can be fairly said that the jury determined that Sizzler USA Franchise did \"not join\" in the \"wrongful act[s]\" of the others found to be causally negligent for the contamination.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">\u00b6 77. Sizzler USA Franchise paid the $1.5 million pursuant to a document titled \"Advance Partial Payment Pursuant to Sec. 885.285 Wis. Stats.\" (Uppercasing omitted.)<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> As can be seen from the statute, which we reprint in the footnote, the statute does not answer the question whether someone who makes a payment seeking the protections afforded by that provision is entitled to recoupment from a tortfeasor found to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>more liable than the payor. Excel argues that Sizzler USA Franchise was a mere volunteer and paid the money out of the goodness of its corporate heart, and points to testimony by Sizzler USA Franchise's chief executive officer, who said that the Kriefall tragedy significantly affected the company and its board of directors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-4\">[I]t is a very emotional thing. And as a board, we met and talked about it, and the feeling was we should do everything we could do, but at the same time we didn't want to overreact and look like we're guilty parties in this thing. We felt responsible but we didn't feel that it was our fault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">And so we contact the Kriefalls' minister and we volunteered to help the family in any way we could but to do it anonymously so that it didn't look like we were trying to buy off the family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">And they ended up accepting help for their relatives to come to the funeral, but that was the only thing that they said that they needed or wanted at that time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">When asked whether the company \"ultimately ma[d]e a payment to the Kriefalls,\" Sizzler USA Franchise's chief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>executive officer replied: \"We did.\" Sizzler USA Franchise paid the $1.5 million. When asked what was Sizzler USA Franchise's understanding of what it was getting for its money, the chief executive officer replied: \"We got a settlement.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">\u00b6 78. The Advance Partial Payment agreement with the Kriefalls recited that Sizzler USA Franchise \"desires to make an Advance Payment to the Kriefall Plaintiffs,\" and recited the basic facts of the outbreak (the Excel meat sold to the E&amp;B Sizzler restaurant where the Kriefalls ate the contaminated food, and that Sizzler USA Franchise \"expressly denie[s]\" \"liability and negligence\" for the Kriefall's injuries). It then provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">Sizzler [USA Franchise] hereby agrees to pay the Kriefalls, pursuant to sec. 885.285, Wis. Stats., the sum of $1.5 million . . . and in the event that judgment is entered [in the action] in favor of the Kriefalls against Sizzler [USA Franchise], this payment shall be a credit, in addition to any other credits to which Sizzler [USA Franchise] is entitled, up to the amount of the payment of $2 million against any judgments the Kriefalls obtain against Sizzler [USA Franchise].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\u00b6 79. The Advance Partial Payment agreement also recited that if the Kriefalls did not prevail in their lawsuit against Sizzler USA Franchise, they could keep the $1.5 million nevertheless. It also recited that the money was intended as \"a partial advance payment for legal damages sustained by the Kriefalls,\" and was \"not a release of any cause of action of the Kriefalls or any partial cause of action of the Kriefalls and shall not be construed to be a release of any kind or nature.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">\u00b6 80. Excel invokes the principle that a mere volunteer may not get equitable indemnity. <em>See Milwaukee Mut. Ins. Co. v. Priewe, </em>118 Wis. 2d 318, 323, 348 N.W.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>585, 587 (Ct. App. 1984) (\" 'Indemnification shifts the entire loss from one person who has been compelled to pay it to another who on the basis of equitable principles should bear the loss.'\") (quoted source omitted) (payment made because of obligation imposed by insurance contract). But someone who pays because he or she <em>might </em>be liable, is not a volunteer. <em>Voge, </em>181 Wis. 2d at 731, 512 N.W.2d at 751 (Insurer who was potentially liable is not a volunteer if it pays before the determination of liability.); <em>Perkins v. Worzala, </em>31 Wis. 2d 634, 637-638, 143 N.W.2d 516, 518 (1966) (Insurance company that paid a non-party when its insured was \"potentially liable\" to the non-party was not \"a mere volunteer,\" and the insurance company could, therefore, get indemnity from a 100%-negligent tortfeasor.).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\u00b6 81. It may be that the money Sizzler USA Franchise paid so that members of Brianna Kriefall's family could attend her funeral was voluntary largess. But, as evident from both the Advance Partial Payment agreement and Sizzler USA Franchise's potential liability, Sizzler USA Franchise paid the $1.5 million to buy a modicum of financial peace and not as unalloyed corporate charity. Accordingly, the trial court erred in rejecting Sizzler USA Franchise's equitable indemnity claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\u00b6 82. Excel also argues that if we should hold that Sizzler USA Franchise has an equitable-indemnity claim against Excel, the claim should be reduced by twenty-percent because Excel was only eighty-percent contributorily negligent. We disagree. As between Sizzler USA Franchise and Excel, Excel was one-hundred percent responsible; the eighty-percent/twenty-percent alloca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>tion of the causal negligence for the <em>E. </em>co/i-contamination was between Excel and E&amp;B.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">C. <em>Attorney Fees.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\u00b6 83. Sizzler USA Franchise seeks the lawyer fees it spent defending itself in these <em>E. </em>coZZ-contamination matters. It contends that the trial court erred when it rejected Sizzler USA Franchise's request. Sizzler USA Franchise argues that Excel should be forced to reimburse Sizzler USA Franchise for its legal expenses because Excel's shipment of contaminated meat ensnared Sizzler USA Franchise in this litigation even though the jury found that Sizzler USA Franchise did nothing wrong. We disagree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">Courts in Wisconsin may direct a person or entity to pay another's attorney's fees only in limited circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>stances. This so-called \"American rule\" holds that \"with the exception of those attorneys' fees incurred in third-party litigation caused by the party from whom fees are sought, attorneys' fees may not be awarded unless authorized by statute or by a contract between the parties.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><em>Community Care Organization of Milwaukee County, Inc. v. Evelyn O., </em>214 Wis. 2d 434, 437, 571 N.W.2d 700, 702 (Ct. App. 1997) (quoted source omitted). This statement of the law ultimately comes from <em>Weinhagen v. Hayes, </em>179 Wis. 62, 66, 190 N.W. 1002, 1003 (1922), which explained that a rule that permitted a winning party to get his or her fees from the losing party would be antithetical to a system of open justice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">To hold otherwise would be to open the door to oppression and extortion, to penalize persons who appeal to the courts to adjudicate their differences. It would not be in accord with sound, public policy. The temptation to institute litigation for the purpose of recovering from the opposite party generous fees would be very great and no doubt lead to great abuses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-6\"><em>Id., </em>179 Wis. at 66, 190 N.W. at 1003-1004. Sizzler USA Franchise's enmeshment in this lawsuit was not as someone collateral to the dispute of others, from whom Sizzler USA Franchise seeks its legal expenses, any more than a driver in a chain-reaction collision is collateral to the dispute between the injured plaintiff and those whom the plaintiff contends negligently caused his or her injuries, even though that driver is ultimately determined to be without fault. We affirm the trial court's refusal to let Sizzler USA Franchise recover its legal expenses from Excel.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>\n<em>TV.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">(Conclusion)</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\u00b6 84.

(c) in civil cases ... factual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law, unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness\" is excepted from the rule against hearsay. Rule 908.03(8)(c) encompasses opinions that are fairly based on the investigation. <em>See Beech Aircraft Corp. v. Rainey, </em>488 U.S. 153, 170 (1988) (applying Rule 803(8)(c) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, from which Rule 908.03(8)(c) was copied). Additionally, things that E&amp;B employees told the investigators compiling the Report are specifically excluded from the rule against hearsay by Wis. Stat. Rule 908.01(4)(b)l., 3., or 4., or all of the subsections. Thus, a \"statement\" is not hearsay under Rule 908.01(4)(b) if it is \"offered against a party and is\": \"1. The party's own statement... or .... 3. A statement by a person authorized by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>the party to make a statement concerning the subject [employees authorized by E&amp;B to talk to the investigators], or 4. A statement by the party's agent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of the agent's or servant's agency or employment, made during the existence of the relationship.\" (Paragraphing altered.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b311-4\"> Massachusetts Gen.

Although spanning some three pages in its brief, E&amp;B's \"inequitable\" contention is largely undeveloped except for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>rhetoric and angry assertions that fault Excel for its initial litigation strategy of denying that its meat was a cause of the illnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b316-4\"> Wisconsin Stat. \u00a7 807.01 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">(1)After issue is joined but at least 20 days before the trial, the defendant may serve upon the plaintiff a written offer to allow judgment to be taken against the defendant for the sum, or property, or to the effect therein specified, with costs.

(Exh 9067, 9068; A[ppendix]24-31).\" This is not true; the cited documents are <em>not </em>settlement agreements between Sizzler USA Franchise and the Kriefalls, as Sizzler USA Franchise points out in its reply brief. We caution counsel for Excel, as we cautioned counsel for E&amp;B, that justice can only be done under accepted legal principles if all parties to a dispute take care not to exaggerate or mislead. <em>See Wisconsin Natural Gas Co., </em>220 Wis. 2d at 19 n.3, 582 N.W.2d at 119 n.3 (\"misleading statements in briefs\" violate \"SCR 20:3.3, which requires candor toward tribunals.\"). At the very least, counsel for Excel should have sent a letter to us and- all other counsel either apologizing for the misstatement or, if the agreement Excel's brief describes exists, pointing to where it is in the Record. They have done neither. Further, counsel for Excel did not correct the misstatement during oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
