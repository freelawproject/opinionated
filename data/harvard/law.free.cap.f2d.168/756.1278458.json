Claims 7 to 11, inclusive, 13 to 17, inclusive, and 20 were allowed by the Primary Examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-24\">Claims 2 and 18 are representative of the appealed claims. They read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-25\">\u201c2. In an homogenizer the combination of \u00e1 plurality of spaced compressor elements, means for forcing material between the elements, and means for mutually reciprocating said elements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-26\">\u201c18. In an homogenizer the combination of an elastic body having opposed and continuous compressor elements disposed in spaced relationship, means for passing material between the elements, and reciprocating means for compressing and expanding the body.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-27\">The references relied on are: Oehninger (Swiss) 176,438 April 15, 1935; Williams 2,170,178 August 22, 1939.'</p>\n<p id=\"AND\">The homogenizer disclosed in appellants\u2019 application comprises a cylindrical casing having an inlet opening at one end and an outlet opening at the other. Within the casing, and arranged axially thereof, are two coil springs formed of flat strip material, the springs being located at opposite ends of the casing, with one end of each spring abutting the corresponding end of the casing. The opposite ends of the springs are secured to a plunger member which is mounted for reciprocating movement axially of the casing and which, when reciprocated alternately expands and compresses each of the springs. The fluid to be homogenized enters the casing through the inlet opening where it is agitated between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>the coils of the springs and finally escapes through the outlet opening.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The Swiss patent to Oehninger discloses a mixing device in which the fluids to be mixed are fed into a chamber containing a coil spring. The patentee states that the fluid mixture passes through the windings of the spring \u201cso that a very good mixing is effected.\u201d It is further stated in the patent that the cross section of the wire of which \u25a0the spring is made \u201cmay show any optional form and need by no means be round.\" In one form of the device the spring is connected with an operating lever, by means of which it may be compressed or expanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">The patent to Williams discloses a homogenizer comprising a chamber located between a diaphragm and a cover. The fluid to be homogenized flows into this chamber and the diaphragm is vibrated at a frequency of about 276 cycles while the cover vibrates at a frequency of about 436 cycles, thus agitating and homogenizing the fluid.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">Claims 2, 3, and 4 were rejected on the patent to Williams. Each of those claims calls for a homogenizer comprizing compressor elements and means for \u201cmutually reciprocating\u201d those elements. In the device of the Williams patent the cover and diapliragm are vibrated or reciprocated at different rates. This of course, would result in some relative movement between them but such movement is irregular and \u2022this irregularity is relied on by the patentee as promoting cavitation. In appellants\u2019 .application, on the other hand, the relative \u25a0movement between the coils of the springs is regular and produces a uniform action on the material being treated. The device of Williams and that of appellants- are, therefore, essentially different in operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">We are of opinion that the expression \u25a0\u201cmutually reciprocating\u201d, as it must be con\u2022strued in the light of appellants\u2019 application, requires a regular movement of the compressor elements relatively to each other, and that it should not be so broadly construed as to cover two elements which are reciprocated at different rates of speed. The word \u201cmutual,\u201d as used by appellants, \u2022implies that there is a correspondence between the reciprocations, so that for a given movement of one of the reciprocating elements, there is a corresponding movement of the other. This is not true in the device of the Williams patent and, in view of this fact and of the basic difference in operating principle between the Williams structure and that of appellants, we are of opinion that claims 2, 3, and 4 are patentable over the structure disclosed in the Williams patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">Claims 18 and 19 were rejected on the Swiss patent to Oehninger. Those claims call for an elastic body having opposed compressor elements and reciprocating means for moving those elements. In rejecting claims 18 and 19, the Patent Office tribunals have relied on the coils of the spring of the reference patent as compress- or elements. It is clear, however, that the patentee did not contemplate that those coils should have any compressing function. The means which he' provides for compressing or expanding the spring is merely an adjusting means for varying the distance between the coils of the spring. There is nothing to <em>suggest </em>that there is to be any such movement of, the spring during the mixing operation as would result in a compressing action, and the fact that a round wire is used for the spring in the preferred embodiment of the patentee\u2019s invention affords a further indication that no compression is intended, since there could be very little, if any compression of fluid between the coils of round wire.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-11\">Since the Oehninger patent contemplates an entirely different type of operation from that of appellants\u2019 application, and since the patent does not disclose any parts fairly corresponding to the compression elements called for by claims 18 and 19, we are of opinion that those claims were not properly rejected on that patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-12\">For the reasons stated, the decision of the Board of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-13\">Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b813-14\">By reason of illness, O\u2019CONNELL, Judge, was not present at the argument of this case and did not participate in the decision.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
