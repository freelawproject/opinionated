Appellant, according to its application, is a company under the laws of Great Britain located at Manchester in the County of Lancaster, England.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In its application the allegation was made that the mark had been registered in England February 20, 1942, and specimens showing the mark as actually used were filed with the application. The specimen reproduced in the record consists of the notation \u201cFairy Princess\u201d printed in bold-faced , type, the letters being capitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-20\">On June 3, 1944, appellee filed notice of opposition to the application, alleging: \u201cSince a date long prior to 1942, the date of first use claimed by said applicant [appellant] the opposer [appellee] has continuously used and opposer [appellee] is now using and owns the trade marks \u2018Printzess\u2019 \u2018Yankee Printzess\u2019, \u2018Printzess Petite\u2019, \u2018Printzess Tourister\u2019 \u2018Printzess Knockabout\u2019, \u2018Printzess Deb\u2019, \u2018Printzess\u2014 Distinction in Dress\u2019, and other trade marks of which \u2018Printzess\u2019 is a part, as applied to women\u2019s, misses\u2019, juniors\u2019, teens\u2019, and children\u2019s outer wearing apparel, including coats, suits, skirts, dresses, jackets, scarfs, in Class 39, Clothing, and on textile fabrics in Class 42, Knitted, Netted, and Textile Fabrics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b814-21\">Also, alleged registration of several of the marks, filing copies of such registrations with the notice for consideration under Patent Office rule 154(e), 35 U.S.C.A. Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-22\">It was further alleged that Fairy Princess \u201cso nearly resembles\u201d the quoted marks owned and used by appellee that its use by appellant would be likely \u201cto cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>confusion and mistake in the mind of the public and mislead purchasers,\u201d as to origin of the goods, children\u2019s coats (the goods of appellant) and the articles of wearing apparel made by appellee being alleged to be merchandise of the same descriptive properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">On December 11, 1945, the Examiner of Interferences rendered his decision. He deemed appellee\u2019s registered mark \u201cPrintzess Knockabout,\u201d as applied to women\u2019s wearing apparel- \u2014 -namely jackets, coats, capes, suits, skirts, and waists \u2014 to be the most pertinent of the marks pleaded in the opposition. Tt was pointed out that the word \u201cKnockabout\u201d was disclaimed as descriptive. In substance, he held \u201cPrintzess\u201d to be the dominant part of appellee\u2019s mark, since \u201cKnockabout\u201d was disclaimed, and held \u201cPrincess\u201d to be \u201cat least a very prominent portion of applicant\u2019s [appellant\u2019s] mark,\u201d if not the dominant feature thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">In a decision rendered December 27, 1945, on a request for reconsideration, the Examiner of Interferences said inter alia: \u201cIt seems to the examiner that the [hi: original] decision * * * clearly holds that the mark \u2018Fairy Princess,\u2019 considered as a whole, is so similar to the mark Printzess \u2018Knockabout,\u2019 also considered as .a whole, as to be likely to lead to confusion in trade. Likewise, it is not deemed necessary that the examiner find as a fact that any portion of the applicant\u2019s [appellant\u2019s] mark be considered as the dominant portion. It is sufficient if it be found that mark considered in its entirety is confusingly similar to the opposer\u2019s [appellee\u2019s] mark, as has been done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">The appeal to the Commissioner of Patents having been taken, appellant filed its brief seemingly on October 11, 1946, and filed therewith a proposed disclaimer of the word \u201cPrincess.\u201d In the course of his decision the First Assistant Commissioner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-8\">\u201cConcurrently with its brief on appeal, applicant [appellant] filed a disclaimer of the word \u2018Princess\u2019 in its application, \u2018apart from the other features of the mark;\u2019 and now rests its case primarily upon the ; premise that this word is \u2018in the public domain\u2019 because descriptive. According to applicant [appellant] \u2018there is absolute proof that from 1876 and down to date, the word \u201cPrincess\u201d has been used universally to designate or describe a certain style of women\u2019s garments.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-10\">\u201cApplicant [appellant] disavows any intention to question the validity of op-poser\u2019s [appellee\u2019s] registration, but that is necessarily the purport of its argument. The word \u2018Knockabout? is clearly descriptive of opposer\u2019s [appellee\u2019s] goods; and if \u2018Princess\u2019 is likewise descriptive, so also is \u2018Printzess,\u2019 for these two words are \u2018substantially identical in all respects.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">He pointed out that he had to assume the validity of appellee\u2019s registration, since the validity of a registered mark may be attacked only in a cancellation proceeding, and being of the view that \u201cPrincess,\u201d although disclaimed, \u201cremains at least a prominent part of applicant\u2019s [appellant\u2019s] mark,\u201d held, in effect, that confusion would be likely to result from the concurrent use of \u201cPrintzess Knockabout\u201d and \u201cFairy Princess\u201d upon goods of the same descriptive properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">Before us it is contended on behalf of appellant that \u201cPrincess\u201d is a term descriptive of merchandise such as that to which appellant applies it and that to which appellee applies it. It is argued, in effect, that, therefore, the term \u201cPrincess\u201d has no trade-mark significance and that it should be disregarded. It is urged on behalf of appellant, however, that the word \u201cPrintzess\u201d in appellee\u2019s mark is in a different category. In the brief for appellant it is said: \u201cThe Appellee herein did not use the same word \u2018Princess\u2019 as Appellant used but had a special form and design of a word \u2018Printzess\u2019, which is a coined word derived from the corporate name of Appellee, Printz, with the suffix \u2018ess\u2019. Also, the word \u2018Printzess\u2019 is written in distinctive Gothic letters. Therefore, * * * the comparison between the two words should have been made not in a broad sense but specifically comparing the spelling and the appearance of the two words. When one does so and bears in mind that the common word \u2018Princess\u2019 has no trademark significance, one readily concludes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>that there can be no confusion between the words \u2018Princess\u2019 and \u2018Printzess.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">In other words, it is argued on behalf of appellant that the word \u201cPrincess\u201d in its mark has no trade-mark significance because it is descriptive, but that \u201cPrintzess\u201d in the mark of appellee should be regarded differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">It is somewhat difficult to understand why if appellant was of opinion that \u201cPrincess\u201d had no trade-mark significance it included the word in its application, or why, if in the progress of the case it concluded that the word had no trade-mark significance, it did not cancel it rather than disclaim it.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">A disclaimer is not a cancellation.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">There is retained in appellant\u2019s mark as a part thereof the word \u201cPrincess\u201d which clearly conflicts with the word \u201cPrintzess,\u201d included in appellee\u2019s mark. In this opposition proceeding, as was held by the First Assistant Commissioner, registration of the mark \u201cPrintzess Knockabout,\u201d must be held valid. Its validity can be tested only by a cancellation proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">The decision appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b816-10\">By reason of illness, O\u2019CONNELL, Associate Judge, was not present at the argument of this case and did not participate in the decision.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b814-23\"> As such it is, by reason of treaty agreement, entitled to all the rights, and privileges of the Trade-Mark Registration Act of February 20, 1905, 15 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 81 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
