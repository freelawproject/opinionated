The court refused to receive this evidence because there was no claim set up in the complaint for loss of tenants, &amp;c. The only exception of the defendant that was. heard and considered, on the appeal, was. to this ruling, and the charge of the judge in reference thereto.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b134-9\">The earliest decision of this court on this subject (Shipman v. Burrows, 1 <em>Sail\u2019s Superior Ct.

The-cause of the damages complained of, alleged in the complaint, was that the defendant had failed to keep-the privies, drains, and drain-pipes in his building in proper repair. The jury rendered a verdict in defendant\u2019s favor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-5\">By stipulation, it is agreed that the only exceptions the plaintiff desires to raise on the appeal are the exceptions to the charge, and the exceptions to the ruling-of the court in excluding the rental value of the premises as an element of damage.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-6\"><em>George W.

The court refused to receive the evidence, as proving any special damages, upon the ground that there was no claim for damages in the declaration for loss of tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">The result of this ruling led necessarily to that portion of his charge where he instructed the jury that, in case they found for the plaintiff, he could only recover for the damage to the wall and building, and not for the loss of the rental value of the building. If this ruling was correct, there was nothing left in the complaint, as the evidence shows, which would entitle the plaintiff to damages in case the jury found in his favor. The jury found for the defendant. The refusal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>to receive proof of special damages, under the circumstances, was clearly right. The principle was established among the first cases decided by the learned judges who first presided on the organization of this court. Each of those distinguished justices gave his individual opinion, and the law remains to this day as it was then pronounced (Shipman <em>v. </em>Burroughs, 1 <em>Hall\u2019s Superior Ct. R. </em>411-430).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Freedman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
