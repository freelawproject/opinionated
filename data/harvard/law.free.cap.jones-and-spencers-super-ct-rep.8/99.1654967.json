Other suspicious circumstances were made to appear, and upon all the papers the good faith of the application stood seriously questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Under these circumstances the court at special term not only had the power to require the defendant to pay, as a condition, all costs and disbursements of the plaintiff since the notice of trial, but the imposition \u25a0 of such terms was eminently proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Speir, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
