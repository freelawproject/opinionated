Pullman recovered in the marine court of the city of Mew York, a judgment in their favor against said Herman Ahrensdorf for the sum of two hundred and eighteen dollars and thirty-two cents, and filed and docketed a transcript of said judgment in the office of the clerk of the city and county of Mew York, where said Ahrensdorf then resided, and issued an execution against the property of said Ahrensdorf to the sheriff of the city and county of Mew York, where said Ahrensdorf then resided, directing him to levy and collect the amount of said judgment, with interest from July 21, 1874, beside his fees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-6\">Before the return of this execution, one of the justices of the marine court made an order dated July 31, 1874, in proceedings supplementary to execution, pursuant to \u00a7 294 and \u00a7 298 of the Code of Procedure, whereby the plaintiff was appointed receiver of all the property, debts, equitable interests, rights, and dioses in action of said Herman Ahrensdorf. The execution which had been issued was not returned until September 17, 1874. The plaintiff herein brought this action as such receiver.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-7\">Issue was joined by answer of defendant Orgler to the complaint, and was tried before a single judge at special term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-8\">On the trial, defendant Orgler, among other things, claimed that plaintiff could not sustain his action because (1) the marine court had no power to appoint a receiver ; (2) plaintiff\u2019s appointment as receiver under \u00a7 294, the execution not having been returned, and the judgment debtor being no party to it, was invalid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-9\">The court at special term dismissed the complaint on the second ground, holding the first to be untenable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>The following opinion was delivered :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-5\">Mokell, Ch. J.\u2014\u201c The power of a justice of the marine court to make an order for the examination of a judgment debtor, and in that proceeding to appoint a receiver of the debtor\u2019s property, must depend upon the construction and force to be given to the 7th section of the act of 1874, entitled \u2018 An act in relation to the marine court of the city of New York\u2019 (Laws, 1874, chap. 545).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-6\">\u201cPrevious to the passing of that statute, there was no such power.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-7\">\u201c The section referred to provides that, 1 In all cases where judgments shall be recovered in said court, all proceedings supplementary to execution on said judgments, under- the provisions of the Code, if had in the city of New York, shall be had and completed in the= said marine court, in the same manner and with like effect, in every particular, as now allowed by law in other courts of record, and all provisions of law relating to such proceedings shall apply to said marine court as fully as they now apply to any other court of record.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-8\">\u201cUnder that statute the marine court may entertain these supplementary proceedings, unless deprived of jurisdiction by the effect of filing a transcript of the judgment in the county clerk\u2019s office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-9\">\u201cThe 68th section of the Code, which was made applicable to the marine court, provided that, upon filing a transcript with the clerk of the county, the judgment shall be \u2018 enforced in the same manner, and be deemed a judgment of the court of common pleas.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-10\">\u201c That section was also made applicable to justices\u2019 and other inferior courts of cities, not of record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-11\">\u201cThe marine court at that time was not a court of record, except for certain purposes (Huff v. Knapp, 5 <em>N. Y. </em>65 ; Porter <em>v. </em>Bronson, 29 <em>How. Pr. </em>292), but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>by the act of 1872 <em>(Laws, </em>1872, chap. 629), it is declared to be a court of record for all purposes. That act also provides that the judgments of the court docketed with the county clerk, shall have the same effect as a lien, and be enforced in the same manner as the judgments of the court of. common pleas. It will be seen that the words, \u2018 and be deemed a judgment of the court of common pleas,\u2019 are omitted : and the repealing clause of \u2018 all acts and parts of acts inconsistent with this act,\u2019 is an express repeal of the 68th section of the Code as respects the marine court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-5\">\u201cThe act of 1874is still broader. Section 12 provides that the judgments of the court may be docketed with the county clerk, and shall thereupon have the same effect as a lien, \u2018and be enforced in the said manner as any other judgment of said court,\u2019 thus changing it from \u2018the same manner as judgments of the court of common pleas,\u2019 and leaving it with the marine court to execute its own judgments in all cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-6\">\u201c This change in the statute was not noticed in matter of Lippman <em>(Daily Register, </em>January 13, 1875), nor was it necessary that it should be, as the judgment in that case had not been docketed with the county clerk.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-7\">\u201cIt is quite clear, therefore, I think, that under the last statute, the marine court is given power to execute Its own judgments in the same manner that other courts of record may do ; and whether docketed with the county clerk or otherwise, an execution may issue from such court, and no longer need be issued, as is understood to have been the former practice, out of the court of common pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-8\">\u201c The Code regulating proceedings supplementary to an execution, has been held to apply to justices\u2019 judgments which had been docketed in the county clerk\u2019s office, which covered the judgments of the marine court which had been docketed in like manner; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>the officer authorized to make the order was a judge of the court of common pleas. When the section of the Code was enacted, and down to the act of 1874, the marine court judgments, after docket in the county clerk\u2019s office, were in effect judgments of the common pleas, and the judges of that court had exclusive jurisdiction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-5\">\u2018 \u2018 But as it was competent for the legislature to relieve the marine court from the operation of the 68th section of the Code, and give it control over its judgments, in respect to the manner of executing and enforcing them, it was equally competent to extend its jurisdicdiction to these supplementary proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-6\">\u201cThis has been done, and the marine court, under the act of 1874, is given the same power over its judgments and the manner of executing them, as is possessed by other courts of record ; and the only effect of docketing in the county clerk\u2019s office is to make the judgment a lien on real property, as provided in section 282 of the Code in respect to the judgments of other courts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-7\">\u201cAnother objection is, that the court can not appoint a receiver until after the return of the execution unsatisfied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-8\">\u201cThe 294tli section allows the examination of a third person alleged to have property of the debtor, before the return of the execution ; and the authority to appoint a receiver is given by the 298th section. The 299th section provides that if the per-son examined claims an interest in the property adverse to the judgment debtor, such interest shall be recoverable only in an action against such person by the receiver.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-9\">\u201cThereare several decisions affecting this question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-10\">\u201cIn Kemp <em>v. </em>Harding (4 <em>How. Pr. </em>178) the appointment of receiver was made upon an examination under section 294, but without notice to the debtor, who appealed from the order, and the general term of the fifth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>judicial district held, that to authorize the appointment of a receiver in section 298 of the Oode, the proceedings should be against the debtor to reach his property generally, and not, under the 294th section, of third persons as to property of the debtor in their hands, and that without such personal proceeding against a debtor, a receiver could not be appointed. That case has been approved in Baker <em>v. </em>Johnson (4 <em>Abb. </em>437), where it was held that a receiver, appointed without an order for the examination of the judgment debtor, could have no authority to sue. And in Sherwood <em>v. </em>Buffalo, &amp;c. R. R. Co. (12 <em>How. Pr. </em>136), it is said, the proceeding under section ' 294 is merely in aid of the principal proceeding against the judgment debtor, and must be had in connection with it, and can not be resorted to independently of any proceeding against the debtor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-5\">\u201cIn Darrow v. Lee (16 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>215) it was held by the general term of the common pleas, that until the return unsatisfied of an execution, a receiver can in no case be appointed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-6\">\u201cIn Andrews <em>v. </em>Gienville Woollen Co. (11 <em>Abb. N. S. </em>78) it is held that \u2018 section 294 does not authorize the appointment of a receiver, and that a receiver can not be appointed under section 298 of a particular debt or particular article of the debtor\u2019s property.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-7\">\u201cThese are sufficient to show the current of decision setting strongly against the power to appoint a receiver, except upon an order for the examination of the judgment debtor; and I think they are sufficiently uniform to serve as a safe guide in determining the objection to the plaintiff\u2019s right to sue in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-8\">\u201cThe proceeding supplementary to the execution is similar to, if not a substitute for, the late creditor\u2019s bill, which could not be filed until all legal efforts to collect the judgment had been exhausted. Hence, in all cases it was necessary to show that an execution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>upon the judgment had been issued and returned unsatisfied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-5\">l\u00a3 So here, the remedies at law must be exhausted against the debtor\u2019s property, and then he may be proceeded against to make discovery of his property, and the other proceeding is merely ancillary to such principal proceeding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-6\">\u00a3\u00a3\u00edhe want of power in the judge to appoint a receiver, upon an examination under section 294, is vital to the plaintiff\u2019s right to sue, and the objection is available by the defendant in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-7\">\u00a3\u00a3 The defendant must have judgment, dismissing the complaint, with costs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-8\">Judgment dismissing the complaint having been rendered, defendant Orgler appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b47-9\"><em>J. S. &amp; C. H. Smith, </em>attorneys, and of counsel for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b47-10\"><em>D, </em>&amp; <em>T. </em>McMahon, attorneys, and <em>Dennis McMahon, </em>of counsel, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b41-19\"> This is an affirmance of one of the propositions held at special term.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-20\">Tho principle of the decision includes as well proceedings instituted under that section, <em>after return of execution. </em>The facts, however, do not call for so broad a decision, but only for one to the effect stated in the head-note.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b41-21\"> Neither of these propositions was passed on by the general term.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b47-11\">By the Court.\u2014Curtis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Abk\">The proposition contended for by the appellants is substantially this, that after issuing and before the return of an execution upon an affidavit that any person has property of the judgment debtor or is indebted to him in an amount exceeding ten dollars, a judge may appoint a receiver of all the property, debts, equitable interests, rights and choses in action of the judgment debtor, with all the powers of a receiver to take possession, hold and dispose of the same, precisely as though appointed under a creditor\u2019s bill, or in proceedings supplementary to execution after the return of an execution unsatisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-12\">It might be harsh and oppressive, while, an execution is in the sheriff\u2019s hands that will be satisfied by a levy and sale, or by the efforts of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>judgment debtor to meet it, that without waiting for the return of the process and simply upon the affidavit above referred to, a receiver with such powers should be appointed, and competent among other acts to subject the property of the judgment debtor to the burden and expenses of a great variety of litigations. The jurisdiction of the court of chancery in reference to creditors\u2019 bills, defined and confirmed by the Eevised Statutes, was limited to those cases, where the execution had been returned unsatisfied. The creditor was compelled to exhaust his legal remedies, before resorting to a court of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">It may well be doubted whether the framers of the Code intended to change this rule. It is evident that they sought to simplify and abridge the former proceedings to obtain payment after the return of an execution unsatisfied ; and if they had intended to establish the new remedy of appointing a receiver, and obtaining satisfaction priorto the return of the execution unsatisfied, it is but just to presume, that they would have used some language manifesting such intention. A careful examination of the provisions of the Code upon which the appellant bases this claim, fails to disclose any such language.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">So far as this question has come before the courts for consideration, it seems to have been held, that there was no power to appoint a receiver, except when an order for the examination of a judgment debtor had been first obtained (Weyman v. Childs, 44 <em>Barb. </em>403; The Ocean National Bank v. Olcott, 46 <em>N. Y. </em>18; Darrow v. Lee, 16 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>215 ; Kemp <em>v. </em>Harding, <em>4 How. Pr. </em>178 ; Andrew v. The Glenville Woollen Mill, 11 <em>Abb. N. S. </em>82).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">No order for the examination of the judgment debtor had been obtained in the present case, and consequently there was a want of power in the judge to appoint the receiver. He is therefore without legal capacity to act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>as such. The answer places his authority to'so act its issue. The objection was available and duly taken, by the defendant, and is one that is fatal to the plaintiffs capacity and right to sue. It becomes unnecessary to consider the remaining questions raised by the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The judgment appealed from, should be affirmed,, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Sedgwick, J.s concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
