The court instructed the witness he might decline to answer whether he wrote the letter or not. The witness declined to answer on the ground that his answer would criminate himself. On cross-examination, defendant\u2019s counsel asked him to write a' little, whereupon the witness wrote the address and first line of the letter in question. Thereafter plaintiff called as a witness, Henry M. Parkhnrst, when the following evidence was given by him, objections taken, and rulings made:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b10-9\">\u201cI have, for a long time, been engaged in the business of writing and seeing other people write.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b10-10\">Q.

It has been uniformly held in.actions of this kind that while to authorize a divorce for adultery, direct testimony of the commission of the crime is not required, yet the proximate facts must lead, by fair inference, to a necessary conclusion\u2014a conclusion so far inevitable that the supposition of innocence, can not by any just course of reasoning, be reconciled with it (17 <em>Abb. Pr. Rep. </em>48, anonymous ; Mulock <em>v. </em>Mulock, 1 <em>Edw. Rep. </em>14; Hart <em>v. </em>Hart, 2 <em>Ed. </em>207; Turney <em>v. </em>Turney, 4 <em>Id. </em>566 ; Banta <em>v. </em>Banta, 3 <em>Id. </em>295). The complaint itself is defective in not stating the acts of adultery with sufficient certainty (Pramagiori <em>v. </em>Pramagiori, 7 <em>Rob. </em>302 ; also Wood <em>v. </em>Wood, 2 <em>Paige Rep. </em>108). Where the evidence of adultery in an action for divorce depends on the testimony of defendant\u2019s paramour, unsupported by other evidence, no decree will, be granted ; he is regarded as an accomplice, and his testimony subject to the objection of an accomplice (5 <em>Rob. </em>611).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b12-7\">II. There is no proof of any adultery at .any time ' such as would warrant a decree for divorce (Myer <em>v. </em>Myer, 48 <em>Barb. </em>114; Hamburger <em>v. </em>Hamburger, 46 <em>How. </em>346; Ferguson v. Ferguson, 3 <em>Sand. </em>307; Trust <em>v. </em>Trust, 11 <em>How. </em>523). There can also be no decree for adultery committed after the filing of the bill. In this action the bill is filed or the action commenced April 11, 1873, the very day of the alleged meeting. The finding of fact in respect to the adultery is April 12, and after the.commencement of the action (Ferrier v. Ferrier, 4 <em>Edw. </em>296).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b12-8\">III. It was error to allow th\u00e9 witness Parkhurst, as an expert, to swear to the letter of Miller by mere comparison of the letter with a paper written by Miller, and marked for identification (Jackson <em>v. </em>Phillips, 9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number><em>Cow. </em>94; Wilson v. Kirkland, 5 Hill, 182 ; People v. Spooner, 1 <em>Johns. </em>343; Bar v. Coleman, 13 <em>Barb. </em>42; Tillford v. Knott, 2 <em>Johns. Chan. </em>Cases, 211; Jackson v. Van Duzeu, 5 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>144 ; Haskin <em>v. </em>Stuyves ant, <em>Anthon. Nisi </em>Prius, 132 ; Van Wyck <em>v. </em>McIntosh, 14 <em>N. Y. </em>[4 <em>Ker.] </em>439).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b13-6\">IV. The testimony of the defendant should not have been stricken out, and she should have been allowed to give the evidence offered, <em>(a.) </em>Such admission would not necessarily have been in contravention of the provisions of the act of 1867 <em>(Laws of </em>1867, ch. 887, \u00a7 2 ; \u00a7\u00a7 388 and 399 <em>of Code; </em>Wehrkamp v. Wiilets, 1 Keyes, 250; Shoemaker <em>v. </em>McKee, 19 <em>How. </em>86; March v. Potter, 30 <em>Barb. </em>506; Chamberlain v. People, 23 <em>N. Y. </em>[9 Smith] 85; Rivenburg v. Rivenburg, <em>47 Barb. </em>419). In this case, special attention is asked to the dissenting opinion of Judge Balcomb (1 <em>Greenleaf on </em>Evidence, 287, \u00a7 254).</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b13-7\"><em>Garretson &amp; </em>Mayo, attorneys and of counsel for respondent, urged:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APs\">I. As to the adultery, the law-does not exact, in cases of this nature, such precise and incontrovertible proof as it requires in many other actions. The direct fact need not be proven. It may be inferred from circumstances that lead to it as a necessary conclusion <em>(N. Y. Sup'r </em>Court, Ferguson <em>v. </em>Ferguson, 8 <em>Sandf. </em>307, citing Lord Stowell in Loveden v. Loveden, 2 <em>Hagg. Consis. Rep. </em>1).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b13-8\">II. The statute making parties to actions competent as witnesses does not apply to cases brought by husband or wife, the one against the other, for divorcement on the ground of adultery. The defendant\u2019s testimony was properly excluded (Smith v. Smith, 15 <em>How. </em>165; Sweet v. Sweet, <em>Id. </em>169 ; C. <em>v. </em>C., 25 <em>Id. </em>432).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b13-10\">III. The letter purporting to have been written by Henry Miller to the defendant was written by him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>her. The testimony of Henry M. Parkhurst refers to a comparison of the writing called for by the defendant\u2019s counsel from Henry Miller on the examination of that witness, with the letter in proof and appearing at large in the case. The rule which in this state rejects proof of handwriting of a paper sought to be put in proof by comparing it with the handwriting of another paper proven to have been written by the same person, applies solely where it is attempted to compare the handwriting of the paper sought to be introduced with that of one which is immaterial to the issue (Van Wyck <em>v. </em>McIntosh, 14 <em>N. Y. </em>[4 <em>Ker.] </em>439). Such is not this instance. Here a portion of the very letter itself is introduced by the defendant\u2019s counsel, and the evidence is perfected by a comparison of what was so written with the same paper in its entirety.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b14-5\">By the Court.\u2014Freedman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AO\">The evidence fully sustains the finding that between the 1st day of May, 1872, and the 12th \"day of April, 1873, the defendant did commit adultery with one Henry Milier. Direct testimony of the commission of the offense is not necessary, but circumstatial evidence which by fair inference irresistibly points to that conclusion is sufficient. Tested by this rule the facts testified to by the witnesses Maria Palmer, Celia Denning, Walker, and Henry Lewis, all of whom were properly admitted, would be sufficient even without the testimony of the paramour. The learned chief justice who tried the case below, had these witnesses before him, and not only heard their testimony, but also observed the manner in which they gave it. He was therefore even in a better position to judge of their credibility than the court at general term can be. Their testimony was not shaken or impeached, and aside from such contradictions upon collateral points as usually appear between the testimony of witnesses testifying to successive occurrences. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>it bears no intrinsic marks for which it could be discredited. As a whole it is wholly incompatible with defendant's innocence, and no inference other than that of criminality is possible from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-5\">The testimony of the defendant was properly excluded. Before the act of 1867 (ch. 887 of <em>Laws of </em>1867), she would not, under the Code, have been a competent witness in her own behalf in an action for divorce (Rivenburgh <em>v. </em>Rivenburgh, 47 <em>Barb. </em>419), and that act, though making the husband or wife of any party to an action as competent a witness on behalf of such party as any other witness, expressly provides that nothing therein contained shall render any husband or wife competent or compellable to give evidence for or against the other in any action or proceeding instituted in consequence of adultery, or in any action or proceeding for divorce on account of adultery, except to prove the fact of marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-6\">The first objection to the testimony of the expert on the question of handwriting is wholly untenable, and the second too general in its character. The authorship of the letter alleged to have been written by the paramour to the defendant, and claimed to have been found by the plaintiff in defendant\u2019s possession, was materia], and a comparison of the handwriting of that letter with the few lines written by the paramour on the witness-stand at the request of the counsel for the defendant was to a certain extent permissible. The expert could properly testify to the condition and appearance of the words and of the letters and characters contained in these writings, and to point out and explain similarities and differences. If by subsequent questions and answers this limit allowed by law was transcended, a farther and specific objection should have been interposed. A genera] objection taken at the beginning \u201cto this class of evidence,\u201d or \u201con the ground of immateriality,\u201d is not enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak\">Sedgwick, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
