Paddock, who on that day executed an instrument in writing, stating that \u201cunder and in virtue of the statute concerning voluntary assignments made pursuant to application of an insolvent and his creditors, and in pursuance of an order made by Hon. Albert Lockwood, a judge of the Westchester -court, &amp;o.\u201d \u201c And for the consideration of one dollar,\u201d he granted, bargained, sold, &amp;c., unto George R.

The deed was' expressed to be \u201c for the consideration of one dollar tome in hand paid,\u201d and also recited that it was executed under and by virtue of the statute concerning voluntary assignments, made pursuant to the application of an insolvent and his creditors, and in pursuance of an order made by a county judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The reading of the deed was objected to unless the plaintiff first proved the proceedings in the matter of the insolvency of Paddock. The court excluded it, and the plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The exceptions were heard at the general term, and the ruling was there affirmed. On appeal, a new trial was ordered. The case is reported in <em>54 N. Y. R. </em>210.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">The only question before the court, as appears from, the reported case, was one relating to the exclusion of the deed before proof was given in the proceedings in the matter of the insolvency of Paddock. The plaintiff being non-suited upon the rejection of the deed, there was nothing else before the court. The court decided a s the proof of the deed properly preceded in the order of proof that of the oath of an assignee, by the insolvent-law, and as the oath without the deed was immaterial, the absence of that proof was no reason for non-suiting the plaintiff. Mr. Commissioner Reynolds adds, \u201cthat by the production of this deed the plaintiff established a <em>prima facie </em>title to the premises, and it should have been received in evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">The case comes before us now with the admission of the deed in evidence as establishing a <em>prima facie </em>title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>in the plaintiff, and with the plaintiff\u2019s admission, that these proceedings in insolvency had before Lockwood were null and void. The plaintiff \u2019 s counsel relies upon the decision in <em>54 </em>N. <em>Y., </em>as deciding that the deed by Paddock to Rockwell was sufficient of itself, and without the aid of any insolvency proceedings, to vest the title in Rockwell. That question was not in the case before the court was called upon to decide whether proper and competent evidence had been excluded on the trial. It is quite plain to my mind, the deed in question would not have been executed and delivered to Rockwell except under and by virtue of the said proceedings. The grantee, Rockwell, is named in the deed as the person who has been nominated as assignee by the petitioning creditors, who signed the petition for Paddock\u2019s discharge for the benefit of all his creditors. This instrument must be considered as a mesne assignment under the proceedings, and was in terms so understood by the parties. If the proceedings are admitted to be null and void, then it is plain that the assignment, being a part of the proceedings, must also be null and void ; this seems to be too plain for argument. The deed or assignment by itself, when offered in evidence, was <em>prima facie </em>valid, and was therefore properly admitted, out if all the proceedings are void for want of jurisdiction, the assignment must fall with the rest (Vose <em>v. </em>Cockroft, 44 N. <em>Y. </em>415 ; Homan v. Brinckerhoff, 1 <em>Den. </em>184 ; Garnes <em>v. </em>Stiles, 14 Peters, 823 .</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">It is claimed that although the proceeding is void, the assignment is voluntary, and if Paddock chooses to make the assignment, he should be bound by it. But the assignment is not voluntary. It is <em>in inmtvm, </em>compulsory, given to enable the assignor to obtain his discharge in these very proceedings, and without which, under the statute, he could not get his release. If the proceeding are void, there is no consideration to uphold the assignment, for it appears from a review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>the whole instrument that the intention was to execute the assignment as a part of the insolvent proceedings, and \u201c the one dollar\u201d preliminary consideration will be deemed to be merely formal, and does not change the character of the deed (Morris v. Ward, 36 <em>N. Y. </em>587).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s exceptions should be overruled, and judgment ordered for defendants on the verdict, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Freedman, J., concurred.'</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
