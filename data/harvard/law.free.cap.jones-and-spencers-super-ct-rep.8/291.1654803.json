The plaintiff then ascertained that on May 25, 1872, the Craftsman\u2019s Company entered into an agreement with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>the defendants by which the latter for a valuable consideration agreed to re-in sure the former on all risks of that company for which policies were then outstanding, and to assure all such policies, and to pay to the holders thereof all such sums as the said Craftsman\u2019s Company might by force of such policies become liable to pay, including dividends declared for the year 1872, on premiums not yet due, and also to accept from all holders of policies a surrender of the same, and thereupon to issue to such holders its own policies of like class and like amounts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-5\">The Craftsman\u2019s Company, from the date of said agreement, ceased to issue policies or to receive premiums, and each company proceeded to carry into effect such agreement</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-6\">The value of the policies existing on May 25, 1872, of the Craftsman\u2019s company was fixed. The value of the plaintiff\u2019s policy that day was fixed at two hundred and forty-nine dollars and fifty cents between the two companies, including the cost of re-insurance ; and the Craftsman\u2019s Company placed in the defendant\u2019s possession assets of the value of one hundred and fifty-five thousand dollars, and from which the defendants realized afterwards more than one hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-7\">The plaintiff commenced an action against the Craftsman\u2019s Company, in the court of common pleas, to recover the damages he had suffered by reason of its not fulfilling the agreement contained in the policy of insurance, and recovered a judgment against the company on April 29,1873, for the sum of five hundred and eighteen dollars and seven cents, and caused execution to be issued to collect the same, which was afterwards returned wholly unsatisfied, and the same remains unpaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-8\">In October, 1873, the plaintiff brought an action against both the companies to reach the property of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>the Craftsman\u2019s Company, and for other relief, which resulted in a dismissal of his complaint upon the merits, and judgment in favor of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-5\">The plaintiff then commenced the present suit, claiming that the defendants were liable by reason of their contract with the Craftsman\u2019s Company. The defendants by answer, insisted, that no such liability arose from the contract, and that in the action last above referred to, the same subject-matter was involved as in this action, and that they recovered judgment therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-6\">The referee found that the plaintiff was entitled to the amount paid for premiums, with interest.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b302-7\"><em>Samuel A. </em>Noyes, attorney, and of counsel for appellant, urged :</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApW\">I. The plaintiffs\u2019 action in bringing his suit against the Craftsmen\u2019s Life Assurance Company, is clearly in disaffirmance of his policy or contract of insurance with that company. On the other hand, if the plaintiff had brought an action in affirmance of his policy, its validity, and his rights thereunder, the action would have been for the issue to him of a paid-up policy for as many tenths of one thousand dollars as he had paid years\u2019 premium s ; or in default thereof, for the then cash value of such a paid-up policy, under the following clause in his policy: \u201cAnd the said company do hereby further promise and agree, that if, after premiums upon this policy for not less than two complete years of assurance, have been duly received by this company, this policy should cease in consequence of default in payment of a subsequent premium, this company will, on due surrender of this policy and of the profits thereon, issue in lieu thereof, provided such surrender be made within three months of the date of such default, another policy, payable as herein provided, on which no further premium shall be required, for as many tenth parts of the original amount hereby assured as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>there shall have been complete annual premiums paid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-6\">II. The defendants, The Hope Mutual Life Insurance Company, is in no way obligated or bound to the general creditors of the Craftsmen\u2019s Life Assurance Company, but only to policy holders, under a state of facts which bring them strictly under the agreement. The plaintiff, at best, is nothing more than a general creditor of the Craftsmen\u2019s Life Assurance Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-7\">III. The assertion of the plaintiffs counsel, that one of the clauses of the defendants\u2019 agreement of May 25, 1872, was intended for those policy holders who would not accept the re-insurance, provided for them in the defendants\u2019 company in place of the Craftsmen\u2019s Company, is without foundation, and is incorrect. Our answer to this assumption is two-fold: First.\u2014The plaintiff is in no situation to take advantage of this position (the correctness of which we deny), for he has repudiated any relation of a policy holder to the Craftsmen\u2019s Company. Second.\u2014All that the plaintiff could get from the Craftsmen\u2019s Company, in case he declined to continue to pay his premiums, was a paid-up policy for as many tenths of one thousand dollars as he had paid annual premiums, provided he surrendered his policy, and made a demand therefor within three months from such default. As the fact is, he made no such demand, and his policy lapsed, became void, and of no effect. The defendants received so much money from the Craftsmen\u2019s Life Assurance Company for the re-insurance of its risks (if the policy holders chose to accept the provision thus made for them), and for assuming its liabilities to policy holders, which arose by force of any agreement, covenant, or promise contained in said policy. Such is the full extent of the defendants\u2019 agreement, which can not be extended beyond its legitimate construction to suit the plaintiff\u2019s fancied claim in this action. Provided the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Craftsmen\u2019s Life Assurance Company refused to carry out their part of the contract, all that the plaintiff could recover from the Craftsmen\u2019s Life Assurance Company, in any event, had he brought his action for damages, would be the net reserve value of his policy', or what it would cost to place him in <em>statu quo </em>in another responsible life insurance company. This the plaintiff does not claim, nor can such a claim be considered in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-5\">IY. The fact that the defendants received a gross sum for the re-insurance of the Craftsmen\u2019s Life Assurance Company\u2019s policies, places it under no obligation to assume or pay such a claim as the plaintiff makes in this action. The question is not what the defendants have received, but what they have promised agreed to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-6\">Y. A gross sum was received by the defendants from the Craftsmen\u2019s Company for the re-insurance of its policies, and for assuming the risk of all the policy holders of said company, demanding such substitution of their policies. Even conceding (which we deny) that such consideration is an apportionable one, it can not be said that the defendants have received the sum at which plaintiff\u2019s policy was rated in the schedule without giving any consideration therefor. The defendant in relation to the Craftsmen\u2019s policy holders, has assumed the risk of their calling for its policies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-7\">VI. The former action between these parties in this court is <em>res adjud\u00edcala. </em>Although it was an equity action, the plaintiff could there claim and prove (if he was able) the same relief that he claims here. It matters not whether an action is legal or equitable, a party is entitled to such relief as the facts proved, or such as he might prove, warrant\u2014be that relief legal or equitable (Armitage v. Pulver, 37 <em>N. </em>Y. 494).</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number><em>D. S. </em>Riddle, attorney, and of counsel for respondent, urged :</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ak4\">I. The agreement of May 35, 1873, went into operation on that day ; is good and valid ; and policy holders may enforce it (Glen <em>et </em>al v. Hope Mutual life Ins. Co., 56 N. Y. 379). The only question that can arise is, whether the plaintiff comes within any of its terms.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-5\">II. Every life policy has a value even in the lifetime of the assured (Ainsworth v. Backus, supreme court, general term, November, 1875, and reported in <em>Register </em>of November 15, 1875; also, Hawkins <em>v. </em>Coutherst, 5 <em>Best &amp; Smith, </em>p. 343). And by turning over to the defendant its assets\u2014especially its securities on deposit with the insurance department at Albany, and which the law requires - to be made as a prerequisite to carry on the insurance business (see <em>Statute </em>part 1, ch. 18, title 18, article 3, \u00a7 68; 3 <em>R. S. </em>5th Ed.), the Craftsman\u2019s Company disabled itself from carrying out its contract of insurance, and, by actually going out of business, and refusing to carry its policies any longer, it committed a breach of contract with its policy holders, and became liable to pay the damage of such breach, and the measure of such damages would naturally be the sum of premiums paid, with the interest, thereon. These liabilities of the Craftsman\u2019s Company the Hope Company agreed to pay by the above provision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-6\">III. Plaintiff, by his action in the common pleas, did not disaffirm his policy. If that action had gone on the hypothesis of a disaffirmance of the contract of insurance, then the plaintiff could only have recovered from the Craftsman\u2019s Company, as money had and received, so much of his premiums as had not then been consumed by carrying the risk on his life\u2014to wit, two hundred and forty-nine dollars and fifty cents, the value of his policy\u2014for the contract being at an end by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>mutual consent, only that amount would have been in the hands of the company belonging to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-5\">IY. Even if the action in the common pleas had been a disaffirmance of the contract, the recovery in that court would be a liability against the Craftsmen\u2019s Company arising by force of plaintiff\u2019s policy ; for the policy would be the basis of the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-6\">Y. It is plain that the agreement in question merely substitutes the Hope Company in the place of the Craftsman\u2019s Company, and obliges the former to do what the latter should have done, and as the latter, on breach of contract, was bound to pay the plaintiff his damages, assessed by the common pleas, the former as the substitute, is also bound to pay them</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b306-7\">By the Court.\u2014Curtis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AzA\">The liability of the defendants depends upon the effect of the agreement entered into by the defendants with the Craftsmen\u2019s Company, in reference to reinsuring, and assuming outstanding risks and liabilities. In the case of <em>Cflen </em>against the defendants (56 <em>N. Y. </em>379) this same agreement came before the court of appeals for construction. Their decision clearly established the right of a policy holder of the Craftsmen\u2019s Company to recover for any liability the defendants assumed as to such policy holder, though he was not a party to such agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">The Craftsmen\u2019s Company violated its agreement with the plaintiff by transferring its assets to the defendants, and by incapacitating itself to continue its business, and refusing to fulfill its contract of insurance. If the defendants assumed any liability of that company to the plaintiff, such assumption was not prejudiced by the fruitless efforts and suits of the plaintiff to get back the premiums he had paid, and for which it does not appear that he ever received any valuable consideration from the derelict company. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>the plaintiff chose primarily to exhaust any remedy he might have by a judgment and execution against the Craftsmen\u2019s Company, and by another suit in the nature of a creditor\u2019s bill to reach its assets, and to which the defendants were a party, it may have added to his losses, but it does not show that he has waived his ultimate recourse against the defendants, if he has any, or that his claim has been passed upon already adversely, and is now <em>res adjudicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The question to be here passed upon is narrowed to the inquiry whether the agreement of the defendants with the Craftsmen\u2019s Company is broad enough to embrace the plaintiff\u2019s demand. It is clear that the plaintiff is now remediless as one of that class of policy holders to whom, upon the surrender of their policies in the latter company, the defendants agreed to issue new policies of their own. If the plaintiff can now recover at all, it is under that provision of the agreement, where the defendants agree to pay the policyholders all such sums as the Craftsmen\u2019s Company might by force of such policies become liable \"to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The words \u201cby force\u201d as used in that context, are synonymous with the words \u201cby reason of\u201d or \u201cin consequence of.\u201d Such was apparently the intention of the parties, and viewed in the light of the attending acts and circumstances, should justly be presumed to have been so used. The evidence in the case confirms this view of the meaning of the words.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s claim upon the Craftsmen\u2019s Company was purely in consequence of this policy; it arose from the obligations, express and implied, of that, and did not accrue to him as a general creditor, and his seeking to recover from them the premiums he bad paid when they violated their agreement to keep him insured, was not a disaffirmance of the policy. The violation of its terms in this respect, formed, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>referee properly found, one of the very liabilities referred to and embraced in the agreement, and which the defendants by its terms assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Monell, Ch. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
