The facts as to the injury are stated in the opinion. At the trial the court dismissed the complaint, to which the plaintiff\u2019s counsel excepted. The court directed the exception to be heard in the first instance at the general term, and suspended judgment in the meantime.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-6\">The facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b377-7\"><em>Julius </em>Lipman, attorney, and of counsel for plaintiff, urged:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A69\">I. The car driver\u2019s act came within the scope of his employment. What is the scope of the driver\u2019s employment? Why, to drive the car\u2014only that and nothing more, and if he drives it unskillfully, and even maliciously, the plaintiff submits it is \u201c within the scope of his employment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-8\">II. In this case the driver did not intentionally or willfully commit the injury. The testimony shows that he stopped his car within a safe distance of the buggy, and shouted to the plaintiff to get off the track. The plaintiff said he would so soon as the wagons moved. After waiting a little, the driver got impatient, shouted he was \u201clate,\u201d and swore a little. Then the trucks began to move, and the driver let go the brake and drove on. The presumption and fair inference is that the driver thought the wheels of the buggy would be sufficiently off the track when the car reached it to pass clear, but made a miscalculation. In this view the act was neither willful nor unlawful, but was within the fair scope of his authority. He had the full command and charge of the car and horses. He had the command and management of them for a lawful purpose. Was responsible to the defendants for his acts, and again he labored under the responsibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>to the defendants if he did not reach the termination of his route within the prescribed time. He was not engaged in any unlawful act or employment, and the occurrence took place in the course of that employment, and arose out of it. The plaintiff was not a passenger in the defendant\u2019s car. He was using the public highway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-5\">III. Railway companies must run their trains with reference to persons who may be rightfully upon the streets used by their roads (Kansas Pacific R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Pointer, 9 <em>Raus C. 20 </em>; 1872). \u201cExemplary damages may be awarded against a railway company for an injury occurring through the gross negligence or drunkenness of its servants\u201d (Peale v. Railroad Co., Dillon [ <em>U. S. Cir. Ct.] </em>568 ; 1871). Railroad companies are responsible in exemplary damages for the negligent and wrongful acts of their agents or employees (New Orleans, Jackson, and Great Northern R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Bailey, 40 <em>Miss. </em>895 ; 1866). A driver is acting in the line of his duty in helping a child or infirm person on or off the car, and the company is liable for the negligence of a driver in this respect (Drew <em>v. </em>Sixth Av. R. R. Co., 1 <em>Abb. Ct. of </em>Appeals, Dec. 556; 26 <em>N. Y. </em>49). Where the driver is notified by a passenger to stop the car, and does so partially, and then starts on again, without notice, he is chargeable with negligence (Nichols <em>v. </em>Sixth Av. R. R. Co., 38 <em>N. Y. </em>131). To entitle a passenger to recover against the carrier for being pushed off the platform of a street car, it must appear that an employee of the railway company did the wrongful act (Pesley <em>v. </em>Third Av. R. R. Co., 1 <em>Jones &amp; </em>Spencer, 406 ; 1871). The driver of a street car having the right to put a person off the car, the company will be liable for his acts in doing so, even if his act should be malicious and willful (Meyer <em>v. </em>Second Av. R. R. Co., 8 <em>Bosworth, N. Y. </em>305; 1861).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>IY. All the authorities cited in the case of Isaacs <em>v. </em>Third Avenue Railroad Company (47 <em>N. Y. </em>122), do not conflict with the general proposition above stated ; they only establish the general proposition, that \u201cfor willful trespass by its servant, defendant is not liable.\u201d The plaintiff does not dispute it; but, in this case, he \u25a0maintains there was no willful trespass.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-5\">V. There was a question of fact to be determined, \u2022and he had no power to assume the fact in one way or the other ; it was the province of the jury (Thrings <em>v. </em>Central Park R. R.

The only question involved in this case is : Can a master be held liable for the willful, intentional, and malicious act of his \u25a0servant, without proof that the act was authorized or subsequently ratified and adopted by the master <em>% </em>The \u00a1authorities are so numerous and positive, against the liability of the master in such cases that it seems almost unnecessary for defendant to do more than to submit to the court the testimony of the plaintiff and his witnesses, and ask for judgment. The case is too plain for \u00a1any argument. All the cases agree that a master is not liable for the willful mischief of his servant, though he be at the time in other respects engaged in the service of the former (1 <em>Chit. Pl. </em>69 ; McManus <em>v. </em>Cricket, 1 <em>East, </em>106 ; Wright <em>v. </em>Wilcox, 19 <em>Wend. </em>343; Van<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>derbilt <em>v. </em>Richmond Turnpike Co., 2 <em>Comst. </em>479 ; Clark <em>v. </em>Metropolitan Bank, 3 Duer, 241 ; Hibbard <em>v. </em>N.

Y. </em>122).</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b380-5\">By the Court.\u2014Curtis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Abe\">The exception the case presents is that of the plaintiff to the dismissal of the complaint, by the court, on the ground that, the evidence showed that the injury complained of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>was occasioned by the willful and unlawful act of the car-driver, defendant\u2019s servant, and not within the scope of his employment. The case shows that the plaintiff, while driving his buggy through Catharine street, crossed defendant\u2019s track so far that only the rear part of the hind wheels of his buggy remained upon the space occupied by the cars when in motion. At this point his further progress was arrested by a throng of trucks and other vehicles. The defendants\u2019 car soon approached, and the driver, after waiting a moment or two, told the plaintiff to \u201c get off the track.\u201d The plaintiff asked him to wait until the trucks moved, promising then to move. The driver said \u201cDamn you! if you don\u2019t get off here ; I am late 5 I will get you off some way or other.\u201d The plaintiff said: \u201cYou wait a moment. I guess the trucks are moving, and I may go.\u201d The trucks started, and as the plaintiff prepared to move on, the driver started his horses, and the platform of the car hit, or as one of the witnesses says touched, the hind wheel of the buggy, and overturned it, thus causing the injury complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">From the evidence, it is apparent that the car-driver may have attempted to pass by the buggy either without hitting it, or else by shoving it around out of his way so he could get by, and that he committed an error of judgment in measuring the distance. This is consistent with his saying to the plaintiff, \u201c I will get you off some way or other.\u201d He was-late and hurried, and perhaps in his zeal to discharge his duty to his employer, he made the mistake which, caused the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Much stress at the argument was laid by the defendant upon the language of the driver, as indicating willfulness and malice, but that does not seem to-be the necessary construction to place upon it. It indicates haste, and a desire to drive on, and has to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>considered in the light of the surrounding circumstances, and a Chesterfieldian request could hardly be expected. It is quite probable if he had used his eyes as strenuously as he did his tongue, he would have been more careful, and the injury to the plaintiff would not have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\u2022 It is claimed that upon the doctrine in the case of Isaacs v. The Third Ave. R. R. Co. (47 <em>N. Y. </em>122), the complaint was properly dismissed, this being an analogous case. That was a case where, when a female passenger desired to alight from the car, and declined doing so until it stopped, the conductor threw her out upon the pavement, and it was considered that this was his unauthorized, wanton, and willful trespass, and that the defendant was not liable. But this case is not to be interpreted as holding that a defendant is to be exonerated from liability for injuries occasioned by the errors and negligence of his reckless, careless, or unskillful driver, because the driver manifests at the same time that he is ruffianly and brutal. It is nowhere intimated that the employment of car drivers or conductdrs of this latter class would benefit their principals, when questions of- pecuniary responsibility for injuries arise. On the contrary, that case affirms the rule, that for a servant\u2019s act in his master\u2019s business, or within the scope of Ms employment, the master is liable for any abuse of authority conferred, or injuries resulting from errors of judgment, or mistake of facts, or from a negligent or reckless performance,of duties by the servant.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The question to be passed upon here, is whether it should not have been left to the jury to determine as a question of fact if the act of the conductor was willful and malicious, or negligent and reckless, and deemed by him necessary to accomplish the purpose with which he thought himself charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">. There may be cases so near the line between law and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>fact that it is difficult to say <em>to </em>which side they belong; but the tendency of courts is to scrupulously watch that the right of a plaintiff, to have a question submitted to a jury should not be infringed upon. The principle in cases like the present is adhered to, that where the fact depends upon inferences to be drawn from the circumstances proved, about which honest men might differ, or the evidence is capable of different interpretations, then it is the plaintiff\u2019s right to have the question submitted to the jury (Hackford <em>v. N. </em>Y. Central R. R. Co., 3 N. <em>Y. </em>654; Belton <em>v. </em>Baxter, 58 <em>Id. </em>411; Salter <em>v. </em>Utica and Black River R. R. Co., 58 <em>Id. </em>631 ; Jackson v. Second Avenue R. R. Co., 47 <em>Id. </em>274).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">If the undisputed propfs in the present case showed that the act of the driver was unauthorized, willful, and malicious, and out of the scope of his employment, it was the duty of the court to dismiss the complaint, and if the question had gone to the jury on such evidence, and they had found a verdict for the plaintiff, it would also have been the duty of the court to set aside such a verdict as unsustained by the evidence. But the case presents this difficulty, that the undisputed facts are consistent with the plaintiff\u2019s claim that Ms injuries resulted from the negligence of the defendant\u2019s servant. They are capable of such interpretation. That inference is fairly to be drawn from them, and though men may honestly differ in their views in respect to them, still it is the province of the jury to pass upon the question, and the right of the plaintiff to have it submitted to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">We think that the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions should be sustained, the verdict set aside, and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event of the \u00bfction.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Sedgwick, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
