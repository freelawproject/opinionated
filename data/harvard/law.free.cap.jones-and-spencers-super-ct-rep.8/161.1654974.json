The motion was decided on the 15th, and was granted. On the 17th plaintiff obtained an order requiring the defendant to show cause,, on the 18th, why the motion should not be re-argued. On the-19th the motion for a re-argument was denied with ten dollars costs of motion, and an order to that effect was entered on that day. On March 20th both defendant and plaintiff handed up orders proposed by them respectively to be entered on the decision of the motion for substitution. On the 22nd the judge settled the order, and the same was entered on that day. The order as thus settled, bore date in its caption as of March 12th (the date of the argument of the motion), and ordered that the said Peter Weis be substituted as defendant in this action in place of the Bowery Savings Bank, and that the said The Bowery Savings Bank deposit the amount claimed in the summons herein, less its costs herein to be taxed by the clerk of this court, in United States Trust Company, and that the said The Bowery Savings Bank be and it hereby is discharged from all liability to either party; and that the said Peter Weis have twenty days after the service of the order within which to plead, and that the prevailing party recover the above costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-6\">This- order was not served on plaintiff\u2019s attorney until April 2, 1875. On the 23rd of March, after the entry of said order, dated March 12th, but before its service on the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, plaintiff\u2019s attorney entered judgment by default against defendant. The j udgment roll contained, so far as the appeal book shows, no proof of the service of the summons and complaint on the defendant, and the only proof contained therein <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>of the defendant\u2019s time to answer having expired, and of no answer having been served, was this:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-5\">\u201cCity and County of New York. in the above action, being duly sworn, <em>says </em>that no answer or demurrer has been received or served in pursuance of the requirement of the summons in said action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-6\">CHAS.

The costs as taxed were, twenty-five dollars for costs before notice of trial, and ten dollars costs given by the order denying the motion for a re-argument.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-13\">Plaintiff moved for a re-taxation, which was denied, and from the order entered on such denial he appeals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-14\">On April 8th defendant noticed a motion to set aside the judgment entered March 23d, specifying in the notice various grounds of irregularity. The motion was granted, and from the order entered thereon the plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b171-15\"><em>Simon Sultan, </em>attorney, and <em>Henry Wehle </em>of counsel for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b171-16\"><em>Norwood &amp; Coggeshall, </em>attorneys and of counsel for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b171-17\">By the Court.\u2014Monell, Ch.

The order does not appear to have been appealed from, and as it gives to the Bowery Savings Bank its costs in the action, to be taxed, we are, as the court below was, concluded by it, and can not inquire whether they should have had costs or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">The item of twenty-five dollars before notice of trial, is the fee prescribed by the Code, and the ten dollars costs of opposing motion for a re-argument, was given by the order denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">The decision below was correct, and the order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">Sedgwick, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
