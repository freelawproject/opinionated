A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AUD\">Summary judgment was granted to defendant and denied to plaintiff in the Law Division. The latter\u2019s appeal comes before us on an agreed statement in lieu of the record <em>(R. R. </em>1:6-2) from which it appears that concededly there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and the question involved was solely one of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">Plaintiff and Albie Nunez were both employees of Abco Vending Service, Inc., to which defendant had issued an automobile liability insurance policy wherein that corporation was the \u201cnamed insured.\u201d While the policy was in effect, plaintiff was injured at his employer\u2019s place of business by a vehicle owned by the employer and operated by Nunez. Both men were engaged in their employment at the time. The accident arose out of and in the course of plaintiff\u2019s employment and out of the use of the automobile in the business of the employer. Plaintiff sued Nunez at law for his injuries and obtained a jury verdict for $5,000. The action was defended by defendant under a reservation of rights. Execution on the judgment was returned unsatisfied. Plaintiff also filed a petition for workmen\u2019s compensation against Abco and received an award for temporary and permanent disability which was considerably less than the judgment against Nunez. Defendant was also the compensation carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Prior to the compensation award plaintiff instituted the instant action on the policy to recover the amount of his judgment at law, claiming that Nunez was an \u201cadditional insured\u201d covered by it under a paragraph thereof entitled \u201cDefinition of Insured,\u201d commonly referred to as the \u201comnibus clause.\u201d Defendant contended that other provisions of the same paragraph and other clauses of the contract precluded or excluded coverage in this factual situation. The summary judgment in favor of the insurer resulted from the trial court\u2019s agreement with its contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The policy provisions involved are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">\u201cIII. Definition of Insured: With respect to the insurance for bodily injury liability and for property damage liability the unqualified word \u2018insured\u2019 includes the named insured and also includes any person while using the automobile and any person or organization legally responsible for the use thereof, provided the actual use of the automobile is by the named insured or with his permission. The insurance with respect to any person or organization other than the named insured does not apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\">(b) to any employee with respect to injury to or sickness, disease or death of another employee of the same employer injured in the course of such employment in an accident arising out of the maintenance or use of the automobile in the business of such employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-9\">EXCLUSIONS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-10\">This policy does not apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-11\">(d) under coverages A and C, to bodily injury to or sickness, disease or death of any employee of the insured while engaged in the employment, other than domestic, of the insured or in domestic employment if benefits therefor are either payable or required to be provided under any workmen\u2019s compensation law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-12\">(e) under coverage A, to any obligation for which the insured or any company as Ms insurer may be held liable under any workmen\u2019s compensation law;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-13\">Nunez is clearly an \u201cadditional insured\u201d entitled to the protection of the policy by reason of the first sentence of paragraph III, because the actual use of the automobile at the time of the accident was in the course of Nunez\u2019s employment and therefore with the permission of the \u201cnamed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>insured,\u201d unless such coverage does not apply by virtue of any of the subsequent restrictive provisions quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Subparagraphs (d) and (e) exclude coverage with respect to injuries to any employee of \u201cthe insured\u201d while engaged in the employment or to any obligation for which \u201cthe insured\u201d may be held liable in workmen\u2019s compensation. Plaintiff urges that Nunez, as the additional insured, and not Abco, the named insured, is the person intended and encompassed by the phrase \u201cthe insured\u201d in these exclusionary clauses and that they are therefore inapplicable for Nunez is not his employer and has no compensation obligation to him. He relies on <em>Maryland Casualty Company v. New Jersey Manufacturers (Casualty) Insurance Co., </em>48 <em>N. J. Super. </em>314 <em>(App. Div. </em>1958), affirmed <em>per curiam </em>28 <em>N. J. </em>17 (1958), since the entry of the instant judgment and the filing of the briefs on this appeal. In that case this court held that reference to \u201cthe insured\u201d in identical exclusion clauses \u201capplies only to the particular insured, whether the named insured or an additional insured under the omnibus clause, whose employee is suing him on account of the injury in question notwithstanding that the injury was compensable through workmen\u2019s compensation payments\u201d and \u201cthe exclusionary language of the policy should be restricted in its application to the particular insured seeking the protection of the policy under the facts of each case as it arises.\u201d 48 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at <em>page </em>324. There the persons sued for the injuries were third persons with whom the injured party had no relation and not, as here, a fellow employee of the named insured. It is not necessary, however, to determine whether the broad holdings quoted and the rationale thereof are applicable to the present factual situation so as also to render subparagraphs (d) and (e)of no pertinency here, because this case is controlled by sub-paragraph (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">That subparagraph in effect says that the insurance contract does not give protection to an employee of the named insured in case of injury to a fellow employee occurring in the course of the employment as a result of an accident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>arising out of the maintenance or use of the vehicle in the employer\u2019s business. The language is plain and no ambiguity can arise, as does with respect to subparagraphs (d) and (e), since the unqualified words \u201cthe insured\u201d are not used. It clearly precluded coverage to Nunez, and so benefit to plaintiff, in the situation at bar. Though the policy in the <em>Maryland Casualty </em>ease contained an identical provision, it had no application under the facts there present and was not mentioned in this court\u2019s opinion. Comment was made on it, however, in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>per curiam </em>affirmance (apparently for the first time in this State) and that comment demonstrates its controlling applicability in the instant case. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel in effect so conceded at oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">The judgment is affirmed, but without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
