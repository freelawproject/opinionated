A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AlB\">This is a workmen\u2019s compensation case. In the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation petitioner was awarded compensation for the death of her son, Donald Hannigan, who was killed while driving one of respondent\u2019s taxicabs. On appeal the County Court reversed, on the ground that the decedent was not an employee of respondent. The petitioner now appeals from the judgment of the County Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">Respondent Goldfarb owns five taxicabs and \u201cmanages\u201d five others belonging to his mother. Although the membership is technically in the name of his mother, for the purposes of this case we may consider him a member of the \u201cTwentieth Century Taxi Cab Association,\u201d a Hew Jersey non-pecuniary profit corporation organized in 1938 (hereafter called the Association) about which more will be said later. Goldfarb\u2019s ten cabs were painted the same color and bore the same \u201c30th Century Cab\u201d insignia as the cabs of all other members of the Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">Goldfarb insists he does not operate taxicabs, but only rents them. Petitioner admits the decedent (hereafter called Hannigan) agreed to pay Goldfarb $8 for every 13-hour shift during which he operated one of Goldfarb\u2019s cabs; that he kept all his fares and tips and did not account to Goldfarb for them; and that he paid for the gas and oil used during the time he operated the cab. (Hereafter, for brevity, we will call this the \u201cthree-phase arrangement.\u201d) Goldfarb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>contends that this arrangement proves conclusively that, regardless of any other incidents of the relationship between Hannigan and Goldfarb, this was a mere rental and Hannigan was not an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">This appears to be a case of first impression in New Jersey. In other jurisdictions there is a split of authority on whether a driver under such an arrangement is an employee. See Annotations, 152 <em>A. L. R. </em>520, 522 and 10 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>369; 1 <em>Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, </em>\u00a7 46.00 <em>et seq. </em>In some cases it has been held that the taxi driver may be the employee of the owner even under a \u201cthree-phase arrangement.\u201d <em>Salt Lake Transportation Co. v.

Ct. </em>1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Most of the above cited cases arose not under workmen\u2019s compensation acts but under social security and unemployment compensation acts. Nonetheless, for present purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>their reasoning is apposite. <em>Cf., De Monaco v. Renton, </em>18 <em>N. J. </em>352, 357 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">It is true that (as the annotation in 10 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>says, at <em>p. </em>369), \u201c* * * it must be pointed out that varying facts account in no small measure for the contrary results reached.\u201d One of those \u201cfacts\u201d is the difference in the definitions of employee contained in the particular statutes involved. An illuminating illustration of the effect of the definition in a statute is given in detail in the <em>Party Cab Co. </em>case, <em>supra, </em>at <em>page </em>89 of 172 <em>F. 2d. </em>There the court pointed out that in 1935, when the federal Social Security Act was enacted, the term \u201cemployee\u201d was not defined. The federal courts interpreted it broadly, beyond its strict common-law meaning, with reference to the purpose of the law to give protection to the alleged employee where the economic facts of the relationship seemed to the court to require such protection. Congress was not happy with that result, so in 1948 the law was amended, over the President\u2019s veto, to expressly provide that \u201cemployee * * * does not include any individual who, under the usual common-law rules * * * is not an employee.\u201d (It is interesting to note that in his veto message the President said the amendment would exclude \u201c* * * persons working as * * * taxicab drivers * * *.\u201d) Since that amendment the interpretations of \u201cemplojree\u201d by the federal courts have tended to be upon strict common-law principles. This may account, in some measure at least, for the difference in the preamendment cases, such as <em>Jones v. Goodson, supra, </em>and the post-amendment cases. But see <em>Larson, supra, </em>\u00a7 43.41.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">But almost equal in importance to difference in facts is the difference in the attitude of the courts of the several jurisdictions towards legislation such as the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. As Justice Rutledge said in <em>N. L. R. B. v. Hearst Publications, </em>332 <em>U. S. </em>111, 122, 64 <em>S. Ct. </em>851, 856, 88 <em>L. Ed. </em>1170, 1179-1180 (1943),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-9\">\u201cIt is enough to point out that, with reference to an identical problem, results may be contrary over a very considerable region of doubt in applying the distinction, depending upon the state or juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>diction whore the determination is made. !! * * In short, the assumed simplicity and uniformity, resulting from application of \u2018common law standards,\u2019 does not exist.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Illustrating this, Justice Eutledge pointed out that on the same facts upon which the courts of New Jersey found there was the employer-employee relationship <em>(Auer v. Sinclair Ref. Co., </em>103 <em>N. J. L. </em>372 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1926), and <em>Schomp v. Fuller Brush Co., </em>124 <em>N. J. L. </em>487 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1940), affirmed <em>In re Schomp, </em>126 <em>N. J. L. </em>368 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1941)), courts of other jurisdictions, whose attitude toward such legislation is different than ours, held there was not. As <em>Larson </em>says (\u00a7 43.10) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">\u201cIt has been said that precedents may be found on both sides of almost every conceivable situation in which the question [of \u2018employment\u2019] could arise. The explanation of this paradox \u2014 complete agreement on principles and endless disagreement in actual decisions\u2014 seems to lie partly * * * in the extent to which courts define status in view of the purpose served by the particular legislation rather than as a fixed and static concept.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">The term \u201cemployee\u201d in our Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is not limited to narrow common-law concepts for, in addition to servants, it \u201cincludes all natural persons * * * who perform service for an employer for financial consideration.\u201d <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-36. This is a broad definition which includes relationships not ordinarily considered to constitute employment. Our act is construed to bring as many cases as possible within its coverage, <em>Parker v. Zanghi, </em>45 <em>N. J. Super. </em>167, 171 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957); <em>El v. Newark Star Ledger, </em>131 <em>N. J. L. </em>373 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1944). <em>Cf., De Monaco v. Renton, supra; Parks Cab Co. v. Annunzio, </em>412 <em>Ill. </em>549, 107 <em>N. E. 2d </em>853, 854 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1952); <em>Salt Lake Transportation Co. v. Bd. of Review, supra, </em>5 <em>Utah 2d </em>87, 296 <em>P. 2d </em>983, at <em>page </em>985. We therefore hold that in spite of such a \u201cthree-phase arrangement,\u201d a taxi driver may be an employee under our Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">Whether or not Hannigan was, in fact, an employee must be determined not upon that arrangement alone but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>upon the totality of the facts surrounding the relationship. The testimony of the arrangement between Hannigan and Goldfarb was oral, but even if it were written (as Goldfarb said it was, in a contract which he said he could not find) the language which the parties used in the contract would not be conclusive. \u201cWe are not so much concerned with the formal wording * <em>* </em>* as we are with the factual relation * * *\u201d when we inquire whether parties are employer and employee. <em>El v. Newark Star Ledger, supra, </em>131 <em>N. J. L., </em>at <em>page </em>379. <em>Cf. Fenwick v. U. C. C., </em>133 <em>N. J. L. </em>295 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1945); <em>Electrolux Corp. v. Board of Review, </em>129 <em>N. J. L. </em>154 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1942); <em>Schomp v. Fuller Brush Co., </em>124 <em>N. J. L. </em>487 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1940), affirmed <em>In re Schomp, </em>126 <em>N. J. L. </em>368 <em>(E. </em>&amp; <em>A. </em>1941). \u201cBegard must be had to the attendant circumstances and the object in view, and also the course of practice of the parties in its execution, since that is significant of the common purpose * * <em>Fury v. New York &amp; Long Branch R. R. </em>&amp; <em>Co., </em>126 <em>N. J. L. </em>25, 30 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1940), affirmed 127 <em>N. J. L. </em>354 <em>(E. </em>&amp; <em>A. </em>1941), <em>certiorari </em>denied 315 <em>U. S. </em>815, 62 <em>S. Ct. </em>800, 86 <em>L. Ed. </em>1213 (1942). <em>Cf., Galler v. Slurzberg, </em>31 <em>N. J. Super. </em>314 <em>(App. Div. </em>1954), affd <em>o. b. </em>18 <em>N. J. </em>466 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">The parties here agree that whenever the employer retains the right to direct the manner in which the business shall be done, as well as the result to be accomplished, or in other words, not only what shall be done, but how it shall be done, it usually proves that the relationship of employer and employee does exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Since Hannigan took the cab daily, and did not return it until 12 hours later, Goldfarb contends that during those 12 hours he could not possibly have directed the manner in which the business was to be done. That, he argues, establishes conclusively that there was no control, and hence no employer-employee relationship. But that does not necessarily follow. \u201cWhen the manner of performing the service is beyond another\u2019s control because of its nature, absence of direct control over such details\u201d may become \u201cinsignificant in the overall view of the facts * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number><em>De Monaco v. Renton, </em>18 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>page </em>357. That is especially true where, as will be seen was the case here, the city by ordinance licenses the drivers and tells them how to behave, under pain of losing their licenses. We therefore turn to the overall view of the facts in the case at bar, and weigh it in the fashion directed by <em>Russo v. United States Trucking Co., </em>26 <em>N. J. </em>430 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The members of the Association are cab owners like Goldfarb, and he testified they all operate as he does. Goldfarb operates only through the Association. The certificate of incorporation of the Association provides that one of the purposes for which the Association was formed is \u201cTo regulate the methods and pass rules and to enforce such rules <em>for the carrying on of the taxi cab business </em>under one uniform system, and which shall apply to all of its members.\u201d (Emphasis ours)</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">On behalf of its members the Association maintains a garage, and offices in which a staff receives telephone calls from prospective passengers and relays them over its two-way radio system to the member cabs nearest the caller. The Association also maintains call boxes and open stands for the member cabs. It was admitted by Mr. Davis, secretary and treasurer of the Association, that the purpose of all this is to lead the public to believe that \u201c20th Century Cab\u201d is a large, responsible organization that gives good service.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">To make sure that this objective will be accomplished, the Association requires each member to abide by the rules and regulations of the organization. Goldfarb testified that each member is responsible for the conduct of his cabs \u201cin the company,\u201d and Davis testified that if a driver misbehaved \u201cwe would reprimand him and tell him if it happened again the owner of the cab would be told to sever relations with him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Drivers are engaged by the individual owners. Each new driver is required to register with the Association. The Association notes the number of the cab assigned to him \u201cso in case of any complaints we will know which one operated the cab on that particular day.\u201d If the driver is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>given another cab he has to re-register; otherwise not. Hannigan registered only once, for in the five or six months he was driving for Goldfarb he always drove cab No. <em>272. </em>With very rare exceptions his shift was 4 p. m. to 4 A. m., and Goldfarb himself said \u201cHannigan was the night man.\u201d During all this period Samuel Naroden operated this cab from 4 A. M. to 4 P. M.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Drivers who have never driven taxis before are trained. Davis testified (emphasis ours):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-5\">\u201cQ. Does the Association bave any control over the driver insofar as his operation of the cab is concerned? A. Well, just the normal rules of decency and not to overcharge, <em>tohich is part of his contract agreement.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\"><em>Q. </em>Is the driver provided with a copy of any rules at the time he begins operating the cab? A. Oh, usually I\u2019ll tell him, if he is a new man, which is very rare \u2014 most of them are over and over again \u2014 the same fellows always work on cabs. They know what the score is. But if they are strictly a new man, they usually send him out with somebody else for a day or two, and I\u2019ll usually tell them, \u2018Do you know what the rates are? Do you know how to operate a meter?\u2019 He is shown. \u2018Do you know how to operate a radio?\u2019 He is shown, if he doesn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">Q. Is he given a rate book? A. He can buy a rate book, which costs 50 cents to print, and we sell them for 50 cents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-8\">Q. <em>In that rate hook is there a copy or is there a list of regulations for the operator? </em>A. <em>In the hook there is </em>\u2014 that <em>tells him how to operate a radio and tells him to treat the customers decently, not to overcharge, not to steal a joh, to mark the joh down for his records; just the general rules.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">Davis was a hostile witness subpoenaed by petitioner. The subpoena ordered him to bring with him, among other things, the list of rules and regulations he said was given to the drivers. When asked for it on the stand, he gave the incredible answer that he didn\u2019t have it because it was out of print, and a new batch was \u201cin the printer\u2019s hands getting printed\u201d! Were the rules and regulations to spring full grown from the mind of the printer ? Obviously not. Necessarily the printer (if there was a printer) had to have before him the rules and regulations to be printed. If Davis did not retain a copy he could have procured one from one of the many drivers, or borrowed the printer\u2019s, or made a handwritten or typed copy thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Later in his testimony Davis said that generally the rules were (emphasis ours) \u201cnot to overcharge, <em>to abide by the rules and regulations set forth by the City Ordinance; </em>not to mistreat people; just general conduct rules.\u201d Though Davis denied there was a printed rule or regulation respecting refusal to accept a passenger he said (emphasis ours) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">\u201c* * * jt&gt;s one 0f those things that we pass amongst themselves. If a man does not take the job, we call him and find out why he didn\u2019t take those people. <em>If he continues to do those things, ice take </em>\u2014 send <em>him down to City Sail to answer questions to the License Commission. </em>It\u2019s one of the City rules. They must take them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">It is therefore pertinent, to the question before us, to examine and consider the taxicab ordinance in effect during the period of Hannigaifis employment, which was introduced in evidence. It provides for separate licenses for the \u201cowner, lessee or bailee\u201d of the taxicab (hereafter called the taxicab license), and for the driver. The application for the taxicab license must be made by the \u201cowner, lessee or bailee\u201d and must state \u201cthe rate to be charged.\u201d Any taxicab licensee desiring to change his rates must file notice of such intention with the Director of the Department of Public Safety. The ordinance contains limitations upon rates, and provides that a photograph of the holder of the taxicab license and a card showing the rates must be displayed in the cab, with a notice \u201cthat in case of any complaint, the Department shall be notified.\u201d The ordinance expressly provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">\u201c* * * nor shall any owner of a taxicab hire out or rent a taxicab to a taxicab driver, or any other person, for use within the City of Newark for a stipulated sum over a definite period of time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">It is to be noted that <em>R. S. </em>48 :16 \u2014 3 and <em>R. S. </em>48 :16 \u2014 12 provide that the operation of a taxi in any municipality without its express consent is a misdemeanor, and <em>R. S. </em>48 :16-10 provides that the consent may be revoked for failure to comply with municipal regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">The ordinance contains detailed regulations relating to the safety and the cleanliness of taxicabs; prohibits \u201cside curtains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>or shades\u201d; and empowers the Director of the Department of Public Safety \u201cto establish reasonable rules arid regulations for the inspection of taxicabs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">The ordinance provides that no driver\u2019s license shall be issued to one addicted to drugs or liquor, or who has been convicted of a crime <em>or of the violation of the </em>ordinance, or who is not of good health and reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The driver receives with his license a badge, which he must \u201cconstantly and conspicuously\u201d display on his right breast. He must \u201cwear a regulation chauffeur\u2019s cap, or a regulation coat or shirt, and must be clean and neat of dress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The ordinance contains numerous and detailed provisions regulating how and where taxis may stand or cruise; behavior at theatres, railway stations and other public places; the use of taxi stands; and the use and illumination of taximeters.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">If the taxi is used for an illegal or immoral purpose the penalty may be \u201csuspension or revocation of <em>owner and driver's </em>licenses.\u201d The driver must give a receipt for the fare upon request; and in case of a dispute must have it settled by \u201cthe police officer in charge of the nearest police station.\u201d Ho person other than the driver may sit in the front seat. After every fare the driver must search the cab for lost or forgotten articles, and report them. Deception of passengers and misrepresentation is forbidden. Every trip must be recorded, and the record retained for 90 days. (The Association provides the drivers with the necessary forms.)</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Pinally, the ordinance provides that any person guilty of violating it shall, in addition to the suspension or revocation of the license, be liable to a fine not exceeding $25, in default of which he may be sentenced to jail for a term not exceeding 90 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">It is not pointed out to us by respondent what instructions relating to \u201cthe manner in which the business shall be done\u201d could have been given by Goldfarb to his drivers that were not included in the foregoing. It must be noted also that here respondent had not only the unfettered right (which not every employer has today) to sever relations with his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>drivers, but lie had the police power of the city behind him as well to compel the driver to perform as he should. Yet, in addition, the Association had its own \u201csupervisors\u201d cheeking the cab operations. Davis testified \u201canyone acting as a \u2018director\u2019 acts as a supervisor.\u201d Since non-pecuniary profit corporations have trustees, not directors, we presume Davis meant each trustee is a supervisor. The certificate of incorporation provides that \u201cthe business of the corporation shall be managed by thirteen trustees,\u201d so presumably there were 13 supervisors. As a specific example of what the supervisors do, Davis said if a supervisor saw a cab was dirty, he would order the driver to get it washed. There was testimony also that the Association wouldn\u2019t tolerate gambling in the cabs or at cab stands.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">Doubtless the supervisors saw to it that the rules and regulations of the city were obeyed by the drivers for, as we have seen, the cab owners\u2019 licenses depend on compliance. <em>Cf., Larson </em>(\u00a7 44.32) in which he points out that \u201cin some cases, it has been possible to make a strong showing of control by introducing detailed regulations such as safety codes * * * and proving that the employer was personally responsible for their observance, with the conclusion that the employer therefore had to have control over \u2018independent\u2019 loaders and truckers to protect himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Why did Goldfarb, through the Association and its supervisors and other agents, do all these things? Was it not to please and entice the traveling public, and to enhance the reputation and advertise the name of \u201c20th Century Cab\u201d as a large, responsible organization that gave good service? It seems to us that it cannot seriously bo argued that all this was also done to enhance the value of the use of the cab in the eyes of the drivers as would-be renters, so that they would prefer to drive 20th Century cabs over others. It seems to us obvious that the members of the Association, through the Association, were in the <em>business </em>of soliciting riders, not renting to drivers. Drivers they could get any time \u2014 for riders they were compelled to compete. In short, Goldfarb was a common carrier of passengers for hire. <em>Of., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number><em>Meridian Taxi Cab Co. v. Ward, </em>184 <em>Miss. </em>499, 186 <em>So. </em>636, 120 <em>A. L. R. </em>1346 (and annotation) <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1939); <em>Richmond v. Clinton, </em>144 <em>Kan. </em>328, 58 <em>P. 2d </em>1116 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1936). Goldfarb was definitely not in the cab rental business. Indeed his business card, placed in evidence, described him as \u201cfleet taxi operator\u201d and said not a word about renting cabs.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Goldfarb testified the driver could buy his gas and oil anywhere. However, in this his witness Uaroden contradicted him. Uaroden testified \u201cwe had to gas up at the 20th Century garage,\u201d and \u201cI wasn\u2019t permitted\u201d to gas up elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">It is true the driver had to repair any damage done to the taxi while he had it, but Goldfarb carried liability insurance to satisfy all claims for personal injury and property damage caused to passengers and others by the operation of the taxi.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The respondent strongly urges that the following further considerations prove that he did not have that control over Hannigan which he says is essential to the relationship of employer and employee. He says that so long as Hannigan paid the $8 to him, Hannigan did not need to work at all. He could shut off his radio altogether, or leave it on and ignore the dispatcher\u2019s message that a fare was waiting at a certain address. He was not allotted any particular territory, and could roam at will or not at all. He could park the cab in front of his apartment and go to sleep, or drive to the shore or to a ball game.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">However, when we look realistically at the economic facts of the relationship between Goldfarb and his drivers, we see that this alleged freedom not to work is fanciful. It is refuted by a simple economic fact \u2014 the driver\u2019s need to eat. As Davis said, \u201cit\u2019s to his advantage to make the call because otherwise how is he going to earn a living?\u201d And when it was suggested to respondent\u2019s witness Uaroden that \u201cif you didn\u2019t want to make the call, you wouldn\u2019t answer,\u201d he was nonplussed by such a bizarre idea. Naroden answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean by that. After all I am out there to try to do my business.\u201d And when asked whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>the Association imposed any penalty upon a driver for failure to obey a dispatcher\u2019s call Goldfarb himself answered, \u201cNever had that experience, don\u2019t know.\u201d As the Iowa Supreme Court said in the <em>Kaus </em>case, supra, 299 <em>N. W., </em>at <em>page </em>419:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\">\u201cWe think it is not inconsistent with the employer-employee relation that the drivers can, if they see fit, reject calls * * * or that they have the privilege of making personal use of the ears. * * <em>* </em>In the very nature of things, no driver will pay $8 and furnish the gasoline to use a taxi for twelve hours and reject many calls or make extensive personal use of the car.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Furthermore, it seems to us obvious that Goldfarb and the other members of the Association would not long tolerate a driver doing as he pleased. If at one time all of the cabs refused to answer customers\u2019 calls, and each one of them departed on the driver\u2019s personal business, it would in a day greatly damage or even destroy the good will and the value of the Association\u2019s name and enterprise. The result would be the same in a short time if not all but a substantial fraction of all of. the drivers did so each day. Beyond that, the city would very likely revoke the licenses if the service were continuously haphazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">Moreover, there is evidence which indicates that Hannigan was more to Goldfarb than just a man who rented a cab whenever the mood seized him. We have already commented upon the fact that Goldfarb assigned to Hannigan a particular cab and a particular shift, which Hannigan drove during all the months he was associated with Goldfarb. In addition, Goldfarb testified that only a single written leasing agreement was made with Hannigan, and that was made before Hannigan took the cab out for the first time. That is hardly consistent with sporadic, intermittent daily rentals.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">Goldfarb testified Hannigan did not drive the cab every day, but came and went as he pleased. Goldfarb\u2019s records were in such shape that it is difficult to determine from them whether or not that was so. The record from July 3 to September 5 indicates it was not so. Hannigan worked 51 out of the 64 calendar days of that period. Furthermore, the fact that he registered only once with the Association for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>cab Fo. 272 indicates that Hannigan was identified by Goldfarb and the Association with that cab during the night shift for all the months he drove. That, as well as the single lease at the beginning of the relationship, are inconsistent with the idea of a drifter who took a cab out now and then for his own amusement or profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Hannigan is dead and cannot tell us whether Goldfarb gave him orders, but in his belongings was found an interesting writing, signed by Goldfarb, reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">\u201cDon, please keep car international for tonight and Sunday also Sunday night. Pick up Naroden Monday <em>a. </em>m.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\u201cInternational\u201d means a 24-hour, around-the-clock shift. This message is much more like an order from employer to employee than a message from a lessor to an intermittent lessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Finally, and most interestingly, it developed in the testimony that Hannigan (and the other drivers) frequently did not pay the stipulated rental. Goldfarb testified he had a list of such unpaid balances \u201cthat big.\u201d Such magnanimity is suggestive of adjustments made between employer and employee to meet conditions of season, weather, accident or other circumstances which interfered with the driver\u2019s earnings and expected fares. Indeed, Goldfarb admitted that he lowered the rental at certain seasons, and when a cab was taken out late.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The parties have briefed and argued the case as if it were to stand or fall upon proof of the right to control the details of the work, or the lack of it. Thejr have taken that approach undoubtedly because many Few Jersey eases have said that such right to control is the primary test of the employer-employee relationship. <em>Piantanida v. Bennett, </em>17 <em>N. J. </em>291 (1955); <em>Wilson v. Kelleher Motor Freight Lines, Inc., </em>12 <em>N. J. </em>261 (1953). Therefore we have examined the facts in this case, to this point, principally upon that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">However, <em>Larson </em>says (\u00a7 43.30) the right to control is not \u201cthe underlying principle that really tips the scales in close situations.\u201d He says (\u00a7 43.50) that \u201cwhat actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>influences the decision [s], not necessarily what appears in briefs or opinions on this kind of question,\u201d is \u201cthe nature of the claimant\u2019s work in relation to the regular business of the employer.\u201d He calls this the \u201crelative nature of the work test,\u201d and he says that under this test \u201care considered: whether the work done is an integral part of the employer\u2019s regular business; and whether the worker in relation to the employer\u2019s business is in a business or profession of his own\u201d (\u00a7 43.53). He points out that in this he follows \u00a7 220 of the <em>Restatement of Agency, </em>which provides that among the tests to be used \u201cin determining whether one acting for another is a servant or an independent contractor, the following matters of fact, among others, are considered: * * * (b) whether or not the one employed is engaged in a distinct occupation or business; * * * (h) whether or not the work is a part of the regular business of the employer * *</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\"><em>La/rson </em>says that among the reasons why the courts treat this as \u201cthe most relevant factor,\u201d even when they do not expressly say so, are the following (\u00a7\u00a7 43.51, 45.10) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">\u201cThe theory of compensation legislation is that the cost of all industrial accidents should be borne by the consumer as a part of the cost of the product. It follows that any worker whose services form a regular and continuing part of the cost of that product, and whose method of operation is not such an independent business that it forms in itself a separate route through which his own costs of industrial accident can be channelled, is within the presumptive area of intended protection. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-9\">There are several reasons why the control tost is in practice giving way to the relative-nature-of-the-work test. Two have already been discussed; the logical irrelevance of the tort-connected test of control to the objectives of social legislation generally, including workmen\u2019s compensation; and the vagueness of the test, resulting both from the lack of agreement or rules on the weight given to various features of the relation, and from the fact that the right of control is itself an inference or conclusion, seldom capable of direct proof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-10\">There is a third reason. With the advent of social and labor legislation * * * drawing a distinction between independent contractors and employees, there has been an increasing effort on the part of employers to avoid both the financial cost and the bookkeeping and reporting inconvenience that goes with workmen\u2019s compensation, unemployment compensation, social security and the like * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>these arrangements are often carefully drawn with an eye to the \u2018control\u2019 test, and since employers are in fact sometimes willing actually to relinquish a considerable degree of control, it becomes very difficult to deal with these contracting-out cases with the old, test. There is therefore beginning to be evinced in the decisions a sort of unexpressed conviction that if the proper scope of workmen\u2019s compensation and other remedial enactments is not to be defeated, a different criterion based on the realistic nature of the work must be given more weight.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">It seems to us that, particularly in a case such as we have here, the \u201crelative nature of the work test\u201d has the advantages of logic, clarity and forthrightness. <em>Cf. O'Brien v. Washington National Insurance Co., </em>17 <em>N. J. Super. </em>549 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1952). However, we need not now determine which of the tests is to be preferred, for in the case at bar we arrive at the same result with either the \u201cright to control\u201d or the \u201crelative nature of the work\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">In those cases in which the taxi driver has been held to be an employee in spite of a \u201cthree-phase arrangement,\u201d the courts have come to that conclusion for reasons which are well summarized in the following excerpt from <em>Kaus v. Huston, supra </em>(35 <em>F. Supp., </em>at <em>p. </em>331) (emphasis ours) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">\u201cBy narrow technical analysis of such relationship and particularly plaintiff\u2019s claimed want of control over the drivers, it is argued that the relationship of master and servant does not exist. It seems to me that this view of the question is too narrow. <em>The real question for solution is, Does the plaintiff engage merely in the leasing of taxicabs, or does he operate a line of taxicabs as a common carrier of passengers? </em>When all factors are considered and particularly the contractual relationship of the plaintiff with the passengers carried, I think there can be little doubt that plaintiff is operating the line of taxicabs, and that while he has adopted an ingenious method of fixing the compensation of his drivers and permits the drivers to exercise some discretion over the cab during the period of the driver\u2019s shift, nevertheless I think there is no discretion vested in the drivers inconsistent with the relation of master and servant. From the very nature of the case the drivers, in order to perform their duties properly, must exercise very complete control over the cabs while they have them out on their shifts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">\u2022 [6] Though we have no New Jersey case on all fours with the one at bar, the holdings and the philosophy of the, cuses we do have dealing with the employer-employee rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>tionship in general lead ns to the conclusion that, as was said in <em>Kaus v. Huston, supra, </em>the real question for solution here is, does Goldfarb \"engage merely in the leasing of taxicabs, or does he operate a line of taxicabs as a common carrier of passengers?\u201d And to paraphrase the language quoted from the <em>Kaus v. Huston </em>opinion, when all factors are considered we think there can be little doubt Goldfarb is operating a line of taxicabs as a common carrier of passengers, and that while he has adopted this method of fixing the compensation of his drivers, they are nevertheless his employees. One cannot call these drivers \"independent contractors\u201d or entrepreneurs without embarrassment. As the Iowa Supreme Court said in <em>Kaus v. Unemployment C. C., supra, </em>at <em>p. </em>419 of 299 <em>N. W.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">\u201cIt can scarcely be claimed that the drivers are in business for themselves. At least so far as the public is concerned, they lose their identity except as drivers for the United Oab Oo. No driver advertises, insures, owns a cab, maintains an office or stand, or has a business telephone. The public deals with the United Cab Co. Its advertisements promising safe, courteous and prompt service at reasonable cost serve as inducements. When a call is received by appellee he necessarily undertakes to furnish that kind of service and delegates to the drivers the duty so to do. It is not reasonable to conclude that appellee does not direct and require his drivers to serve his customers in the manner he advertises to serve them. Appellee forbids the drivers the use of intoxicating liquor, requires them to drive carefully and observe the traffic laws, to be courteous in dealing with the public, to keep the cabs clean, to conduct themselves so the passengers will not complain of their conduct, and requires them to- adhere to the established schedule of fares. He has also dictated which shift the driver shall have and discharged those whose services were not satisfactory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Appellant argues that since the ordinance, in the language quoted above, forbids rental arrangements such as Goldfarb says he made here, this court as a matter of public policy should refuse to countenance it. Eespondent says this argument was rejected in <em>Wilson v. Kelleher Motor Freight Lines, Inc., supra, </em>12 <em>N. J. </em>261, 266 (1953); but see <em>Runk v. Rickenbacher Trans. Co., </em>31 <em>N. J. Super. </em>350, 355 <em>(App. Div. </em>1954). However, it is to be noted that in the <em>Wilson </em>case the court was dealing with I. C. C. regulations, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>here we have an ordinance backed by a statute, <em>R. S. </em>48:16-1 <em>et seq. </em>In <em>Diamond Cab Co. v. </em>Adams, supra, 91 <em>Ga. App. </em>220, 85 <em>S. E. 2d </em>451, 452 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1954), the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-4\">\u201cDiamond Gab Company, having obtained a permit to operate taxicabs upon the streets of Atlanta, was bound to operate taxicabs in compliance with that city\u2019s regulatory ordinances, including an ordinance that no taxicabs shall be operated by any person other than the owner, or his duly licensed employee, and cannot delegate its duties as an operating company to its drivers, by an arrangement of leasing its taxicabs to drivers as independent contractors rather than as employees, in order to avoid liability under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act for death or injury to its drivers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Since we can and do decide the case at bar upon other grounds, we prefer not to pass upon this question of public policy at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The judgment- of the County Court is therefore reversed. The County Court concluded that the finding that Hannigan was not an employee \u201cmakes it unnecessary for this Court to consider the issues created by the Deputy Director\u2019s refusal to permit testimony that the decedent, Donald Hannigan, was intoxicated at the time of the accident.\u201d The case will therefore be remanded to the County Court to consider those issues as well as to make findings of fact and conclusions of law from its review of the record in the Division with respect to all necessary elements of the claim (which it did not make by reason of the basis of its decision), and enter judgment as it shall finally determine the case, not inconsistent with this opinion. If the County Court finds it necessary to remand the case to the Division for further testimony on any issue it may, of course, do so.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
