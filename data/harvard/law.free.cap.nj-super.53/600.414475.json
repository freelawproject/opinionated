A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Ax7\">Plaintiff sued Vogue Shoe Center, Inc. for $2,118.71 for goods sold and delivered. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>a separate count, plaintiff sued defendants Eeich and Wexler for said sum on the ground that (to quote the complaint) \u201cPlaintiff did request defendants to file a Certificate of Paid In Capital for said debtor corporation,\u201d defendants failed to file it, \u201cand said defendants are therefore jointly and severally liable for the debts of said Yogue Shoe Center, Inc. * * * <em>R. S. </em>14:8-16.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Judgment by default was entered against Yogue Shoe Center, Inc. (hereafter called Yogue), but summary judgment was entered in favor of defendants Eeich and-Wexler. The trial judge gave as one of the reasons for the entry of summary judgment that the \u201crequest\u201d which plaintiff relied upon was not sufficiently clear and definite to meet the requirements of the statute. Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">We agree with the trial judge that the \u201crequest\u201d was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\"><em>R. S. </em>14:8-16, as amended <em>L. </em>1955, c. 154, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">\u201cUpon payment of each installment of capital stock, and of every increase thereof, the president or a vice-president and the secretary or treasurer shall make a certificate stating the amount of the capital so paid and whether paid in cash or by the purchase of property. This certificate shall be signed and sworn to by the president or such vice-president and the secretary or treasurer, and shall be filed in the office of the Secretary of State, within 10 days after such payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-8\">If any of such officers neglect or refuse so to do for 30 days after written request so to do by a creditor or stockholder of the corporation, they shall be jointly and severally liable for all its debts contracted before the filing of such certificate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">Each defendant received a letter from plaintiff\u2019s attorney, addressed to Yogue as well as to him \u201cc/o The Yogue Shoe Center, Inc.,\u201d which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-10\">Re: Portage Shoe Manufacturing Oompany Division of Weyenberg Shoe Manufacturing Co.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ_Z\">vs. <em>The Vogue Center, Inc.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-11\">\n<em>The Vogue Shoe Center, Ine.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-12\">$2,118.71</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-13\">Dear Sir :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-14\">Since <em>you </em>have chosen not to dispose of this matter amicably, I have been requested to take legal action against <em>you.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>If suit is instituted, <em>your </em>obligation will be increased by the amount of court costs involved. It is therefore suggested that <em>you </em>communicate with this office at once to arrange for voluntary payment of this obligation of The Vogue Shoe Center, Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">You are requested as a principal officer of The Vogue Shoe Center, Inc., and/or The Vogue Center, Inc., to file a Certificate of Paid In Capital for said debtor corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">Very truly yours,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">(Whenever emphasis appears in this opinion, it is ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">What is a sufficient \u201crequest\u201d under this statute lias been involved in two recent <em>cases </em>\u2014 Frank <em>Rizzo, Inc. v. Alatsas, </em>27 <em>N. J. </em>400 (1958) and <em>Sylvania Electric Products, Inc. v. </em>Fulmer, 47 <em>N. J. Super. </em>444 <em>(Ch. Div. </em>1957). In the <em>Rizzo </em>case plaintiff had recovered judgment against Meridian Development Corporation. Plaintiff then served upon the officers of that corporation the following writing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-9\">\u201cDemand is hereby made on behalf of Prank Rizzo, Inc., that you file, <em>within SO days from, the receipt of this letter a certificate in the office of the Secretary of State, stating the total amount of capital </em>paid into the Meridian Development Corporation <em>and, whether it was paid in cash or by the purchase of property.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">It is to be noted that in the <em>Rizzo </em>case (1) judgment had already been recovered by the plaintiff against the Meridian Development Corporation, so the addressee could not have been misled into believing that this demand was a threat to sue the corporation; (2) there was no language in the letter other than that quoted above \u2014 hence nothing to divert the attention of the addressee from the demand that a certificate be filed; (3) the demand identified the type of certificate required by stating, substantially, what the statute said such a certificate should contain, and when and where it was to be filed. The record and the briefs in the <em>Rizzo </em>ease show that the sufficiency of the demand was argued before the Supreme Court, and the <em>Sylvania </em>case was cited. Since the Supreme Court sent the case back for trial upon other issues, we must assume that the court found the demand sufficient. Nevertheless, it is significant that the court pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>ferred to give its approval <em>sub silentio, </em>without mentioning the issue or citing the <em>Sylvania, </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">The \u201crequest\u201d in the case at bar falls far short of the \u201cdemand\u201d in the <em>Rizzo </em>case. Appellant admits that the language of the letter sent to defendants here is substantially different than that in the demand in Rizzo, but, says appellant, it is similar to that which was approved in the <em>Sylvania </em>case. Without passing upon the sufficiency of the request in the <em>Sylvania </em>case, we would point out that even in <em>Sylvania </em>the request was less likely to mislead the addressee than the one now before us. As in Rizzo, Sylvania already had its judgment against the Barry Products Corporation. The letter from Sylvania\u2019s attorney did not (as it did here) divert the attention of Eulmer with threats of suit against the corporation. It warned Eulmer that the attorney was intent upon collecting the judgment and, \u201cin order to aid the abovementioned creditor in ascertaining the assets of Barry Products Corporation, you are requested to file a Certificate of Paid In Capital for said debtor corporation * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">In the case at bar the request did not give the specific what, when and where directions contained in the demand in the <em>Rizzo </em>case, nor the clue to what was requested which might have been found in the <em>Sylvania </em>case. On the contrary, even if it were not intentional, the request here was downright misleading. The first sentence of the letter threatened suit against Yogue and not against the officer (and, in fact, suit was started six weeks later). This was fortified by the second sentence \u2014 \u201cIf suit is instituted, your obligation will be increased by the amount of court costs\u201d \u2014a statement which, at the date of the letter, could apply only to the corporation, for at that time the officer was under no obligation to plaintiff. The first two paragraphs of this three paragraph letter plainly meant that it was not intended to hold the officer liable, hut the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The last paragraph of the letter cannot he accepted as sufficient notice to trigger liability under the statute, especially when read in the context of the two preceding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>paragraphs. It did not refer to the statute; nor did it describe, in language recognizably drawn from the statute, the requested certificate, as the demand in Eizzo attempted to do. What is a \u201ccertificate of paid in capital\u201d? No certificate by that name is mentioned anywhere in the statute. A lawyer may know what is meant by that, and where it is to be filed and when, but what is a layman to make of such a name?</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">In the <em>Rizzo </em>case, <em>supra, </em>the court said <em>(27 N. J. </em>at <em>page </em>405) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">\u201c* * * The statute involved in effect imposes a penalty. It is sufficiently penal in character to require a strict construction and thus to impose its burden only when there has been a manifest noncompliance. * * * The critical words by which liability is to be gauged are \u2018neglect or refuse.\u2019 In the context and weighted with the rule of strict construction, \u2018neglect\u2019 signifies more than mere failure or omission. It connotes a wilful failure to discharge, or a reckless indifference to, a <em>known obligation. </em>* * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-9\"> The statute could have made the officers personally liable for failure to file such a certificate without any prior demand upon them that they do so. The fact Unit the statute does require a prior request clearly indicates that the Legislature intended that the request plainly make known to the officers their obligation, <em>i. e., </em>what it is they are to do, and when and where. In the absence of express provision, the form and contents of a notice required by a statute are dependent upon the wording of the statute construed in the light of its intent and purpose.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-10\">\u201cGenerally speaking, when a formal notice is required, it should give the necessary information, and must apprise the person whose rights are to be affected of what is required of him * * * a notice must be clear, definite, and explicit, and not ambiguous. The notice is not clear unless its meaning can be comprehended without explanation. * * \u00ae\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">66 <em>C. J. S. Notice </em>\u00a7 16, <em>pp. </em>653-654. The request here falls far short of that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">Eor the foregoing reasons the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
