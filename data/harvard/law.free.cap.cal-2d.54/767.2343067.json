Judgment went for plaintiff, and defendant appeals. We have concluded that the trial court correctly held for plaintiff and that judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-3\">Both plaintiff and defendant are in the business of factoring accounts receivable. The chronology of events leading up to this litigation is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">February 7, 1955. Defendant entered into a written factoring agreement with Modern Crane and Conveyor Company, Inc., hereinafter called Crane. Under this agreement Crane agreed to sell and defendant agreed to buy from Crane \u201cat the net face amount of invoices less three (3%) per cent, accounts receivable created by\u201d Crane\u2019s sales on such sales \u201cas shall be approved by\u201d defendant, and defendant agreed to \u201cbe responsible for payment when the goods have finally been accepted by\u201d Crane\u2019s customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">March 10, 1955. Defendant and Crane filed in the office of the county recorder (Los Angeles), pursuant to the provisions of sections 3017 through 3029 of the Civil Code, a notice of assignment of accounts receivable. The notice had been executed by defendant and Crane on February 7, 1955, was signed by both parties thereto, and recited that they thereby gave notice that Crane, as assignor, \u201cexpects to assign, or has assigned, an account or accounts receivable now existing or hereafter arising,\u201d to defendant as assignee, and that \u201cthe general nature of the business out of which such accounts arise is Manufacturing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">July 30, 1955. Crane executed a written assignment to defendant of \u201ccertain accounts receivable identified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-7\">\u201cDate of Contract 7-30-55 Contract Number N3883S-16654A</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-8\">Amount $98,505.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">The findings and the evidence show that this \u201cNumber N3883S-16654A\u201d was a United States Navy prime contract to supply hydraulic jacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">Some time prior to November 9, 1955, defendant, according to allegations in its answer, under the terms of its above described assignment from Crane became the owner and assignee of an \u201cindebtedness to\u201d Crane in the sum of $9,704.41 representing the unpaid balance on Invoices Numbers 1737, 1820, and 1824, which invoices were dated as of July and August, 1955, and indicated the delivery to the Navy of certain jacks under the Navy contract. The uncontra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>dieted evidence shows, however, and the trial court found,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that no deliveries were actually made under these invoices.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">November 9, 1955. Defendant and Crane executed a written release of the February 7, 1955, factoring agreement between them. The release declared that unpaid accounts receivable purchased by defendant from Crane totaled $41,248.28 and included $16,369.66 of purported accounts receivable under the Navy contract. In consideration of the release and as indemnity (required under the terms of the factoring agreement) for payment of the $41,248.28 to defendant, Crane transferred to defendant title to a certain crane and hoist (not otherwise involved in this litigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">November 11, 1955. Defendant executed, and on November 16, 1955, had recorded a cancellation of the March 10, 1955, notice of assignment of accounts receivable, between itself and Crane. The cancellation declares in part that the notice of assignment theretofore filed by defendant and Crane \u201cis hereby cancelled and is no longer effective. \u2019 \u2019 The court found that the November 9 release and the November 11 cancellation notice \u201cwere to permit Modern Crane to factor with other Factors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">February 27, 1956. Plaintiff and Crane executed, and on March 5, 1956, filed in the county recorder\u2019s office, a notice of assignment of accounts. Concurrently the county recorder issued to plaintiff his certificate that there were no other uncancelled notices of assignment on file, with an exception not here material.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Thereafter Crane sold to plaintiff an indebtedness totaling $9,900,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> represented by invoices numbered 2073, 2075, and 2083, for hydraulic jacks supplied under the Navy contract. Examination of such invoices and of the \u201cMateriel Inspection and Receiving Report[s],\u201d certified copies of which are included in the record, discloses that the items listed in the three invoices were \u201cinspected . . ., conform to contract, and have been accepted\u201d respectively as follows: Invoice Number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>2073, February 23, <em>1956; </em>Invoice Number 2075, February 28, 1956; and Invoice Number 2083, March 2,1956. The shipping dates for the items under such invoices were for Number 2073, March 16, 1956, and for the other two, March 20, 1956. The Navy received this merchandise and paid to defendant bank $9,875.25 as the discounted full payment of these three invoices. Both plaintiff and defendant claimed the money from the bank, and this litigation followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-3\">The trial court found and concluded that plaintiff is entitled to the full fund of $9,875.25, that as shown by the evidence such sum had been paid to the bank in payment of the specific three invoices (2073, 2075, 2083) representing the indebtedness purchased by plaintiff, that the invoices (1737, 1820, 1824) which seemingly formed the basis of defendant\u2019s claim to the money \u201cwere fictitious. No deliveries of the merchandise listed had been made to the Navy (the purchaser) nor acknowledged by the Navy.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court further found that defendant \u201cdid release, cancel, surrender and waive any and all his <em>[sic] </em>rights of claims sold and assigned by . . . [Grane] to the defendant and which may have affected or related to the claims purchased from . . . [Crane] by the plaintiff.\u201d Accordingly, judgment went for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Defendant, as grounds for reversal, argues that despite the recorded notice of cancellation of assignment of accounts receivable, it is entitled to priority over plaintiff to the fund here in dispute. However, such fund was admittedly paid to the bank for material supplied by Crane under the Navy contract some four months <em>after </em>the cancellation notice had been recorded,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and represents an indebtedness which defendant had not at any time purchased; it was, indeed, as shown above, an indebtedness which by the terms of the Navy contract did not come into existence until the items to be sold had been manufactured by Crane and accepted by the Navy.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Moreover, in defendant\u2019s brief seven of the Navy contract invoices are set forth showing an alleged total Navy indebted<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>ness of $37,620 purportedly purchased hy defendant from Crane prior to the cancellation notice. Three of such invoices are, however, those expressly found by the court to be fictitious and to have represented no deliveries of merchandise to the Navy. This finding is directly supported by testimony of a representative of the Inspector of Navy Materiel. These three invoices totaled $12,870, which when subtracted from the total indebtedness claimed by defendant leaves only $24,750 as possibly actually owing to defendant from the Navy. Since the evidence shows, and defendant in its brief relates, payment to defendant by the Navy of $27,915.59, it follows that nothing further was owing to defendant by the Navy, and that regardless of other considerations defendant is entitled to no part of the $9,875.25 paid by the Navy to the bank in full of the three invoices representing the indebtedness purchased by plaintiff. On the record presented it appears that defendant did not purchase such indebtedness, that it advanced no money in reliance upon it, that plaintiff did purchase it, and that the trial court correctly held that plaintiff is entitled to the money therefor paid to the bank by the Navy.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">In other words, the whole tenor of defendant\u2019s argument and brief seems to be that the issue on this appeal is that of priority as between two factors who purchased the same indebtedness. As already stated, however, the evidence and the findings establish that plaintiff did, and defendant did <em>not, </em>purchase the indebtedness in payment of which the funds in dispute were deposited with, and are now held by, the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The appeal in this case approaches, if it does not reach, the character of frivolousness. The contention on behalf of defendant-appellant that disposition of the case depends on resolution of an issue of law relating to priority of assignments is not sustained by the record. Inspection of the record discloses that the judgment appealed from is required by the facts found and that the evidence supporting the findings is substantially uncontradicted. The substance of defendant\u2019s factoring agreement with Crane is embodied in the words \" Seller will sell and Factor will buy from Seller at the net face amount of invoices less three (3%) per cent, accounts receivable created by Seller\u2019s sales.\u201d By the terms of Crane\u2019s contract with the Navy there could be no \u201caccounts receivable created by Seller\u2019s sales\u201d until the contracted items had been manufactured by Crane and inspected and accepted by the Navy. Defendant\u2019s claim to the money here involved is com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>pletely devoid of merit because it is essentially based on fictitious invoices (Nos. 1737, 1820 and 1824) as to which the witness Linden (who was Director of Contract Control with the office of the Inspector of Navy Materiel, Los Angeles) testified that \u201cInvoice Nos. 1737, . . . 1820, and 1824 were returned [to Crane], stating records of this activity indicate that nothing has been shipped . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-3\">Even if we assume (as intimated at the trial by counsel for defendant) that defendant has been the victim of a fraudulent act by someone representing Crane, it does not follow that plaintiff should bear the loss, if any. The statement made by counsel for defendant during oral argument before this court, in response to questions from the bench, that the trial court found specifically that defendant did purchase the subject indebtedness and that there is no evidence in the record that it did not, is not justified by the record and should not have been made. The attention of counsel is directed to subdivision (d) of section 6068, Business and Professions Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Gibson, C. J., Traynor J., McComb, J., Peters, J., White, J., and Dooling, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b797-8\">Part of Finding No. 6: \"The purported accounts receivables [sic] of California Equities designated ... as Invoices Nos. 1737, 1820 and 1824 were fictitious.
