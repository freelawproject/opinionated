P. Schultz, who died on May 15, 1958. A surviving brother, Gustave O. E. Schultz, offered for probate a witnessed will executed in 1951. There also was offered for probate by Alfred P. Bolz, a friend of the deceased, two documents dated respectively, February 1, 1956, and March 22, 1956.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both of these latter documents were admittedly in the deceased\u2019s handwriting. The court denied probate to the 1951 will on the ground of its revocation by the 1956 instruments and admitted to probate the latter two holographic documents as the integrated last will of the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Mr. Bolz received the February 1, 1956, document from the deceased through the mail. The record does not show whether there was an accompanying letter. The document was headed : \u201cCopy. Last Will and Testament.\u201d After appointing Mr. Bolz as \u201cadministrator\u201d and providing for a series of $1.00 gifts to several relatives, the document concluded with a residuary clause as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">\u201cAll the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, real, personal or mixed, wheresoever situate, of which I may die seized or possessed or to which I may be entitled at the time of my desease, I give, devise and bequeath as follow to wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">\u201cA \u2014 To my good friend Leopold Singwald whom owes me the Sum of $400.001 will cancel the debt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-8\">\u201cB \u2014 To my beloved niece Ella (Alke) Ilse Ahrensburg in Holstein near Hamburg, Germany</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-9\">\u201c C \u2014 To my nephew Hans Ebinger and his Wife in L.A.C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-10\">\u201cD\u2014\u2022 To Mrs. Katie Whittemore 227 So.

The second document was part of a letter dated March 22, 1956, which the deceased sent to Mr. Bolz. It was addressed to \u201cDear Albert\u201d and after asking for some advice relative to the presentation of a property damage claim, the letter concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-18\">\u201cInclose you find the rest of my Will please fill in on your <em>copy </em>as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-19\">\u201cA \u2014 To my friend Leopold Singewald whom owes me $400.00 for over 5 years already but has always paid the intress\u2014I will cancel that debt in case of/ my Death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-20\">\u201cB\u2014\u2022 To my beloved niece Mrs. Ella Ilse Ahrensburg in Holstein Germany $5,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-21\">\u201cC \u2014 To my nephew Hans Ebinger and his wife In a $1000.00.

They were: (1) a letter dated March 19, 1956, wherein the deceased stated: \u201cNext time I send you the list of names for my new will and how much for <em>each\u201d-, </em>(2) a letter dated March 20, 1956, wherein the deceased noted: \u201cDear Albert I nearly forgot to tell you I am just so absent? minded. I made up the list of all those in my will and what everybody is going to get and many thanks in advance\u201d; and (3) a letter postmarked March 23, 1956, wherein the deceased wrote: \u201cI am very glad I changed the will and it is in your hands again. Amen. \u2019 \u2019 The first two letters were informally signed \u201cYour sincere friend John.\u201d The third letter was unsigned and contained a separately written list of the relatives and friends of the deceased, with their gift amounts identically stated as in the specific listing of the March 22, 1956, letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">There was no evidence that an original holographic will had ever been seen in decedent\u2019s possession, and after his death a thorough search of his home and personal effects was made but no other documents purporting to be a will were discovered. In these circumstances, the trial court found that the offered holographic documents of February 1, 1956, and March 22, 1956, were written with testamentary intent and constituted the last will and testament of the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">Appellant concedes that each of the two documents satisfies the formal requirements for an holographic will<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but he argues: (1) that there is no substantial evidence that the decedent executed either of the documents with <em>animus testandi, </em>i.e., that he executed either document with the intention that it should be anything other than a non-testamentary copy of an original will which he must have kept in his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>possession; and (2) that in any event the ease is governed by a presumption that the original will, of which the probated documents constitute a copy, and which it must be inferred that decedent had executed, was destroyed by the decedent with the intent of revoking the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">We have concluded that in all substantial respects, this ease is governed by <em>Estate of Janes, </em>18 Cal.2d 512 [116 P.2d 438]. In <em>Janes </em>we reversed an order of the probate court refusing probate to a document which in form satisfied all of the requirements of an holographic will, but which had a notation attached to it in the decedent\u2019s handwriting reading: \u201cThis is a copy of my last Will, the original is in my safe deposit box.\u201d (18 Cal.2d, p. 514.)  Of the claim that the instrument was not intended to have testamentary effect because the decedent had designated it a copy we said, after noting \u201cthe policy of the law favoring testacy rather than intestacy\u201d (18 Cal.2d, p. 515) : \u201cThe designation of an instrument as a \u2018copy\u2019 is not alone sufficient to establish that the decedent lacked testamentary intent in executing the instrument. The word \u2018copy\u2019 implies that the instrument so labeled is identical with another instrument. ... If it is properly executed, a copy of a will is in effect the same as a duplicate (citations), and it is clear that a properly executed duplicate may be admitted to probate.\u201d (18 Cal.2d, p. 516.)</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">As to the claim that the failure to find an original after the decedent\u2019s death created a presumption that he destroyed it in his lifetime with intent to revoke it, we said in <em>James, </em>18 Cal.2d at page 517: \u201cIn the instant case, however, there was no evidence that anyone had ever seen the \u2018original\u2019 will and the only evidence of its existence was decedent\u2019s statement in the notation. The decedent might have intended to execute another copy of his will to be kept in his safe deposit box and failed to do so; but this would not prevent the probate of the will produced. (Citations.) Under these circumstances, there is no evidence to support the theory of revocation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The facts in the instant case, while differing from those in <em>Janes, </em>are in some respects stronger. In <em>Janes </em>the decedent expressly declared in writing after designating the document admitted to probate \u201ca copy of my last Will\u201d: \u201cthe original is in my safe deposit box.\u201d (18 Cal.2d, p. 514.) There was no such explicit declaration by the decedent in the ease before us, and the existence or nonexistence of an original will is wholly a matter of inference. There is also the express declaration of the decedent in his letter postmarked the day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>after the letter containing the second, portion of the will admitted to probate was written: \u201cI am very glad I changed the will and it is in your hands again. Amen.\u201d This statement furnishes strong support for the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the documents sent to Bolz were executed with testamentary intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Appellant places great stress upon the words introducing the second document admitted to probate: \u201cInclose you find the rest of my Will please fill in on your <em>copy </em>as followsclaiming that these words are necessarily inconsistent with an intent that the two documents should have a testamentary effect. If used by a lawyer, this might well be true, but decedent was a layman, the extent of whose knowledge of the law affecting wills was in no way established.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The probate court was entitled to consider all of the evidence in arriving at decedent\u2019s intent, including the fact that both documents were formally dated and signed with the decedent\u2019s full name, whereas his letters to Bolz referring to his will were otherwise either signed with his first name only or unsigned; that he apparently took care to date back the testamentary portion of his letter of March 22 to February 1, the date of the first incomplete will; and that, as above noted, after sending the letter of March 22, in a letter postmarked the very day following he wrote: \u201cI am very glad I changed the will and it is in your hands again. Amen. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">At the most, this is a case in which the evidence before the probate court would support conflicting inferences on the questions posed by appellant, but where either of two inferences may be reasonably drawn from the evidence by the trier of the facts, the reviewing court will not substitute its deductions for those of the trial court. <em>(Estate of Bristol, </em>23 Cal.2d 221, 223 [143 P.2d 689].)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">Gibson, C. J., Traynor, J., Schauer, J., McComb, J., Peters, J., and White, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b542-11\">As appears hereinafter, the portion of the letter dated March 22, 1956, which was admitted to probate, was separately dated February 1, 1956.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b544-13\">The fact that the second document was part of a longer letter does not affect its sufficiency as a will. <em>(Estate of Sutton, </em>209 Cal. 325, 330-331 [287 P. 964]; <em>Estate of Spitzer, </em>196 Cal. 301, 306-307 [237 P. 739].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
