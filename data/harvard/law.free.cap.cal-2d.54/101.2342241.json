Kyle was the defaulting purchaser of the automobile under a contract of conditional sale with Milliken Chevrolet, Inc. Such contract did not comply with the requirements of subdivision (a) of section 2982 of the Civil Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The seller assigned the conditional sale contract to GMAC. Disposition of GMAC\u2019s appeal turns upon the legislative purpose in regulating conditional sales of motor vehicles by section 2982.  As we said when we first considered subdivision (a) of the section in <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Seaboard Finance Co. </em>(1949), 33 Cal.2d 564, 573 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>[203 P.2d 758], its \u201cobvious purpose\u201d is \u201cto protect purchasers of motor vehicles against excessive charges by requiring full disclosure of all items of cost.\u201d As shown by subsequent decisions hereinafter discussed, such subdivision (a) is not intended to penalize the seller who violates it in the respects here concerned, or the assignee of such a seller, nor should such subdivision (a) be applied in a manner which will give a windfall to the conditional purchaser. This view of section 2982 leads to the conclusion that the judgment should be reversed with directions to permit Kyle, if he be so advised, to amend his counterclaim and seek recovery upon a restitutive rather than a punitive theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">On December 21, 1956, Kyle and Milliken executed the conditional sale contract. The transaction violated subdivision (a) of section 2982 of the Civil Code, <em>supra, </em>footnote 1, in the following respects: The copy delivered to Kyle was not signed by an authorized representative of the corporate seller; the recited cash down payment was $787.47, but the actual cash down payment to Milliken was $285; the contract did not recite a \u201cdescription and itemization of amounts . . . which will actually be paid by the seller . . .to any public officer as fees in connection with the transaction, which are included in the contract balance,\u201d but rather stated, \u201cFees Paid : Registration and Transfer $_, Other $_ $54.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">On an undisclosed date, by a writing which is not in evidence, Milliken assigned the conditional sale contract to GMAC. Kyle paid GMAC two monthly instalments pursuant to the contract, then defaulted. On April 30, 1957, Kyle\u2019s attorney wrote Milliken and GMAC that the contract is \u201cvoid\u201d because of specified violations of section 2982-; that Kyle \u201ctendered this automobile back to Milliken Chevrolet several months ago and . . . tender was refused\u201d; and that Kyle therefore would make no more payments and would not permit repossession of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">GMAC brought this action to recover the vehicle or its reasonable value and damages for its detention, obtained possession of the car (through the municipal court marshal) by the provisional remedy of claim and delivery, and sold it to a third person. Kyle answered and counterclaimed for damages \u201cbecause of the repossession of said automobile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The trial court determined that because of <em>the </em>above stated violations of section 2982 the conditional sale contract was \u201cvoid\u201d and GMAC \u201chad no rights thereunder and had no right to repossess said automobile by means of this action, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>otherwise\u201d; that Kyle had \u201cthe right to possession\u201d of the automobile. The court awarded Kyle $2,643, the stipulated value of the car at the time GMAC obtained possession of it by the claim and delivery remedy. That the trial court was of the opinion that the vehicle should be forfeited to the conditional purchaser is clear from its statement, at the time it announced judgment, that \u201cThe parties agree that the automobile in question was sold by the repossessing party, and that return of the automobile cannot now be had. . . . Accordingly, the judgment of the Court will necessarily be for the value of the automobile at the time ... of the taking in this claim and delivery proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Such an award does not accord with our understanding of the legislative intent of section 2982 which is implicit in the statute and which the courts have attempted to make explicit by decisions hereinafter cited. On the other hand, as we shall explain, the words of the statute do not require, and effectuation of the statutory purpose would be frustrated by, acceptance at face value of the contention of GMAC that a contract which violates subdivision (a) of section 2982, quoted <em>supra, </em>footnote 1, is \u201cenforceable by a bona fide purchaser for value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">As to the just stated contention of GMAC, defendant Kyle points out that nothing in the record on appeal indicates that GMAC was or attempted to show that it was a \u201cbona fide purchaser for value.\u201d The complaint of GMAC alleges that it \u201cwas the owner of a certain conditional sales contract by an assignment in writing,\u201d and Kyle\u2019s answer and counterclaim and the trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions describe GMAC as an \u201cassignee.\u201d  Since the case was tried on this theory, and the facts on which GMAC\u2019s belatedly advanced legal argument is based were not presented to the trial court, it is improper for GMAC to assert for the first time on appeal that its rights are greater than those of its assignor. <em>(Ernst </em>v. <em>Searle </em>(1933), 218 Cal. 233, 240-241 [6, 7] [22 P.2d 715]; see <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Taggart </em>(1959), 51 Cal.2d 736, 742 [6, 7] [336 P.2d 534].) However, since the case must be remanded for a new trial on the issue of the amount of recovery, it is appropriate that we forestall any thought of GMAC that on such trial it might be able to show a right to enforce the contract of conditional sale as a bona fide purchaser. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 53.)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">In an effort to show that it took without notice of the illegality of the contract, GMAC asserts for the first time on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>appeal that the copy of the contract which it received was signed by a representative of the seller and that it had no knowledge that Kyle\u2019s copy was not so signed or that the recited amount of the cash down payment was not correct.  But the failure of the contract to describe and itemize amounts to be paid as fees appears on the face of the contract and therefore GMAC could in no event properly claim that it had no notice of that defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">More fundamentally, as will appear from the hereinafter related legislative and judicial developments since the enactment of section 2982 of the Civil Code, GMAC is mistaken in its contention that a contract which violates subdivision (a) of such section is enforcible by a bona fide purchaser for value from the conditional seller. As stated above, the legislative purpose of the section is the protection of instalment buyers of automobiles from concealed and excessive finance and interest charges.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Subdivision (a) of section 2982, quoted <em>supra, </em>footnote 1, requires that the conditional sale contract be in writing, with specified contents, and that an exact copy be delivered to the buyer; subdivision (b) requires the seller to furnish the buyer who pays for insurance under the contract with an exact copy of the insurance policy; subdivision (c) establishes the maximum permitted \u201ctime price differential\u201d (finance and interest charges) ; and subdivision (d) (added by Stats. 1949, ch. 1594, p. 2842) provides for a refund credit to a buyer who satisfies his indebtedness under the contract before its maturity, and specifies the permissible minimum amount of such refund credit.  Subdivisions (a) and (b) are designed to enable the buyer to know just what his contract is; subdivisions (c) and (d) are directly aimed at excessive charges which are akin to usury but to which, by common law <em>(Wilson </em>v. <em>J. E. French Co. </em>(1931), 214 Cal. 188, 189 [2] [4 P.2d 537]; <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Herndon </em>(1929), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>97 Cal-App. 193, 200 [3] [275 P. 503] ; see <em>Milana </em>v. <em>Credit Discount Co. </em>(1945), 27 Cal.2d 335, 340 [4, 5] [163 P.2d 869, 165 A.L.R. 621]), the usury statutes do not apply. The requirements of subdivisions (a) and (b) have been aptly called \u201cformal\u201d and those of subdivisions (c) and (d), \u201csubstantive\u201d (Note, <em>California Motor Vehicle Installment Sales Act </em>(1951), 39 Cal.L.Rev. 450) and we shall adopt that terminology.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Section 2982 does not specify the effect of violation of the formal requirements. Sanctions for substantive violations have been stated and amended by the Legislature,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but their operation if they are literally applied is entirely fortuitous, depending upon the amount of the down payment as compared to the total price, upon when the sanctions are invoked, and upon whether the seller transfers the contract to a \u201cbona fide purchaser for value\u201d; such sanctions afford no uniformly operative scheme of penalizing the seller or protecting the buyer. Furthermore, the Legislature has said nothing about the effect of violations upon the property rights in the vehicle.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">In <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Seaboard Finance Co. </em>(1949), <em>supra, </em>33 Cal.2d 564, we held that substantial violations of formal requirements of subdivision (a) of section 2982 render the contract unenforcible by the seller<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that a buyer who has made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>payments to the seller under such a contract can recover them. In so holding, we took into account the fact that the section expressly prescribed sanctions for substantive violations and concluded that such sanctions were not inconsistent with the court-declared effect of formal violations (pp. 572-573 [9a-9b], 573-574 [12] of 33 Cal.2d). The Legislature has since repeatedly amended section 2982, and the courts have since frequently passed upon the effect of violations, but, except for implied recognition in 1951 of the rule of unenforcibility announced in the Carter case,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> none of the amendments state the effect of formal violations or clarify the effect of substantive violations. Therefore, we take it, the Legislature has been satisfied with the efforts of the courts to work out these problems as to which it has chosen to remain silent. (See <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>State </em>(1959), 53 Cal.2d 23, 29 [346 P.2d 193]; <em>Baum </em>v. <em>Aleman </em>(1956), 139 Cal.App.2d Supp. 929, 932 [2] [293 P.2d 162].)  The results of those efforts are rules based on the theory that the rights of the buyer against the seller arising from formal violations are in the nature of traditional rescission and restitution (but without the need for prompt notice and offer to restore required by Civ. Code, \u00a7 1691; see <em>Estrada </em>v. <em>Alvarez </em>(1952), 38 Cal.2d 386, 389-391 [240 P.2d 278]) and that the buyer\u2019s recovery from the seller for substantive violations which do not result from accidental or bona fide errors in computation, is not limited to restitution because the Legislature has expressed the intention that the seller should be penalized for such violations. Eules concerning rights between buyer and seller are as follows :<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Although the express legislative sanctions for substantive violations by the seller (footnote 3, <em>supra) </em>state that the seller cannot enforce the contract and the buyer can recover \u201cthe total amount paid on the contract balance,\u201d the courts have not considered that such sanctions are an exelu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>sive remedy; rather, for violations either substantive or formal, the buyer can invoke the restitutive measure of recovery and obtain the total amount or value of that with which he parted, including down payments, less offsets hereinafter described. <em>(City Lincoln-Mercury Co. </em>v. <em>Lindsey </em>(1959), 52 Cal.2d 267, 274 [2b] [339 P.2d 851]; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Muntz Car Co. </em>(1958), 50 Cal.2d 681, 684 [1] [328 P.2d 968].)  The measure of recovery for an automobile traded in is its actual retail market value, rather than its trade-in value. (City Lincoln-Mercury case, <em>supra, </em>pp. 274-275 [9] of 52 Cal.2d.)  The seller whose violations are formal only can have an offset \u201cin an amount representing the depreciation in value of the car occasioned by the use made of it by the buyer while in his possession, which necessarily excludes any allowance for depreciation resulting from a general decline in the market value of such automobile during the period in question\u201d <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Caruso Enterprises </em>(1956), 140 Cal. App.2d Supp. 973, 980 [5, 6] [295 P.2d 592]); because the buyer is a member of a protected class, the offset is not measured by the rental value of the car,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for such measure would improperly allow the seller a profit, and the seller can in no event recover on the theory of offset more than an amount equal to that which the buyer is entitled to recover <em>(id.). </em>The seller who is guilty of intentional substantive violations is penalized by not allowing him an offset. (City Lincoln-Mercury case, <em>supra, </em>pp. 275-276 [11a-11b], 277 [14] of 52 Cal.2d; Lewis case, <em>supra, </em>pp. 686-687 [2] of 50 Cal.2d.)</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Since \u201c [t]he courts will not impose penalties for noncompliance with statutory provisions in addition to those that are provided expressly or by necessary implication\u201d (City Lincoln-Mercury case, <em>supra, </em>p. 276 [12] of 52 Cal.2d), we think that the Legislature could not have intended to tacitly impose so harsh a sanction as forfeiture of the vehicle against the seller whose violations are only formal. In such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>a situation the buyer cannot both recover the consideration with which he has parted and keep' the vehicle; he cannot simultaneously avoid the conditional sale contract and assert rights in the conditionally sold car. <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Caruso Enterprises </em>(1956), <em>supra, </em>140 Cal.App.2d Supp. 973, 979 [4].)  The conditional seller whose violations of section 2982 are only formal can keep the car if he retakes it from the defaulting buyer without aid of a court <em>(id.; </em>see the Lewis case (1958), <em>supra, </em>pp. 686, 688 of 50 Cal.2d, rejecting without particular discussion the buyer\u2019s contention that he should recover the car from the repossessing assignee of a seller whose violations were both formal and substantive). And the seller whose violations are formal only should not be penalized if, instead of repossessing the vehicle by his own action, he seeks the aid of legal process to retake it.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The anomalous results reached in some cases of seriously illegal contracts of sale of goods, where the courts leave the parties as they find them, sometimes with one party retaining possession although the other has title (see 3 Williston, Sales (1948), \u00a7\u00a7 677, 678; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>California Thorn Cordage, Inc. </em>(1933), 129 Cal.App. 93, 101 [18 P.2d 393]), would follow in the situation under discussion from application of the general rule that the guilty party to an illegal contract cannot enforce it or recover on principles of quasi contract benefits he has conferred under the contract. (City Lincoln-Mercury case, <em>supra, </em>p. 276 [13] of 52 Cal.2d.)  But there is no need to reach such an anomalous result where the conditional seller\u2019s illegality consists of a formal, harmless violation of section 2982. That situation can be analogized to the position of the usurer who can recover the amount of the principal loaned, less an offset of the illegal interest which has been paid and \u201ctreble damages\u201d for payments of usurious interest not barred by limitations. <em>(Rice </em>v. <em>Dunlap </em>(1928), 205 Cal. 133, 136 [2] [270 P. 196] ; <em>Shirley </em>v. <em>Britt </em>(1957), 152 Cal. App.2d 666, 670 [4] [313 P.2d 875].) Just as the usurer can enforce the legal portion of his contract, the agreement of the borrower to repay the principal indebtedness, the seller whose violations of the conditional sale contract are merely formal, although he cannot enforce the contract as a whole, can enforce the legal provision for return of the vehicle when the condition is broken.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The Williams case (1956), <em>supra, </em>p. 979 of 140 Cal.App.2d Supp., where the violation was formal, in the course of able and helpful discussion of the problems posed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>by\" the subject legislation, contains the following dictum: The buyer, \u201cif sued for the possession of the automobile or installments accrued under the contract, doubtless could successfully defeat the action without surrendering the car or making the payments due under the contract.\u201d Insofar as this dictum may suggest that a defaulting buyer sued by a seller who has committed merely formal violations of section 2982 can keep the vehicle and pay nothing, it is disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">But this limited enforcibility of this one aspect of the conditional sale contract follows from the general purpose of the statute (which is merely to protect, not to enrich, the buyer in cases of purely formal violations) ; it is a right of the seller and not, as GMAC urges, a right which arises as a result of a bona fide purchase of the contract from the seller.  Such limited right of enforcement passes to the seller\u2019s transferee under familiar rules concerning the assignment of contract rights in nonnegotiable instruments. The assignee of the seller\u2019s contract rights is subject under such rules to defenses and counterclaims of the buyer-obligor against the seller-assignor <em>(Bliss </em>v. <em>California Cooperative Producers </em>(1947), 30 Cal.2d 240, 250 [8] [181 P.2d 369, 170 A.L.R. 1009] ; <em>Western Oil etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Venago Oil Corp. </em>(1933), 218 Cal. 733, 738 [2] [24 P.2d 971, 88 A.L.R. 1271] ; <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Funk </em>(1921), 185 Cal. 347, 352-353 [3, 4, 7] [197 P. 83] ; <em>Pacific Rolling Mill Co. </em>v. <em>English </em>(1897), 118 Cal. 123, 129 [50 P. 383] ; <em>Alpers </em>v. <em>Hunt </em>(1890), 86 Cal. 78, 90 [24 P. 846, 21 Am.St.Rep. 17, 9 L.R.A. 483] ; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 368, 440; Civ. Code, \u00a7 1459), and we find nothing in section 2982 which supports the contention of GMAC that the Legislature intended the law of bona fide purchase, with the cutting off of defenses and equities, to apply to the transfer by the seller of a formally defective contract of conditional sale of an automobile.  GMAC is mistaken in its assertion that subdivision (e) of section 2982, quoted <em>supra, </em>footnote 3, \" specifically provides that a contract [such as the one here, which violates subdivision (a)] shall be enforceable by a bona fide purchaser for value. \u2019 \u2019 Rather, that subdivision expressly applies only to contracts which violate subdivisions (c) and (d). We are not here confronted with the question of the effect of subdivision (e), in cases of substantive violations by the seller, upon the normal rule that \u201cthe assignee of a non-negotiable chose in action . . . , though he buys it for value, and in good, faith, takes it subject to all defenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>which the obligor may have against the assignor . . (2 Williston, Contracts (rev. ed., 1936), p. 1243, \u00a7432.)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">GMAC urges that under <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Muntz Car Co. </em>(1958), <em>supra, </em>50 Cal.2d 681, 683, 688, the buyer can recover from the seller\u2019s assignee only the consideration which he actually paid to the assignee, not the down payment which he made to the seller. This was the result reached in the Lewis case, but the contention made by GMAC here was not there presented or discussed and therefore the case is not authority on this point. <em>(Fricker </em>v. <em>Uddo &amp; Taormina Co. </em>(1957), 48 Cal.2d 696, 701 [6] [312 P.2d 1085] ; <em>In re Tartar </em>(1959), 52 Cal.2d 250, 258 [13] [339 P.2d 553].) [18] Rather, since the assignee \u201cstands in the shoes of the assignor,\u201d to exercise the seller\u2019s limited right to repossess the vehicle because of the buyer\u2019s default, the assignee must restore to the buyer that with which the buyer parted under the illegal contract, including payments which he made to the seller-assignor prior to the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">GMAC further contends that Kyle is in no event entitled to recover because the evidence establishes that the offset to which GMAC is entitled exceeds the consideration with which he parted. The trial court made no findings based upon the above stated restitutive rules of recovery, and the evidence in the record is not such that an appellate court could make such findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">For the reasons above stated, the judgment is reversed with directions to permit Kyle, if he be so advised, to amend his counterclaim to allege, and to permit the parties to introduce evidence of, the amount if any which Kyle may be entitled to recover from GMAC in accord with the foregoing views.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">Gibson, C.
