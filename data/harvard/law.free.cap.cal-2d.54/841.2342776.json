(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">It is to be noted that the word \u201cinjury\u201d is not qualified by the word \u201caccidental,\u201d \u201cbodily,\u201d or any other modifying word or words.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">In <em>Urie </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>337 U.S. 163 [69 S.Ct. 1018, 93 L.Ed. 1282, 11 A.L.R.2d 252], the Supreme Court of the United States rejected the contention that the Liability Act is confined to injury inflicted by accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">The court there interpreted the above-quoted section to include an occupational disease, namely, silicosis. It discussed the principles which govern the interpretation of the word \u201cinjury,\u201d stating at page 180 et seq.: \u201cThe question remains whether silicosis is an \u2018injury\u2019 within the meaning of that term as used in the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act. It is a novel one for this Court. But we think silicosis is within the statute\u2019s coverage when it results from the employer\u2019s negligence. Considerations arising from the breadth of the statutory language, the Act\u2019s humanitarian purposes, its accepted standard of liberal construction in order to accomplish those objects, the absence of anything in the legislative history indicating a congressional intent to require a restricted interpretation or expressly to exclude such occupational disease, and the trend of existing authorities dealing with the question, combine to support this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">\u201cWe recognize of course that, when the statute was enacted, Congress\u2019 attention was focused primarily upon injuries and death resulting from accidents on interstate railroads. Obviously these were the major causes of injury and death result<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>ing from railroad operations. But accidental injuries were not the only ones likely to occur. And nothing in either the language or the legislative history discloses expressly any intent to exclude from the Act\u2019s coverage any injury resulting \u2018in whole or in part from the negligence\u2019 of the carrier. If such an intent can be found, it must be read into the Act by sheer inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">\u201cThe language is as broad as could be framed: \u2018any person suffering injury while he is employed\u2019; \u2018such injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such carrier\u2019; \u2018by reason of any defect or insufficiency, due to its negligence, in its cars, engines, appliances, \u2019 etc. On its face, every injury suffered by any employee while employed by reason of the carrier\u2019s negligence was made compensable. <em>The wording was not restrictive as to </em>the employees covered; the cause of injury, except that it must constitute negligence attributable to the carrier; or <em>the particular kind of injury resulting.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-5\"><em>\u201cTo read into this all-inclusive wording a restriction as to </em>the kinds of employees covered, the degree of negligence required, or the <em>particular sorts of harms inflicted, </em>would be contradictory to the wording, the remedial and humanitarian purpose, and the constant and established course of liberal construction of the Act followed by this Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-6\">\u201c. . . If respondent were right in suggesting that the common law does not recognize occupational disease as a category of compensable injury, he would lend substance to the argument that Congress\u2019 use of the word \u2018injury\u2019 was less broad than the word\u2019s surface connotation indicates. . . . We do not doubt that at \u2018common law the incurring of a disease or harm to health is such a personal wrong as to warrant a recovery if the other elements of liability for tort are present.\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">The court further stated, at page 186 et seq.: \u201c. . . when the employer\u2019s negligence <em>impairs or destroys an employee\u2019s health </em>by requiring him to work under conditions likely to bring about such harmful consequences, the injury to the employee is just as great when it follows, often inevitably, from a carrier\u2019s negligent course pursued over an extended period of time as when it comes with the suddenness of lightning.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">(See also <em>Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>257 F.2d 933, 935 [3]; <em>Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Waterhouse </em>(Tex. Civ. App.), 223 S.W.2d 654, 658 [1]; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number><em>Nuttall </em>v. <em>Beading Company, </em>235 F.2d 546, 549 [3]; <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Baltimore &amp; O. R. Co., </em>137 F.2d 527, 528 [1,2].)</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">It was error to sustain the demurrer to the amended complaint without leave to amend.  It is settled that negligence may be alleged in general terms, which means that it is sufficient to allege that an act was negligently done without stating the particular omission which rendered it negligent. <em>(Brooks </em>v. <em>E. J. Willig Truck Transp. Co., </em>40 Cal.2d 669, 680 [13] [255 P.2d 802]; <em>Rannard </em>v. <em>Lockheed Aircraft Corp., </em>26 Cal.2d 149, 156 [6] et seq. [157 P.2d 1]; <em>Guilliams </em>v. <em>Hollywood Hospital, </em>18 Cal.2d 97, 100 [2] [114 P.2d 1]; <em>Stephenson </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co., </em>102 Cal. 143, 147 [34 P. 618, 36 P. 407].)</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">The allegations in the amended complaint are clearly sufficient to state a cause of action for injuries resulting from the negligence of defendant, in light of the foregoing decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\"><em>Burwell </em>v. <em>Railway Express Agency, Inc., </em>26 F.Supp. 26, a decision of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, is contrary in its holding to the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Urie </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>and therefore should not be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">Gibson, C. J., Traynor, J., Schauer, J., Peters, J., White, J., and Dooling, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
