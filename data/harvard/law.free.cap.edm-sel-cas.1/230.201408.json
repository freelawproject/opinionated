On this precept Rice was arrested, but was immediately discharged from arrest, upon its being discovered that the precept had been delivered to the sheriff after its return day had passed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-11\">Rice then commenced a suit in the Marine Court against Platt, and in his declaration set out the issuing of the precept and the arrest of Rice, adding the averments that the precept was issued without any just cause; that Platt, when he issued it, knew the costs had been paid, and maliciously and wrongfully caused Rice to be arrested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-12\">Platt refused to appear or plead in the Marine Court, and the cause was tried <em>ex parte </em>in that court, Rice appearing there by Niles, as his attorney. On that trial, no evidence of malice was given, but the cause proceeded entirely, as well in the opening of the counsel as in the testimony, on the ground of the false imprisonment. Judgment was rendered for Rice, who immediately swore out an execution, which Niles put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>into the officer\u2019s hands with directions forthwith to levy the same.

But I am referred on the argument to a case <em>(Morris </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>21 Wend. 281), in which it is held that on process issuing out of a court having no jurisdiction, case may be brought, where malice and falsehood are the gravamen of the offense, and the false imprisonment is only an incident. But that case, though it establishes an exception to the general rule, still leaves the question to be determined in this ease as to what the action in the Marine Court actually was.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Neither in the declaration, nor in the other proceedings in that court was the malice the gravamen of the action. There was indeed no malice in the case. It whs a mistake, an oversight, which made the arrest on the precept a false imprisonment, but there was no pretense that it was malicious in fact. The gravamen was the false imprisonment, and it is evident that for that it was that the action was brought, and for that the judgment was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">The action in the Marine Court, though in form ease, was in fact, it seems to me, false imprisonment. The declaration contains all the ingredients of that action, as well as the averments of want of probable cause, necessary to an action for malicious prosecution. Omitting the former, the gravamen would be taken away even from the declaration, and in the action as it was tried, in the opening of the counsel, in the character and nature of the evidence, and the facts disclosed by it, nothing else is to be recognized but a strict and technical false imprisonment, and it requires a good deal of astute<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>ness, even when aided by the ingenuity of counsel, to detect amid this mass of the characteristics of false imprisonment even the features of malicious prosecution, and much more its essential ingredients of malice and falsehood.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">But, if I had any doubts upon this point, I should be inclined to yield the1\" to the decision of the Superior Court, a competent tribunal, which has had before it, on certiorari, the proceedings of the Marine Court, and has pronounced the action to be false imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Besides, it is important to suitors, and to the administration of justice, that the line of demarkation between the jurisdiction of the different courts should be preserved broad and distinct, particularly so as to courts of inferior jurisdiction, to see that they do not, by subtle arguments and refined distinctions, overstep the bounds which the statute has plainly marked out for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">New trial denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
