This cause was tried at the New York Circuit, May 9,1845, and the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for $253.36, subject to the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-13\">On the 9th of March, 1839, plaintiff leased to the defendants portions of the Shakspeare hotel, in New York, for five years from May 1, at a rent of $300. On the 17th of August, 1842, the plaintiff executed a general assignment, under a creditor\u2019s bill, to Allen, the receiver, who received the rents of -the defendants up to February 1, 1843.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-14\">On the 17th of July, 1843, the plaintiff made a specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>assignment of the lease to one Eemsen, for whose benefit this suit is brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-5\">The premises were subject to a mortgage for $25,000, re corded in July, 1837, which was foreclosed in December, 1842. The premises were sold on that foreclosure in February, 1843, and purchased by Eemsen, who immediately after getting his deed, in March, 1843, entered into possession, and has continued in possession ever since.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-6\">The defendants abandoned the premises in February, 1843, and gave up the key to the plaintiff, who said he would keep it for them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-7\">The defendants were not made parties to the foreclosure, and Eemsen, when he came into possession, did not take actual possession of these rooms, but reserved them for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-8\">In April, 1843, Eemsen settled the suit on the creditor\u2019s bill, but no reassignment was made by the receiver, either to the plaintiff or to Eemsen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-9\">The plaintiff claimed to recover in this suit the quarterly rent due in May, August and November, 1843.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b202-10\"><em>Wessel S. Smith &amp; J. Hammond, </em>for defendants, insisted\u2014\u25a0</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-11\">1. The assignment by the plaintiff,, to the receiver, carried with it all the plaintiff\u2019s right to the rent, and of this the defendants had notice; they recognized the receiver as landlord, and paid him the rent. This right has never been re-vested in the plaintiff in any way. (1 R. S. [2d ed.] 739, \u00a7\u00a7 23, 25; <em>Demarest </em>v. <em>Willard, </em>8 Cow. 206; <em>Evertsen </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>2 Wend. 507; 1 Chitty\u2019s Pl. 20, and cases.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-12\">2. The settlement of the creditor\u2019s bill- did not, of itself, effect a reassignment of the lease to the plaintiff; it was conveyed by deed, and could only be revested by deed. Besides, the tenants disclaimed the old landlord, and commenced a fresh holding under the receiver; moreover, the settlement of that suit was not made by him, or on his behalf. <em>(Raynor </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>6 Hill, 469; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Andrew, </em>4 Wend. 474; <em>Same </em>v. <em>Page, </em>id. 585.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>3. The assignment by the plaintiff, to the receiver, the payment of rent, by the defendants to the receiver, was an attornment to him, and the commencement of a fresh holding under him ; and extinguished the relation of landlord and tenant be tween the plaintiff and the defendants. This constitutes a perfect defense to this action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-5\">4. The foreclosure, sale and conveyance, under the decree, extinguished the title of the plaintiff, and the title of the tenants to hold under the lease was also extinguished. (4 J. C. R. 609.) As to right of a mortgagor to give a lease, and the effect of it. <em>(McKircher </em>v. Hawley, 16 J. R. 292; <em>King </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>8 Wend. 584; Comyn on Landlord and Tenant, 29, and cases; <em>The Fitchburg Manuf'g Co. </em>v. <em>Melien, </em>257, \u2020 269.) Effect of master\u2019s deed. <em>(Fuller </em>v. <em>Van Geesen, </em>4 Hill, 171; 2 R. S. 119, \u00a7 164.) From what time purchaser entitled to possession, and that there can be no apportionment of rent. (Sugden on Estates, 50; 1 Fonblanque\u2019s Equity, 383; <em>Tule </em>v. <em>Tule, </em>24 Wend. 76.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-6\">5. The assignment of the lease by the plaintiff, to Remsen, does not give him any greater right than the plaintiff had when it was made. This, we have shown, was nothing, his whole title having been extinguished, not only by the assignment to the receiver, but also by the foreclosure and sale; and the purchase, of itself, carried with it no title to the rent. <em>(Siniers </em>v. <em>Saltus, </em>2 Legal Observer, p. 180; <em>Nellis </em>v. <em>Lathrop), </em>22 Wend. 121.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-7\">6. Besides, the assignment of the lease to Remsen carried with it the whole title of the plaintiff (if any he had), and with it all the right to the rent, also; and this can be recovered in the name of the assignee, only, if at all. But it cannot be recovered at all, the tenants not having occupied the premises during any \u00abportion of the time for which rent is claimed, or since the foreclosure. Besides, there is no privity, either of contract or estate, between the lessees and the purchaser at the foreclosure sale. <em>(See </em>cases on first point; Comyn on Landlord and Tenant, 296; <em>King </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>8 Wend. 584; <em>McKircher </em>v. <em>Hawley, </em>16 J. R. 289; 15 Mass. 257; 2 R. S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>119, \u00a7 164; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Roland, </em>6 Wend. 666; <em>Siniers </em>v. <em>Saltus, supra; McBride </em>v. <em>Brundage, supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-5\">7. The foreclosure and sale was a determination of the lease, and, together with the master\u2019s deed, and the entry of the purchase under it, amounted to an <em>eviction. </em>Besides, the tenants refused to attorn, and abandoned the premises, as they had a right to do. As to what is a determination of lease. (15 Mass. 257, <em>supra; </em>1 Bos. &amp; P. 531; 2 Kinne\u2019s Law Comp. 257, and cases. What is an eviction. <em>(Hunt </em>v. <em>Amidon, </em>4 Hill, 345-8; <em>Dyett </em>v. <em>Pendleton, </em>8 Cow. 727; 3 Kent\u2019s Com. 464, and cases; Cro. J. 204.) Eviction may be given in evidence under general issue. (1 Chitty, 517; 8 J. R. 85.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-6\">8. But it is not necessary, in order to maintain this defense, to show an eviction. It is enough that the title under which the defendants entered has expired. (1 Cowen\u2019s Treatise [2d ed.] 423, and cases; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>5 Cow. 123; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Roland, </em>6 Wend. 666; <em>Nellis </em>v. <em>Lathrop, </em>22 id. 121; 1 Hilliard\u2019s Ab. 142, \u00a7 82,144, \u00a7 89; <em>England </em>v. <em>Slade, </em>6 T. R. 682; <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>8 id. 487; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>4 B &amp; C. 402.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-7\">9. The above is a complete and perfect defense to this action, and the defendants are entitled to a verdict under the stipulations in the case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b204-8\"><em>A. Grist, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-9\">1. The suit is brought by Abraham A. Eemsen, the assignee of the lease, and the owner of the premises in question; and \u25a0 the suit- is rightly brought by said plaintiff, in the name of Anderson, by whom the lease was given, and to whom the defendants covenanted to pay the rent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-11\">2. The defendants entered into possession under the lease, and are therefore bound to pay rent for the whole term, although they may have ceased to occupy the premises.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-12\">3. The proceedings and sale in the foreclosure suit do not impair the plaintiff\u2019s' right to recover. The defendants were ' not parties to such suit, and were not bound by such proceed- .. ings. They were not disturbed in the possession, and they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>might at all times have used and occupied the premises during the continuance of the lease.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-5\">4. The creditor\u2019s bill suit having been settled, no reassignment of the lease was necessary. At all events, the defendants cannot avail themselves of such objection. <em>(Evertsen </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>2 Wend. 512.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-6\">5. The verdict is right, and judgment should be given for the plaintiff.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b205-7\">\n<em>The Circuit Judge:</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"ADA\">There are three objections made to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery. One growing out of the assignment to the receiver, one out of the assignment to Remsen, and one out of the foreclosure and sale under the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">The assignment to Remsen merely conveys the rents, while the assignment to the receiver conveys the reversion, as well as the rents.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">As to the assignment to the receiver, that is to be regarded as a mortgage, and was satisfied before the rent became due which is in controversy in this suit. It was an assignment of so much of Anderson\u2019s property as would be sufficient to pay his creditor\u2019s debt and costs; and by the receiver\u2019s collections, and the arrangement made by Remsen, in April, 1843, neither the creditor nor the receiver had any farther claim. No reassignment was necessary, because its force was spent by its purposes having been fully answered. <em>(Evertsen </em>v. Sawyer, 2 Wend. 509.)</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">By the foreclosure of the mortgage, in 1842, and by Rem-sen\u2019s purchase on that foreclosure, in March, 1843, Remsen became seized of all the plaintiff\u2019s title in the premises. He thus became the assignee of the reversion, which, before that, had been in the plaintiff. The provisions of our Revised Statutes (1 R. S. 747, \u00a7 23) from that moment apply to him, and he, as the grantee of the demised premises, or of the reversion thereof, had the same remedies, by action, distress, or otherwise, for the recovery of any rent, as the grantor or lessor might have had if the reversion had remained in him. And .if he could, in his own name, maintain an action for the rent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>the plaintiff could not. Otherwise, the tenant would be liable to two actions for the same rent. (Taylor\u2019s Landlord and Tenant, 217; <em>Harbeck </em>v. <em>Sylvester, 13 </em>Wend. 608.)</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">These remarks apply to all the three quarters\u2019 rent now sought to be recovered. But in regard to the two quarters that became due in August and November, the case is still stronger, for, before they accrued, Bemsen became the assignee of the lease, also) and was thus seized of all the estate which the plaintiff had originally had in the premises. As to those two quarters, Bemsen was not only the grantee of the demised premises, and of the reversion thereof, but he was the assignee of the rents, also, and as such, under our statute, had his remedy by action for the non-payment of the rent, the same as his grantor might have had if the reversion had remained in him.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Upon this view of the case there must be judgment for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
