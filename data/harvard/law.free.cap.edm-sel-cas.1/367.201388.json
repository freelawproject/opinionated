The defendant, Tufts, professing to act as a produce broker, purchased the load for the defendant, Yan Alstyne, representing him to be responsible, and they were accordingly delivered to the defendant, Roberts, who professed to act as Yan Alstyne\u2019s clerk, and who sold them again, in parcels, as fast as they were delivered. After the delivery, the master called for payment in vain, and found that the defendants, Yan Alstyne and Roberts, were insolvent, and had, as soon as they received the avails of the oats, gone to a gambling house and lost the whole of it at two sittings. Yan Alstyne declared himself able to pay for the oats in thirty and sixty days, and insisted upon the master\u2019s taking his notes, which he did. As soon as the plaintiffs were made acquainted with the transaction, they rescinded the contract of sale, and instituted this suit, charging a conspiracy to defraud upon all the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-11\">At the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence they produced the notes which had been given to the master, proved that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>had never negotiated, nor in any manner used them, and offered at the trial to cancel them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b368-5\"><em>A. L. Jordan, </em>for defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZv\">moved for a nonsuit, on the ground that the plaintiffs had not 'ffuly rescinded the contract of sale, because they had not restored the defendants to their former condition, but, on the contrary, had kept the notes in their possession until after this suit was brought. He insisted that the plaintiffs, in order to maintain this action, ought to have returned the notes immediately on rescinding the contract of sale, and that it was not enough for them to offer now, on the trial, to cancel them. He cited <em>Masson </em>v. <em>Bovet </em>(1 Denio, 69).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b368-6\">\n<em>H. P. Hastings, contra,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXO\">insisted that the plaintiffs had sufficiently signified their election to waive the contract, and go for the tort, by bringing their action, and that their keeping the notes, as evidence of the value of the goods sold, was no evidence that the plaintiffs had elected to stand by the contract. He cited 22 Pick. 18.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b368-7\">\n<em>The Circuit Judge:</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AFO\">Whether the plaintiffs\u2019 retaining the notes after they discovered the fraud, was an election to abide by the contract, and a waiver of their right to rescind, must depend upon circumstances. If they had negotiated them or attempted to enforce the payment of them, it might well be questioned whether they had not concluded themselves and waived the tort. But the mere fact of retaining possession of the notes, unaccompanied by any other act showing an election, and especially when attended by other circumstances, clearly showing that the plaintiffs intended to waive the contract, would not conclude the plaintiffs against bringing their action in the case. It was very common, where a party sought to recover on the original cause of action, to produce on the trial the notes given, and cancel them there, and that had always been held sufficient. It would be giving the prepetrator of a fraud an undue advantage, if he had in all cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>the power of involving his victim in the difficulty, and sometimes the impracticability of finding him and tendering him back his void and worthless securities. It would be enough to produce and cancel them on the trial, if in other regards the plaintiff had already signified his election to waive the contract and go for the tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Motion denied. Verdict for plaintiffs, $750.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">[This case was affirmed in the Supreme Court. 6 Barb. R. 432.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
