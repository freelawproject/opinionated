Making himself or his representative liable to be called on by the mortgagee, is not sufficient, of itself, to charge the personal estate in relief of the lands.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-8\">The bill was filed by the complainant, heir-at-law oi Eobcrt McLenahan, deceased, against his administrator and widow, to compel the administrator to pay a mortgage debt out of the personal estate of the intestate, in exoneration of mortgaged lands descended to the complainant, and to restrain him from settling his final account and distributing the estate until such payment shall have been made. The intestate had purchased the lands subject to the mortgage in question, but had not expressly assumed or covenanted to pay the mortgage by the deed to him, which only recited that the land was conveyed subject to the mortgage. The amount of the mortgage money had been retained by him from the consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-9\">Answers were filed by the widow and administrator, and the cause was heard on a motion to dissolve the injunction granted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b113-10\"><em>Mr. SMrpma/n, </em>for Sarah Ann McLenahan, in support of the motion, contended:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-11\">That it was a settled principle, that where lands descended, subject to a mortgage debt not contracted by the intestate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>but which was a lien on the lands when he acquired the title, the lands descended <em>cum onere </em>to the heir, and that he was not entitled to have the personal estate applied to pay the debt, in exoneration of the real.

Where lands subject to a mortgage debt, not created by the decedent, descend or are devised, the heir or devisee takes them <em>eum onere, </em>and is not entitled to have the debt paid out of the personal estate, unless the decedent has directly assumed the debt, intending to make it a charge on his personal estate, or shall have so directed expressly by his will. It is not enough that he has assumed to pay the debt, or has rendered himself liable to be called on directly by the creditor to pay it.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">The authorities, ancient and modern, are uniform on these principles, although there is some difference as to what shall show the intention to assume the mortgage debt as a primary lien on the purchaser and his personal estate. The case of <em>Belvidere </em>v. <em>Rockfort, </em>decided in the house of lords, and reported in 6 <em>Bro. P. C. </em>520, goes the furthest in favor of the heir. This case falls far short of that. In that, there was a covenant in the deed that the grantee would pay off the mortgage, \u201c out of the consideration <em>money </em>in this present deed expressed.\u201d and even that case was doubted and disapproved by Lord Thurlow.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">The authorities are collected in 2 <em>Jarman on Wills, p. </em>546, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number><em>&amp;c., </em>and are thoroughly reviewed and discriminated by Chancellor Kent, in <em>Cumberland </em>v. <em>Codrington, </em>3 <em>Johns. C. R. </em>229, which the great learning and ability of that distinguished jurist, will always make a leading case on this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The decisions in New Jersey, relied upon for the complainant, do not affect the application of the rule as established in England, in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">In many of the English cases referred to, in which the personalty was held not to be liable to the debt, in discharge of the land, there were, covenants to pay the debt, and the ancestor, or his personal representatives, could have been compelled to pay it. <em>Shafto </em>v. Shafto, 1 <em>P. W. </em>664, <em>note; Tankerville </em>v. <em>Fawcet, </em>2 <em>Bro. Ch. Cas. </em>57; <em>Tweddell </em>v. <em>Tweddell, Ibid. </em>101; <em>Billinghurst </em>v. <em>Walker, Ibid. </em>604; <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>5 <em>Ves. </em>534.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">The result at which Chancellor Kent arrives is this: <em>&lt;e </em>There must be a direct communication and contract with the mortgagee, <em>and even that is not enough, </em>unless the dealing with the mortgagee be of such a nature as to afford decided evidence of an <em>intention </em>to shift the primary obligation from the real to the personal fund.\u201d 3 <em>Johns. C. R. </em>262.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">There is, in this case, no contract with the mortgagee, and nothing to show an intention to shift the primaiy obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">The proposed amendment to the bill would not affect the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">I am of opinion that the injunction should be dissolved, and the bill dismissed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
