The Board rejected both contentions and, because its jurisdiction over resignations is limited to involuntary ones, dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction. We affirm and, since we conclude that the appeal is frivolous, assess costs and attorney\u2019s fees against the petitioner and his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">On June 1, 1982, the petitioner, an employee of the Bonneville Power Administration, made a telephone call to his supervisor, Mr. Miller. Prior thereto, the petitioner had been the subject of several disciplinary actions by his agency. During the preceding 4 months, Miller had several conversations with the petitioner \u201cconcerning his job performance\u201d and in which Miller told him he \u201chad to improve his performance and \u2018[alternatively, he could become subject to removal or he could resign.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">There was a sharp disagreement in the testimony before the presiding official over what was said in that telephone conversation. The presiding official stated that Mr. Miller testified that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-8\">[the petitioner] informed him that he had talked at length with his wife about his problems at Bonneville, and had decided to resign. According to Mr. Miller, [the petitioner] wanted to resign immediately so the processing of the return of his retirement monies could commence. [The petitioner] states that this conversation never took place and instead maintains that Mr. Miller informed him that he had <em>already </em>processed his \u201cresignation\u201d and there was nothing he could do to change the situation. (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">The presiding official discussed in detail the parties\u2019 different versions of that conversation and other testimony relating to the petitioner\u2019s resignation, as well as the factors relating to the credibility of the witnesses. After a full review of the evidence, the presiding official stated that \u201cto believe\u201d the petitioner\u2019s \u201cstory,\u201d the testimony of Miller and three other agency witnesses \u201cwould have to be inaccurate or an outright fabrication. I find no basis to make such a finding.\u201d The presiding official then found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-11\">After carefully viewing the demeanor of each witness during the hearing, I find Mr. Miller\u2019s testimony credible concerning his telephone conversation with [the petitioner] on June 1, 1982. I also find that by [petitioner\u2019s] own admission, Mr. Miller made efforts to help him ... and I do not credit [petitioner\u2019s] theory that Mr. Miller processed his resignation in order to avoid going through the formal procedures of actually terminating [the petitioner].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-12\">Thus, based on the documents submitted, the testimony of all the witnesses, and the respective credibility of each of these witnesses, I find [the petitioner] orally resigned on June 1, 1982, and the effective date of his resignation was June 1, 1982. I also find that [the petitioner] subsequently tried to retract his resignation on June <em>1, </em>1982. However, since [petitioner\u2019s] resignation was already effected, he could not revoke it at his option. (Record reference omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-13\">The Board granted a petition to review and affirmed the initial decision of the presiding official with one modification. The presiding official had concluded that the only question was whether the petitioner had resigned on June 1, 1982, and that the voluntariness of the resignation was not in issue. The Board held that voluntariness was an issue in the ease. It then ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYO\">We further find, however, that [the petitioner] has not carried his burden of establishing that the resignation was involuntary. Although the record indicates that [petitioner\u2019s] supervisor informed him that the agency would probably propose [petitioner\u2019s] termination if he did not resign, this fact, standing alone does not constitute duress or coercion sufficient to render the resignation involuntary____ The fact that appellant was faced with two unpleasant alternatives does not make the action taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>involuntary____ Thus, we conclude that the presiding official\u2019s failure to rule on this issue did not prejudice appellant\u2019s substantive rights and did not, therefore, constitute harmful adjudicatory error____ Therefore, we find no basis to disturb the presiding official\u2019s finding that the resignation action was not within the Board\u2019s jurisdiction. (Citations and record references omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">In his appeal to this court, the petitioner challenges the Board\u2019s decision on two grounds: (A) the Board improperly determined on the record that the petitioner voluntarily resigned on June 1, 1982; and (B) the Board failed to \u201cgive any weight\u201d to the agency\u2019s failure to comply with \u201ccertain rules set forth in the Federal Personnel Manual\u201d dealing with resignations.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">A. The determination of the credibility of the witnesses is within the discretion of the presiding official who heard their testimony and saw their demeanor. <em>Brewer v. United States Postal Service, </em>227 Ct.Cl. 276, 647 F.2d 1093, 1096 (1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1144, 102 S.Ct. 1005, 71 L.Ed.2d 296 (1982). Here the presiding official credited the testimony of the agency witnesses and rejected the conflicting testimony of the petitioner. That choice was one the presiding official was fully justified in making on this record. The petitioner has given no convincing reason for us to reject those credibility determinations, and we see no basis for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">At oral argument, petitioner admitted that if we accept the presiding official\u2019s credibility determinations, which we do, there is no basis for rejecting the Board\u2019s finding that the petitioner voluntarily resigned on June 1, 1982. Moreover, as the Board pointed out, the fact that the petitioner was faced with the probability that the agency would remove him unless he resigned, did not make his resignation involuntary. <em>See Christie v. United States, </em>207 Ct.Cl. 333, 518 F.2d 584, 589 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">B. The petitioner argues that the Board improperly failed to give sufficient weight to provisions of the Federal Personnel Manual, which the agency did not follow, stating (1) that an employee who announces his resignation \u201cshould\u201d be asked to submit a detailed written resignation; (2) that if an employee declines to submit a written resignation, the oral resignation should be accepted, \u201cpreferably\u201d in the presence of witnesses, and that the official receiving the oral resignation \u201cshould\u201d record and place in the employee\u2019s personnel folder data concerning the resignation, together with any appropriate statements of the witnesses; and (3) whether the resignation is written or oral, reasons for it \u201cshould\u201d be obtained whenever possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">The presiding official held that \u201c[tjhese guidelines suggest procedures to be utilized by an agency to effect a voluntary resignation,\u201d and \u201care clearly precatory, not mandatory.\u201d The Board agreed. At oral argument the petitioner himself admitted that these provisions are precatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">The provisions are intended to aid government officials in handling resignations by suggesting procedures to be followed that will avoid or minimize subsequent disputes concerning the resignation and to strengthen the government\u2019s case in any litigation regarding it. They do not create any rights in an employee, and the government\u2019s failure to observe the suggestions does not provide a basis for challenging the government\u2019s acceptance of an oral resignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-13\">Although at oral argument the petitioner contended that the government\u2019s nonobservance of these provisions weakened the testimony of the agency witnesses, it provided no basis for that claim, and we cannot see any. The determination by the presiding official of which witness\u2019s testimony to accept depended upon his evaluation of the witness\u2019s credibility in light of all the evidence, not upon whether the government followed the suggestions in the Federal Personnel Manual for the preferred manner of handling resignations.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The utter lack of any merit to the petitioner\u2019s arguments on appeal ineluctably leads to the conclusion that this appeal is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">As we recently reiterated, and have made clear to litigants and their attorneys, the prosecution of a frivolous appeal will result in the imposition of costs and attorney\u2019s fees against the offending par- . ties and their attorneys. <em>Moir v. Department of the Treasury, </em>754 F.2d 341 (1985). Accordingly, we assess costs and attorney\u2019s fees of five hundred dollars ($500) in favor of the government, jointly and severally against Mr. Griessenauer and his attorney, Robert J. Slade.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
