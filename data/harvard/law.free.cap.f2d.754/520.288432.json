Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977), we reverse the decision of the district court and remand this proceeding to that court for a determination of whether Carrier can successfully meet the \u201ccause\u201d requirement of <em>Wainwright, </em>and if so, whether he can then satisfy the \u201cprejudice\u201d prong of the <em>Wainwright </em>exception to procedural bar. The basis for our ruling is adequately set forth in the panel majority opinion and need not be repeated here. <em>Carrier v. Hutto, </em>724 F.2d 396 (4th Cir. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">Judge Russell, Judge Widener, Judge Hall, and Judge Chapman dissent, believing that the district court should be affirmed because of Carrier\u2019s failure to exhaust his state remedies and his failure to satisfy the cause and prejudice requirements of <em>Wainwright </em>as articulated by Judge Hall in his dissenting opinion, 724 F.2d at 403.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
