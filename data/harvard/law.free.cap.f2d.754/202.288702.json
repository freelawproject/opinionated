Upon consideration of the Motion filed by counsel for the defendant-appellee, the Court has decided to issue the decision as an opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b279-8\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">Plaintiff-appellant Henry Anderson filed a petition in federal district court under the Railway Labor Act seeking review of the Public Law Board\u2019s award which upheld his termination of employment with defendant National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak). We affirm the district court\u2019s decision to grant defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">Plaintiff was employed by Amtrak as a ticket clerk in Chicago. On July 5, 1978, Mr. George, who was working next to plaintiff, reported that $3,000.00 in cash was missing. Plaintiff and all employees working that evening took a polygraph examination, but plaintiff was the only employee who failed the examination. Defendant asked plaintiff and Mr. George to undergo a second polygraph examination, and, again, only plaintiff failed the test. Pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, an investigatory hearing was conducted, during which plaintiff testified and was afforded the opportunity to present witnesses. The hearing officer concluded that plaintiff should be dismissed. This decision to dismiss was upheld throughout the appeals process provided under the collective bargaining agreement. Pursuant to the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 <em>et seq., </em>plaintiff then appealed to Public Law Board No. 2296. After oral arguments and extensive briefing, the Board upheld the plaintiff\u2019s dismissal. Plaintiff then filed the present petition in federal district court seeking reversal of the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-16\">The scope of judicial review of Public Law Board decisions is \u201camong the narrowest known to the law.\u201d <em>Union Pacific Railroad v. Sheehan, </em>439 U.S. 89, 91, 99 S.Ct. 399, 401, 58 L.Ed.2d 354 (1978). Judicial review is limited to three specific areas: (1) failure of the Board to comply with the requirements of the Railway Labor Act, (2) failure of the Board to confine itself to matters within the scope of its jurisdiction, and (3) fraud or corruption. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 153 First (q). If plaintiff\u2019s objections do not fall within any of these three categories, the findings and order of the Board are conclusive and may not be set aside. <em>Id. See also Sheehan, </em>439 U.S. at 93, 99 S.Ct. at 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-17\">Plaintiff claims that the Board\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, and not supported by substantial evidence. In so doing, plaintiff makes a colorable claim that the Board\u2019s decision is outside the scope of the Board\u2019s jurisdiction, but to succeed on this claim, plaintiff must show that the Board\u2019s decision is without foundation in reason or fact, <em>Laday v. Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, </em>422 F.2d 1168, 1171 (7th Cir.1970), or wholly baseless and without reason, <em>Gunther v. San Diego &amp; Arizona Eastern Railway, </em>382 U.S. 257, 261, 86 S.Ct. 368, 370, 15 L.Ed.2d 308 (1965). The decision of the Board clearly cannot be described as lacking a foundation in reason or fact for it was founded in both.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>may disagree that the evidence underlying the Board\u2019s decision is adequate, the sufficiency of the evidence comprising the foundation of the Board\u2019s decision is not reviewable. The Board\u2019s determination is conclusive. <em>Kotakis v. Elgin, Joliet &amp; Eastern Railway, </em>520 F.2d 570 (7th Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 1016, 96 S.Ct. 451, 46 L.Ed.2d 388 (1975); <em>Edwards v. St. Louis-San Francisco Railroad, </em>361 F.2d 946 (7th Cir.1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Plaintiff also argued that Amtrak violated his fifth amendment due process rights in terminating his employment. According to plaintiff, Amtrak\u2019s actions constitute governmental action for due process purposes because of the government\u2019s \u201ctotal and pervasive control\u201d over Amtrak. Amtrak is intertwined with the government to a certain extent. Amtrak was established by an act of Congress, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 541, and the federal government is represented on Amtrak\u2019s nine-member board by six members who can control the appointment of a seventh member, the president of the corporation. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 543. Amtrak is defined as a \u201cmixed ownership Government corporation\u201d and, therefore, must comply with federal audit and reporting requirements. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9101(2)(A), 9105(a)(1)(B). Congress, however, explicitly declared that Amtrak is not a governmental agency or establishment. Rather, Amtrak is a for-profit corporation chartered under the District of Columbia Business Corporation Act. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 541. In addition, Amtrak is striving to minimize federal subsidies. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 501a(l) &amp; (14). Amtrak\u2019s daily operation is not subject to close government supervision; nor are Amtrak\u2019s daily affairs conducted by federal employees. <em>Ehm v. National Railroad Passenger Corp., </em>732 F.2d 1250 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">The ties between Amtrak and the federal government do not warrant a finding of governmental action for purposes of the fifth amendment. The Supreme Court considered an argument similar to plaintiff\u2019s in <em>Blum v. Yaretsky, </em>457 U.S. 991, 102 S.Ct. 2777, 73 L.Ed.2d 534 (1982).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Blum, </em>the plaintiff contended that the state was a joint participant in a nursing home\u2019s activities because the state subsidized the operating and capital costs of the nursing home, paid 90% of patient medical expenses, and licensed the nursing home. There was no state action because the court was unable to find a nexus between the challenged actions of the defendant and the state\u2019s regulation and subsidization. <em>Id. </em>at 1010-11, 102 S.Ct. at 2789. This requirement of a nexus between the state and the challenged activity of the regulated entity is based upon considerations of fairness so as \u201cto assure that constitutional standards are invoked only when it can be said that the state is <em>responsible </em>for the specific conduct of which the plaintiff complains.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1004, 102 S.Ct. at 2786 (emphasis in original). <em>See Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. 345, 95 S.Ct. 449, 42 L.Ed.2d 477 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">Plaintiff in the instant case has not alleged any nexus between the federal government\u2019s involvement with Amtrak and Amtrak\u2019s decision to terminate plaintiff. Plaintiff does not suggest that the government was responsible for the alleged inadequate investigation conducted by Amtrak or his termination. There is no allegation that the government is involved with Amtrak\u2019s personnel policies or decisions. <em>Cf. Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, </em>457 U.S. 830, 102 S.Ct. 2764, 73 L.Ed.2d 418 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>(1982) (decisions to discharge employees were not compelled or even influenced by any state regulation). The existence of a relationship, without more, is insufficient to support a finding of governmental action and, therefore, Amtrak was not required to provide fifth amendment due process protection to plaintiff.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Indeed, numerous district courts agree. <em>See, e.g., Kimbrough v. National Railroad Passenger Corp., </em>549 F.Supp. 169 (M.D.Ala.1982); <em>Chaney v. National Railroad Passenger Corp., </em>No. 82-339, slip. op. at 7 (D.Del. Feb. 17, 1983); <em>Moorhead v. National Railroad Passenger Corp., </em>No. 81-1579 (D.D.C. March 9, 1982). <em>Accord Ehm v. National Railroad Passenger Corp., </em>732 F.2d 1250 (5th Cir.1984) (Amtrak is not a government-controlled corporation within the meaning of the Privacy Act); <em>Sentner v. Amtrak, </em>540 F.Supp. 557 (D.N.J.1982) (Amtrak is not an instrumentality of the government for purposes of liability for punitive damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Plaintiffs final claim alleged that Amtrak\u2019s initial investigatory hearing violated the collective bargaining agreement\u2019s requirement of a fair and impartial hearing because his attorney was not able to participate, witnesses did not testify under oath, and the investigation involved more than one suspect. The Board found that \u201c[t]he Carrier ... proceeded in an orderly manner, and conducted the investigation within the provisions of the Agreement.\u201d The meaning of the contractual provision that required a \u201cfair and impartial hearing\u201d is not for this court to decide. We are bound by the Board\u2019s interpretation of the agreement. <em>Kotakis v. Elgin, Joliet &amp; Eastern Railway, </em>520 F.2d 570 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 1016, 96 S.Ct. 451, 46 L.Ed.2d 388 (1975); <em>Edwards v. St. Louis-San Francisco Railroad, </em>361 F.2d 946 (7th Cir.1966).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Accordingly, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-11\">. The Board reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-12\">The Carrier, we are satisfied, proceeded in an orderly manner, and conducted the investigation within the provisions of the Agreement. At the conclusion, it found that Claimant had responsibility in the disappearance of the funds. The Carrier\u2019s officers must have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number><em>given </em>great weight to the polygraph tests\u2014 both administered by independent agencies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">Carrier\u2019s officials must have concluded that the Claimant\u2019s failure to pass the tests, indeed his apparent strong showing of a lack of truthfulness in the matter, was sufficient to disqualify him from handling Carrier\u2019s funds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">We cannot find that this was an arbitrary or capricious action.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b281-17\">. Although plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleged that the Board\u2019s order violated his fifth amendment due process rights, plaintiff did not press this either in the district court or on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b280-11\">. Although <em>Blum </em>discussed the standard for finding state governmental action . under the fourteenth amendment, the standard for finding federal governmental action under the fifth amendment is the same. <em>Gerena v. Puerto Rico Legal Servs., </em>697 F.2d 447 (1st Cir.1983); <em>Warren v. Governmental National Mortgage Assoc., </em>611 F.2d 1229, 1232 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 847, 101 S.Ct. 133, 66 L.Ed.2d 57 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b281-18\">. Plaintiff also argued on appeal that defendant violated section 7 Third of the Railway Labor Act,-45 U.S.C. \u00a7 157 Third. This section requires a board of arbitration to provide the parties with a full and fair hearing. Although this argument fails because plaintiff failed to raise the issue in the district court, this argument also is without merit because section 7 does not apply to Public Law Boards. <em>Compare </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 153 (Adjustment Boards and Public Law Boards) <em>with </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 157 (Arbitration Boards).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
