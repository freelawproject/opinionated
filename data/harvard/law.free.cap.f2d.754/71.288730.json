McLaughlin, <em>J., </em>granting motions of plaintiff LeSportsac, Inc., for a preliminary injunction. The orders enjoin K mart from marketing certain bags, which the court found to contain a combination of mark and dress confusingly similar to that used by plaintiff. For reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-19\">LeSportsac commenced this action. on June 22, 1984, alleging that K mart had violated various federal laws as well as New York State statutes and common law in selling certain bags under the trade name \u201cdi paris sac.\u201d On July 11, 1984, the district court, relying chiefly on the claim of unregistered trademark infringement under \u00a7 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a), granted LeSportsac\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction after hearing testimony from four witnesses and receiving other evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By order dated July 13, 1984, the court enjoined K mart from selling four specific bags (the \u201clightweight bags\u201d) and directed LeSportsac to post an injunction bond of $250,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-20\">In August, K mart moved to modify the July 13 order to permit K mart to sell its bags with a square hangtag, approximately three and one-half inches on each side, stating prominently:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>di paris sac</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-4\">SOLD EXCLUSIVELY AT AND MADE EXCLUSIVELY FOR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">K mart</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">LeSportsac cross-moved to broaden the injunction to include a fifth K mart bag, described by the parties and the district court as the \u201cheavyweight knapsack.\u201d In a Memorandum and Order dated September 18, 1984, the district court denied K mart\u2019s motion to modify the injunction, granted LeSportsac\u2019s motion to broaden the injunction to include the heavyweight knapsack and increased the injunction bond to $400,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">LeSportsac has been selling a distinctive, highly successful line of lightweight luggage and bags since 1976. In that period, LeSportsac has sold approximately 5,000,-000 bags \u2014 for over $50,000,000 \u2014 both in the United States and abroad. The bags, available in a variety of colors, are made of parachute nylon and trimmed in cotton carpet tape with matching cotton-webbing straps. The zippers used to open and close the bags are color coordinated with the bags themselves, and usually are pulled with hollow rectangular metal sliders. Many bags also have separate zippered compartments that employ the same, hollow rectangular sliders.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">The LeSportsac line also features the repetitive printing of the LeSportsac logo on the trim of each bag. The distinctive logo consists of a solidly colored circle, followed by the name \u201cLeSportsac\u201d in the same color as the bag, both enclosed within an elongated ellipse of the same color as the circle. The name, the circle and the ellipse are all set against an elliptical background that contrasts with the color of the bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">K mart apparently purchased its allegedly infringing line of bags in the Far East in late 1983; the bags were first offered for sale early in 1984. The K mart bags are strikingly similar to those manufactured and sold by LeSportsac. Four of the five allegedly offending bags (the lightweight bags) are also made of parachute nylon and trimmed in cotton tape, have cotton handles in the same color as the trim and are equipped with color-coordinated zippers and hollow rectangular metal zipper pulls. K mart sells these bags under the name \u201cdi paris sac.\u201d The di paris sac logo is quite similar to that of LeSportsac in both design and color combinations. The name, which is in the same color as the bag, is followed by an Eiffel Tower design; both are enclosed within an elongated ellipse. The name, the Eiffel Tower design and the ellipse are all set against the elliptical background, which contrasts with the color of the bag. K mart apparently admits that these four bags were copied from LeSportsac bags.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">The fifth bag \u2014 the heavyweight knapsack \u2014 is somewhat less similar to its LeSportsac counterpart than are the other four. It is made of heavier nylon and uses different webbing for its carrying straps. In addition, the \u201cdi paris sac\u201d logo is slightly different from that on the other four K mart bags.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"AmQ\">A party seeking a preliminary injunction in this circuit must establish both possible irreparable injury and either (1) a likelihood of success on the merits or (2) sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly in the movant\u2019s favor. <em>See, e.g., Arthur Guinness &amp; Sons, PLC v. Sterling Publishing Co., </em>732 F.2d 1095, 1099 (2d Cir. 1984); <em>Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, Inc. v. Pussycat Cinema, Ltd., </em>604 F.2d 200, 206-07 (2d Cir.1979). The standard of review on appeal to this court is whether issuance of the preliminary injunction, in light of the applicable legal standards, constituted an abuse of discretion. <em>Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., </em>422 U.S. 922, 931-32, 95 S.Ct. 2561, 2567-68, 45 L.Ed.2d 648 (1975). The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d is capable of widely varying interpretations, ranging, as Judge Friendly has recently pointed out, \u201cfrom ones that would require the appellate court to come close to finding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>trial court had taken leave of its senses to others which differ from the definition of error by only the slightest nuance, with numerous variations between the extremes.\u201d <em>See </em>Friendly, Indiscretion About Discretion, 31 Emory L.J. 747, 763 (1982); <em>see also </em>Rosenberg, Judicial Discretion of the Trial Court, Viewed from Above, 22 Syracuse L.Rev. 635, 639 (1971). In the remainder of this opinion, we will indicate the type of scrutiny we are applying to the various aspects of the decision of the district court. <em>Cf. Coca-Cola Co. v. Tropicana Products, Inc., </em>690 F.2d 312, 315-16 (2d Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> establishes a federal law of unfair competition by providing a statutory remedy to a party injured by a competitor\u2019s \u201cfalse designation of origin\u201d of its product, whether or not the aggrieved party has a federally registered trademark. <em>See, e.g., Ives Laboratories, Inc. v. Darby Drug Co., </em>601 F.2d 631, 641 (2d Cir.1979). The \u201ctrade dress\u201d of a product, which \u201cinvolves the total image of a product and may include features such as size, shape, color or color combinations, texture, [or] graphics,\u201d <em>John H. Harland Co. v. Clarke Checks, Inc., </em>711 F.2d 966, 980 (11th Cir. 1983), may become an unregistered trademark eligible for protection under \u00a7 43(a) if it is nonfunctional and has acquired a secondary meaning in the marketplace by which it is identified with its producer or source. <em>See, e.g., Ives Laboratories, supra, </em>601 F.2d at 642-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Most trade dress infringement actions involve the packaging or labeling of goods. <em>See </em>1 J.T. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition \u00a7 8:1 (2d ed. 1984). Recently, however, we have recognized that the design of a product itself may function as its packaging, serving to distinguish it from other products, and hence be protectable trade dress under \u00a7 43(a). <em>See, e.g., Warner Bros., Inc. v. Gay Toys, Inc., </em>658 F.2d 76 (2d Cir.1981) (distinctive color and symbols on toy car); <em>Harlequin Enterprises Ltd. v. Gulf &amp; Western Corp., </em>644 F.2d 946 (2d Cir.1981) (distinctive paperback book covers). To maintain an action for trade dress infringement, having established an unregistered trademark in that dress, \u201ca plaintiff must allege that a competitor\u2019s product design or packaging is likely to confuse consumers as to the product source \u2014 such a design or packaging falsely designates its origin.\u201d <em>20th Century Wear, Inc. v. Sanmark-Stardust Inc., </em>747 F.2d 81, 93 (2d Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">A. <em>Functionality</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">\u201cFunctional symbols (those that are essential to a product\u2019s use as opposed to those which merely identify it) are not protected under \u00a7 43(a).\u201d <em>Warner Bros., Inc. v. Gay Toys, Inc. (Warner II), </em>724 F.2d 327, 330 (2d Cir.1983). K mart claims that LeSportsac failed to establish that its design features are nonfunctional.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">At the outset, we note that it is not clear either in this circuit or elsewhere whether a plaintiff has the burden of proving non-functionality in order to obtain \u00a7 43(a) relief or whether a defendant must prove functionality as a defense. <em>Compare Vibrant Sales, Inc. v. New Body Boutique, Inc., </em>652 F.2d 299, 303-04 (2d Cir.1981) (apparently suggesting, in dicta, that burden is on plaintiff), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 909, 102 S.Ct. 1257, 71 L.Ed.2d 448 (1982), with <em>Warner II, supra, </em>724 F.2d at 330-32 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>(discussing \u201cfunctionality defense\u201d), and <em>Ives Laboratories, supra, </em>601 F.2d at 643 (affirming denial of preliminary injunction; \u201ccase for functionality ... depends on the evidence proffered by defendants ... \u201d). <em>See also Clarke Checks, supra, </em>711 F.2d at 982 n. 26 (declining to resolve question of where burden should be placed); <em>Fisher Stoves, Inc. v. All Nighter Stove Works, Inc., </em>626 F.2d 193, 195-96 (1st Cir.1980) (expressing doubt about where burden should be placed).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">We believe that <em>Warner II </em>correctly characterized the question of functionality as a defense, and that the burden therefore falls on the defendant to prove functionality. <em>See also Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., </em>456 U.S. 844, 863, 102 S.Ct. 2182, 2193, 72 L.Ed.2d 606 (1982) (White, J., concurring) (\u201cfunctionality is a defense to a suit under \u00a7 43(a) of Lanham Act\u201d). Requiring the plaintiff to prove nonfunctionality in order to prevail might \u201cdefeat[ ] the Lanham Act\u2019s purpose of enabling a purchaser to distinguish one product from another, see S.Rep. No. 1333 [79th Cong., 2d Sess. 4 (1946) ], because a plaintiff unable to prove that the features copied are nonfunctional will not prevail, no matter how compelling the evidence that purchasers are confused as to product source.\u201d Note, The Problem of Functional Features: Trade Dress Infringement Under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 82 Colum.L.Rev. 77, 87 n. 78 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The Supreme Court, in dictum, recently defined a functional feature in \u201cgeneral terms\u201d as one that \u201cis essential to the use or purpose of the article or [that] affects the cost or quality of the article.\u201d <em>Inwood Laboratories, supra, </em>456 U.S. at 850 n. 10, 102 S.Ct. at 2186 n. 10.- Judge Oakes elaborated on this definition in <em>Warner II:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">A design feature of a particular article is \u201cessential\u201d only if the feature is dictated by the functions to be performed; a feature that merely accommodates a useful function is not enough. <em>In re Morton-Norwich Products, Inc., </em>671 F.2d 1332, 1342 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1982) (shape of plastic container for spray products not essential to its purpose as a sprayer). And a design feature \u201caffecting the cost or quality of an article\u201d is one which permits the article to be manufactured at a lower cost, e.g., <em>Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co., </em>305 U.S. 111, 122, 59 S.Ct. 109, 115, 83 L.Ed. 73 (1938) (pillow shape of shredded wheat biscuit functional as cost would be increased and quality lessened by other form), or one which constitutes an improvement in the operation of the goods, <em>e.g., Fisher Stoves, Inc. v. All Nighter Stove Works, Inc., </em>626 F.2d 193, 195 (1st Cir.1980) (two-tier design of woodstove functional because improving the operation of the stove in three respects).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">The functionality defense, then, was developed to protect advances in functional design from being monopolized. It is designed to encourage competition and the broadest dissemination of useful design features.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">724 F.2d at 331 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">K mart argues that certain of LeSportsac\u2019s design features, particularly the hollow rectangular zipper pull, the cotton carpet tape and use of the repeating logo, are plainly functional and hence unprotected. But by breaking LeSportsac\u2019s trade dress into its individual elements and then attacking certain of those elements as functional, K mart misconceives the scope of the appropriate inquiry. LeSportsac does not claim a trademark in all lightweight nylon bags using hollow zipper pulls or carpet tape trim. It claims as its mark the particular combination and arrangement of design elements that identify its bags and distinguish them from other bags. See <em>Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, supra, </em>604 F.2d at 203. The district judge found that the design of the LeSportsac bag, when viewed in its entirety, is nonfunctional. That finding, on the record as it now stands, is not clearly erroneous. See <em>Vuitton et Fils S.A. v. J. Young Enterprises, </em>644 F.2d 769, 775 (9th Cir.1981) (\u201cThe issue of functionality has been consistently treated as a question of fact.\u201d) (citing <em>Ives Laboratories, supra, </em>601 F.2d at 643). In any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>event, LeSportsac plainly raised serious questions going to the merits on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">This conclusion is reinforced when evaluated against the rationale of the functionality defense: encouraging competition by preventing advances in functional design from being monopolized. See <em>Warner II, supra, </em>724 F.2d at 331. K mart\u2019s ability to compete is not unduly hindered by the determination that LeSportsac\u2019s particular configuration of design features is nonfunctional and therefore eligible for protection. C<em>f. In re Penthouse International Ltd., </em>565 F.2d 679, 682 (C.C.P.A.1977) (quoting <em>In re Mogen David Wine Corp., </em>328 F.2d 925, 933 (C.C.P.A.1964)). For example, the cotton carpet tape and carrying straps could be placed differently, contrasted in color with the bag or be made thicker or thinner; zipper pulls could be solid or nonreetangular; the repeating elliptical logo could be changed or placed differently. Indeed, K mart submitted to the district court a number of third-party bags that differ from the LeSportsac and K mart lines in many of the ways suggested above. <em>See also LeSportsac, Inc. v. Dockside Research, Inc., </em>478 F.Supp. 602, 607-08 (S.D.N.Y.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">K mart argues that under this court\u2019s definition of functionality in <em>I.A. Fratelli Saporiti v. Charles Craig, Ltd., </em>725 F.2d 18 (2d Cir.1984), the particular configuration of features on its and LeSportsac\u2019s bags is functional because it is \u201can important ingredient in the commercial success of the product\u201d or the \u201csaleability of the goods.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19-20. <em>Charles Craig </em>was decided just two weeks after <em>Warner II, supra, </em>in which another panel of this court had criticized as confusing \u201clanguage in the case law ... linking what is functional to the commercially successful features of the product.\u201d 724 F.2d at 330. This formulation, which appears in earlier cases as well, <em>see, e.g., Ives Laboratories, supra, </em>601 F.2d at 643 (quoting <em>Pagliero v. Wallace China Co., </em>198 F.2d 339, 343 (9th Cir.1952)), has also been criticized for over-inclusiveness. <em>See, e.g., Keene Corp. v. Paraflex Industries, </em>653 F.2d 822, 824-25 (3d Cir.1981); <em>Vuitton et Fils, supra, </em>644 F.2d at 773. Trade dress associated with a product that has accumulated goodwill, such as the LeSportsac line, will almost always be \u201can important ingredient\u201d in the \u201csaleability\u201d of the product. A related difficulty with the \u201cimportant ingredient\u201d formulation, read literally, is that \u201cit provides a disincentive for development of imaginative and attractive design. The more appealing the design, the less protection it would receive.\u201d <em>Keene Corp., supra, </em>653 F.2d at 825. The <em>Inwood Laboratories-Warner II </em>formulation, in which a feature must be \u201cessential to the use or purpose of the article\u201d or must affect \u201cthe cost or quality of the article,\u201d <em>Warner II, supra, </em>724 F.2d at 331, provides no such disincentive and is less susceptible to confusion or an overly broad interpretation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">There is an obvious tension between <em>Warner II </em>and <em>Charles Craig, </em>since the latter relied on the \u201cimportant ingredient\u201d formulation and did not cite either <em>Warner II </em>or <em>Inwood Laboratories. </em>Yet the result in <em>Charles Craig </em>is not inconsistent with <em>Warner II. </em>In <em>Charles Craig, </em>the district court had found that plaintiff had an unregistered trademark in the design of its sofa, the distinctive feature of which was the interlocking design of the back cushions, which served to hold the cushions in place while presenting the appearance of \u201cloose, free back pillows.\u201d This court reversed, finding the design to be \u201can important ingredient in the saleability of the product\u201d and therefore functional. The cushion design, on which the plaintiff had previously held a United States design patent, plainly \u201cconstitutes an improvement in the operation of the goods\u201d that ought not be monopolized (absent patent protection), and hence is functional under <em>Warner II </em>as well. See 724 F.2d at 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">Although <em>Warner II </em>cast doubt on the continued vitality of the \u201cimportant ingredient\u201d formulation, we do not suggest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>that it cannot be appropriately applied in certain circumstances. The \u201cimportant ingredient\u201d definition achieved its most quoted formulation in the context of a product, hotel china, the essential feature of which was the aesthetic appeal of its design. See <em>Pagliero, supra, </em>198 F.2d at 343.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Of course, lightweight nylon bags, like many other products, are often bought in part for aesthetic reasons. In deciding the question of functionality at trial, the factfinder will be faced with answering the following: Are consumers likely to purchase a LeSportsac bag rather than that of a competitor principally because they find LeSportsac\u2019s particular combination of design features aesthetically pleasing, or will they buy principally because the product features serve to identify or distinguish the goods as genuine LeSportsac products? See <em>Vibrant Sales, Inc., supra, </em>652 F.2d at 303-04; <em>Vuitton et Fils, supra, </em>644 F.2d at 776. If the latter, the LeSportsac \u201clook\u201d primarily serves a legitimate trademark purpose \u2014 identifying the source of the product \u2014 and should be eligible for protection even though it is also an \u201cimportant ingredient\u201d in the product\u2019s commercial success. The district court found that the combination and arrangement of design features on LeSportsac\u2019s bags did (and apparently were intended to) serve the trademark purpose of identification. While the ultimate disposition of this question awaits a trial on the merits, the district court\u2019s finding, made for the purpose of a preliminary injunction, was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">B. <em>Secondary meaning</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Appellant\u2019s other contentions require less discussion. K mart challenges the district court\u2019s finding that the design elements of LeSportsac\u2019s bags have acquired a secondary meaning. The trade dress of a product has attained \u201csecondary meaning\u201d when the purchasing public associates that dress with a single producer or source rather than just with the product itself. <em>Inwood Laboratories, supra, </em>456 U.S. at 851 n. 11, 102 S.Ct. at 2186 n. 11. In essence, K mart argues that LeSportsac presented insufficient evidence to establish secondary meaning. While LeSportsac might have presented additional evidence, it did offer proof of phenomenal sales success, substantial advertising expenditures, unsolicited media coverage, requests from third parties to license the use of its design and K mart\u2019s deliberate attempt to imitate its trade dress. Whether or not this evidence is sufficient to prove secondary meaning to the satisfaction of the ultimate trier of fact, it at least raised serious questions going to the merits, which is sufficient at this stage of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">K mart also argues that the fact of intentional copying, which the district judge found to be the \u201cmost persuasive evidence\u201d of secondary meaning, cannot substitute for actual proof of secondary meaning. Citing <em>Mattel, Inc. v. Azrak-Hamway International, Inc., </em>724 F.2d 357, 361 (2d Cir.1983), K mart claims that the district court \u201cshould have demanded <em>some </em>proof of what the public thinks about plaintiff\u2019s design standing alone.\u201d But in <em>Mattel </em>we simply said that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to issue a preliminary injunction. In doing so we noted the lack of survey evidence. We did not establish any requirement that survey evidence of secondary meaning or customer confusion be introduced before a plaintiff may obtain a preliminary injunction. <em>See Thompson Medical Co., Inc. v. Pfizer Inc., </em>753 F.2d 208, 217 (2d Cir.1985) (to determine existence of secondary meaning, \u201cevery element need not be proved\u201d). Such evidence is often desirable, as it may well be in the trial of this case. Nevertheless, we cannot say that the district court erred in finding that the evidence presented by LeSportsac was sufficient at this stage to meet its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>C. <em>Likelihood of confusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Having found that LeSportsac has at least raised serious questions as to the trademark status of its product, we turn now to LeSportsac\u2019s prospects for proving that K mart\u2019s bags infringed its trade dress. In enjoining the sale of the four lightweight bags, the district-court found that LeSportsac \u201cestablished not only a likelihood of confusion, but a virtual certainty of it.\u201d K mart argues that LeSportsac\u2019s proof was insufficient, focusing on the lack of direct proof of actual confusion. Here again, LeSportsac may well find it necessary or advisable to present additional evidence at trial, but at this stage its burden was only to raise a serious question of likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">As to the four lightweight bags, the district court concluded that the \u201caverage consumer, seeing [K mart\u2019s] products in discount stores\u201d may well \u201cbeliev[e] them to have originated from [LeSportsac],\u201d and that the bags are \u201cremarkably similar.\u201d Apart from differences in feel and the wording on the marks, the bags are almost indistinguishable. Indeed, the district court found that K mart \u201cdeliberately copied the distinctive features of [LeSportsac\u2019s] bag.\u201d Where a product\u2019s design has achieved secondary meaning, confusion is a likely consequence of copying. See <em>Harlequin Enterprises, supra, </em>644 F.2d at 949.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">K mart\u2019s heavyweight knapsack is concededly less like its LeSportsac counterpart than are the other four bags. Nonetheless, here too we would not be justified in overruling the district court\u2019s conclusion that LeSportsac met its burden on likelihood of confusion. The heavyweight knapsack features a repeating elliptical logo, substantially the same as that on the other four bags, as well as the same hollow rectangular zipper pulls. In addition, the repeating logo is placed in precisely the same place\u2014 on the nylon trim just above the three compartment zippers \u2014 as it is on the LeSportsac knapsack. \u201c[I]t is the \u2018combination of features as a whole rather than a difference in some of the details which must determine whether the competing product is likely to cause confusion in the mind of the public.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 949 (quoting <em>Perfect Fit Industries v. Acme Quilting Co., </em>618 F.2d 950, 955 (2d Cir.1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">D. <em>Irreparable injury and balance of hardships</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">The district court also found that LeSportsac faces possible irreparable injury and concluded that the balance of hardships tips decidedly in its favor, determinations to which we ordinarily give substantial deference. See <em>Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, supra, </em>604 F.2d at 206-07. In any event, we are persuaded that the district court here was correct. Likelihood of confusion is itself strong evidence that in the absence of an injunction LeSportsac might face irreparable harm. <em>Id. </em>at 207. Similarly, while K mart must stor\u00e9 its bags pending the outcome of this litigation, the true hardships tip markedly in favor of LeSportsac. It would risk loss of both sales and goodwill if K mart were permitted to continue selling its confusingly similar bags pending resolution of this action. The district court was justified in concluding that the potential damage to LeSportsac\u2019s mark and goodwill in the absence of a preliminary injunction outweighs the short-term economic harm that K mart may suffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">We conclude, therefore, that under all the circumstances the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-13\">Finally, K mart contends that the district court erred in denying K mart\u2019s motion to modify the preliminary injunction. K mart proposed to sell its bags (the approximately 90,000 that remain on hand) accompanied by a hangtag prominently indicating K mart as the source of origin. Citing <em>Terkildsen v. Waters, </em>481 F.2d 201 (2d Cir.1973), LeSportsac responds that K mart failed to appeal that portion of the district court\u2019s September 18 order denying the modification motion and that we are therefore barred from reviewing that denial. We disagree. Unlike the situation in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number><em>Terkildsen, </em>K mart\u2019s notice of appeal can reasonably be construed as embracing all aspects of the September 18 order. In addition, while the notice of appeal here might have been more precise, <em>Terkildsen </em>itself stated that our practice generally is to construe a notice of appeal liberally. 481 F.2d at 206. Moreover, we have the power to modify the injunction if we believe it is too broad. Finally, LeSportsac has proffered no evidence suggesting it has been \u201cmisled by the mistake,\u201d if there was one, in the notice of appeal. 9 J. Moore, B. Ward &amp; J. Lucas, Moore\u2019s Federal Practice 11203.18, at 3-77 (2d ed. 1983). Accordingly, this court has jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s order denying K mart\u2019s motion to modify the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">As is so often the case, the issue of appealability requires more discussion than the merits of the question on appeal. Having determined that we may appropriately consider K mart\u2019s attack on the finding that the hangtags would not eliminate the likelihood of confusion, we readily conclude that the finding is not clearly erroneous. The proposed hangtag would be removable. Once the tag comes off, the bags are again virtually identical and likelihood of confusion remains. Moreover, as LeSportsac correctly points out, the equities of the situation are quite different than they would have been had K mart placed the proposed tags on the bags when they were first offered for sale. See <em>Johnson &amp; Johnson v. Quality Pure Manufacturing, Inc., </em>484 F.Supp. 975, 980 (D.N.J.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the orders of the district court are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b149-21\">. Because the district court\u2019s order was based on \u00a7 43(a) of the Lanham Act, we need not address the other grounds for relief claimed in LeSportsac\u2019s complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b151-6\">.
