MORGAN, Senior Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">Rex Elmo Smalley has been sheriff of Marshall County, Alabama, since 1974. The sale of alcoholic beverages is illegal in Marshall County,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but various bootlegging operations have flourished there under the patronage and protection of Sheriff Smalley. During his tenure he has extorted pay-offs from bootleggers<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the county and failed to report this income to the Internal Revenue Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">A jury in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama convicted him of four counts of extortion,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> one count of conspiracy to commit extortion, and three counts of willfully filing false income tax returns.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court sentenced him to serve concurrent sentences of three years on each count, to pay $1,000.00 on each tax count, and to pay costs of $1,239.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">Smalley does not challenge on appeal the sufficiency of the evidence to support the convictions. He does, however, allege defects in the indictment and the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">I. THE INDICTMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">\n<em>A. Misjoinder of the Extortion and Tax Counts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">Smalley first asserts that the joinder of the tax and extortion counts in the same indictment violated Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Improper joinder under Rule 8(a) is a matter of law subject to plenary review by this court. <em>United States v. Montes-Cardenas, </em>746 F.2d 771, 776 (11th Cir.1984). We must construe Rule 8(a) broadly in favor of initial joinder. <em>Id. </em>\u201cOffenses may be joined if they are based on \u2018two or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting part of a common scheme or plan.\u2019 Fed.R.Crim.P. 8(a). Two crimes are \u2018connected\u2019 together if the proof of one crime constitutes a substantial portion of the proof of the other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Smalley contends that the government\u2019s proof failed to satisfy this requirement because it failed to show that the income he failed to report on his tax returns came from extortion. <em>Compare United States v. Diaz-Munoz, </em>632 F.2d 1330,1335-36 (5th Cir.1980) (joinder of tax and non-tax counts violated Rule 8(a) because government failed to prove that unreported income flowed from the non-tax crime) <em>with United States v. Kopituk, </em>690 F.2d 1289, 1312-14 (11th Cir.1982) (joinder proper because tax offenses arose out of the other offenses charged), <em>cert. denied, </em>461 U.S. 928,103 S.Ct. 2089, 77 L.Ed.2d 300 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-18\">The government\u2019s proof at trial consisted of the testimony of bootleggers who had paid large sums to Smalley for protection, Smalley\u2019s financial statements,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and a bank deposits-cash expenditures analysis.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>Smalley bases his misjoinder argument upon the deposits-expenditures analysis, which he contends establishes that very little of the unreported income stemmed from extortion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We agree with the government, however, that this analysis sets only the lower limit of Smalley\u2019s unreported income. The bootleggers testified that they normally made the pay-offs in cash, but few cash deposits were made into Smalley\u2019s bank accounts. Thus, the extortion proceeds probably circumvented the receipts-expenditures analysis. The other direct evidence established that Smalley received considerable amounts by extortion. He does not claim to have reported any of it, and the government established that he did not. Thus, because the proof of extortion constituted a substantial portion of the proof of tax evasion, <em>see Montes-Cardenas, </em>746 F.2d at 776, the government proved that logical relationship between the tax and extortion counts required for joinder under Rule 8(a). <em>See United States v. Park, </em>531 F.2d 754, 761 (5th Cir.1976); <em>see also Bonner v. City of Prichard, Alabama, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1207 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc) (decisions of the former Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals handed down pri- or to October 1, 1981 binding precedent in the eleventh circuit).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">\n<em>B. Multiplicity of the Extortion Counts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">Count three of the indictment charged Smalley with extorting money and alcoholic beverages from Jerry Wayne Lang from late 1974 to July 1980. During this time, Lang either personally operated his bootlegging business or hired employees to operate it for him. Count four charged Smalley with extorting money from Lang and Larry Abercrombie from July 1980 to February 1982. Abercrombie leased the business from Lang at a flat rate of $500.00 per week and gave Lang the pay-off money for Smalley. Count 20 alleged that Smalley extorted money from Lang, Harry Kearley, and Richard Sams from February 1982 to June 1982. Kearley and Sams, government undercover agents, took over the business from Abercrombie and continued to pay the rent and extortion money to Lang. Each count alleged extortion \u201cby a course of conduct.\u201d Smalley insists that these counts allege a single course of conduct against a single victim, Lang, and should therefore have been consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">The government could indeed have proceeded upon a one-count theory. <em>United States v. Provenzano, </em>334 F.2d 678, 684-85 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 947, 85 S.Ct. 440, 13 L.Ed.2d 544 (1964). The law does not <em>require </em>such a tactic, however. <em>United States v. Addonizio, </em>451 F.2d 49, 59 (3d Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 1048, 92 S.Ct. 1309, 31 L.Ed.2d 591 (1972). An extortion conviction under the Hobbs Act requires proof that (1) the defendant induced his victim to part consensually with property (2) either through the wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence or fear or under color of official right (3) in such a way as to adversely affect interstate commerce. <em>United States v. Nakaladski, </em>481 F.2d 289, 298 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1064, 94 S.Ct. 570, 38 L.Ed.2d 469 (1973); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951. Each relinquishment of property manifesting all these elements is a separate offense that may be the subject of a separate count. <em>Addonizio, </em>451 F.2d at 59 (defendant\u2019s conviction on sixty-three counts of extortion upheld because all counts, each of which based upon individual payment, showed that each subject payment manifested all the elements of extortion); Fed. R.Crim.P. 8(a). If each individual payment could be the subject of a separate count, then the grouping of payments as in the indictment against Smalley is also permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>II. THE TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">\n<em>A. \u201cStipulation\u201d by the Trial Judge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">The prisoner stipend received by Smalley, <em>see supra </em>note 7, was the subject of considerable testimony at trial. The government called a witness from the State of Alabama Department of Public Accounts, who explained the payment of these funds. The following colloquy occurred on cross-examination of this witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-6\">Q: Now, what does the law provide\u2014 whose money, under the law, legally, is that $1.75 a day, plus the sliding scale of food allowance? Who does that belong to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-7\">A: That is the sheriffs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-8\">Q: Sheriffs, personally?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-9\">A: If they have a local law providing such, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-10\">Q: All right, sir. Are you familiar with the law in Marshall County, Alabama? A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-11\">Q: Well, do you have it with you by chance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-12\">A: Yes, sir, somewhere.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-13\">Q: Now, Marshall County, Alabama\u2014 GOVERNMENT ATTORNEY: We</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-14\">will stipulate it is personal income to the sheriff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-15\">DEFENSE ATTORNEY: You will</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-16\">stipulate that all that money belongs to the sheriff?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-17\">GOVERNMENT ATTORNEY: Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-18\">DEFENSE ATTORNEY: All right. Just all the money paid by the state for prisoner meals was personal property of the sheriff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-19\">GOVERNMENT ATTORNEY: And by the county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-20\">DEFENSE ATTORNEY: And paid by the county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-21\">GOVERNMENT ATTORNEY: And by the county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-22\">DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0r\">Smalley later called as a witness Ralph Dowdy, a Certified Public Accountant, to challenge the income tax calculations of the Internal Revenue Service and to analyze the income reported by Smalley for the tax years in question. Dowdy testified that Smalley\u2019s unreported income was less than that claimed by the government, but his figures were based upon the assumption that the profit from the prisoner stipend was not taxable income. During the government\u2019s cross-examination of Dowdy, Smalley denied that he had made any stipulation on the issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-24\">Q: Aren\u2019t you assuming in your computation \u2014 well, let me ask you this: If he had, if he received checks from the state and from the county and what he got was in excess of his expenses for feeding prisoners, that would be income to him wouldn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-25\">A: Not necessarily.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-26\">Q: Why not necessarily?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-27\">A: Well, if it was income, why didn\u2019t the State of Alabama send him a 1099? He gets a W-2 at the end of the year for the salary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-28\">Q: For the record, we stipulated that was income. But let me ask you this\u2014 DEFENSE ATTORNEY: We did not so stipulate. We stipulated that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-29\">THE COURT: Well, I stipulate that it is income because it is the law. That is income. So I am in respectful disagreement with the witness on that. Now, let\u2019s go on to the next question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1024-30\">Smalley argues that the court committed reversible error by (1) stipulating the excess prisoner stipend to be income, thereby invading the purview of the jury, and (2) discrediting the witness before the jury by openly disagreeing with him. \u201c[W]e will not reverse a conviction unless the comments of the Trial Judge are so prejudicial as to amount to a denial of a fair trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Preston, </em>608 F.2d 626, 636 (5th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 940,100 S.Ct. 2162, 64 L.Ed.2d 794 (1980). \u201cA clear effect on the jury is required to reverse for comment by the trial judge.\u201d <em>United States v. Rochan, </em>563 F.2d 1246, 1250 (5th Cir.1977). Such is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>Gross income includes \u201call income from whatever source derived, including ... [compensation for services, including fees, commissions, and similar items....\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 61(a)(1). Smalley\u2019s excess prisoner stipend falls within this definition. \u201cUnder our system of federal income taxation, ... every element of gross income of a person, corporation or individual, is subject to tax unless there is a statute or some rule of law that exempts that person or element.\u201d <em>HCSC-Laundry v. United States, </em>450 U.S. 1, 5, 101 S.Ct. 836, 838, 67 L.Ed.2d 1 (1981). Smalley has not directed us to any applicable exemption. The district court\u2019s characterization of the excess prisoner stipend was correct. An actual controversy about the taxability of particular receipts may pose a jury issue on the intent of a taxpayer charged with tax evasion. <em>United States v. Garber, </em>607 F.2d 92, 97 (5th Cir.1979). Smalley has shown no such controversy. We need not now decide if the characterization of an economic gain as income is always a question of law for the court. In this case, there simply is no question of fact for the jury on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">This court has identified three factors that indicate that the comments of the trial judge were not reversible error: (1) the comments \u201coccupied but a few seconds of a lengthy trial,\u201d (2) the comments \u201cwere directed to defense counsel rather than to the jury,\u201d and (3) the trial judge advised the jury to disregard any intimation by the court relating to the facts of the case. <em>Preston, </em>608 F.2d at 636 (quoting <em>United States v. Onori, </em>535 F.2d 938, 944 (5th Cir.1976)). This sole challenged statement of the judge occupied a moment of the three-week trial, the court addressed the statement to the attorneys to facilitate the progress of the trial, <em>cf. United States v. Berdick, </em>555 F.2d 1329, 1330 (5th Cir.1977) (court\u2019s remarks \u201cnot only fair and impartial but necessary to avoid lengthy, redundant and confusing testimony\u201d), and the court diffused any lingering effect of the statement upon the jury with his final instructions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-13\">In <em>United States v. Washington, </em>550 F.2d 320 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 832, 98 S.Ct. 116, 54 L.Ed.2d 92 (1977), a bank robbery prosecution, the government proffered a witness as an expert in lifting latent fingerprints. The court accepted the expert over the defendants\u2019 objection, observing as follows: \u201cHe\u2019s totally acceptable to the Court as an expert____ He\u2019s had more experience than all of those nutty professors that you have talked about. It\u2019s done by the school of hard knocks[; that] is where you learn to dust something and lift fingerprints, and not by some professor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>sitting in some university who doesn\u2019t know his neck from third base.\u201d The defendants\u2019 expert on photographic identification was a professor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">The defendants argued on appeal that the comments of the trial judge denied them an effective cross-examination of the government\u2019s expert\u2019s qualifications, adversely affected the credibility of their expert witness, violated the court\u2019s duty to remain neutral and trespassed upon the jury\u2019s duties. The appellate court acknowledged that the remarks were unfortunate but refused to reverse the defendants\u2019 convictions. They noted that the comments consumed only a few moments of the five-day trial, concerned a procedural matter and did not reflect on the defendants\u2019 guilt or innocence. The trial court made the statement to defense counsel before the defendants\u2019 witness took the stand. Finally, the trial court\u2019s immediate admonishment to the jury that they alone were to give the experts\u2019 testimony the appropriate weight and his final charge that they were the sole judges of the facts weighed in the appellate court\u2019s decision that the defendants\u2019 trial was not unfair. <em>Washington, </em>550 F.2d at 324 and n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">Although not all of the factors enumerated in <em>Washington </em>are present here, that case confirms our conclusion that the trial judge\u2019s stipulation did not render Smalley\u2019s trial unfair. Reviewing the trial as a whole, the statement concerned only a peripheral matter that did not reflect upon Smalley\u2019s guilt or innocence. \u201c[A]n occasional lapse of patience will not suffice to overturn a conviction returned after a full and fair presentation of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Hill, </em>496 F.2d 201, 202 (5th Cir.1974), <em>quoted in Allen v. Montgomery, </em>728 F.2d 1409, 1416 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">\n<em>B. The Cotton Tapes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">In late 1981 and early 1982, L.G. Cotton, a resident of Marshall County, agreed to cooperate in a government undercover operation against Smalley. He had several conversations with Smalley, \u2022 five of which were taped. He told Smalley that he was operating a gambling game and wanted to establish a bootlegging and prostitution operation. He paid Smalley $1,000 on one occasion and from $100 to $200 on several other occasions. He eventually started the bootlegging business, using $200 loaned to him by Smalley.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-9\">The grand jury returned the indictment against Smalley on May 9, 1983. On June 1, Smalley filed a discovery and inspection motion. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 16. The government mailed transcripts of the Cotton tapes to Smalley on June 27, and Smalley claims that he did not receive them until June 30. Smalley filed on July 8 a motion to suppress all evidence regarding activities between Smalley and Cotton on the grounds of irrelevancy, immateriality, and the failure of the government to timely produce the taped conversations. The court struck the jury on July 13 and the trial began on July 14. The government made no reference to the Cotton conversations in its case in chief, but the court allowed the government attorney to cross-examine Smalley on them. The court prohibited the United States from introducing into evidence the tape recordings or the transcripts and from calling Cotton as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-10\">Smalley first argues that the government violated Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure by failing to timely produce the Cotton tapes pursuant to his discovery request. He concludes that the district court therefore erred in allowing the government to cross-examine him concerning the taped conversations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-11\">Rule 16 reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-12\">Upon request of a defendant the government shall permit the defendant to inspect and copy or photograph: any relevant written or recorded statements made by the defendant, or copies thereof, within the possession, custody or control of the government, the existence of which is known, or by the exercise of due diligence may become known, to the attorney for the government____ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>If at any time during the course of the proceedings it is brought to the attention of the court that a party has failed to comply with this rule, the court may order such party to permit the discovery or inspection, grant a continuance, or prohibit the party from introducing evidence not disclosed, or it may enter such other order as it deems just under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1), (d)(2). This rule infuses the trial judge with a broad discretion. <em>United States v. Sarcinelli, </em>667 F.2d 5, 5 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982); <em>see Stein v. Reynolds Securities, Inc., </em>667 F.2d 33, 34 (11th Cir.1982) (decisions of a Unit B panel of the former Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals after September 30, 1981, are binding in the eleventh circuit).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">The court below did not breach that discretion by allowing Smalley to be cross-examined about his conversations with Cotton. The government did disclose the existence and contents of the tapes two weeks before trial and three weeks before the government\u2019s use of them in court. Smalley has failed to show that he had inadequate time to prepare to meet them. Any impermissible prejudice was diffused by the court\u2019s refusal both to admit the tapes into evidence and to allow Cotton to testify and Smalley\u2019s denial before the jury of any impropriety in his dealings with Cotton.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">Smalley further contends that the government\u2019s use of the Cotton conversations violated rules 402<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and 404(b)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of the Federal Rules of Evidence. He misconstrues the government\u2019s tactics. Rules 402 and 404 deal with the <em>admission </em>of evidence. Here, the court received into evidence nothing pertaining to the Cotton conversations. Instead, the court allowed the government to use the tapes solely to impeach Smalley\u2019s claim \u2014 asserted during opening statement, direct testimony and closing argument \u2014 that he was a \u201cgood\u201d sheriff who enforced the laws as well as he could and did not take bribes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-13\">Matters affecting the credibility of the witness are always relevant on cross-examination. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 611(b).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The credibility of a witness may be attacked by reference to specific instances of his conduct as was done by the government in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1027-14\">Specific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting his credibility ... may not be proved by extrinsic evidence. They may, however, in the discretion of the court, if probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness, be inquired into on cross-examination of the witness ... concerning his character for truthfulness or untruthfulness ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1027-15\"><em>Id. </em>608(b). The Cotton conversations were clearly relevant to Smalley\u2019s veracity on direct examination. The trial court did not exceed his discretion in allowing the cross-examination and properly refused to admit any extrinsic evidence of the Cotton transaction.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Cf<em>.

These statements showed an increase in Smalley's net worth between February 1977 and November 1980 of $140, 114 in constant dollars.

The government concedes that under this analysis most of the unreported income stemmed from Smalley's profit from the stipend he received from the State of Alabama and Marshall County to feed the prisoners under his supervi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>sion.

Smalley contends that the government\u2019s computations failed to include certain items that, when properly considered, would reduce the amount of the understatements and thus the amount arguably attributable to extortion. He nevertheless fails to account for $181.95 in 1978, $1,320.64 for 1979 and $12,819.73 for 1980.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">. The district court instructed the jury in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-9\">[D]uring the course of this trial I have occasionally made comments to the lawyers. You have heard me. And I might have, on occasion, and I think I did occasionally ask questions of the witness or admonish the witness as to the manner in which he had responded or should respond to a question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-10\">Now, don\u2019t assume from anything that I have said during the trial that I have any opinion concerning any of the issues in this case. Except for my instructions to you on the law here, you should disregard anything I may have said during the trial in arriving at your own findings as to the facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-11\">You are the sole judges of the credibility\u2014 put another way \u2014 the believability of each witness and the weight to be given his or her testimony. And in weighing the testimony of a witness, you should consider his or her relationship to the government or to the defendant; his or her interest, if any, in the outcome of the case; his or her manner of testifying; his or her opportunity to observe or to acquire knowledge concerning the facts about which he or she testified; his or her candor, fairness, intelligence and the extent to which he or she has been supported or contradicted by other credible evidence. In short, you may accept or reject the testimony of any witness in whole or in part because that is what your job is, to make those kinds of evaluations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-16\">We have had some expert testimony. You should consider each expert opinion and give it such weight as you think it deserves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-17\">If you should decide that the opinion of an expert witness is not based upon sufficient education and experience or if you should conclude that the reasons given in support of the opinion of an expert are not sound or that the opinion is outweighed by other evidence, you may disregard that opinion entirely.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">. Rule 402 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1027-9\">All relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution of the United States, by Act of Congress, by these rules, or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority. Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1027-10\">. Rule 404(b) states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1027-11\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1027-16\">. Rule 611(b) states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZJ\">Cross-examination should be limited to the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting the credibility of the witness. The court may, in the exercise of its discretion, permit inquiry into additional matters as if on direct examination.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1027-17\">. Smalley also hints at an argument based upon Federal Rule of Evidence 403, to which Rule 608(b) is subject. Fed.R.Evid. 608(b) advisory committee note. In this case, however, the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, or misleading the jury does not outweigh the probative value of the Cotton transaction to determining Smalley\u2019s credibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
