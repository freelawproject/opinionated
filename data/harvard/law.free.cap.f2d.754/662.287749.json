Tangerman, an Army serviceman who was injured when struck by an automobile driven by Charles M. Gee while walking across a street. Tangerman was brought by ambulance to Louisville General Hospital, and was later transferred to Ireland Army Hospital. The United States paid for Tangerman\u2019s ambulance services and for his care at Louisville General, and provided treatment at Ireland Army Hospital without charge. It did not obtain an assignment of Tangerman\u2019s right to receive indemnification for medical expenses under applicable insurance policies. The total cost to the United States, including the reasonable value of the care provided at Ireland, was $8,620.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-21\">As an Army Serviceman on active duty status, Tangerman was entitled by 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1074(a) to receive his medical care at government expense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time of the accident, however, both Tangerman and Gee had no-fault automobile insurance policies with Allstate Insurance. Their policies had identical personal injury protection (PIP) endorsements which provided for basic reparation benefits, including medical expense. The United States did not seek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>an assignment from Tangerman, but filed a claim with Allstate as a third party beneficiary of Gee and Tangerman\u2019s insurance contracts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When Allstate refused to hon- or this claim, the government brought the present action, maintaining that it was entitled to payment from Allstate both by the express language of the PIP medical expense provision, and by the language of the Kentucky no-fault statute, K.R.S. \u00a7 304.-39-010 <em>et seq. </em>(1981). The District Court entered judgment for Allstate on its motion for a new trial,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> finding that neither the contract nor the no-fault status gave the government the right to recover benefits from Allstate. We affirm for a number of reasons, including the fact that the government did not obtain an assignment of rights under the Kentucky no-fault statute, \u00a7 304.39-240, K.R.S., the method contemplated by statute for recovery by a medical provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">The government argues that because it incurred Tangerman\u2019s medical expense, it is entitled to payment under Allstate\u2019s promise in the PIP endorsement to pay \u201cpersonal injury protection benefits for medical expense ... incurred with respect to bodily injury sustained by an eligible insured person.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It also maintains that as a legal entity or organization which suffered economic loss, it is entitled to receive benefits under K.R.S. \u00a7 304.39-030, which states that \u201cevery person suffering loss from injury arising out of maintenance or use of a motor vehicle has a right to basic reparation benefits,\u201d where basic reparation benefits are defined by sections 304.-39-020(2) and 304.39-020(5)(a) to include medical expense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Neither of these contentions has yet been decided by the Kentucky courts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-14\">The District Court held that the government was no more than an incidental beneficiary or optional payee under the PIP endorsement. In order to rise above this status and assert rights as a third party beneficiary under that provision, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>United States faces the longstanding rule in Kentucky that for a stranger to recover under a contract to which he is not a party, \u201cit is indispensably essential that he allege and prove that the contract was intended for his benefit in the sense that it embraces the claim asserted by him.\u201d <em>Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad Co. v. Dry Branch Coal Co., 252 </em>Ky. 124, 65 S.W.2d 1008, 1011 (1933), quoted in <em>King v. National Industries, Inc., </em>512 F.2d 29, 32 (6th Cir.1975). The contract must be \u201cdirectly or primarily for the benefit of such third person.\u201d <em>Long v. Reiss, </em>290 Ky. 198, 160 S.W.2d 668, 674 (1942). Intent to benefit is determined primarily by looking at the \u201cpurpose of the promisee in light of the terms of the promise and the accompanying circumstances.\u201d J.D. Calamari &amp; J.M. Perillo, The Law op Contracts, \u00a7 17-2, at 608 (2d ed. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The language of the PIP endorsement fails to evidence the requisite intent to benefit a provider such as the government. Allstate promised to pay \u201cpersonal injury protection benefits\u201d which are clearly for the benefit primarily of the injured insured person. Allstate\u2019s general promise to pay PIP benefits for medical expense falls far short of establishing a specific right in the government to recover under the policy. The most natural inference regarding the insured\u2019s intent is simply that it was to cover his own medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Discerning intent with respect to the no-fault PIP provision is, moreover, complicated by the fact that \u00a7 304.39-080(5) requires all Kentucky automobile owners to carry insurance (or meet the self-insurance requirements of \u00a7 304.39-080(7)) containing a PIP provision,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>a and the elements of loss covered in that provision are also statutorily defined and not subject to contractual choice. <em>See </em>sections 304.39-020(2) and 304.39-020(5)(a). Against this background, it is impossible to find that the insured intended the PIP endorsement to be for the direct or primary benefit of the government in its role as a legally obligated provider of medical services.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-12\">The government\u2019s more substantial contention is that the no-fault statute itself entitles it to receive payment for medical expenses under the PIP provision. In evaluating this argument we turn first to the language of the statute, which is decisive, if clear. <em>See Gateway Construction Co. v. Wallbaum, </em>356 S.W.2d 247, 249 (Ky.1962). In addition to the statutory right to basic reparation benefits of \u201cevery person suffering loss from injury arising out of maintenance or use of a motor vehicle,\u201d \u00a7 304.-39-030(1), the government cites \u00a7 304.39-040(2), which states that no-fault insurers \u201cshall pay basic reparation benefits ... for loss from injury arising out of maintenance or use of a motor vehicle.\u201d Its argument is simply that the United States suffered loss from Tangerman\u2019s injury, and is therefore entitled to basic reparation benefits absent statutory language showing the legislature intended a more restrictive reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-13\">The difficulty with this contention is that under the statutory definition of \u201cinjury\u201d in \u00a7 304.39-020(4), \u201closs from injury\u201d means \u201closs from bodily harm, sickness, disease, or death,\u201d whereas the government\u2019s expense occurred because it was legally obligated to provide free medical care, and only indirectly from Tangerman\u2019s injury. Moreover, while the no-fault statute fails to define \u201cperson,\u201d the court in <em>Gregory v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em>618 S.W.2d 582, 582-583 (Ky.Ct.App.1981) held that the word \u201cperson\u201d as used in \u00a7 304.-39-030(1) refers only to \u201cliving human beings.\u201d The Commissioner\u2019s Comment to \u00a7 2 of the Uniform Motor Vehicle Repara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>tions Act (which is identical in this respect to \u00a7 304.39-030(1)) similarly states that \u201call <em>persons injured in </em>motor vehicle accidents within this State are entitled to receive basic reparation benefits.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Uniform Motor Vehicle Reparations Act (U.L.A.) \u00a7 2, at 59 (1980). The Kentueky Supreme Court has recognized the commissioner\u2019s comments as \u201cpersuasive authority\u201d in interpreting Kentucky statutes. <em>Couty v. Kentucky Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Co., </em>608 S.W.2d 370, 371 (Ky.1980). See also Note, <em>Kentucky No-Fault: An Analysis and Interpretation, </em>65 Ky.L.J. 466, 475 (1976) (the basic assumption of the statute is that \u201ceveryone sustaining personal injuries in an automobile accident in Kentucky will be entitled to basic reparation benefits\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>b</p>\n<p id=\"AIA\">The government also argues that the purpose of the no-fault statute requires allowing any person legally obligated to pay the medical expenses of an insured person to claim benefits directly and on his own behalf from the no-fault insurer. We find this contention inconsistent with the language and policy of the statute. In section 304.39-240, the Kentucky legislature specifically made enforceable an assignment of a right to benefits for \u201cmedical expense to the extent the benefits are for the cost of products, services, or accommodations provided or to be provided by the assignee.\u201d It thus clearly contemplated that a provider\u2019s right to recover should arise only from assignment. In addition, in providing that \u201cmedical expense benefits may be paid by the reparation obligor directly to persons supplying products, services, or accommodations to the claimant,\u201d section 304.39-210 makes the provider an optional payee or incidental beneficiary of no-fault policies in order to facilitate the insured person\u2019s receipt of benefits, and does not make the provider a third party beneficiary with a right to enforce the insurance contract. <em>Accord, Heusle v. National Mutual Insurance Co., </em>628 F.2d 833, 839 (3rd Cir.1980); <em>United States v. Dairyland Insurance Co., </em>674 F.2d 750, 752 (8th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"A7h\">The stated purposes of the Kentucky no-fault statute might be frustrated and are not furthered by granting the government a right to recover. Since the United States is legally obligated to cover the medical expenses of servicemen, its payment of those expenses should not be influenced by its ability to recover from the no-fault insurer. Thus the \u00a7 304.39-010(3) goal of encouraging \u201cprompt medical treatment an&lt;^ rehabilitation of the accident victim by providing prompt payment of needed medica4 care,\u201d does not support the government s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"ACI\">Even more importantly, an expansive view of the class of third party beneficiaries to no-fault PIP coverage could undermine the primary compensatory purpose of no-fault automobile insurance. Like the Uniform Motor Vehicle Reparations Act (the model no-fault law), the Kentucky statute allows the automobile accident victim to receive compensation for net loss, including medical expenses and work loss, directly from his own insurance company. However, in exchange for this direct right of recovery, the Kentucky automobile owner must agree to the abolition of any tort rights \u201cto the extent that basic reparation benefits are payable,\u201d <em>see </em>\u00a7 304.39-060(1)(2),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and, in accordance with \u00a7 304.-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>39-020(2), to the limitation of basic reparation benefits to not more than $10,000 per individual per accident. No-fault thus ensures direct and speedy compensation, but the amount of compensation awarded under the no-fault system is limited and hence exhaustible. <em>See generally </em>R.E. Keeton &amp; J. O\u2019Connell, Basic Protection For The Traffic Victim, 274-76 (1965) (classic study setting forth the principles and structure of no-fault law). Given the exhaustible nature of no-fault benefits, we cannot accept the government\u2019s position that any person legally obligated to provide medical services should be allowed to claim under the no-fault system, since this enlargement in the class of beneficiaries could frustrate the legislature\u2019s stated intention of \u201cproviding prompt payment to victims of motor vehicle accidents,\u201d K.R.S. \u00a7 304.39-010(2), by creating competing claims to basic reparation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Our conclusion parallels that reached by the court in <em>United States v. Dairyland Insurance Co., </em>674 F.2d 750, 754 (8th Cir.1982), where the court held that a provision in the North Dakota no-fault statute stating that the no-fault insurer was obligated to pay basic no-fault benefits for \u201ceconomic loss resulting from (1) accidental bodily injury\u201d did not entitle the government to recover benefits and in fact had nothing to do with the question of which parties could recover benefits, but instead described the types of claims which were payable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>a We find ourselves in conflict with the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Government Employees Insurance Co., </em>605 F.2d 669 (2d Cir.1979), but we cannot accept its argument, <em>see </em>605 F.2d at 671, that general statutory language entitling persons suffering loss on account of personal auto injury to no-fault benefits was intended to give any third party who incurs medical expenses the right to recover benefits on his own behalf. There is simply nothing in the language or policy of the Kentucky no-fault statute to suggest that such a radical result was intended by the legislature.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">We recognize that Allstate will in a certain sense realize a windfall, in that both Gee and Tangerman paid premiums for PIP coverage and yet Allstate escapes what would ordinarily be its clear obligation to pay. On the other hand, allowing recovery by the government would make it the beneficiary of insurance protection for which it did not pay, and would notify no-fault insurers that servicemen present the risk of substantial medical expense payments even though they ostensibly receive free care from the government. As a matter of Kentucky state law, an action to recover no-fault benefits is an action on an insurance contract, <em>France v. Kentucky Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Co., </em>605 S.W.2d 773, 774 (Ky.Ct.App.1980), and we cannot extend the class of beneficiaries entitled to bring such an action merely because the insurance company may reap a windfall if we do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b739-15\">. In pertinent part, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1074(a) provides that \"a member of a uniformed service who is on active duty status is entitled to medical and dental care in any facility of any uniformed service.\u201d The government apparently interpreted this provision as also requiring it to pay for Tangerman\u2019s privately provided care.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b740-6\">. The government maintained that coverage should be extended under Gee\u2019s policy, since Kentucky Revised Statutes 304.39-050(1) provides that the applicable insurance in auto accidents involving pedestrians is that covering the auto, but also claimed benefits under Tangerman\u2019s policy in the event that coverage was not provided under Gee\u2019s policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b740-7\">. The District Court initially granted summary judgment for the government on the basis of a medical expense, death and disability provision, but then vacated that judgment and entered judgment for Allstate when Allstate moved for a new trial on the ground that neither Gee nor Tangerman\u2019s policy included the medical expense coverage, but only the PIP endorsement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b740-8\">. The PIP endorsement reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-9\">Allstate will pay, in accordance with the Kentucky Revised Statutes Chapter 304, Sub Title 29, personal injury protection benefits for (A) MEDICAL EXPENSE,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-10\">(b) WORK LOSS...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-11\">incurred with respect to BODILY INJURY sustained by an ELIGIBLE INJURED PERSON and caused by an accident arising out of the operation, maintenance or use of a MOTOR VEHICLE as a vehicle.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b740-12\">. In pertinent part, \u00a7 304.39-020(2) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-15\">(2) \u201cBasic reparation benefits\u201d mean benefits providing reimbursement for net loss suffered through injury arising out of the operation, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle____ The maximum amount of basic reparation benefits payable for all economic loss resulting from injury to any one person as the result of one (1) accident shall be ten thousand dollars ($10,000), regardless of the number of persons entitled to such benefits or the number of providers of security obligated to pay such benefits. Basic reparation benefits consist of one (1) or more of the elements defined as \"loss.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-17\">Section 304.39-020(5)(a) then defines loss in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-18\">(5) \u201cLoss\u201d means accrued economic loss consisting only of medical expense, work loss, replacement services loss and, if injury causes death, survivor\u2019s economic loss and survivor\u2019s replacement services loss. Noneconomic detriment is not loss. However, economic loss is loss although caused by pain and suffering or physical impairment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-19\">(a) \"Medical expense\u201d means reasonable charges incurred for reasonably needed products, services, and accommodations, including those for medical care____</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b740-20\">. We certified these questions to the Kentucky Supreme Court, but that court declined to answer them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b741-7\">a. Section 304.39-080(5) sets forth the statutory insurance requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-9\">[EJvery owner of a motor vehicle registered in this Commonwealth or operated in this Commonwealth by him or with his permission, shall continuously provide with respect to the motor vehicle ... by a contract of insurance or by qualifying as a self-insurer, security for the payment of basic reparation benefits in accordance with this subtitle and security for payment of tort liabilities, arising from maintenance or use of the motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b742-6\">b. The District Court similarly found that only those persons who are injured or survivors may claim basic reparation benefits, including medical expense, not all those \"suffering loss from injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"AC\">. As relevant, \u00a7 304.39-060 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An\">(1) Any person who registers, operates, maintains or uses a motor vehicle on the public roadways of this Commonwealth shall, as a condition of such registration, operation, maintenance or use of such motor vehicle and use of the public roadways, be deemed to have accepted the provisions of this subtitle, and in particular those provisions which are contained in this section,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5\">(2)(a) Tort liability with respect to accidents occurring in this Commonwealth and arising from the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle is \u201cabolished\" for damages because of bodily injury, sickness or disease to the extent the basic reparation benefits provided in this subtitle are payable therefore____</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b743-6\">a. The <em>Dairyland </em>decision rested also on a provision in the North Dakota statute limiting recovery to loss \"sustained by an injured person or his dependent survivors or incurred on his behalf by his spouse, relatives, or guardian.\u201d While this sort of provision is not found in the Kentucky statute, we think that the policy it expresses is that which the Kentucky legislature intended.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b743-12\">. The government suggests that denying it a right to recover benefits necessarily implies that a parent will be unable to recover the cost of her child\u2019s care. This issue is not before us for decision, and we note also that state law generally provides for the direct right of parents to recover on behalf of their children. <em>See, e.g., Atlanta Casualty Co. v. Jones, </em>247 Ga. 238, 275 S.E.2d 328, 330 (1981) (allowing a parent to recover her child\u2019s medical expenses under a no-fault automobile policy).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b743-10\">WELLFORD, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A3z\">dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">I agree with the majority that the government should not be entitled to recover as a third party beneficiary of the insurance contract. However, I cannot agree that the government should not be allowed reimbursement under the Kentucky no-fault statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>In <em>United States v. Government Employees Ins. Co., </em>605 F.2d 669 (2d Cir.1979), the Second Circuit held that under the New York no-fault statute, the government could recover from an insurer medical expenses paid out for a serviceman\u2019s injuries. The relevant language of that statutory scheme was explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-4\">Section 672(l)(a) of New York\u2019s no-fault law provides, in part, that every no-fault insurance policy should provide for the payment of certain statutory benefits to <em>\u201cpersons, </em>other than occupants of another motor vehicle or a motorcycle, for loss arising out of the use or occupation in [New York] of [the insured] motor vehicle....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 670 (emphasis added and brackets original) (quoting N.Y.Ins.Law \u00a7 672(l)(a) (McKinney Supp.1978)). The court concluded that the term \u201cpersons\u201d was not limited to living beings, and thus the government could not be precluded from recovery on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">The court next decided that the government could recover despite the absence of physical injury to itself. Under the New York statutory scheme, the benefits to be paid out are essentially defined as including \u201cpayments to reimburse a person for basic economic loss on account of personal injury arising out of the use or operation of a motor vehicle.\u201d 605 F.2d at 671 (quoting N.Y.Ins.Law \u00a7 671(2)). This definition, the court found, was not limited to payments made solely because of personal physical injury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-7\">The broad language of section 672(l)(a) suggest [sic] that a third party claimant who incurs the medical costs of an accident victim may recover those expenses under this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">605 F.2d at 671. Thus, the government\u2019s payments for a serviceman\u2019s injuries were found not to be excluded, and could be recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">It is important to note in considering the above rationale that Kentucky\u2019s no-fault statute is similar to that of New York, and is subject to much the same analysis. Kentucky grants the relevant right to benefits in Ky.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 304.39-030(1) (Michie 1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-12\">If the accident causing injury occurs in this Commonwealth <em>every person </em>suffering <em>loss from injury </em>arising out of maintenance or use of a motor vehicle has a right to <em>basic reparation </em>benefits,____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-14\">(Emphasis added). \u201cInjury\u201d is defined as meaning \u201cbodily harm, sickness, disease, or death.\u201d Ky.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 304.39-020(4). \u201cLoss,\u201d in turn, is defined as being \u201caccrued economic loss consisting only of medical expense, work loss, replacement service loss; and, if injury .causes death, survivor\u2019s economic loss and survivor\u2019s replacement services loss.\u201d Ky.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 304.39-020(5). Thus, in sum, \u201closs from injury\u201d is economic loss resulting from bodily harm, sickness, disease or death (\u201cphysical injury\u201d). There can be no doubt that the government, by paying for the serviceman\u2019s medical care,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> has suffered economic loss by reason of a physical injury suffered by the serviceman.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-15\">The fact that the physical injury resulting in the loss was not inflicted directly upon the government itself does not defeat the government\u2019s claim. As was the case in <em>Government Employees, </em>the no-fault statute nowhere requires that the person physically injured be the same \u201cperson\u201d suffering the economic loss. In fact, section 304.39-020(5) (defining loss) expressly includes the economic loss borne by a survivor, one not personally physically injured. Any argument that the party bearing the economic loss must also be the person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>physically injured is thus patently inconsistent with the statutory language.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">The last question that must be answered is whether the government qualifies as a \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of Kentucky\u2019s no-fault statute. \u201cPerson\u201d is not defined in the Act. Section 304.39-030(1), however, purports to encompass <em>\u201cevery </em>person.\u201d First, consistent with the immediately preceding discussion, this choice of language would seem to indicate clearly that all parties suffering economic loss, even those not personally physically injured, receive compensation. Second, the legislature, in another context, limited specifically those who could receive compensation; where the accident occurs out-of-state, only</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2G\">the <em>following persons ... </em>suffering loss from injury ... have a right to basic reparation benefits:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">(a) Basic reparation insureds; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-7\">(b) The driver and other occupants of a secured vehicle____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">Ky.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 304.39-030(2) (emphasis added). \u201cBasic reparation insureds\u201d are defined as those persons named on the insurance contract and the family members of those named persons. Ky.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 304.39-020(3). Thus, where the accident occurs out-of-state, only a select group of persons may recover reparation benefits. Where the accident occurs in-state, as here, \u201cevery person\u201d who otherwise qualifies may recover. The coverage of section 304.-39-030(1) (applying to in-state accidents) is broader than the coverage provided by section 304.39-030(2) (applying to out-of-state accidents). I find it logical, therefore, to infer that the class of \u201cevery person\u201d was intended to include entities other than living beings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Government Employees, </em>605 F.2d at 671.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">Accordingly, the government qualifies as a \u201cperson\u201d entitled to reparation benefits. This analysis is consistent with the no-fault statute policy of spreading liability among a large class of individuals, and is also consistent with the policy of compensating promptly those who have suffered economic loss. Further, such an interpretation will in no way influence the government\u2019s decision whether to pay, or not to pay, injured servicemen. Indeed, the fact that the government might be reimbursed would only encourage prompt payment and could only enhance prompt reparation for needed medical care for those injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-15\">The equities in this case clearly weigh in favor of the government. Should the government not be able to recover, the insurer experiences a two-fold windfall. First, it is relieved of paying that which it would otherwise have been required to pay had there been no third-party payment. Second, the insurer keeps premiums paid not only by the injured serviceman, but also those paid by the driver of the automobile, and the government is forced to bear a burden which should rightfully fall on the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-16\">In <em>United States v. Dairyland Ins. Co., </em>674 F.2d 750 (8th Cir.1982), after interpreting the North Dakota no-fault statute, the court concluded that the government was not entitled to reimbursement for expenses paid for a serviceman\u2019s medical needs. In that case, however, recovery was limited to loss \u201csustained by an injured person \u2018or his dependent survivors or incurred on his behalf by his spouse, relatives, or guardian.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 753 (quoting N.D.Cent.Code \u00a7 26-41-09). That language is more restrictive than that of the Kentucky statute previously analyzed (\u201cevery person\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-17\">Similarly, in <em>Heusle v. National Mutual Ins. Co., </em>628 F.2d 833, 839 (3d Cir.1980), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>the Pennsylvania no-fault statute included a provision expressly relieving the insurer of liability for amounts paid by \u201cany government.\u201d <em>See </em>Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 40, \u00a7 1009.206(a) (Purdon Supp.1980). The Kentucky no-fault law contains no such provision. <em>Heusle </em>is therefore inapplicable to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">For these reasons I respectfully dissent; I would reverse the judgment of the district court, and render judgment for the government.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b744-9\">. I take note of the reference in note 1 of the majority opinion to 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1074(a). I have difficulty, however, with the government\u2019s apparent interpretation that \u00a7 1074(a) <em>requires </em>it to pay for \"privately provided care.\u201d I accordingly have doubt, as set out by the majority in Part II of its opinion, that the government \"was legally obligated to provide free medical care\u201d if it is referring to care at Louisville General Hospital, a private hospital, where Tangerman was treated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b745-11\">. As set out in section 304.39-030(1), a person suffering economic loss by reason of physical injury is entitled to \"basic reparation benefits.\u201d These benefits are defined as \u201cbenefits providing reimbursement for net loss suffered through injury____\u201d Ky.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 304.39-020(2). This language is consistent with the conclusion that the government has suffered \u2018loss from injury.\u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b745-18\">. <em>Gregory v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em>618 S.W.2d 582 (Ky.Ct.App.1981), does not require a different result. That case dealt with whether a decedent\u2019s estate could recover for \"work loss\u201d under the no-fault statute. The court concluded it could not, relying heavily on the fact that an estate is not a \u201csurvivor,\u201d and also relying on its interpretation of \"work loss.\u201d These statutory terms are not implicated in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
