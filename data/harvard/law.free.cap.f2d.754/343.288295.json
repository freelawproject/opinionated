The Board sustained his demotion under reduction-in-force (RIF) procedures from a Grade 11 position to a Grade 9 position. We affirm,</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Agb\">Madsen was employed by the Veterans Administration (agency) as a Field Section Supervisor, GS-1801-11, at the agency\u2019s regional office in Lincoln, Nebraska. Effective August 21, 1983, Madsen was displaced (bumped) from this position by an employee from the same competitive level who was in a higher retention subgroup (IA to Madsen\u2019s IB) under 5 C-F-R- \u00a7 35L' 7f.(a)(A&gt; (1983). This displacement result- <em>^ </em>m Madsen s demotion by the agency to ^position of Contact Representative, GS-</p>\n<p id=\"AYC\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"A5j\">Madsen asserts that (1) the employee who bumped him during tbe RIF wag ag. signed to a position improperly classified at the Grade n level; (2) the employee who bumped him wag n(jt ag qualified as Mad_ sen since the bumping employee possessed ordy the minimum qualifications for the position; and (3) the agency should not have resorted to RIF procedures but, rather, should have restructured its work force.</p>\n<p id=\"Axj\">With respect to Madsen\u2019s first contention, the Board correctly determined that the question of the classification of the position held by the displacing employee was n\u00b0t within its jurisdiction. The Board possesses limited jurisdiction over appeals instituted by federal employees under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(a) and can only hear appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>instituted by employees who are specifically granted appeal rights thereunder. <em>E.g., Cowan v. United States, </em>710 F.2d 803 (Fed.Cir.1983). We find no statute or regulation which empowers the Board to review (within the context of an adverse action appeal) the merits of an agency\u2019s prior decision concerning the classification of the bumping employee\u2019s position or his qualifications for that position. <em>Cf. Brace v. Department of Housing and Urban Development, </em>11 MSPB 451, (1982), <em>aff'd, </em>No. 83-580 (Fed.Cir. June 3, 1983) (unreported). Accordingly, the Board correctly refused to address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">Madsen\u2019s second contention, that he was more qualified than the displacing employee to perform the duties assigned to a Field Supervisor, was considered, and properly rejected, by the Board. Madsen does not contend that the bumping employee was unqualified for the position, only that Madsen was better qualified. An employee is qualified for assignment under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.701 if the employee \u201cmeets the OPM standards and requirements for the position.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.702(a) (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Finally, Madsen\u2019s assertion that the agency should have avoided a RIF was also correctly rejected by the Board. Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.201(b) (1983), an agency is not required, in conducting RIFs, to fill vacant positions. In addition, an agency, in deciding how to structure the workplace, is given wide discretion in determining which individuals are best qualified to perform particular functions. <em>Wilmot v. United States, </em>205 Ct.Cl. 666 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">\u201cAn agency is accorded wide discretion in conducting a reduction in force; absent a clear abuse of that discretion, a substantial departure from applicable procedures, a misconstruction of governing statutes, or the like, we do not upset a final agency decision.\u201d <em>Cooper v. Tennessee Valley Authority, </em>723 F.2d 1560, 1562 (Fed.Cir.1983) (quoting <em>Dancy v. United States, </em>668 F.2d 1224,1226, 229 Ct.Cl. 300 (1982)). Under this limited scope of judicial review, we have no basis for overturning the agency\u2019s action in demoting Madsen pursuant to the RIF.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
