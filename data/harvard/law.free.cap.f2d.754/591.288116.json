Plaintiff-appellant Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. (Fuji) and defendant-appellee Shinohara Shoji Kabushiki Kaisha (Shinohara) each alleged trademark infringement and unfair competition by the other under federal, state, and common law. Both now appeal the decision of the trial court that Fuji take nothing by its claim against Shinohara, and Shinohara take nothing by its counterclaim against Fuji. Shinohara also appeals the trial court\u2019s denial of its request for attorneys\u2019 fees. We reverse as to Fuji's claim, and affirm as to Shinohara\u2019s counterclaim and request for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">Fuji is a Japanese corporation founded circa 1934 which has used \u201cFUJI\u201d as its tradename and as a trademark on its products since its inception. Fuji makes various products related to photography and graphic arts, all of which it sells in the United States through its wholly-owned subsidiary Fuji Photo Film U.S.A., Inc. (Fuji USA), a New York corporation. Fuji obtained its first United States registered trademark, \u201cFUJI\u201d, for photographic chemicals, in December 1954. Between 1954 and 1972, Fuji obtained nine United States registered trademarks for \u201cFUJI\u201d or composite words containing \u201cFUJI\u201d, these registrations covering a variety of photography-related products, some of which are used in the offset printing process. Fuji products have been sold in the United States under the \u201cFUJI\u201d trademark since 1954; since 1965, those relating to graphic arts (rather than amateur photography) have been sold here by Roberts &amp; Porter (Roberts), an Illinois corporation which buys them from Fuji USA.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-13\">All of Fuji\u2019s products are of the highest quality and have an international reputation for excellence; Fuji won an academy award in 1982 and its \u201cFUJI\u201d film was the official film of the 1984 Summer Olympics. As these facts indicate, Fuji spends a lot of money on advertising (in the millions of dollars); its annual sales in the United States are in the billions of dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-14\">Shinohara is also a Japanese corporation, founded in 1919. It has been making and selling printing presses since 1947. These presses have been trademarked \u201cFUJI\u201d in Japan since 1961. Its first United States sale of a printing press occurred in January 1978.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Shinohara filed five applications in 1980 to register the trademark \u201cFUJI\u201d, standing alone or with additional words, in the United States. Fuji has filed oppositions to each of these applications; action on the oppositions has been suspended pending the outcome of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-15\">Shinohara presses are sold in the United States by three companies, including Sundman International, Inc. (Sundman) and defendant Graphic Machinery International, Inc. (Graphic). Fuji first became aware of Shinohara\u2019s use of the \u201cFUJI\u201d mark in the United States in 1978, when both Sundman and Roberts exhibited their principals\u2019 products at a California trade fair. At that time, Sundman\u2019s corporate name was Fuji Graphics, Inc. Sundman\u2019s display of \u201cFUJI\u201d presses and \u201cFUJI\u201d brochures alarmed the Roberts representatives, who thought that Fuji had reneged on its exclusive distribution arrangement with them. Visitors to the show also inquired about the connection between the two \u201cFUJIs\u201d. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>There was thus actual confusion at the trade show.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">After the show, reports of Sundman\u2019s and Shinohara\u2019s use of \u201cFUJI\u201d in the United States sped quickly up the Roberts chain of command and thence up that of Fuji. When the news reached Fuji\u2019s supervisor of trademarks, he wrote letters to and met with his opposite number at Shinohara. The substance of these communications is disputed. It is undisputed that Fuji then brought an action in the United States district court for the central district of California against Fuji Graphics, Inc., Sundman\u2019s company,, alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition. Sundman and his lawyer \u201cpromptly traveled to Japan to explain the nature and possible consequences of such litigation, and to persuade the management of Shinohara to assume defense of the case,\u201d pursuant to the terms of their contract.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Shinohara was not persuaded and took no part in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">In August 1979, the trial court entered a consent judgment in which, among other things, Fuji\u2019s various \u201cFUJI\u201d trademarks were found valid, Fuji was found to be the owner of the \u201cFUJI\u201d trademark as applied to graphic arts equipment and materials, and the defendant admitted that his corporate name and the Shinohara \u201cFUJI\u201d materials infringed Fuji\u2019s trademarks. The defendant and \u201cany and all persons in active concert or participation with it\u201d were permanently enjoined from use of the name \u201cFUJI\u201d and from sale, distribution or advertising of graphic arts-related products bearing or including the name \u201cFUJI\u201d. In compliance with the terms of the judgment, Sundman changed the name of his company and asked Shinohara to stop sending him products marked \u201cFUJI\u201d. Shinohara continued to send them, and Sundman to deal in them. In an order entered in September 1980, the court held Sundman in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">In July 1980, another Roberts representative saw more offset presses marked \u201cFUJI\u201d at another trade show, this time in Texas. The sight engendered the same series of reactions, resulting in this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">\n<em>Likelihood of Confusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">Section 32(1) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1), governs suit for infringement of a registered trademark.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE8\">Prior to 1962, \u00a7 1114(1) provided that the use of the mark must be \u2018likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive purchasers as to the source or origin of such goods or services.\u2019 (emphasis added). In 1962, it was amended to delete the underlined portion. Although this amendment \u2018clearly broadened the protection afforded by the statute,\u2019 it is equally clear that this amendment did not delete the confusion requirement entirely, and that a claimant must still prove a likelihood of confusion, mistake or deceit of \u2018typical\u2019 purchasers, or potential purchasers, as to the connection of the trademark owner with' the infringing product.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-13\"><em>Supreme Assembly, Order of Rainbow for Girls v. J.H. Ray Jewelry Co., </em>676 F.2d 1079, 1082 n. 3 (5th Cir.1982) (citations omitted). \u201cLikelihood of confusion\u201d is thus the central issue in any suit for trademark infringement, as it is in suits for unfair competition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Fuji contends that the trial court used the wrong legal standard to determine likelihood of confusion. We are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>convinced by our review of the record that this point is well taken.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">The trial court correctly identified the factors to be considered in determining likelihood of confusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\">(a) type of trademark, that is, the strength of the prior owner\u2019s mark;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">(b) degree of similarity between the two marks;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-7\">(c) similarity between the two products;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-8\">(d) identity of retail outlets and purchasers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-9\">(e) identity of advertising media utilized;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-10\">(f) defendant\u2019s intent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-11\">(g) actual confusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-12\"><em>Armco, Inc. v. Armco Burglar Alarm, Inc., </em>693 F.2d 1155, 1159 (5th Cir.1982). The court then, however, apparently cast aside these factors, holding for defendants because \u201cthere is no likelihood of confusion between the Plaintiff\u2019s products and Shinohara\u2019s printing presses.\u201d It is obviously true that no one is likely to confuse a printing press with the equipment used in its operation. It is also irrelevant except as bearing on the third factor to be considered, similarity of products. The \u201cmost decisive factor\u201d to the trial court was one that did not appear on the list, the sophistication of the buyers of Shinohara\u2019s presses, and the high cost of these presses. Even assuming purchaser sophistication and product cost to be proper subjects of inquiry, it is clearly necessary to consider each with respect to each party\u2019s products. Here, the trial court erred by stopping at Shinohara\u2019s presses, and by equating the admitted technical sophistication of press purchasers with trademark sophistication. It is well settled that expertise in the field of trademarks cannot be inferred from expertise in another area. <em>See, e.g., AMF, Inc. v. Sleekcraft Boats, </em>599 F.2d 341, 353 (9th Cir.1979); <em>Omega Importing Corp. v. Petri-Kine Camera Co., </em>451 F.2d 1190, 1195 (2d Cir. 1971); <em>Communications Satellite Corp. v. Comcet, Inc., </em>429 F.2d 1245, 1252-53 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 942, 91 S.Ct. 240, 27 L.Ed.2d 245 (1970) (collecting cases and authorities); <em>American Drill Bushing Co. v. Rockwell Manufacturing Co., </em>342 F.2d 1019, 1022, CCPA 1173 (1965); <em>Koppers Company, Inc. v. Krupp-Koppers GmbH, </em>517 F.Supp. 836, 845 (W.D.Pa.1981). (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-15\">We may assume the purchasers of presses to be sophisticated about printing; we may also assume that presses, which cost tens of thousands of dollars, are not bought on impulse, but rather with a great deal of care. We may not assume that these facts are determinative. As stated by the Court of Custom and Patent Appeals, in a case dealing with expensive, complex, and complementary electrical products,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-16\">[We] are of the opinion that the goods are so closely related that purchasers of the respective products could reasonably expect them to have a common source in view of a similarity of the marks. The products are well within the field of electrical apparatus and in some instances devices similar to those manufactured by appellee are used in connection with the various items produced by appellant____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0B\">It is true that in most instances technicians would use the products of either party and they are a discriminating group of people but that does not elimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>nate the likelihood of purchaser confusion here. Being skilled in their own art does not necessarily preclude their mistaking one trademark for another when the marks are similar as those here in issue, and cover merchandise in the same general field.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-4\"><em>Wincharger Corp. v. Rinco, Inc., </em>297 F.2d 261, 264, 49 CCPA 849 (C.C.P.A.1962). <em>See also Gotrian, Helfferich, Schulz, etc. v. Steinway &amp; Sons, </em>523 F.2d 1331, 1342 (2d Cir.1975). In <em>Wincharger </em>(and in <em>Gotrian), </em>the products of both parties were approximately equal in cost and complexity. Here, by contrast, Fuji\u2019s graphic arts materials are of negligible cost and complexity when compared with Shinohara\u2019s presses. The significance of this difference, overlooked by the trial court, was not lost on Shinohara, which correctly, if perversely, noted that \u201c[tjhere is absolutely no evidence in this case to show that a busy printer will bother to investigate any of the supplies which he uses. Accordingly, there is nothing in the record to support the District Court\u2019s presumption that commercial printers are expert and sophisticated as to offset plates, cleaning fluids, and other <em>non-photographic </em>materials which Plaintiff sells to printers under the \u2018Fuji\u2019 trademark.\u201d The trial court neglected this point because it apparently understood \u201clikelihood of confusion\u201d to mean only confusion <em>by the purchasers of Shinohara\u2019s presses </em>as to the source of those presses. Such is not the ease; the broad language of \u00a7 1114(1) clearly encompasses confusion on the part of purchasers of <em>either </em>(or both) party\u2019s products. Moreover, this Court has recognized that an action will lie \u201cwhen the infringer\u2019s use of plaintiff\u2019s mark results in confusion as to the origin of <em>plaintiffs </em>product.\u201d <em>Capital Films Corp. v. Charles Fries Productions, </em>628 F.2d 387, 393 (5th Cir.1980), <em>quoting Big O Tire Dealers, Inc. v. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., </em>561 F.2d 1365, 1371 (10th Cir.1977), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>434 U.S. 1052, 98 S.Ct. 905, 54 L.Ed.2d 805 (1978) (emphasis added); <em>see Plus Products v. Plus Discount Foods, Inc., </em>564 F.Supp. 984, 989 and n. 4 (S.D.N. Y.1983), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>722 F.2d 999 (2d Cir.1983) (recognizing \u201creverse confusion,\u201d 722 F.2d at 1003-04 and n. 6); <em>compare Victory Pipe Craftsmen, Inc. v. Faberge, Inc., </em>582 F.Supp. 551, 554-56 (N.D.Ill.1984); <em>Scott v. Mego International, Inc., </em>519 F.Supp. 1118, 1136 n. 21 (D.Minn.1981). Further, and perhaps more important, \u201clikelihood of confusion\u201d may be found absent confusion as to source; trademark infringement occurs also \u201cwhen the use sought to be enjoined is likely to confuse purchasers with respect to ... [the products\u2019] endorsement by the plaintiff, or its connection with the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Kentucky Fried Chicken, </em>549 F.2d at 388, <em>quoted in Supreme Assembly, </em>676 F.2d at 1082. The lack of care with which Fuji\u2019s products are purchased, coupled with Fuji\u2019s extensive advertising, could clearly conduce to confusion of this sort, yet the trial court apparently did not consider the possibility of its existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">It is thus clear that the trial court erred in grounding its finding of no likelihood of confusion primarily on the sophistication of printing press purchasers, and on the high cost of printing presses.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The second most important factor to the trial court was its \u201coverwhelming\u201d belief in Shinohara\u2019s good faith. This too was error. Good faith is not a defense to trademark infringement. <em>Pizzeria Uno Corp. v. Temple, </em>747 F.2d 1522, 1535 (4th Cir.1984); <em>Communications Satellite Corp. v. Comcet, Inc., </em>429 F.2d 1245, 1249 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 942, 91 S.Ct. 240, 27 L.Ed.2d 245 (1970); <em>Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co., </em>314 F.2d 149, 158 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>374 U.S. 830, 83 S.Ct. 1870, 10 L.Ed.2d 1053 (1963); <em>Best &amp; Co. v. Miller, </em>167 F.2d 374, 377 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>335 U.S. 818, 69 S.Ct. 39, 93 L.Ed. 373 (1948). The reason for this is clear: if potential purchasers are confused, no amount of good faith can make them less so. Bad faith, however, may, without more, prove infringement. <em>Amstar Corp. v. Domino\u2019s Pizza, Inc., </em>615 F.2d 252, 263 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 985, 101 S.Ct. 268, 66 L.Ed.2d 129 (1980). The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>court thus erred in grounding its finding of no confusion on Shinohara\u2019s good faith. As stated by the <em>Comcet </em>court, \u201c[w]hile evil intent may evidence unfair competition and deception, lack of guile is immaterial.\u201d <em>Id., </em>429 F.2d at 1249 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">Finally, the trial court appears to have believed that only actual confusion on the part of ultimate purchasers was relevant, and for this reason to have discounted the evidence (and its own findings) of actual confusion on the part of distributors and trade show visitors. This was error as well. Our cases have uniformly recognized evidence of actual confusion as the best evidence of likelihood of confusion. <em>Chevron Chemical Co. v. Voluntary Purchasing Groups, </em>659 F.2d 695, 704 (5th Cir. 1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>457 U.S. 1126, 102 S.Ct. 2947, 73 L.Ed.2d 1342 (1982); <em>Exxon Corp. v. Texas Motor Exchange, </em>628 F.2d 500, 506 (5th Cir.1980); <em>Roto-Rooter Corp. v. O\u2019Neal, </em>513 F.2d 44, 46 (5th Cir.1975); <em>World Carpets, Inc. v. Dick Littrell\u2019s New World Carpets, </em>438 F.2d 482, 489 (5th Cir. 1971). In no case have we sanctioned total disregard of evidence of actual confusion; there is simply no precedent for such a view, regardless of the identity of the person confused. To the contrary, we have stated that \u201cwhile very little proof of actual confusion would be necessary to prove the likelihood of confusion, an almost overwhelming amount of proof would be necessary to refute such proof.\u201d <em>World Carpets, </em>438 F.2d at 489. In <em>World Carpets, </em>moreover, the actual confusion was engendered in retailers rather than in the ultimate purchasers of carpets. <em>See also Union Carbide Corp. v. Ever-Ready, Inc., </em>531 F.2d 366, 384 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 830, 97 S.Ct. 91, 50 L.Ed.2d 94 (1976) and cases cited therein (confusion in consumers can be inferred from confusion in sales clerks); <em>Dr. Ing. H.C.F. Porsche AG v. Zim, </em>481 F.Supp. 1247, 1250 n. 4 (N.D.Tex.1979) (Higginbotham, J.); <em>Polo Fashions, Inc. v. Extra Special Products, Inc., </em>451 F.Supp. 555, 561 (S.D.N.Y.1978) (confusion in consumers can be inferred from confusion in plaintiffs distributors); <em>Waples-Platter Companies v. General Foods Corp., </em>439 F.Supp. 551, 582 (N.D.Tex.1977) (consumer confusion inferred from retailer confusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we hold that the trial court used the wrong standard to determine likelihood of confusion. The three factors cited as crucial to its determination were not the proper ones for consideration. A judgment based on a finding \u201cinduced by or resulting from a misapprehension of controlling substantive principles\u201d cannot stand. <em>Continental Motors, </em>375 F.2d at 859, <em>quoting Fulton National Bank v. Tate, </em>363 F.2d 562, 567 (5th Cir.1966); <em>see Sicilia di R. Biebow &amp; Co. v. Cox, </em>732 F.2d 417, 431 (5th Cir.1984). The trial court\u2019s judgment for Shinohara on Fuji\u2019s claim must therefore be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Our conclusion would be no different were we bound by the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d rule, for a review of the entire evidence on which the trial court grounded its finding of no likelihood of confusion leaves us \u201cwith the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948), <em>quoted in Sun Banks of Florida v. Sun Federal Savings &amp; Loan, </em>651 F.2d 311, 315 (5th Cir.1981). The factors properly to be considered in determining likelihood of confusion, and their likely application to the facts here, may be summarized as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">a) Type of trademark: \u201cFUJI\u201d appears to be a strong mark because it is arbitrary as applied to graphic arts material and because of the lack of evidence of third-party use. <em>Armco, </em>693 F.2d at 1159, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">b) Degree of similarity between the two marks: they are identical, except that Shinohara uses slanted instead of perpendicular block print. They are, of course, completely identical when heard. <em>See Dr. Ing. H.C.F. Porsche, </em>481 F.Supp. at 1250 (auditory similarity an important factor); <em>see also Gotrian, </em>523 F.2d at 1340 (\u201ctrademarks, like small children, are not only seen but heard\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>c) Similarity between the two products: they are in some respects complementary; Shinohara\u2019s presses are useless without equipment and materials of the sort made by Fuji (among others); some of Fuji\u2019s products are useless without an offset press like Shinohara\u2019s. Complementary products have been held particularly susceptible to confusion. <em>See, e.g., In re Martin\u2019s Famous Pastry Shoppe, Inc., </em>748 F.2d 1565, 1567 (Fed.Cir.1984) (association of identical trademarks with bread and cheese likely to cause confusion when products not of common origin); <em>Interpace Corp. v. Lapp, Inc., </em>721 F.2d 460, 462 (3d Cir.1983) (\u201cthe closer the relationship between the products, and the more similar their sales contexts, the greater the likelihood of confusion\u201d); <em>Comcet, </em>429 F.2d at 1253, <em>citing Aunt Jemima Mills Co. v. Rigney &amp; Co., </em>247 F. 407, 159 CCPA 461 (2d Cir.1917), <em>cert. denied, </em>245 U.S. 672, 38 S.Ct. 222, 62 L.Ed. 540 (1918) (pancake flour and pancake syrup). This is especially true when, as here, the senior user is diversified. <em>Armco, </em>693 F.2d at 1161 (\u201c[diversification makes it more likely that a potential customer would associate the non-diversified company\u2019s services with the diversified company, even though the two companies do not actually compete\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">d) Identity of retail outlets and purchasers: some of the same companies sell \u2022presses like Shinohara\u2019s and related products like Fuji\u2019s. Inasmuch as one party\u2019s product is useless without that of the other, the same purchasers obviously buy both.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">e) Identity of advertising media utilized: Fuji and Shinohara advertise in the same trade journals. It is all too clear that they advertise at the same trade shows.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">f) Defendant\u2019s intent: assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the trial court was correct in finding Shinohara to have innocent intent, this factor drops out as Immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">g) Actual confusion: it is undisputed that both this and the preceding California litigation arose from incidents of actual confusion. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">As in <em>World Carpets, </em>no evidence has been produced here to \u201crefute the clear inference created by this proof of actual confusion.\u201d 438 F.2d at 489. The only factor suggesting support for the trial court\u2019s position is that the two products are not identical. The case law, however, has never required identity; widely divergent products have been held subject to confusion. <em>See, e.g., Interpace Corp. v.

Neither Shinohara nor the trial court cites any case in which no likelihood of confusion was found as to products useless without each other, bearing the same mark, advertised in the same media, sold by the same sellers to the same buyers, and as to which there has been undisputed actual confusion. We have found no such cases either, and therefore hold the trial court\u2019s finding of no likelihood of confusion to be clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">\n<em>The California Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Axm\">Fuji contends that the trial court erred in refusing to accord the California consent decree <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel effect; it is unnecessary to deal with this point in great detail because of the conclusions reached above. Shinohara was not a party to the California litigation; therefore, the consent decree could be <em>res judicata </em>as to Shinohara only if Sundman, the actual party defendant, was in privity with Shinohara or its virtual representa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>tive. <em>Hardy v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., </em>681 F.2d 334, 339-41 (5th Cir.1982). The trial court\u2019s finding that Sundman was not the virtual representative of Shinohara is one of fact, to be reviewed under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard. <em>Aero-jet General Corp. v. Askew, </em>511 F.2d 710, 719 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 908, 96 S.Ct. 210, 46 L.Ed.2d 137 (1975). Although we entertain grave doubts as to this finding, given the contractual relationship between the parties and undisputed evidence of communications concerning the litigation, we do not believe it to be clearly erroneous. The decision of the trial court to refuse the California judgment <em>res judicata </em>effect is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">We note, however, that the consent decree entered by the California court fulfilled the requirement set forth in <em>Kaspar Wire Works, Inc. v. Leco Engineering and Machinery, </em>575 F.2d 530, 542 (5th Cir. 1978), that \u201ca consent decree is not issue preclusive, <em>i.e., </em>does not act as collateral estoppel, in the absence of clear evidence concerning the parties\u2019 intention, including specific reference to the issues that it was intended to preclude.\u201d It is quite clear that the parties to the California consent decree intended it to preclude further litigation of Fuji\u2019s exclusive right to the \u201cFUJI\u201d trademark applied to graphic arts materials.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">\n<em>Foreign Trademark Usage</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">Fuji correctly assigns as error the trial court\u2019s admission of evidence of the parties\u2019 foreign trademark usage and occurrences. The concept of territoriality is basic to trademark law;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> trademark rights exist in each country solely according to that country\u2019s statutory scheme. <em>Ingenohl v. Walter E. Olsen &amp; Co., </em>273 U.S. 541, 544, 47 S.Ct. 451, 452, 71 L.Ed. 762 (1927). \u201cIt is well settled that foreign use is ineffectual to create trademark rights in the United States.\u201d <em>La Societe Anonyme des Parfums Le Galion v. Jean Patou, Inc., </em>495 F.2d 1265, 1270 n. 4 (2d Cir.1974) (citation omitted); <em>accord, Johnson &amp; Johnson v. Diaz, </em>339 F.Supp. 60, 63-64 (C.D.Cal.1971), <em>citing, inter alia, Le Blume Import Co. v. Coty, </em>293 F. 344 (2d Cir.1923). It is equally well settled that \u201cwhen trade-mark rights within the United States are being litigated in an American court, the decisions of foreign courts concerning the respective trade-mark rights of the parties are irrelevant and inadmissible.\u201d <em>Vanity Fair Mills v. T. Eaton Co., </em>234 F.2d 633, 639 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>352 U.S. 871, 77 S.Ct. 96, 1 L.Ed.2d 76 (1956), citing <em>George W. Luft Co. v.

These cases are perfectly good law; despite the absence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>comparable authority from this Circuit, their reasoning, and general principles of trademark law, compel the conclusion that it was error to admit evidence of the parties\u2019 foreign trademark practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">\n<em>Shinohara\u2019s Counterclaim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Shinohara contends that the trial court correctly found no likelihood of confusion between Fuji\u2019s products and its presses, but erred in finding no likelihood of confusion between Shinohara\u2019s presses and Fuji\u2019s products. This remarkable argument is premised on Shinohara\u2019s assertion of prior use of the \u201cFUJI\u201d mark on graphic arts materials, as evidenced by one sale of one non-offset press in Okinawa in 1967, during the United States occupation of that island. Shinohara claims that the occupation of Okinawa by the United States rendered Okinawa a part of the United States, and that its sale of one press in Okinawa was therefore a use in commerce in the United States within the meaning of \u00a7 1127 of the Lanham Act. Shinohara has provided no support for this proposition and we have found none; the question of Okinawa\u2019s status under the Lanham Act during the relevant period appears to be one of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">We are not, however, totally without guidance. During the American occupation, but before the signing of the peace treaty with Japan in 1952, the Ninth Circuit held Okinawa to be a \u201cforeign country\u201d for purposes of the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2671-2680. <em>Cobb v. United States, </em>191 F.2d 604 (9th Cir.1951), <em>cert. denied, </em>342 U.S. 913, 72 S.Ct. 360, 96 L.Ed. 683 (1952). Six years later, with the occupation still in force but after the signing of the peace treaty, the Fourth Circuit also held Okinawa to be a foreign country under the FTCA. <em>Burna v. United States, </em>240 F.2d 720 (4th Cir.1957). The <em>Buma </em>court quoted the statement of John Foster Dulles, United States delegate to the Japanese Peace Conference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-9\">Several of the Allied Powers urged that the treaty should require Japan to renounce its sovereignty over these islands in favor of United States sovereignty. Others suggested that these islands should be completely restored to Japan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-10\"><em>In the face of this division of Allied opinion, the United States felt that the best formula would be to permit Japan to retain residual </em>sovereignty____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-12\">240 F.2d at 721 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Both <em>Buma </em>and <em>Cobb </em>(Pope, J., concurring) quoted language from <em>Hichino Uyeno v. Acheson, </em>96 F.Supp. 510, 515 (W.D.Wash. 1951):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-13\">[I]t is obvious that the words \u201cforeign state\u201d are not words of art. In using them, the Congress did not have in mind the fine distinctions as to sovereignty of occupied and unoccupied countries which authorities on international law may have formulated. They used the word in the sense of \u201cotherness\u201d. When the Congress speaks of \u201cforeign state\u201d, it means a country which is not the United States or its possession or colony, \u2014 an alien country, \u2014 other than our own, bearing in mind that the average American, when he speaks of a \u201cforeigner\u201d means an alien, non-American.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-14\">So here, the interpretation called for is that of common speech and not that derived from abstract speculation on sovereignty as affected by foreign military occupation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-15\">In <em>Rose v. McNamara, </em>375 F.2d 924 (D.C.Cir.), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>389 U.S. 856, 88 S.Ct. 70, 19 L.Ed.2d 121 (1967), the District of Columbia Circuit similarly rejected the notion of Okinawa as part of the United States, explaining the relationship as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-16\">[W]e have, vis-a-vis Okinawa, been a most reluctant conqueror indeed. In the Treaty of Peace with Japan we signified our purpose not to hold Okinawa as a United States possession but to put it in due course under the United Nations trusteeship system. More latterly it has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>become a stated objective of our international policy to restore Okinawa to Japan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-4\">In the Executive Order issued in implementation of the Peace Treaty, President Eisenhower declared at the outset the amenability of its provisions to action by Congress. Congress has, however, remained content for a decade to allow Okinawa to be governed under the terms of the Order. The reasons for this inaction are not hard to divine. They reflect what appears to be a national consensus that our possession of Okinawa is, by our own design, temporary; and that a wise concept of our foreign relations points in the direction of its being returned, sooner rather than later, to a Japan which has, in no small part because of a host of similar forbearances on our part, become a strong bulwark of the free world in the Far East. In this posture, when our friends in Japan look expectantly to an early restoration of these islands, the assertion by Congress of its authority to create permanent and detailed laws for the government of the Ryukyus would be as impolitic as it would, hopefullly [sic], be short-lived and thereby wasteful of Congressional energies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">375 F.2d at 928 (footnotes omitted). The <em>Rose </em>court further noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgY\">President Kennedy, in a statement to accompany Exec. Order No. 11010, March 16, 1962, which amended President Eisenhower\u2019s original order setting up the Government of the Ryukyus, declared it to be the public policy of the United States that we recognize the Ryukyus as \u201ca part of the Japanese homeland and look forward to the day when the security of the Free World will permit their restoration to full Japanese sovereignty.\u201d 1962 Public Papers of the Presidents 247-48. For similar statements, see 48 Dep\u2019t State Bull. 770 (1962) (referring to \u201cthe anticipated eventual restoration of these islands to Japanese administration\u201d); 45 Dep\u2019t State Bull. 57-58 (1961); 37 Dep\u2019t State Bull. 52 (1957).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-10\"><em>Id. </em>at n. 7. We are persuaded by these cases, and by the authoritative statements on which their holdings were grounded, that the United States did not encompass Okinawa in 1967 for purposes of the Lanham Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Shinohara\u2019s sale of a press trademarked \u201cFUJI\u201d in Okinawa in 1967 was not, therefore, a use in commerce in the United States; it did not and could not establish Shinohara as the prior user of the \u201cFUJI\u201d mark here.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s judgment that Shinohara take nothing by its counterclaim was thus correct, and we affirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">\n<em>Attorneys\u2019 Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b677-12\">Under \u00a7 1117 of the Lanham Act, attorneys\u2019 fees may be awarded in an \u201cexceptional case.\u201d Shinohara contends that this was such a case, and that the trial court erred in denying it attorneys\u2019 fees. Shino<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>hara\u2019s contention is without merit. A trademark holder is required to police his mark; else, it may become generic,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> diluted, or otherwise lessened in value. The trial court found that Fuji acted in good faith in bringing this action; its finding was clearly correct. The trial court\u2019s denial of attorneys\u2019 fees to Shinohara was thus correct as well, and we affirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">The judgment of the trial court for defendant-appellee Shinohara on plaintiff-appellant Fuji\u2019s claim is REVERSED, and the cause is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The judgment of the trial court as to Shinohara\u2019s counterclaim and request for attorneys\u2019 fees is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">REVERSED in part, AFFIRMED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b669-10\">.

The contract between Shinohara and Sundman contained the following clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-7\">7.

Because all of the claims asserted by the parties here hinge on the same issue, likelihood of confusion, we do not consider them separately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b671-13\">. In this Circuit, a trial court\u2019s determination of likelihood of confusion is ordinarily a finding of fact, reviewable under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Civ.P. <em>Louisiana World Exposition v. Logue, </em>746 F.2d 1033, 1039 (5th Cir.1984); <em>compare Giant Food, Inc. v. Nation's Foodservice, Inc., </em>710 F.2d 1565, 1569 (Fed.Cir.1983) (likelihood of confusion is question of law); <em>Alpha Industries v. Alpha Steel Tube &amp; Shapes, Inc., </em>616 F.2d 440, 443-44 (9th Cir.1980) (same); <em>see also Security Center, Ltd. v. First Nat. Sec. Centers, </em>750 F.2d 1295 at 1297 n. 3 (5th Cir.1985). The \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d rule does not apply, however, to determinations reached by application of an incorrect legal standard. <em>Falcon Rice Mill, Inc. v. Community Rice Mill, Inc., </em>725 F.2d 336, 344 and n. 7 (5th Cir.1984); <em>Kentucky Fried Chicken Corp. v.

Our conclusion that the trial court applied the wrong legal standard in determining likelihood of confusion in this case thus requires us to review its conclusion <em>de novo.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b675-5\">.

This conclusion is buttressed by trademark practice in Okinawa at the time in question. Those wishing to register trademarks in Okinawa during the American occupation did so through a special office established for that purpose in Okinawa, rather than through the United States Patent and Trademark Office. At the close of the American occupation, all trademarks so registered were transferred to the Japanese Trademark Office in Tokyo. We are indebted to Ms. Cathy Blowers of the Embassy of Japan for this information, which seems clearly to indicate that no United States trademark rights were created by trademark usage in Okinawa.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b677-8\">. In any event, it is far from clear that one United States sale, not followed by another for eleven years, would be sufficient to create United States trademark rights. The \"token use\" doctrine might well preclude a claim of prior use in these circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Ralston Purina Co. v. On-Cor Frozen Foods, Inc., </em>746 F.2d 801, 804 (Fed.Cir.1984); <em>Exxon Corp. v. Humble Exploration Co., </em>695 F.2d 96, 99-100 (5th Cir.1983); <em>La Societe Anonyme des Parfums Le Galion v.
