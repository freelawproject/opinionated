We conclude that the constitutional right was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1513\">*1513</page-number>clearly established at the time of the hair cut because courts had failed to develop a clear standard of legal analysis in prisoner free expression cases. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-5\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-6\">Appellant Capoeman is a Quinault Indian who wears his hair long as an expression of his religious beliefs and cultural identity. In 1981 he was convicted in state court and sentenced to confinement in a Washington state facility. Capoeman was ordered to submit to a haircut to enable officials to take a \u201cbefore and after\u201d photograph for identification purposes. Capoeman immediately objected on religious grounds and offered to tie his hair back for the photo. Capoeman continued for the next week resisting the haircut. He made his views known to defendants and cited to them the leading authority for his position, <em>Teterud v. Burns, </em>522 F.2d 357 (8th Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-7\">On January 30,1981 correctional officers took Capoeman from his cell to cut his hair. Capoeman did not resist physically but did continue to assert that cutting his hair was in violation of his constitutional rights. He offered to go into the segregation unit until the matter could be resolved. Despite the protests Capoeman\u2019s hair was cut.</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-8\">The prison\u2019s policy on haircuts was amended in May 1982 to exempt inmates who are members of recognized Indian tribes. Capoeman was released from prison in 1983 when his conviction was reversed by the Washington Court of Appeals. Shortly thereafter he filed this civil rights action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and damages for the alleged violation of his first amendment right to the free exercise of religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-9\">Following cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court issued an opinion concluding that (1) Capoeman\u2019s claim for injunctive relief was made moot by the change of policy and by his release; (2) the forced cutting of Capoeman\u2019s hair after his protestations \u201cconstituted a serious violation of his constitutional rights at the hands of state officials\u201d; and (3) defendants were immune from damages because the constitutional right at issue was not \u201cclearly established\u201d at the time of the incident. On appeal the only issue is whether the district court properly concluded that the defendants were immune from damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-12\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-13\">In reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we need only decide whether there exists any material disputed fact and whether the substantive law was correctly applied. <em>Amaro v. Continental Can Co., </em>724 F.2d 747, 749 (9th Cir.1984). There are no disputed facts here. Accordingly we must determine as a matter of law whether defendants are entitled to immunity. <em>Bilbrey by Bilbrey v. Brown, </em>738 F.2d 1462, 1465 n. 5 (9th Cir.1984). Questions of law are freely reviewed. <em>United States v. McConney, </em>728 F.2d 1195, 1201 (9th Cir.) <em>(en </em>banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 105 S.Ct. 101, 83 L.Ed.2d 46 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-16\">B. Qualified Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b1589-17\">Even defendants who violate constitutional rights enjoy a qualified immunity that protects them from liability for damages \u201cunless it is further demonstrated that their conduct was unreasonable under the applicable standard.\u201d <em>Davis v. Scherer, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 104 S.Ct. 3012, 3018, 82 L.Ed.2d 139 (1984). The applicable standard is defined in <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800,102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). There the Court eliminated the subjective \u201cmalicious intention\u201d requirement articulated in <em>Wood v. Strickland, </em>420 U.S. 308, 95 S.Ct. 992, 43 L.Ed.2d 214 (1975), in favor of an objective test. See <em>Cinevision Corp. v. City of Burbank, </em>745 F.2d 560, 578 n. 24 (9th Cir.1984) <em>(Harlow </em>eliminated subjective test); <em>Albers v. Whit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1514\">*1514</page-number><em>ley, </em>743 F.2d 1372, 1376 (9th Cir.1984) (describing <em>Harlow </em>standard as objective). Under <em>Harlow\u2019s </em>objective standard \u201cgovernment officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Harlow, </em>457 U.S. at 818, 102 S.Ct. at 2738.</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-4\">The district court examined whether at the time of the incident there was a \u201cclearly established\u201d right retained by prison inmates to refuse haircuts on religious grounds. The court found that on the date of the incident one published opinion from the Eighth Circuit and two opinions from the Second Circuit held that inmates legitimately could resist haircuts and shaves on religious grounds. Although there were no cases cited to the contrary and the district court found that the defendants should have \u201chesitated to act\u201d in the face of judicial authority adverse to their positions, the court nevertheless concluded that decisions from other circuits \u201ccannot constitute a \u2018clearly established\u2019 right of inmates not to have their hair cut.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-5\">We are initially faced with the task of defining <em>Harlow\u2019s </em>\u201cclearly established\u201d standard. Twice the Supreme Court avoided the task by finding it unnecessary to decide whether the \u201cstate of the law is evaluated by reference to the opinions of this Court, of the Courts of Appeals, or of the local District Court.\u201d <em>Procunier v. Navarette, </em>434 U.S. 555, 565, 98 S.Ct. 855, 861, 55 L.Ed.2d 24 (1978); <em>Harlow, </em>457 U.S. at 818, n. 32, 102 S.Ct. at 2739, n. 32 (quoted in part). Recently, the D.C. Circuit concluded that it is still not clear how a court should determine well-established rights. <em>Hobson v. Wilson, </em>737 F.2d 1, 25-26 (D.C.Cir.1984); <em>see also Zweibon v. Mitchell, </em>720 F.2d 162, 168-69 (D.C.Cir.1983) (\u201cclearly established law\u201d difficult to define), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 244, 83 L.Ed.2d 182 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-8\">In <em>Bilbrey, </em>738 F.2d at 1466, we sought to apply the <em>Harlow </em>standard. We found no explicit rulings by the Supreme Court or by this circuit concerning the legality of student searches. Nonetheless, we found that the basic fourth amendment rights of students had been sufficiently clearly established at the time to prevent the defendants\u2019 immunity. <em>Id. </em>In support of that conclusion, we reviewed decisions of state courts, another circuit and various district courts. <em>Id. We </em>conclude that in the absence of binding precedent, a court should look to whatever decisional law is available to ascertain whether the law is clearly established under the <em>Harlow </em>test. <em>Bilbrey, </em>738 F.2d at 1466. But see <em>Wallace v. King, </em>626 F.2d 1157, 1161 (4th Cir.1980) (immunity allowed where law not authoritatively decided by the Supreme Court, the \u201cappropriate\u201d court of appeals, or the highest state court), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 969, 101 S.Ct. 2045, 68 L.Ed.2d 348 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-9\">The relevant decisional law at the time of the incident here favors Capoeman\u2019s position. While early cases treated such prisoner claims as nearly frivolous, e.g., <em>Proffitt v. Ciccone, </em>506 F.2d 1020 (8th Cir.1974); <em>Brooks v. Wainwright, </em>428 F.2d 652 (5th Cir.1970) (per curiam), when the rights were later fully examined prison regulations were found to infringe impermissibly on prisoners\u2019 constitutional rights. <em>See Shabazz v. Barnauskas, </em>598 F.2d 345 (5th Cir.1979); <em>Burgin v. Henderson, </em>536 F.2d 501 (2d Cir.1976); <em>Teterud v. Burns, </em>522 F.2d 357 (8th Cir.1975); <em>Wright v. Raines, </em>457 F.Supp. 1082 (D.Ka.1978); <em>Moskowitz v. Wilkinson, </em>432 F.Supp. 947 (D.Conn. 1977); <em>Monroe v. Bombard, </em>422 F.Supp. 211 (S.D.N.Y.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1590-10\">We are aware that post-incident decisions are mixed. Courts have upheld prison hair and beard regulations against sincere first amendment religious challenges. <em>See Dreibelbis v. Marks, </em>742 F.2d 792 (3d Cir.1984); <em>Furgan v. Georgia State Board of Offender Rehabilitation, </em>554 F.Supp. 873, 879-80 (N.D.Ga.1982); <em>cf. Madyun v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1515\">*1515</page-number><em>Franzen, </em>704 F.2d 954, 960 (7th Cir.) (upholding state\u2019s legitimate interest in having female guards frisk male prisoners against petitioner\u2019s Islamic belief that such conduct is incompatible with religion), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 104 S.Ct. 493, 78 L.Ed.2d 687 (1983). Courts have also struck down prison regulations found to constitutionally infringe on a prisoner\u2019s right to the free exercise of his religion. <em>E.g. Barrett v. Virginia, </em>689 F.2d 498, 501-02 (4th Cir.1982) (name change); <em>Gallahan v. Hollyfield, </em>670 F.2d 1345 (4th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (hair length); <em>see also Weaver v. Jago, </em>675 F.2d 116, 119 (6th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (Native American\u2019s challenge to prison\u2019s hair regulation remanded to allow state to offer more than \u201cconelusory statements that a limitation on religious freedom is required for security, health or safety\u201d). But, because these are post-incident decisions, they cannot determine whether the law was then clearly established.</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-7\">Appellee state asserts that <em>Green v. White, </em>693 F.2d 45 (8th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>462 U.S. 1111, 103 S.Ct. 2464, 77 L.Ed.2d 1341 (1983) and <em>Jihaad v. O\u2019Brien, </em>645 F.2d 556 (6th Cir.1981), although decided after Capoeman\u2019s haircut, should nevertheless be considered to demonstrate lack of uniformity in the law. The states\u2019 reliance on these two cases is misplaced. In <em>Green, </em>the court held that officials were entitled to qualified immunity because in 1976, when Green asserted his first amendment right to long hair and a beard, the law was not sufficiently known to the officials to charge them with knowledge of a constitutional violation. <em>Green, </em>693 F.2d at 48. Similarly, in <em>Jihaad </em>the court held that immunity was properly granted to officers who, in 1975, forced a prisoner to cut his beard worn for religious purposes because the law was not clearly established at the time. <em>Jihaad, </em>645 F.2d at 563. In both cases the courts were examining the clarity of the law long before the time of the incident here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-8\">Despite the weight of relevant cases in favor of Capoeman\u2019s position, it is unclear that the appellees here should be charged with knowledge of \u201cclearly established\u201d law. Where, as here, there are relatively few cases on point, and none of them are binding, an additional factor that may be considered in ascertaining whether the law is \u201cclearly established\u201d is a determination of the likelihood that the Supreme Court or this circuit would have reached the same result as courts which had previously considered the issue. To make the determination, we examine the legal analysis employed by those courts and compare it to the analysis being used at that time by the Ninth Circuit in related but factually different situations. In general, courts have applied a number of different legal standards to prisoner claims of infringement of free exercise rights. <em>See generally, </em>Comment, <em>The Religious Rights of the Incarcerated, </em>125 U.Pa.L.Rev. 812 (1977) (identifying at least seven different standards for analyzing prisoner free exercise claims). Most courts have adopted and applied a less restrictive means standard. <em>See Gallahan, </em>670 F.2d at 1346; <em>Teterud, </em>522 F.2d at 359; <em>Wright, </em>457 F.Supp. at 1090; <em>Moskowitz, </em>432 F.Supp. at 951; and <em>Monroe, </em>422 F.Supp. at 217. Other courts have attempted to balance the state\u2019s interests against the prisoner\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>E.g., Dreibelbis v. Marks, </em>675 F.2d 579, 581 (3d Cir.1982); <em>Burgin, </em>536 F.2d at 504. Finally, at least one court concluded that a \u201crational basis\u201d standard must be applied. <em>Furgan, </em>554 F.Supp. at 878.</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-10\">The question of which standard should be applied to a prisoner\u2019s first amendment challenges to prison regulations appeared unresolved at the time of the incident here. See generally <em>Dreibelbis, </em>742 F.2d at 794 (noting the wide diversity in the criteria applied by various courts of appeals to determine the constitutional validity of such restrictions); <em>Madyun, </em>704 F.2d at 960, n. 7 (listing various standards applied by courts). We conclude that it was not clear at the time in question what standard the Ninth Circuit would have applied. In <em>Jones v. Bradley, </em>590 F.2d 294 (9th Cir.1979), an inmate challenged the prison\u2019s denial of the use of the prison chapel. The court concluded that a prisoner must be given \u201ca reasonable opportunity of pursuing his faith comparable to the opportunity afforded fellow prisoners who adhere to conventional religious precepts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 296 (quoting <em>Cruz v. Beto, </em>405 U.S. 319, 322, 92 S.Ct. 1079, 1081, 31 L.Ed.2d 263 (1972)). Prison regulations are to be \u201cevaluated in light of the state\u2019s legitimate interest in prison security.\u201d <em>Jones v. Bradley, </em>590 F.2d at 296. The court concluded that the state had a legitimate interest in placing appropriate restrictions on chapel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1516\">*1516</page-number>use that were reasonable to maintain order and security. <em>Id. </em>There is no indication that \u201cappropriate restrictions\u201d meant the least restrictive means.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-5\">In light of all the relevant factors we cannot conclude that the law was so clearly established at the time as to defeat appellees\u2019 immunity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-6\">The decision below is AFFIRMED. Each side is to bear its own costs of appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
