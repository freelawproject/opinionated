The United States District Court dismissed DeYoung\u2019s action, holding that it lacked appellate jurisdiction to review decisions of the Iowa District Court. DeYoung appeals the decision of the United States District Court to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-27\">Even were we to treat DeYoung\u2019s complaint in the United States District Court as one requesting exercise of original and not of appellate jurisdiction, the only issue raised by DeYoung in the present case that would vest jurisdiction of his action in a United States District Court is that he was denied due process of law by the failure of the Iowa small claims court sua sponte to appoint an attorney to represent him in the proceeding before it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That claim is totally without merit.
