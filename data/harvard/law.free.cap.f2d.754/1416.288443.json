(the debtor) filed a Chapter 11 petition in bankruptcy on November 17, 1982. The debtor\u2019s only significant asset was a five-story commercial building in Burlingame, California. At the time of filing bankruptcy, the building was subject to several deeds of trust, including a first deed of trust in favor of New York Life Insurance Company for approximately $2.4 million, and a second deed of trust in favor of Union Bank for $247,000. The third deed of trust was in favor of Davre\u2019s, Inc., appellant herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1493-6\">Davre\u2019s had entered into a lease/management agreement with Four Seas Center, Inc. (FSC, Inc.), an entity related to the debtor, in December, 1980, which provided that Davre\u2019s would lease and operate a restaurant on the fifth floor of the Burlingame commercial building to be furnished and equipped by FSC, Inc. The debtor guaranteed all obligations of FSC, Inc. under the agreement; the third deed of trust secured that guarantee as well as the repayment of a $200,000 promissory note to Davre\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1493-7\">In October, 1981, the debtor and FSC, Inc. filed suit against Davre\u2019s in the District Court for the Northern District of California for fraud and breach of contract. Davre\u2019s counterclaimed for in excess of $2,000,000, and sought judicial foreclosure on its third deed of trust. The case is now pending as Case No. 81-4404 WWS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1493-8\">After bankruptcy was filed, the debtor\u2019s trial counsel was permitted to withdraw from the ease, and debtor\u2019s bankruptcy counsel appeared temporarily in the litigation. On July 29, 1983, the bankruptcy court approved the employment of special counsel to represent the debtor in the case against Davre\u2019s. The court approved a compensation agreement between the debt- or and special counsel whereby the source of compensation would be the rental income from the Burlingame commercial property or, if the property were thereafter sold, the sale proceeds. The bankruptcy court imposed a lien on the property or proceeds from its future sale to protect special counsel\u2019s right to compensation. The lien was placed in a position senior to all other liens on the property except the first and second deeds of trust, in favor of New York Life and Union Bank, respectively, and Davre\u2019s third deed of trust to the extent of $200,000, plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1493-10\">The agreement for compensation provided for a $120,000 retainer payable $20,000 immediately upon adoption of the agreement, and $10,000 each month for the following ten months. The retainer was to be kept \u201con account of fees incurred and billed\u201d by special counsel at the hourly rate of $150. If Davre\u2019s recovered a judgment in excess of $407,000, the agreement provided that counsel would be paid no more than $120,000. If Davre\u2019s recovered a judgment of less than $407,000, counsel\u2019s compensation would not exceed $200,000. If judgment was in the debtor\u2019s favor, trial counsel would receive the larger of $120,-000 or a third of the judgment minus compensation already paid. The agreement also specifically provided that special counsel understood that final payment of compensation under the agreement was subject to review and approval by the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1493-11\">On September 14, 1983, the sale of the Burlingame property was approved by order of the bankruptcy court. The sale price was $5,225,000. The first and second deeds of trust on the property to New York Life and Union Bank were discharged and the claims of the other trust deed holders were transferred to the remaining proceeds of sale, which were deposited in an interest-bearing cash collateral account.</p>\n<p id=\"b1493-12\">On appeal to the district court, Davre\u2019s challenged the July 29, 1983, order allowing compensation to special counsel, argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1418\">*1418</page-number>ing that the bankruptcy court erred by allowing payment from the cash collateral account and by imposing a lien on the property. Upon the sale of the property, special counsel\u2019s lien became senior to all but $200,000 of Davre\u2019s third deed of trust. Davre\u2019s claimed that the proceeds of sale remaining after the discharge of the two senior-most liens were insufficient to satisfy its asserted claim in the district court litigation between it and the debtor in an amount in excess of $2,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1494-4\">On August 9, 1983, the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s order authorizing employment of special counsel. The district court found that Davre\u2019s interest was adequately protected under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 364(d)(1)(B) since, even though a recovery in the district court litigation would be covered by Davre\u2019s lien, the exact amount of that recovery was unresolved because the case was still pending. The district court accorded only $200,000 of Davre\u2019s lien a priority status over special counsel\u2019s lien because this was the only amount to which Davre\u2019s was definitely entitled at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1494-5\">Davre\u2019s appeals the August 9, 1983, order of the district court affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s order of July 29, 1983. The parties on appeal initially agreed that jurisdiction of this court was proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, claiming that the district court\u2019s order was final under the \u201ccollateral order\u201d doctrine as stated in <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). By order dated March 7, 1984, this court raised the issue of jurisdiction <em>sua sponte, </em>and the parties filed supplemental briefs. See <em>In re Martinez, </em>721 F.2d 262, 264 (9th Cir.,1983). We find the resolution of the issue of jurisdiction to be dispositive, and so do not discuss the parties\u2019 contentions on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1494-6\">Our review of the district court\u2019s order in bankruptcy proceedings is governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293, which grants us jurisdiction only over <em>final </em>orders of the district court. While the district court in its discretion may review interlocutory orders of the bankruptcy court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(b), we are given no such jurisdiction. We have, however, held that the doctrines of finality evolved under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 are not to be applied blindly to bankruptcy proceedings, but that the issue of appealability under \u00a7 1293 must follow \u201ca pragmatic approach.\u201d <em>In re Mason, </em>709 F.2d 1313, 1318 (9th Cir., 1983). The mere fact that the underlying order of the bankruptcy court may have been technically interlocutory does not automatically defeat the jurisdiction of this court to entertain an appeal of the district court\u2019s decision. <em>In re White, </em>727 F.2d 884, 885 (9th Cir., 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1494-8\">Nevertheless, an order to be reviewable under \u00a7 1293 must at least finally determine the discreet issue to which it is addressed, as is the case with an order entirely terminating an adversary proceeding. See <em>In re Ellsworth, </em>722 F.2d 1448, 1450 (9th Cir., 1984). When further proceedings in the bankruptcy court will affect the scope of the order, the order is not subject to review in this court under \u00a7 1293. <em>In re Martinez, </em>721 F.2d 262, 264-265 (9th Cir., 1983). We conclude that the district court's order in this case is not final as to the amount of attorneys fees to be awarded, and accordingly is nonappealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1494-9\">Davre\u2019s claims that the bankruptcy court\u2019s order is final because the agreement for compensation approved by the bankruptcy court \u201cconclusively\u201d determined the fees to be awarded to special counsel through trial and judgment. As previously mentioned, however, the agreement for compensation itself provides that each future allowance of fees requires approval by the bankruptcy court. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 328, 330(a) and 331. Special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1419\">*1419</page-number>counsel was hired to represent the debtor in a suit which has yet to be resolved. Counsel\u2019s ultimate compensation remains undetermined since, under the agreement, the exact amount depends upon the outcome of the litigation. Appellant\u2019s contention that the agreement conclusively determined special counsel\u2019s fees is not supported by the terms of the agreement itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-5\">The bankruptcy court\u2019s order had the immediate practical effect of paying special counsel the down payment on the agreed retainer for his services. This disbursement of estate funds falls into the category of an interim payment of fees. Each succeeding payment to counsel calls for bankruptcy court approval, and appellant can make objections to each of these disbursements as they arise. The district court, in its discretion, chose to hear the appeal from the bankruptcy court\u2019s order. This court lacks the jurisdiction to hear an appeal from the district court\u2019s affirmance of such a non-final order. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-6\">The imposition of the lien in favor of special counsel in a position superior to the balance of Davre\u2019s secured claim, as yet undetermined, over $200,000, was not improper. Attorneys services rendered during the pendency of bankruptcy proceedings are administrative expenses. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 503(b)(2). The imposition of the lien ahead of that portion of Davre\u2019s claim which is greater than $200,000 was necessary because Davre\u2019s has yet to prove the entire amount of its claim; a request for damages in a counterclaim in a suit outside of the bankruptcy proceeding itself does not constitute proof of a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"AIR\">In support of its position appellant cites <em>In re Yermakov, </em>718 F.2d 1465 (9th Cir., 1983). In that case, an appeal from an order awarding attorneys fees in a bankruptcy proceeding was allowed. <em>Yermakov </em>is distinguishable on its facts from this case. In <em>Yermakov, </em>the attorneys had been discharged from further representation of the debtors, and their full compensation had been finally determined. Any payments made in this case have been interim awards, and the final award remains uncertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-8\">The nature of the bankruptcy court\u2019s order also removes it from the class of orders that fall within the collateral order doctrine as expressed in <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). To be renewable under <em>Cohen, </em>an \u201corder must conclusively determine the disputed question.\u201d <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Risjord, </em>449 U.S. 368, 375, 101 S.Ct. 669, 674, 66 L.Ed.2d 571 (1981), quoting <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 468, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 2457, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-9\">In this case, the amount of special counsel\u2019s compensation has not been finally settled. Davre\u2019s claims that \u201cevery dollar paid to special counsel directly diminishes the monies available to pay Davre\u2019s claim.\u201d The problem with this argument is that the amount of Davre\u2019s claim which exceeds $200,000 is an expectancy which rests upon the uncertainties of litigation. The order from which Davre\u2019s appeals therefore does not fall within the <em>Cohen </em>exception. Nor is it sufficiently conclusive to fall within the rule of <em>Forgay v. Conrad, </em>47 U.S. (6 How.) 201, 204, 12 L.Ed. 404 (1848), where appeal was allowed of an order that awarded property and left nothing more to be done than an accounting. See <em>In re Mason, </em>709 F.2d 1313, 1318 (9th Cir., 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-10\">The district court\u2019s order affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s approval of the retention of special counsel was not a final order. We lack jurisdiction to hear this appeal. The appeal is therefore DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
