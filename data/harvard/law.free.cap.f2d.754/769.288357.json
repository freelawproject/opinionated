We affirm the district court\u2019s decision to condition the plaintiff\u2019s voluntary dismissal on the payment of attorney\u2019s fees, but because the defendant failed to offer sufficiently detailed proof of the fees incurred, we remand to the district court for a new determination of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">Cauley filed his initial complaint in this suit on April 1, 1975. That complaint alleged that on August 7, 1974, Chicago Police Officer John Wilson shot plaintiff Antowyn Cauley and that Wilson and other unnamed officers then arrested Cauley, assaulted him, and falsely imprisoned him. The complaint named the City of Chicago, Acting Police Superintendent James Rochford, Police Officer John Wilson, and other unnamed police officers as defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">More than seven years passed before the case was ready for trial. During that time, the district court dismissed the complaint as to the Superintendent, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint again naming the Superintendent, and the district court then granted summary judgment for the Superintendent. From March, 1980 until October, 1982, the case was placed on military hold while Cauley served in the United States Navy. With the trial finally set for November 15, 1982, the defendants moved on November 3, 1982 for a dismissal of the claim against the unnamed officers and, citing <em>Powe v. City of Chicago, </em>664 F.2d 639 (7th Cir.1981), for summary judgment in favor of the City of Chicago. The district court granted both motions on November 12, 1982, and the plaintiff\u2019s attorney then made an oral motion for a Rule 41(a)(2) voluntary dismissal without prejudice of the action against the sole remaining defendant, John Wilson. The court granted the dismissal motion and, at the same hearing, granted Wilson\u2019s attorney\u2019s request to file a memorandum in support of a request for attorney\u2019s fees. Wilson subsequently requested fees of $14,500, of which the court awarded $7,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-13\">Before addressing the attorney\u2019s fees issue, we must consider whether the plaintiff can bring this appeal. Generally, a plaintiff may not appeal an order of voluntary dismissal without prejudice because the dismissal is the relief that the plaintiff requested. <em>See LeCompte v. Mr. Chip, Inc., </em>528 F.2d 601, 603 (5th Cir.1976). There is a conflict among the circuits, however, as to whether a plaintiff can appeal an attorney\u2019s fees award on which a court conditions a Rule 41(a)(2) dismissal. The majority approach allows appeal only if the conditions imposed on the dismissal \u201clegally prejudice\u201d the plaintiff. <em>See Bowers v. St. Louis Southwestern Railway, </em>668 F.2d 369, 370 (8th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 946, 102 S.Ct. 2013, 72 L.Ed.2d 469 (1982); <em>LeCompte, </em>528 F.2d at 603; <em>Scholl v. Felmont Oil Corp., </em>327 F.2d 697, 700 (6th Cir.1964). Following this approach, the Fifth Circuit suggested that there \u201cwill be cases in which the amount of money set as the price of a voluntary dismissal without prejudice is so clearly unreasonable as to amount to appealable \u2018legal prejudice,\u2019 \u201d but held that attorneys\u2019 fees of $44,000 did not constitute such prejudice. <em>Yoffe v. Keller Industries, Inc., </em>580 F.2d 126, 131 (5th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 915, 99 S.Ct. 1231, 59 L.Ed.2d 464 (1979). The District of Columbia Circuit, on the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>hand, has taken jurisdiction of appeals of fees awards but has limited its review to whether the district court abused its discretion in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>GAF Corp. v. Transamerica Insurance Co., </em>665 F.2d 364, 367-68 (D.C.Cir.1981). Our circuit has not yet addressed the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">We believe that \u2014 at least in cases in which a plaintiff requests a dismissal in order to proceed in state court \u2014 the District of Columbia Circuit approach provides the sounder rule. We agree that a plaintiff may not appeal an unconditional, voluntary dismissal without prejudice; a plaintiff has no rational reason to appeal such an order. It also seems reasonable that a plaintiff may not appeal a condition that the suit may only be refiled in a specified state or federal court, especially when the plaintiff does not oppose the condition in the district court. <em>See Bowers, </em>668 F.2d at 370. <em>But cf. LeCompte, </em>528 F.2d at 604. Nonetheless, a plaintiff may understand that the dismissal without prejudice is conditioned on paying attorneys\u2019 fees yet disagree with the amount of fees awarded.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus an order awarding attorneys\u2019 fees may qualify as an involuntary adverse judgment even though the plaintiff requested and received the Rule 41(a)(2) dismissal. <em>But cf. </em>5 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice U 41.05[3] (2nd ed. 1984). The appellate court should be able to decide whether the district court abused its discretion in awarding fees and, because Cauley is now bringing his action against all three defendants in state court, this is his only opportunity to appeal the fees award. <em>But see Yoffe, </em>580 F.2d at 131 n. 13 (plaintiff can refuse to pay, receive a dismissal with prejudice, and then appeal that dismissal).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Furthermore, the Fifth and Sixth Circuits also consider whether the district court abused its discretion in awarding fees, but those circuits have tucked the attorneys\u2019 fees issue into the \u201clegal prejudice\u201d aspect of their jurisdictional analysis. For example, in <em>Yoffe, </em>the Fifth Circuit found that the $44,000 attorneys\u2019 fees award was not so unreasonable as to constitute legal prejudice and concluded that no appellate jurisdiction existed. 580 F.2d at 130-31 &amp; n. 12. Similarly, when the Sixth Circuit held in <em>Scholl </em>that the plaintiff could not appeal from a dismissal without prejudice, the court noted that the attorneys\u2019 fees award was not unreasonable. 327 F.2d at 700. Thus, both of these decisions consider the reasonableness of the fees award in deciding whether the plaintiff can appeal. Rather than intertwine the jurisdictional and fees issues, we prefer to take jurisdiction and then to decide whether the district court abused its discretion in awarding fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-11\">Rule 41(a)(2) permits the district court to condition a voluntary dismissal without prejudice on payment of attorneys\u2019 fees to the defendant. Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(2); <em>see Yoffe, </em>580 F.2d at 129. In the present case, the plaintiff argues that the fees were not a \u201cterm or condition\u201d because the district court dismissed the action before the defendant asked for fees and that the plaintiff may not have accepted the dismissal if he had known it was conditioned on paying attorney\u2019s fees. We find both arguments unconvincing. The defendant moved for attorney\u2019s fees at the same hearing that the district court granted the plaintiff\u2019s oral motion for dismissal without prejudice. If the plaintiff preferred maintaining his action in federal court against one defendant to a dismissal conditioned on attorney\u2019s fees, the plaintiff should have objected or asked to reinstate his complaint when Wilson\u2019s attorney moved for attorney\u2019s fees. Perhaps the district court should have explicitly stated that attorney\u2019s fees were a condition of the dismissal without prejudice, but, in any event, we believe that the plaintiff\u2019s attorney should have realized that the fees were an implicit condition of the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>The purpose of awarding attorneys\u2019 fees on a voluntary dismissal without prejudice is to compensate the defendant for the unnecessary expense that the litigation has caused. <em>See Galva Union Elevator Co. v. Chicago and North Western Transportation Co., </em>498 F.Supp. 26, 27-28 (N.D.Iowa 1980); 9 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2366, at 178-80 (1971). Fees are not awarded when a plaintiff obtains a dismissal <em>with prejudice </em>because the \u201cdefendant cannot be made to defend again.\u201d <em>Smoot v. Fox, </em>353 F.2d 830, 833 (6th Cir.1965), <em>cert. denied sub. nom. League of Women Voters v. Smoot, </em>384 U.S. 909, 86 S.Ct. 1342, 16 L.Ed.2d 361 (1966). In the case of a dismissal <em>without prejudice, </em>however, the defendant may have to defend again at a later time and incur duplicative legal expenses. <em>Id. </em>Thus the fee award should reimburse the defendant for expenses incurred in preparing work product that will not be useful in subsequent litigation of the same claim. <em>See McLaughlin v. Cheshire, </em>676 F.2d 855, 857 (D.C.Cir.1982); <em>Victory Beauty Supply, Inc. v. Lamaur, Inc., </em>98 F.R.D. 306, 309 (N.D.Ill.1983). We will apply these general standards to the fees awarded in this case, although we will affirm the fees award unless the award constitutes an abuse of discretion by the district court. <em>GAF Corp., </em>665 F.2d at 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">The plaintiff argues that a fees award of $7,500 cannot reasonably be based on the itemization of services provided by defendant\u2019s attorney. Wilson\u2019s attorney submitted a two-page affidavit and a one-page itemization of attorney\u2019s fees which stated that the attorney spent twenty-five hours on researching, drafting, and filing pleadings, eighty hours on discovery, and forty hours on trial preparation. Charging $100 per hour, Wilson\u2019s attorney requested an award of $14,500; the district court awarded $7,500. The showing is inadequate to support either amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">We think the plaintiff\u2019s criticism is well-founded. We would expect more documentary evidence <em>{e.g., </em>billing statements submitted by counsel to the City, time sheets, etc.) than the sketchy itemization provided here in order to allow the district court to determine reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See, e.g., Yoffe, </em>580 F.2d at 128 (district court heard testimony of lawyers and considered bills to clients, time sheets, and computer printouts of time spent). Counsel stated at oral argument that she has more detailed records at her office.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We also question, although we leave for the district court to determine on remand, whether a lawyer less than three years out of law school was justified in charging $100 per hour in 1975 when defendant Wilson filed his original answer. Since the defendant\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees lacked sufficient detail to permit the district court to determine a reasonable award, we remand the case to the district court to receive additional evidence and to reconsider the fees issue. <em>See GAF Corp., </em>665 F.2d at 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">In addition, some of the work product of Wilson\u2019s attorney may be useful in the state court proceedings and therefore not compensable. The plaintiff sought a dismissal without prejudice because the district court\u2019s rulings in favor of the Superintendent and the City on the federal section 1983 claims eliminated the court\u2019s pendent jurisdiction over the state claims against the Superintendent and the City. With Wilson left as the only defendant in federal court, Cauley would have had to proceed against Wilson in federal court and then bring an action in state court against the Superintendent and the City. The plaintiff chose instead to obtain a dismissal without prejudice in federal court and proceed against all three defendants in state court. Since the state court action presumably alleges both the federal and state claims against Wilson, Wilson\u2019s attorney should be able to use much of the research and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>discovery from the federal suit in defending the same claims in state court. <em>See Galva Union Elevator Co., </em>498 F.Supp. at 27-28. On remand the district court should therefore not award attorney\u2019s fees for expenses incurred in research, discovery, or preparation that will be useful to Wilson in defending the action in state court. <em>See Kern v. TXO Production Corp., </em>738 F.2d 968, 972-73 (8th Cir.1984); <em>GAF Corp., </em>665 F.2d at 369-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the district court is vacated and the case is remanded for a determination of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AMl6\">. In the district court the plaintiff contested the fees request on several grounds, arguing that the itemization was insufficient and that the City of Chicago, and not Wilson, paid for the attorney.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b848-5\">. The City of Chicago hired an attorney in private practice to represent both the City and Wilson in this litigation. That attorney submitted bills to the City of Chicago. The City\u2019s Corporation Counsel represented Wilson on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
