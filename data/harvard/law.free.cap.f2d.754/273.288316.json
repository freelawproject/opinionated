Forsythe, a correctional officer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Appellant filed an action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that the prison officials had maliciously and intentionally interfered with his receipt of eight editions of the October and November <em>Des Moines Register. </em>Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment with supporting affidavits. In an affidavit Don Mallinger, business manager of the penitentiary, stated that appellant had paid for an October subscription for the daily edition of the newspaper through the cashier\u2019s office. Mallinger also stated that to the best of his knowledge appellant had received all October papers. Mallinger stated that if an inmate who paid for \u00e1 newspaper subscription through the cashier\u2019s office failed to receive a copy of a newspaper, the inmate must send a memo to the cashier\u2019s office or to Mallinger and that neither he nor the cashier\u2019s office had received such a memo from appellant. In his affidavit appellee Eaves stated that he had processed two memos from appellant to the mail room regarding his papers but that appellant had not submitted a memo to the cashier\u2019s office. Appellee Forsythe stated that during the times in question he was not responsible for distribution of newspapers to appellant. In opposition to the motion, appellant filed a \u201cresistance\u201d and supporting exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\u201cA reviewing court should sustain a grant of summary judgment only when there is no genuine issue of material fact for the jury to decide and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Bouta v. American Federation of State, County &amp; Municipal Employees, </em>746 F.2d 453, 454 (8th Cir.1984) (per curiam). Furthermore, \u201c[a] party opposing a motion for summary judgment \u2018may not rest upon the mere allegations ... of his pleading, but ... by affidavits ... must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e)).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">We have carefully reviewed the entire record in this case. We agree with the district court that although appellant disputed certain statements in appellees\u2019 affidavits, none of the disputes were material. For example, as to appellee Eaves\u2019s affidavit, appellant noted that Eaves had not informed him he was supposed to send his inmate memos to the cashier\u2019s office instead of the mail room. As to Forsythe\u2019s affidavit, appellant asserted that Forsythe often worked areas to which he was not assigned. Appellant also asserted that Forsythe refused his request to help him locate the missing newspapers because Forsythe had informed appellant that he had a \u201cbad attitude.\u201d The district court correctly noted that although Forsythe may have indicated \u201ca lack of active interest in helping plaintiff locate missing newspapers,\u201d appellant\u2019s assertion \u201cdid not establish a fact issue as to malicious and intentional interference with plaintiff\u2019s receipt of newspapers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-8\">. The Honorable Harold D. Vietor, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b349-25\">. In a previous order the district court dismissed the action as to other named prison officials, unless appellant filed an amended complaint specifying facts as to how the offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>e\u00f1\u00e1is violated his constitutional rights. Appellant did not file an amended complaint, nor does he challenge the dismissal of the defendants on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
