On the USJ\u2019s trademark infringement claim, the district court found that it was undisputed that the \u201cJaycees\u201d trademark had become incontestable under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1065 (1982), and that the CRJ had asserted none of the permissible defenses under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1115(b) (1982). The court therefore concluded that the USJ was entitled to injunctive relief to prevent the further, unauthorized use of its trademark by the CRJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-20\">The district court also considered the CRJ\u2019s counterclaims which sought declaratory judgment of noninfringement of the USJ\u2019s trademark and a permanent injunction to prevent the USJ from engaging in further unfair or discriminatory practices, in violation of Iowa Code \u00a7 601A.7 (1981) and Cedar Rapids, Iowa Code, ch. 69, by restricting membership in its organization to men. The CRJ alleged that the USJ fell within the definition of \u201cpublic accommodation\u201d as that term is used in the aforementioned code provisions and defined in Iowa Code \u00a7 601A.2(10) (1981) and Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Code \u00a7 69.02(13) (1984). The district court rejected the CRJ\u2019s counterclaims and declined to certify to the Iowa Supreme Court the question of whether the USJ falls within the definition of \u201cpublic accommodation,\u201d on the basis of our decision in <em>United States Jaycees v. McClure, </em>709 F.2d 1560 (8th Cir.1983), <em>rev\u2019d sub nom. Roberts v. United States Jaycees, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 3244, 82 L.Ed.2d 462 (1984). In <em>McClure, </em>a panel of this court found that a Minnesota statute, which forbade discrimination on the basis of sex in \u201cplaces of public accommodation,\u201d was invalid under the first and fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution as applied to the membership policies of the USJ because there was not a compelling state interest sufficient to override the USJ's protected right of association. The district court below, in relying on <em>McClure, </em>found that although the statutory provision involved in the instant case differed slightly from the one at issue in <em>McClure, </em>the Iowa Code provision would likewise be invalid if invoked against the USJ, for the reasons discussed by the court in <em>McClure. </em>The district court reasoned that the associational interests of the USJ and the state\u2019s interest in regulating the USJ\u2019s membership policies would be the same in this case as they were in <em>McClure. </em>Thus, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>the associational interests of the USJ were found to outweigh the state\u2019s interests, the Iowa statute as applied to the USJ would be invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">We do not find fault with the district court\u2019s analysis as the law existed at the time of the decision. However, in light of the decision by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Roberts v. United States Jaycees, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 3244, 82 L.Ed.2d 462 (1984), reversing the <em>McClure </em>decision, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment below with the following instruction. The USJ is directed to certify to the district court within thirty days whether its August 16, 1984 resolution amending its bylaws to allow women full membership in the USJ places its revocation of the CRJ\u2019s license to use USJ\u2019s trademarks in a different light. If the USJ still wishes to enforce the revocation, it may renew its motion for summary judgment. Upon the USJ\u2019s renewal of its summary judgment motion, the district court must consider (1) whether the USJ is a public accommodation within the meaning of Iowa Code \u00a7\u00a7 601A.2(10), .7; and (2) if the USJ is a public accommodation, whether the USJ\u2019s revocation is nonetheless valid. In any event, the district court on remand should reconsider its ruling on the CRJ\u2019s counterclaims in light of <em>Roberts. </em>In doing so, the court should take note of the USJ\u2019s argument made during this appeal that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to consider the CRJ\u2019s counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">We offer no view as to the merits of any of the claims before the court, nor do we comment on the propriety of certification of any state law issues or the effect of the pending Iowa civil rights action on this litigation. These questions should be considered in the first instance by the district court. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s judgments for plaintiff on its trademark infringement claim and on defendant\u2019s counterclaims, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b378-17\">.
