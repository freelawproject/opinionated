Anderson, appeals an adverse judgment of the district court in this suit for refund of a penalty assessed by the Internal Revenue Service, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6702(a), for the filing of a frivolous income tax return. Finding appellant\u2019s objections to be utterly meritless, we affirm and impose double costs and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-5\">Anderson filed a joint Form 1040 (individual income tax return) with his wife for the tax year 1982. On this return, the Andersons reported no income from \u201cwages, salaries, tips\u201d or \u201cinterest\u201d. Attached to the return, however, were copies of Forms W-2 and Forms 1099-INT indicating that the Andersons received wage and salary income in 1982 of $41,733.49 and interest income of $544.59. The word \u201cincorrect\u201d was handwritten across the face of the Forms W-2. The Andersons attached two completed Schedules C (Profit or Loss from Business or Profession), on which they reported their wage and salary income as the gross receipts of a purported business as \u201clabor contractors\u201d. These gross receipts were wholly offset by adjustments for \u201ccost of labor\u201d and \u201cpurchases\u201d. Mr. Anderson attached a signed statement to the return in which he asserted that he and his wife had no \u201cadjusted gross income\u201d for the tax ye\u00e1r 1982. Neither of the Andersons signed the Form 1040 itself; rather the words \u201cFor Information olny [sic] Not a Return\u201d were written over the signature line.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-6\">The IRS assessed a $500 penalty for the filing of a frivolous return under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6702(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although they filed a written protest of the IRS\u2019 action, the Andersons failed to forestall collection of the penalty by paying 15% of the amount owed and instituting suit for refund as provided by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6703(c)(1). The IRS subsequently collected the penalty by levying upon the accrued wages of Mrs. Anderson.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-7\">Mr. Anderson filed a complaint in the district court on May 11, 1984, for refund of the $500 penalty alleging that he and his wife owed no income taxes for 1982 and that the penalty had been improperly imposed. The United States was served with this complaint on May 14, 1984. On July 13, 1984, the government served Mr. Anderson with a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment. This motion was filed in court on July 17, 1984. On July 23, 1984, Mr. Anderson filed a motion for default judgment alleging that the government had failed to answer his complaint within sixty days of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-14\">On July 27, 1984, the district court entered an order denying Anderson\u2019s motion for default judgment concluding that sixty days had elapsed before the government filed an answer, but that this temporary default had been cured by the subsequent filing of the government\u2019s motion to dismiss. The district court proceeded to enter summary judgment for the government, finding that Anderson had filed a \u201cfrivolous\u201d income tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-16\">Section 6702(a) permits the IRS to impose a $500 civil penalty on any individual who files \u201cwhat purports to be\u201d a tax return when such return (1) contains information on its face which indicates that the taxpayer\u2019s self-assessment is substantially incorrect, and (2) is based on a frivolous position. While the Andersons\u2019 Forms W-2 and Forms 1099-INT indicated taxable income in excess of $42,000, the Andersons included none of this income on their Form 1040. This self-assessment was obviously incorrect. Moreover, the Andersons\u2019 purported justifications for omitting their wage and interest income from their Form 1040 were patently frivolous. We have repeatedly rejected Mr. Anderson\u2019s conten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>tion that Congress is not empowered by the Constitution to levy a tax on wage and salary income. See <em>Davis v. United States, </em>742 F.2d 171, 172 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-4\">Anderson\u2019s contention that the 1982 return was not a \u201cpurported return\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 6702(a) is utterly without merit. While the Andersons did write \u201cFor Information olny [sic] Not a Return\u201d on their Form 1040, \u201cthe form was undeniably filed to obtain a refund of taxes withheld from their wages for which the filing of the return is necessary.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>742 F.2d 173. Hence, the Andersons\u2019 return was a \u201cpurported return\u201d subject to the penalties of section 6702(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-5\">Anderson asserts that section 6703(c)(1)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> violates the fifth amendment guarantee of due process by requiring payment of a portion of the penalty before a taxpayer may obtain judicial review of the IRS assessment. \u201cIt is well-established that the government\u2019s need for revenue justifies the use of summary procedures to collect money, followed by a later hearing on the seizure.\u201d <em>Zernial v. United States, </em>714 F.2d 431, 434 (5th Cir.1983) citing <em>Phillips v. Commissioner, </em>283 U.S. 589, 595, 51 S.Ct. 608, 611, 75 L.Ed. 1289 (1931). Anderson\u2019s contention that section 6703(c)(1) violates due process by requiring partial payment of the penalty assessed is frivolous. Accord <em>Martinez v. IRS, </em>744 F.2d 71, 72-73 (10th Cir.1984); <em>Baskin v. United States, </em>738 F.2d 975, 977 (8th Cir.1984).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1348-8\">The district court properly granted judgment in favor of the government.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, since Anderson\u2019s contentions on appeal are utterly baseless, we impose double costs upon him and will, upon timely petition for rehearing, award the government reasonable attorney\u2019s fees as damages for this frivolous appeal. See F.R. App.P. 38; <em>Knoblauch v. Commissioner, </em>749 F.2d 200, 202-03 (5th Cir.1984), on rehearing, 752 F.2d 125 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1347-8\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6702 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1347-9\">(a) Civil penalty. \u2014 If\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1347-10\">(1) any individual files what purports to be a return of the tax imposed by subtitle A but which\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1347-11\">(A) does not contain information on which the substantial correctness of the self-assessment may be judged, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1347-12\">(B) contains information that on its face indicates that the self-assessment is substantially incorrect; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1347-17\">(2) the conduct referred to in paragraph (1) is due to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1347-18\">(A) a position which is frivolous, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1347-19\">(B) a desire (which appears on the purported return) to delay or impede the administration of Federal income tax laws,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1347-20\">then such individual shall pay a penalty of $500.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1348-6\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6703(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1348-7\">(1) In general \u2014 If, within 30 days after the day on which notice and demand of any penalty under section 6700, 6701, or 6702 is made against any person, such person pays an amount which is not less than 15 percent of the amount of such penalty and files a claim for refund of the amount so paid, no levy or proceeding in court for the collection of the remainder of such penalty shall be made, begun, or prosecuted until the final resolution of a proceeding begun as provided in paragraph (2).

Since the government was served by the plaintiff on May 14, 1984, the government's service of a response on July 13, 1984, was timely.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
