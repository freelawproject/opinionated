Because of various procedural deficiencies, the substance of Mark\u2019s <em>pro se </em>appeal is only doubtfully before us. Even so, since the merits are simply disposed of, we assume <em>arguendo </em>that they are properly here and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-13\">At the hearing, Mark testified that at the time of his arrest one of the officers slapped him several times with his open hand. He further testified that he was not injured by the slaps and that they caused no bleeding, required no medical attention, and were too weak to knock him down. Thus, on his own evidence, they amounted to more of an affront than an injury. Assuming the truth of his account, and however reprehensible such conduct by a policeman may be, it does not rise to such a level that redress may be had for it under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-14\">Some years ago, in <em>Shillingford v. Holmes, </em>634 F.2d 263, 264 (5th Cir.1981), we recognized that \u00a7 1983 \u201cdoes not grant a cause of action for every injury wrongfully inflicted by a state officer.\u201d To merit redress under that federal statute, we held, the officer\u2019s conduct must have been such that it \u201ccaused severe injuries, was grossly disproportionate to the need for action under the circumstances, and was inspired by malice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 265. Other batteries are the business of state law. While the indignity inflicted on Mark arguably satisfies the last two elements of this formula, it clearly falls short of the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-15\">Although Mark\u2019s appeal must therefore fail, we do not think it so vexatious and frivolous as to justify the award of costs and attorney\u2019s fees requested by the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
