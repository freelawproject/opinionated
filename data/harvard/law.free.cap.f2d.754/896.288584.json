The plaintiffs-appellants sought to enjoin the Secretary of Health and Human Services from implementing regulations that would transfer certain reimbursement functions from that Department to private intermediaries. The district court denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction over any of the plaintiff\u2019s claims. We affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">The plaintiffs, American Federation of Home Health Agencies, Inc., and Alacare Home Health Services, Inc., are medicare providers. They challenged as \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d the Secretary\u2019s implementation of final regulations that would abolish Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Direct Reimbursement and transfer its functions to various private intermediaries. <em>See </em>49 Fed.Reg. 3648 (1984). The district court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. The court held that the statutory limitation on judicial review of medicare determinations, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(h) (1982), removed jurisdiction prior to an administrative determination by HSS\u2019s Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB). Under section 405(h), a district court cannot entertain a claim for benefits unless the applicant has first exhausted administrative remedies by appealing to the PRRB.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">The plaintiffs contend that <em>National Association of Home Health Agencies v. Schweiker, </em>D.C.Cir.1982, 690 F.2d 932, 937, preserves jurisdiction of an action based on the APA to \u201cvindicate an interest in procedural regularity\u201d. In <em>National Association, </em>the court held that it had jurisdiction because the plaintiffs were not seeking money or other benefits and that the PRRB was therefore unavailable: \u201cThey merely challenge the method of reimbursement, a concern that is not cognizable under [the scope of the PRRB\u2019s legislative grant]..... Appellees seek to enjoin the Secretary from changing the method of processing payment claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938. The plaintiffs similarly assert that in challenging the Secretary\u2019s decision to transfer responsibility for payment from the Office of Direct Reimbursement to private entities, they are attacking the procedure used for reimbursement, not claiming benefits under the Medicare Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-11\">The defendants counter that <em>National Association </em>has recently been limited by <em>Heckler v. Ringer, </em>1984, \u2014 U.S.\u2014, 104 S.Ct. 2013, 80 L.Ed.2d 622. In <em>Ringer, </em>the Secretary ordered HHS not to pay medicare benefits for a specific respiratory surgical procedure. The complaint in <em>Ringer </em>alleged that the instructions violated constitutional due process provisions, that the instructions were arbitrary and capricious, and that the Secretary\u2019s decision violated the rulemaking requirements of the APA. The complaint did not seek an award of benefits. The <em>Ringer </em>court held that all of the claims raised in the complaint were \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the claims for benefits and therefore all claims had first to be channeled into an administrative review. <em>Id. </em>The Court expressly rejected the procedural/substance division adopted below, mandating instead a broad construction of the term \u201cclaim arising under\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYy\">We disagree ... that simply because a claim somehow can be construed as \u201cprocedural,\u201d it is cognizable in federal district court by way of federal. question jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-14\">\u2014 [T]o be true to the language of the statute, the inquiry in determining whether \u00a7 405(h) bars federal question jurisdiction must be whether the claim \u201carises under\u201d the Act, not whether it lends itself to \u201csubstantive\u201d rather than a \u201cprocedural\u201d label.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b973-15\"><em>Id. </em>at-, 104 S.Ct. at 2021-22, 80 L.Ed.2d at 635-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-17\">According to the <em>Ringer </em>Court, \u201c[Federal question jurisdiction is barred by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(h) ... even in a case where [the] claimant is challenging the administrative <em>procedures </em>used to terminate welfare benefits\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at-, 104 S.Ct. at 2022, 80 L.Ed.2d at 636 (citing <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>1976, 424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18) (emphasis in <em>Ringer).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b973-19\">We agree with the defendants that <em>Ringer </em>mandates preclusion of jurisdiction for the claim here. The Supreme Court has interpreted 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(h) as \u201cmore than a codified requirement of administrative exhaustion\u201d; it is a \u201csweeping and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>direct\u201d bar to section 1331 jurisdiction over Social Security Act claims except to the extent authorized elsewhere in the Act. <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>1975, 422 U.S. 749, 757, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 2463, 45 L.Ed.2d 522, 534. <em>Ringer </em>has applied <em>Salfi </em>to claims that pertain to the administrative of claims even if the claimants do not seek \u201cactual award of benefits\u201d because they \u201carise under\u201d the Social Security Act. <em>Ringer </em>at \u2014, 104 S.Ct. at 2022, 80 L.Ed.2d at 636. Thus the only avenue for judicial review of such determinations is section 405(g). <em>V.N.A. v. Heckler, </em>11 Cir.1984, 711 F.2d 1020, 1025 n. 7 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 1908, 80 L.Ed.2d 457 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">This interpretation is also consistent with this Circuit\u2019s past readings of section 405(h). In <em>V.N.A. v. Heckler </em>this court flatly rejected the view of some circuits that litigants could still bring a claim in district court under section 1331 if the claim were to \u201cvindicate an interest in procedural regularity\u201d. 711 F.2d at 1025. The court instead agreed with those circuits that \u201chave held that total preclusion of review except after a PRRB decision is <em>precisely </em>what was intended\u201d. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). This reading of section 405(h) is supported by <em>Ringer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">We therefore find here that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims \u201carise under\u201d the Social Security Act within the meaning of <em>Ringer. </em>We further find that the claims do eventually seek reimbursement under the Medicare Act and are therefore precluded from being heard in district court. The dismissal of the district court for lack of jurisdiction is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b972-15\">. Section 405(h) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-16\">\"The findings and decision of the Secretary after a hearing shall be binding upon all individuals who were parties to such hearing. No findings of fact or decision of the Secretary shall be reviewed by any person, tribunal, or governmental agency except as herein provided. No action against the United States, the Secretary, or any officer or employee thereof shall be brought under section 1331 or 1346 of Title 28 to recover on any claim arising under this subchapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-25\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(h) (1982). Section 405(h) is incorporated into the Medicare Act by <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1395\u00dc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b972-26\">. The district court also dismissed the complaint because the plaintiffs-appellants lack standing to assert the claim. Because we find that jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>tion was lacking, we do not address this alternate ground for dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
