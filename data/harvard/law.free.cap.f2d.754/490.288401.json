We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>1.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">The facts in this case are not in dispute and have been agreed upon by stipulation. On July 22, 1981, appellant, Warner Bell (\u201cBell\u201d), a Pennsylvania resident, was injured in a two-vehicle accident. At the time of the accident, he was employed by the Department of Defense as a civilian file clerk and was acting within the scope of his employment. Bell was a passenger in a federally-owned truck which was hit in the rear by a vehicle owned by First Pennsylvania Auto Leasing and driven by John Callahan (\u201cCallahan\u201d). Callahan was employed by Wistar Institute (\u201cWistar\u201d) and, at the time of the accident, was also acting within the scope of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Bell was severely injured as a result of the accident and was unable to return to work for many months. As of January 26, 1983, Bell\u2019s medical expenses totaled $32,-509.24, and his lost earnings amounted to $13,648.80 and were accruing at the rate of $188.00 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The government truck in which Bell was a passenger was not registered in Pennsylvania nor was it insured under Pennsylvania\u2019s No-Fault Act. At the time of the accident, Bell had no statutorily identifiable source of coverage under Pennsylvania\u2019s No-Fault Act, as he did not own a vehicle, did not reside with the owner of a vehicle, and was not named insured in any policy of basic loss insurance under the No-Fault Act. Since the accident, Bell has been receiving federal workmen\u2019s compensation payments for his medical expenses and lost earnings under the Federal Employee\u2019s Compensation Act (\u201cFECA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8101, <em>et seq. </em>(1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">In April 1982, Bell filed an application with the Pennsylvania Assigned Claims Plan<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (\u201cthe Plan\u201d), the entity created by the No-Fault Act to provide coverage for vehicle accident victims who have no statutorily identifiable source of coverage. The Plan initially rejected Bell\u2019s request, stating that he was not entitled to benefits under the No-Fault Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-14\">Bell responded by filing suit in the Court of Common Pleas to compel the Plan to designate a servicing carrier to Bell\u2019s claim for no-fault benefits. In May 1982, the court granted Bell\u2019s motion and ordered the Plan to assign Bell\u2019s claim to a servicing carrier. As a result of the court\u2019s order, the Plan assigned Bell\u2019s claim to Travelers Insurance Company (\u201cTravelers\u201d). On July 6, 1982 Travelers denied Bell\u2019s claim for benefits and directed Bell to seek benefits instead through the United States Government. Travelers further stated that since Bell is eligible for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits, there would be no money due Bell from Travelers once Travelers set-off the amount Bell received from workmen\u2019s compensation. On July 22, 1982, Travelers sent Bell another letter denying liability on the alternative ground that the vehicle in which Bell was a passenger at the time of the accident was not a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of the No-Fault Act and therefore Travelers was not required to make payment under the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-15\">Shortly after Travelers\u2019 last letter, Bell filed suit in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from the United States Department of Labor and Travelers, and monetary damages from Wistar Institute and Callahan. In an order filed December 30, 1982, the district court dismissed Wistar and Callahan for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The district court judge also dismissed the Department of Labor, but held that the Department was entitled to satisfaction of a statutory lien on any recovery in tort made by Bell from Wistar and Callahan. The judge did not dismiss the action between Bell and Travelers because there was diversity of citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-16\">Bell and Travelers then submitted cross motions for summary judgment. On March 25, 1983, the district court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Bell was entitled to recover No-Fault benefits from Travelers under the Plan, but that Travelers was authorized to deduct the entire amount of Bell\u2019s FECA benefits from Bell\u2019s No-Fault recovery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Bell appeals both the December 30, 1982 and March 25, 1983 orders of the district court. Travelers cross-appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">As a preliminary matter, we affirm the district court\u2019s order of December 30, 1982 dismissing Wistar, Callahan, and the Department of Labor. We are presented with two issues from Bell\u2019s appeal of that order. The first is whether the Department of Labor is entitled to exercise a statutory lien over non-economic tort recovery. The second is whether there existed subject matter jurisdiction with regard to appellees Wistar and Callahan.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The No-Fault Act\u2019s operation generally limits any recovery sought in tort against the driver of the other automobile to non-economic losses such as pain and suffering. Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 40, \u00a7 1009.301(a)(4) (Purdon Supp.1984). Bell originally argued that the United States, pursuant to section 8132<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of FECA, could not exercise a statutory lien against tortfeasors Callahan and Wistar because FECA did not authorize the government to offset its payments with any form of non-economic recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8132 essentially provides that when a beneficiary receives compensation from the United States under this statute and also receives payments from a third person for the same injuries or damages, the beneficiary, after deducting from the third party recovery the costs of suit and a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee, is required to refund to the government the amount of compensation which the government had paid to him, to the extent of his third party recovery. The district judge rejected Bell\u2019s argument, relying entirely on Judge Bechtle\u2019s district court opinion in <em>Lorenzetti v. United States, </em>550 F.Supp. 997 (E.D.Pa. 1982) , <em>rev\u2019d, </em>710 F.2d 982 (3d Cir.1983), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 2284, 81 L.Ed.2d 134 (1984). In <em>Lorenzetti, </em>Judge Bechtle held that the Government was entitled under FECA to reimbursement from an employee\u2019s non-economic tort recovery of the benefits which the government had paid under workmen\u2019s compensation. Although this court reversed the district court\u2019s <em>Lorenzetti </em>decision, <em>see Lorenzetti v. United States, </em>710 F.2d 982 (3d Cir. 1983) , the Supreme Court thereafter reversed our decision, and thereby upheld the district court\u2019s conclusion. <em>United States v. Lorenzetti, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 104 S.Ct. 2284, 81 L.Ed.2d 134 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-19\">In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncement, the district court in the present case was correct in holding that the government is entitled to a general right of reimbursement that attaches to Bell\u2019s recovery of non-economic losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-20\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-21\">The district court was also correct in dismissing appellees Wistar and Callahan for lack of jurisdiction. Since both Bell and Callahan are residents of Pennsylvania and Wistar is a non-profit corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>organized under the laws of Pennsylvania, app. at 2-3, there exists no diversity of citizenship in the event that Callahan and Wistar remain as parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">Bell seeks to retain his state court claims against Wistar and Callahan by asserting that the No-Fault Act violates the United States Constitution. Bell argues that the No-Fault Act, by abolishing tort liability for economic losses, unreasonably discriminates against employees of the federal government in violation of the equal protection clause. This federal claim is without merit. While federal employees may receive reduced no-fault payments as a result of the FECA lien on third party tort recoveries, such decreased benefits do not represent a constitutional deprivation. The fourteenth amendment guarantees equal laws, not equal results. <em>Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney, </em>442 U.S. 256, 273, 99 S.Ct. 2282, 2293, 60 L.Ed.2d 870 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">It is important in this regard to note that the No-Fault Act does not, on its face, discriminate against federal employees. Although a statute\u2019s facial neutrality does not automatically immunize the statute from an attack on equal protection grounds, the burden that the plaintiff must satisfy is made more difficult. When, as in this case, the attack is based on a statute\u2019s discriminatory impact, the burden is on the plaintiff, here Bell, to demonstrate that the legislators had a discriminatory intent. <em>Washington v. Davis, </em>426 U.S. 229, 239, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 2047, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">In the instant case, to state a federal claim, Bell had to allege that the No-Fault Act was designed to purposefully discriminate against federal employees. This he has failed to do. In neither his pleadings, submissions, or arguments has Bell alleged or established the requisite discriminatory intent. Given the fact that Bell has failed to state a claim under the equal protection clause, and noting in passing that Bell will not be deprived of a forum since he has already initiated a suit for personal injuries against Wistar and Callahan in Pennsylvania state court, <em>see, Warner Bell v. The Travelers Insurance Company, et al., </em>Dec. Term, 1982, No. 4959, we hold that the district court did not err in dismissing Bell\u2019s claims against defendants Wistar and Callahan.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-13\">The cross-appeals taken from the district court\u2019s March 25, 1983 summary judgment order present this court with issues of first impression and require us to interpret various sections of Pennsylvania\u2019s No-Fault Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the outset, we note that there is no legislative history to shed light on the purpose or meaning of any of the No-Fault Act\u2019s provisions. As a result, our analysis must primarily rely upon the statutory language of the Act itself, as well as upon general policy statements contained in the relevant case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-15\">In the instant case, the district court held that Bell was entitled to receive both no-fault and workmen\u2019s compensation payments. <em>See Bell v. United States Dep\u2019t. of Labor, </em>560 F.Supp. 515, 519-20 (E.D.Pa. 1983). Travelers, however, presents the novel argument that Bell is not entitled to benefits under Pennsylvania\u2019s No-Fault Act because Bell\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation recovery under FECA is exclusive. Travelers contends that to allow Bell to recover from both the FECA and the Assigned Claims Plan would be contrary to the provisions and purposes of the No-Fault Act. Bell, on the other hand, claims that he is entitled to the difference between the FECA benefits that he has been receiving and the no-fault benefits. The district court, as we have noted, agreed with Bell.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-16\">As an initial matter, it should be emphasized that our attention has not been called to any provision of the No-Fault Act which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>would excuse a payment of no-fault benefits to a claimant who was receiving workmen\u2019s compensation. Indeed, the Pennsylvania Superior Court has held that an employee who received Pennsylvania workmen\u2019s compensation benefits was not precluded from also recovering benefits under the Assigned Claims Plan of the No-Fault Act. <em>Borrell v. Continental Casualty Co., </em>310 Pa.Super. 554, 456 A.2d 1074 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">In its attempt to limit Bell to only his FECA benefits, Travelers relies on policy arguments which do not persuade us, and case law which we find to be inapposite. Travelers\u2019 basic contention is that an insurance company should not be required to pay benefits pursuant to the Assigned Claims Plan when, under section 501<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the No-Fault Act, Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 40, \u00a7 1009.501 (Purdon Supp.1984), the owner of the uninsured vehicle (in this case the government) is under no obligation to reimburse the insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Section 501 of the No-Fault Act allows an insurance company that pays benefits to a victim injured while in an uninsured motor vehicle to recover from the vehicle\u2019s owner. However, since the Department of Defense is the uninsured owner of the vehicle in which Bell was injured. Travelers cannot successfully maintain an action under section 501 due to the federal government\u2019s shield of sovereign immunity. Travelers contends that its inability to recover any benefits which Travelers must pay, releases Travelers from its obligation to pay benefits under the Assigned Claims Plan. In effect, Travelers argues that section 501 may be invoked by an Assigned Claims carrier not only to recover its no-fault payments from the owner of an uninsured vehicle, but that section 501 also protects the carrier from making no-fault payments when the uninsured owner cannot be sued.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">On the basis of the statutory arguments made, we conclude that despite Travelers\u2019 inability to recover from the government under section 501, Travelers still remains responsible for its no-fault payments. Nowhere does section 501, or any other provision of the No-Fault Act, suggest that an insurance company is released from its obligation to pay benefits if it cannot succeed in obtaining reimbursement under section 501. Section 501 was designed to provide insurance companies with a potential source of reimbursement. It was not designed to allow insurance companies to escape payment obligations. This result is consistent with the No-Fault Act\u2019s primary purpose which is to provide basic loss benefits to individuals injured in automobile accidents. Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 40, \u00a7 1009.102(b) (Purdon Supp.1984). <em>See generally Harleysville Mutual Insurance Company v. Schuck, </em>302 Pa.Super. 534, 449 A.2d 45 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">Unable to find direct support for its exclusivity argument, Travelers draws an analogy between the present situation and the situations presented in cases where residents of other states have been injured in Pennsylvania. Travelers calls our attention to <em>Toter v. Knight, </em>278 Pa.Super. 547, 420 A.2d 676 (1980), which involved an automobile collision between vehicles operated by To ter, a New Jersey resident, and Knight, a resident of Pennsylvania. In <em>Toter, </em>the Superior Court of Pennsylvania resolved a claimed statutory conflict in Pennsylvania\u2019s No-Fault Act. The court permitted Toter to pursue a tort action in Pennsylvania despite the Pennsylvania No-Fault provision that abolished tort liability. Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 40, \u00a7 1009.301(a)(4). (Pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>don Supp.1984). In its discussion of the purported \u201cconflict\u201d issue presented, the court referred to still another provision of the No-Fault Act, section 110(c)(1).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That statute provides, among other things, that a nonresident domiciled in a state that has its own no-fault plan is denied benefits available under Pennsylvania\u2019s No-Fault Act and is remitted to the benefits available to the plan of his home state. Pa.Stat. Ann. tit. 40, \u00a7 1009.110(c)(1) (Purdon Supp. 1984). Travelers seeks to persuade us that just as a resident of another no-fault state is required to pursue no-fault benefits in his home state, so should Bell in this case be required to pursue only FECA benefits from the federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">We find that Travelers\u2019 reliance on <em>Toter </em>is entirely inappropriate. First, <em>Toter </em>involves two states \u2014 each of which has its own no-fault statute \u2014 and the issue presented concerned the availability of a tort action brought in the face of a Pennsylvania No-Fault statute that purportedly barred such an action. This is not our situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Second, the analysis in <em>Toter </em>relied upon still another provision of the Pennsylvania Act which remitted a nonresident to the no-fault benefits that his home state provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">In this case, we are not presented with another state\u2019s no-fault plan, but rather with the federal government\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation scheme. Under FECA, the benefits paid may differ in character from the benefits which compensate a victim who claims no-fault payments. Finally, in <em>Toter, </em>a New Jersey claimant was denied Pennsylvania no-fault benefits, although he was permitted to pursue other tort claims. In the instant case, the claimant, Bell, is a resident of Pennsylvania, and as such, is entitled to protection under Pennsylvania\u2019s No-Fault Act. The court in <em>Toter </em>recognized the importance of Pennsylvania residency with regard to coverage under the No-Fault Act when it considered the policy underlying the No-Fault Act. It answered the question which it asked, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD0\">Is the policy of the [No-Fault] Act to provide for all persons injured in Pennsylvania, or to provide for all Pennsylvanians injured in motor vehicle accidents? As already noted, the basic intent of the Act is to provide basic loss benefits to <em>Pennsylvanians </em>injured in Pennsylvania</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">278 Pa.Super. at 555-56, 420 A.2d at 681 (quoting D. Shrager, The Pennsylvania No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act, \u00a7 1:16.3 at 131-32 (1979)) (emphasis added). Thus, we hold that Bell is entitled to no-fault benefits despite the fact that Travelers is denied recovery from the government under section 501 due to the government\u2019s sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-13\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-14\">Travelers argues that even if the district court correctly held that Bell\u2019s recovery under FECA is nonexclusive, the district court erred in determining that, under Section 204<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the No-Fault Act, Travelers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>was the appropriate carrier to pay Bell\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Section 204 of the No-Fault Act sets out the source of recovery for a victim entitled to benefits under the Act. Travelers maintains that under that section, the proper source of recovery is not, as the district court held, the Assigned Claims Plan <em>(see </em>section 204(a)(5)), which would require Travelers to respond to Bell\u2019s claim. Rather Travelers contends the proper source of recovery is the insurer of the leased car that Callahan was driving <em>(see </em>section 204(a)(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">By its terms, Section 204(a)(4) applies to an individual who is (1) not an insured, (2) not the driver of a \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d and (3) not the occupant of a \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d Bell was not an insured and was not the driver of the government-owned truck. Bell, however, <em>was </em>an occupant (a passenger) in the government-owned truck, which Bell claims is a motor vehicle within the meaning of section 204(a)(4). Thus, section 204(a)(4) is inapplicable. The provisions of section 204(a)(4) could come into play in the circumstances of this case only if the government-owned truck was held not to be a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of the No-Fault Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Travelers argues that because the government vehicle was not a \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d section 204(a)(4) is the controlling provision of the Act, and as such, the insurer of Callahan\u2019s car, rather than Travelers under section 204(a)(5), should respond to Bell\u2019s claims. As we have noted, the district court rejected this argument and held that, because Bell did not fall within the first four sections of 204(a), Bell was necessarily covered under section 204(a)(5), which refers to \u201cany other individual\u201d and which provides that the Assigned Claims Plan is the proper source of recovery. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">A \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d is defined by section 103 of the No-Fault Act as \u201ca vehicle <em>of a kind </em>required to be registered under the act of April 29, 1959 (P.L. 58, No. 32), known as The Vehicle Code.\u201d Pa.Stat. Ann. tit. 40, \u00a7 1009.103 (Purdon Supp.1984) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-12\">Travelers argues that this definition requires a determination of which vehicles must or must not be registered in Pennsylvania. Accordingly, Travelers maintains that if an automobile is not required to be registered in Pennsylvania, it is not a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d for purposes of the No-Fault Act. If we were to accept Travelers\u2019 argument, then the federally owned truck in which Bell was a passenger would not be a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d under section 103, because, by operation of federal law, the truck was not required to be registered in Pennsylvania. As Travelers points out, federal regulation specifically excludes government owned vehicles from mandatory state registration.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-13\">We believe, however, that Travelers\u2019 definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d is far too narrow. The plain language of the statute provides that a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d is a vehicle <em>of a kind </em>required to be registered. In arguing for its interpretation, Travelers apparently ignored the import of section 103\u2019s qualifying language \u201cof a kind.\u201d It is our duty, under established principles of statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>construction, to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute. <em>United States v. Menasche, </em>348 U.S. 528, 538-39, 75 S.Ct. 513, 519-20, 99 L.Ed. 615 (1955); <em>Commonwealth v. Sitkin\u2019s Junk Co., Inc., </em>412 Pa. 132, 138, 194 A.2d 199, 202 (1963). If the legislature had intended to limit the meaning of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d to only those vehicles required to be registered in Pennsylvania, it could have done so explicitly. Instead, by including the words \u201cof a kind,\u201d the legislature expanded the definition of motor vehicle to encompass not only vehicles required to be registered under Pennsylvania\u2019s Vehicle Code, but also those vehicles generically similar to vehicles required to be registered. Since the truck in which Bell was a passenger is of the generic variety of vehicle that must be registered under the Pennsylvania Vehicle Code,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it falls under the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d contained in section 103 of the No-Fault Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">Our construction of the No-Fault Act is also supported by the language of the Act\u2019s title.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The title of the No-Fault Act, which provides an overview of the Act\u2019s many provisions, states that No-Fault insurance is mandatory \u201cfor all motor vehicles required to be registered in Pennsylvania____\u201d Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 40, \u00a7 1009.101 (Purdon Supp.1984). If, as Travelers argues, the legislature had intended the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d under section 103 to be limited to only those vehicles required to be registered under the Act, the legislature presumably would have used the same unequivocal language in section 103 that it employed in the Act\u2019s title. Instead, the legislature intentionally broadened the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d in section 103 by inserting the words \u201cof a kind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">The district court held that Travelers is not obligated to compensate Bell for amounts recovered by the Government pursuant to its <em>Lorenzetti </em>lien. Bell appeals that holding, contending that Travelers, by off-setting Bell\u2019s FECA benefits against Travelers\u2019 no-fault payments, is thereby impermissibly reimbursed for Bell\u2019s non-economic loss. We reject Bell\u2019s argument and uphold the district court\u2019s conclusion that Travelers is not required to make payments to Bell for the <em>Lorenzetti </em>amounts that the government has recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-14\">Under the Pennsylvania No-Fault Act, a tort action against the driver of the other automobile is generally limited to recovery for non-economic losses. As we have earlier discussed, in <em>United States v. Lorenzetti, supra, </em>the Supreme Court held that under section 8132 of FECA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8132 (1982), the government is entitled to a general right of reimbursement that attaches to the employee\u2019s third party recovery of non-economic losses. This lien permits the federal government to deduct from its FECA payments any non-economic tort recovery to which the employee is entitled. The issue presented to the district court by Bell was whether Travelers is entitled under Pennsylvania\u2019s No-Fault statute to deduct from any payment due Bell, the entire amount of the government\u2019s FECA benefit obligations (including those benefits which represent Bell\u2019s potential recovery against Callahan and Wistar) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>and thus, indirectly deduct from payments due to Bell, Bell\u2019s potential tort recovery against third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">There are two No-Fault Act provisions which bear upon this issue. Travelers relies on section 108(a)(3),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 40, \u00a7 1009.108(a)(3) (Purdon Supp.1984), which provides that in calculating net loss under the Assigned Claims Plan, an insurance company may deduct any benefits received by the victim. Bell, on the other hand, places great importance on section 111(a)(1)(A),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 40, \u00a7 1009.-111(a)(1)(A) (Purdon Supp.1984), which outlines the reimbursement and subrogation rights of insurance companies under the Act. Section 111(a)(1)(A) forbids an insurance company from exercising, either directly or indirectly, a right of reimbursement to the proceeds of a victim\u2019s cause of action for non-economic damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Bell argues that under section 111(a)(1)(A), Travelers must reimburse Bell for any money the government recovers as a result of its <em>Lorenzetti </em>lien on Bell\u2019s non-economic tort recovery. Bell\u2019s reasoning is as follows. Since the government has a lien against Bell for any non-economic tort recovery, the FECA benefits that Bell ultimately receives from the government will, in effect, be comprised of compensation for both economic and non-economic injury. Thus, when Travelers deducts Bell\u2019s FECa benefits from its no-fault payments pursuant to section 108(a)(3), Travelers is indirectly offsetting its no-fault payments with Bell\u2019s non-economic tort claim recovery in violation of section 111(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">While Bell\u2019s argument is though provoking, it is not in accord with the plain language of the No-Fault Act. By deducting Bell\u2019s FECA benefits, Travelers is not exercising a form of indirect reimbursement for non-economic damages because Travelers\u2019 no-fault payments to Bell are not dependent upon Bell\u2019s non-economic recovery. Since Travelers is obligated to pay the same amount of benefits to Bell regardless of any non-economic recovery to which Bell might be entitled, Travelers cannot be'said to be reimbursed, directly or otherwise, by Bell\u2019s non-economic recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">A simplified numerical example may be helpful in explaining the relationship between no-fault payments, FECA benefits and non-economic tort recovery. Assume that Bell is entitled to $100 in FECA benefits and $200 in no-fault benefits. Bell\u2019s total recovery will amount to $200: $100 from FECA benefits and $100 from the no-fault insurer (the insurer will deduct the $100 in FECa benefits from its $200 obligation pursuant to section 108(a)(3) of the No-Fault Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-12\">Assume now, however, that Bell recovers an additional $100 in a third party tort action for non-economic damages. Bell, of course, is not advantaged by his non-economic tort recovery since the Government will exercise its $100 lien against Bell\u2019s tort recovery. The government, under its <em>Lorenzetti </em>lien, will be reimbursed for its $100 workmen\u2019s compensation outlay by the $100 that Bell recovered from his tortfeasor. Travelers will deduct the government\u2019s $100 FECA payment from its benefits, thereby paying Bell $100. As a result, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Bell\u2019s total recovery will remain unchanged at $200.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">More relevant to the issue of reimbursement, is that the no-fault insurer is unaffected by the third party tort recovery. The no-fault insurer is still obligated to pay $100, representing its $200 in no-fault payments less $100 which it is permitted to deduct as a result of Bell\u2019s FECA benefits.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The only party reimbursed, directly or indirectly, by Bell\u2019s tort recovery is the federal government, whose net outlay under this example is now zero.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Under the approach recommended by Bell, the no-fault insurer in the above example would be obligated to pay Bell an additional $100, which would represent the amount of the government lien against Bell\u2019s non-economic recovery. In effect, Bell\u2019s analysis requires the no-fault insurer to reimburse Bell for Bell\u2019s non-economic recovery lost as a result of the government having exercised its <em>Lorenzetti </em>lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">While we observe that Bell\u2019s approach would more fully compensate Bell and similarly situated plaintiffs with regard to non-economic loss, we also recognize that such an approach is not countenanced by the provisions of the No-Fault Act, nor can it be inferred from the underlying purpose of the Act. The No-Fault Act\u2019s purpose is to provide \u201cprompt and adequate <em>basic loss benefits </em>for motor vehicle accident victims \u2014 \u201d Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 40, \u00a7 1009.-102(b) (Purdon Supp.1984) (emphasis added.) The federal government\u2019s lien deprives Bell only of his <em>non-economic </em>recovery and does not diminish his economic recovery in any way. Thus, the fact that Travelers is under no obligation to reimburse Bell for his non-economic recovery, does not run counter to the purpose of the No-Fault Act as expressed in the statute itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">Moreover, as illustrated above, Travelers\u2019 set-off under section 108(a)(3) does not violate section 111(a)(1)(A) by representing a form of indirect reimbursement. The amount of FECA benefits that Bell is entitled to receive from the federal government is not in any way dependent on Bell\u2019s third party non-economic tort recovery. As a result, the amount of Travelers\u2019 set-off under section 108(a)(3) is also unaffected by Bell\u2019s tort action.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">Thus, under the No-Fault Act, Travelers is required to pay Bell the same amount, whether or not Bell is successful in recovering non-economic damages through a third party tort action. Because Travelers\u2019 set-off and ultimate payments are not dependent on Bell\u2019s tort recovery, Travelers cannot be described as being \u201creimbursed\u201d for Bell\u2019s non-economic compensation. The district court was therefore correct in its disposition of Bell\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Bell has made one additional argument before us which merits little discussion. Bell claims that Travelers cannot deduct his FECA payments because they are not \u201cbenefits\u201d under the No-Fault Act. Relying on <em>Heusle v. National Mutual Insurance Co., </em>628 F.2d 833 (3d Cir.1980), Bell contends that the FECA payments he received were \u201cexhaustible\u201d and for that reason were not deductible benefits under section 206(a)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> of the Act. Exhaustible benefits may be characterized as benefits which terminate after a specified period of time has elapsed, or after a maximum amount of benefits have been paid. This argument fails for a number of reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">First, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in <em>Venpanziani v. Insana, </em>293 Pa.Super. 117, 437 A.2d 1234 (1981) specifically held that a no-fault insurer could deduct Pennsylvania workmen\u2019s compensation benefits under section 206(a) of the No-Fault Act. Second, the relevant provision in the instant appeal is not section 206(a), but rather section 108(a)(3) which applies to the Assigned Claims Plan. While section 206(a) provides only for subtraction of certain governmental benefits, section 108(a)(3)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> is much broader in its scope and provides for the deduction of <em>\u201call </em>benefits or advantages that [an] individual receives or is entitled to receive as a result of [his] injury.\u201d Pa. Stat.Ann. tit. 40, \u00a7 1009.108(a)(3) (Purdon Supp.1984) (emphasis added). <em>See also Killeen v. Travelers Insurance Co., </em>721 F.2d 87, 89 (3d Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">We conclude that the district court was correct in dismissing defendants Wistar and Callahan, and in determining that the Department of Labor was entitled to exercise a lien against Bell\u2019s non-economic recovery. We also find that Travelers is responsible for Bell\u2019s no-fault benefits, but may deduct from those no-fault payments Bell\u2019s entire FECA benefits.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-13\">Accordingly, we will affirm the district court\u2019s order of December 30, 1982 (dismissing Callahan, Wistar, and the Depart ment of Labor) and the district court\u2019s order of March 25, 1983.

The dissent states: \"In this case, deduction of all FECA payments in calculating net loss would effectively reimburse Travelers for Bell\u2019s recovery of damages for such noneconomic loss.\u201d (Dissenting opinion, at 504). Contrary to the dissent\u2019s characterization, the no-fault carrier, in this case Travelers, is not reimbursed by any third party recovery which Bell may obtain. Travelers may offset its payments to Bell by the amount which the government has paid Bell as FECA benefits. FECA benefits, by definition, are wholly economic. As a consequence, Travelers receives no reimbursement whatsoever from Bell\u2019s non-economic third party recovery. It is only the government which offsets Bell\u2019s economic benefits and it does so only because of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. </em>Lorenzetti, \u2014 U.S. \u2014. 104 S.Ct. 2284, 81 L.Ed.2d 134 (1984). Thus, the dissent\u2019s argument, which claims that Travelers would effectively be reimbursed for Bell\u2019s non-economic loss, is both analytically and factually incorrect. In essence, the dissent would overrule section 108(a)(3) of Pennsylvania's No-Fault Act, which allows the no-fault insurer to deduct workmen\u2019s compensation benefits, which by their nature are solely economic in character.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-13\">Moreover, the dissent\u2019s \"benefit\u201d theory would lead to a shifting benefit formula. Under the dissent's theory, no benefits received by Bell under FECA would be considered \"benefits\u201d and therefore available for offset under section 108(a)(3) by Travelers until such time as any third party litigation had been concluded. This would be so because a recovery from a third party of non-economic damages would diminish the FECA benefits to the extent of a third party recovery and thereby diminish the \"benefit\u201d to Bell. There is no indication that Pennsylvania\u2019s No-Fault statute ever intended such an open-ended result.

Because I believe the trial court erred in holding that the Travelers Insurance Company may deduct from Warner Bell\u2019s no-fault benefits the entire amount paid to him under the Federal Employee\u2019s Compensation Act (FECA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8101, et seq. (1982), I dissent from the judgment in Travelers\u2019 favor in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-18\">The dispute between Bell and Travelers arises because of two seemingly inconsistent provisions of the Pennsylvania No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act. Travelers relies on 40 Pa.Cons.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 1009.108(a)(3) (Purdon Supp.1984), which provides that \u201call benefits or advantages that [an] individual receives or is entitled to receive ... shall be subtracted from loss in calculating net loss.\u201d Travelers concludes from this provision that when it calculates net loss it is permitted to subtract all FECA payments to which Bell is entitled. Bell asserts that Travelers\u2019 position conflicts with Section 111(a)(1)(A) of the Act, which provides that \u201can obligor ... does not have and may not contract, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, for a right of reimbursement from or subrogation to the proceeds of a victim\u2019s ... cause of action for noneconomic detriment ____\u201d 40 Pa. Cons.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 1009.111(a)(1)(A) (Purdon Supp.1984). This provision is included in the statute because the No-Fault Act compensates victims only for economic loss. Therefore, the carrier may be subrogated to the victim\u2019s claims for economic loss (such as medical bills or lost pay) against other parties. Claims for noneconomic loss (such as pain and suffering) may not be subrogated because the no-fault insurance carrier does not compensate the claimant for this loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>FECA compensates federal employees only for economic loss. The Supreme Court has held, however, that Congress intended to allow the United States to be subrogated to claims for noneconomic loss as well as economic loss. <em>United States v. Lorenzetti, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 2284, 81 L.Ed.2d 134 (1984). The result of the <em>Lorenzetti </em>holding in this case is that Bell receives a specified compensation for economic loss under FECA; any additional damages Bell may receive for noneconomic loss are returned to the United States, under the statutory lien, to the extent that the United States has paid compensation. Bell\u2019s FECA benefits are effectively reduced by the amount of his recovery for noneconomic loss. Therefore, those FECA payments recouped by the federal government under <em>Lorenzetti </em>are not a \u201cbenefit\u201d to Bell at all. Bell\u2019s net recovery does not change. The award for noneconomic loss in reality benefits the government, not Bell. Thus it does not fall within the language of section 108(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">In contrast with congressional intent in enacting FECA (at least the intent found by the Supreme Court in <em>Lorenzetti), </em>the Pennsylvania legislature clearly did not intend that no-fault insurance companies be subrogated to, or be reimbursed for proceeds of a victim\u2019s cause of action for non-economic losses such as pain and suffering. In this case, deduction of all FECA payments in calculating net loss would effectively reimburse Travelers for Bell\u2019s recovery of damages for such noneconomic loss. If, as Travelers urges, all FECA payments are deducted from Bell\u2019s no-fault recovery, Bell probably will collect no damages for noneconomic loss in addition to the no-fault compensation for economic loss. He will be barred from any compensation for pain and suffering, unless the award for pain and suffering exceeds the total of his FECA benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Section 108(a)(3), which provides for deduction of benefits in calculating net loss, can be read in a way that is consistent with legislative intent to allow claimants to recover for noneconomic loss. Under section 206(a) \u201call benefits or advantages ... shall be subtracted from loss in calculating net loss.\u201d Travelers and the majority incorrectly equate \u201cbenefits\u201d with \u201cpayments.\u201d The words \u201cbenefits or advantages\u201d should be given their plain meaning. The \u201cbenefit\u201d received by Bell in this case is not the entire FECA payment, but only that which is beyond what Bell would have received anyway. Since Bell\u2019s receipt of noneconomic damages against Callahan and Wis-tar is unrelated to his receipt of FECA payments, \u201cbenefit\u201d should be measured by subtracting an amount equal to the statutory lien, a \u201cbenefit\u201d only to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">Thus I would reverse the judgment appealed from insofar as it permits Travelers to deduct from its no-fault obligation amounts recovered from Callahan and Wis-tar for the benefit of the United States.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
