DOYLE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">After examining the briefs and the appellate record, this three-judge panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not be of material assistance in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.R. App.P. 34(a); Tenth Circuit R. 10(e). The cause is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">This is an appeal by Joseph Afflerbach, John Cotton, Michael Cotton, Harvey Annis, and Murray Watson from their criminal convictions in the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming. We affirm the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">The facts are that for some time the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) had tried to collect taxes due from appellant Harvey Annis. The IRS secured a judicial determination that Annis owed the money, <em>United States v. Anderson, et al., </em>No. 81-1349, slip op. (10th Cir. Nov. 23, 1981) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Annis, </em>634 F.2d 1270 (10th Cir.1980), and sent him several deficiency notices. Annis failed to respond to the notices and this caused the district court to issue an order on July 17, 1981, allowing IRS agents to enter Annis\u2019s farm and seize machinery and equipment to satisfy the deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">IRS Special Agents Benjamin Baker and Robert Freeland proceeded to inspect the Annis property to make certain of its exact location. They returned with Revenue Officers Andrew Tagliavore and John Dalrymple and Natrona County Deputy Sheriff Gerald Wushbon. Officer Tagliavore testified that the special agents were necessary because of Annis\u2019s past resistance, and that a confrontation could possibly be anticipated. The agents began tagging the equipment specified in the order. After that, as some of the machinery was being readied to be towed away, appellant Murray Watson arrived. Watson asked Deputy Wushbon to arrest the agents for stealing the equipment, claiming that much of it belonged not to Annis but to the other appellants. Agent Baker told Watson that if he could document his ownership of the equipment, the equipment would not be taken. Watson left the Annis farm in order to obtain the necessary documents and to notify the other appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-12\">Just as the agents began to leave, the appellants drove their trucks to the entrance of the farm. There is some dispute whether the vehicles blocked the agents\u2019 exit. The appellants, armed with pistols, 12-gauge shotguns, and a Colt AR 15 semiautomatic rifle, got out of their trucks and approached the agents. Appellants Afflerbach, John Cotton, and Michael Cotton confronted Agent Freeland and Deputy Wushbon, threatening them with violence. Simultaneously appellants Annis and Watson discussed the situation with Agent Baker. At last the agents agreed to leave the equipment on the Annis property if the appellants would put away their weapons. No one was harmed, and the appellants returned to their trucks. The IRS has not attempted seizure of the equipment since that incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-13\">On September 4, 1981 the appellants were indicted. Count I charged them with violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and \u00a7 2<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for_ forcibly interfering with or assaulting federal officers. Only appellant Watson was not charged in that count with the use of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>deadly weapon. Count II charged all but Watson with violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for the use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. Trial was held in the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\">Afflerbach, John Cotton, and Michael Cotton were convicted on both counts. Annis and Watson were found guilty of a lesser included offense under Count I, that of forcibly interfering with a federal officer without the use of a deadly weapon, and- were found not guilty of Count II. Afflerbach was sentenced to seven years\u2019 imprisonment on Count I, followed by five years\u2019 probation on Count II. John Cotton was sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment on Count I, followed by five years\u2019 probation on Count II. Michael Cotton received eighteen months\u2019 imprisonment on Count I and four years\u2019 probation on Count II. Annis and Watson were sentenced to three years\u2019 probation on Count I, three months of which were to be served in jail. All five appellants appeal on various grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">Appellants first claim was that the district court abused its discretion by failing to grant their motion for transfer within the district. Appellants had moved for the trial to be held in Casper, where they, along with their attorney and some of their witnesses, lived. The district court denied the motion, deciding that for security reasons, the trial should be held in Cheyenne, where the federal marshal\u2019s personnel were more readily available. Rule 18, F.R. Cr.P. provides that \u201c[t]he court shall fix the place of trial within the district with due regard to the convenience of the defendant and the witnesses and the prompt administration of justice.\u201d Appellants argue that the district court failed to consider their convenience in setting the place of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-11\">This court has held that the mere fact that a defendant\u2019s home is nearer one trial site than another is insufficient to merit transfer. <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>670 F.2d 923, 926 (10th Cir.1982). A defendant must allege \u201cspecific prejudice,\u201d resulting from the Court\u2019s refusal to transfer. <em>Id. </em>Appellants here have failed to establish any such prejudice. Furthermore, Rule 18 allows a court to consider \u201cthe prompt administration of justice\u201d in fixing the place of trial and matters of security clearly fall within that consideration. Hence the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellants\u2019 motion to transfer the trial to Casper.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">Second, the appellants argue that the district court erred in denying their motion to stay the proceedings because non-registered voters were not included in the jury pool. The District of Wyoming chooses its prospective jurors solely from voter registration lists, a process which appellants claim precludes the selection of a fair cross-section of jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-13\">The statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1861, allows litigants \u201cthe right to grand and petit juries selected at random from a fair cross section of the community in the district or division wherein the court convenes.\u201d Section 1863(b)(2) provides that voter registration lists are to be the primary source of prospective jurors. \u201cThe supplementation of voter lists is the exception, not the rule, and absent a showing of deficient representation the use of an approved jury selection process is lawful.\u201d <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>539 F.2d 45, 55 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. de</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number><em>nied, </em>429 U.S. 925, 97 S.Ct. 327, 50 L.Ed.2d 293 (1976). Appellants can prevail only if they show that the district\u2019s reliance on registration lists systematically excluded a distinct, cognizable class of persons from jury service. <em>United States v. Test, </em>550 F.2d 577, 586 (10th Cir.1976); <em>United States v. Grismore, </em>546 F.2d 844, 848 (10th Cir.1976); <em>United States v. Bennett, supra </em>at 55. Persons who choose not to register to vote do not comprise such a cognizable group. <em>Reed v. Wainwright, </em>587 F.2d 260, 264 (5th Cir.1979); <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>472 F.2d 252, 256 (3d Cir.1973). The district court thus properly denied appellant\u2019s motion to stay proceedings in that the appellants failed to establish that the jury selection process systematically excluded a cognizable class.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">Third, appellants advance the contention that the IRS agents\u2019 attempted seizure of equipment was itself illegal and that therefore the appellants had the right to resist. The IRS has the right to levy the property of a taxpayer who has failed to pay any federal tax. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6331(a). The district court order, allowing seizure of Annis\u2019s equipment, was properly entered, and the seizure was legal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The appellants had no right to resist the IRS agents. This circuit has held that a third person has no right to intervene in an arrest when he knows or has reason to know the officer is authorized to make the arrest. <em>United States v. Vigil, </em>431 F.2d 1037, 1042 (10th Cir.1970). By analogy, the appellants here had no right to resist the seizure of equipment when the agents clearly identified themselves and showed the appellants a copy of the district court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">Fourth, appellants advance the argument that they were denied their Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. They maintain that their attorney was not prepared, failed to file all motions requested by the appellants, and filed other motions that were insufficient. The trial record establishes that appellants\u2019 lawyer exercised \u201cthe skill, judgment and diligence of a reasonably competent defense attorney,\u201d as required by this circuit. <em>United States v. Golub, </em>694 F.2d 207, 213 (10th Cir.1982); <em>United States v. Crouthers, </em>669 F.2d 635, 643 (10th Cir.1982); <em>Dyer v. Crisp, </em>613 F.2d 275, 278 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 945, 100 S.Ct. 1342, 63 L.Ed.2d 779 (1980). The attorney\u2019s decision not to file all motions requested by his clients was not ineffective assistance of counsel. Effective assistance \u201cdoes not demand that every possible motion be filed, but only those having a solid foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Crouthers, supra </em>at 643, quoting <em>United States v. Hines, </em>470 F.2d 225, 232 (3d Cir.1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 U.S. 968, 93 S.Ct. 1452, 35 L.Ed.2d 703 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">Appellants\u2019 fifth claim is that the district court erred in instructing the jury that third persons (for example, Watson, Afflerbach, John Cotton, and Michael Cotton) do not have the right to intervene and assist the person (Annis) whose property the IRS agents had attempted to seize. Appellants assert that the instruction was misleading because they acted to prevent the taking of their own property, not the property of another. It is true that appellants are entitled to instructions on their theory of defense only if there is evidence to reasonably support the theory. <em>United States v. Hoopes, </em>545 F.2d 721, 721 (10th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 954, 97 S.Ct. 2675, 53 L.Ed.2d 270 (1977). As we stated earlier, the district court order allowed the IRS to confiscate Annis\u2019s property, not that of the other appellants. The order was presumptively legal, and the appellants did not present any evidence that the machinery belonged to them. In any event, appellants\u2019 presence on Annis\u2019s property prevented the IRS agents from confiscating any of Annis\u2019s equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">Sixth, appellants make the argument that the IRS lacked \u201cjurisdiction\u201d over Annis\u2019 equipment because Annis was not given advance notice of the levy. However, notice of that levy comported with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>requirements of both <em>G.M. Leasing Corp. v. United States, </em>429 U.S. 338, 350, 97 S.Ct. 619, 627, 50 L.Ed.2d 530 (1977) (\u201cLevy upon tangible property normally is effected by service of forms of levy or notice of levy and physical seizure of the property; where that is not possible, the property is posted or tagged\u201d) and the version of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 6331 then in effect (ten-day notice not required in these circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">Last, appellants argue that they were charged under the wrong statute and that the sentences they received constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Appellants\u2019 assertion of cruel and unusual punishment must fail because the sentences they received were all within the statutory limits. <em>United States v. MacClain, </em>501 F.2d 1006, 1013 (10th Cir.1974). However, <em>Busic v. United States, </em>446 U.S. 398, 100 S.Ct. 1747, 64 L.Ed.2d 381 (1980) compels us to vacate the probationary sentences received by Afflerbach, John Cotton, and Michael Cotton for violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). Because these appellants were convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111, which contains its own enhancement of sentence provision, their sentences cannot be further enhanced by \u00a7 924(c). Thus, although we affirm all the appellants\u2019 convictions and sentences under \u00a7 111, we must vacate the sentences received by Afflerbach, John Cotton, and Michael Cotton under \u00a7 924(c).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b944-8\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-9\">Whoever forcibly assaults, resists, opposes, impedes, intimidates, or interferes with any person designated in section 1114 of this title while engaged in or on account of the performance of his official duties, shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than three years or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-10\">Whoever, in the commission of any such acts uses a deadly or dangerous weapon, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b944-14\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-15\">(a) Whoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-16\">(b) Whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if directly performed by him or another would be an offense against the United States, is punishable as a principal.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b945-6\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-7\">(c) Whoever\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-8\">(1) uses a firearm to commit any felony for which he may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-9\">(2) carries a firearm unlawfully during the commission of any felony for which he may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for the commission of such felony, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for not less than one year nor more than ten years.

Even if the seizure were illegal, appellants' recourse lies in a civil proceeding, not in resisting the seizure themselves.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b947-6\">McKAY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Agv\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">On September 4, 1981, defendants were indicted for impeding Internal Revenue Service agents in carrying out a lawful levy on the property of defendant Harvey Annis. Count I of the indictment charges violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, and Count II of the indictment charges a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-13\">Defendant Afflerbach was convicted and sentenced to seven years on Count I of the indictment and was sentenced to a period of five years probation under Count II of the indictment. Defendant John Cotton was sentenced to two years under Count I of the indictment and to probation for a period of five years under Count II of the indictment. Defendant Michael Cotton was sentenced to incarceration for 18 months under Count I of the indictment and to four years probation under Count II of the indictment. Defendants Harvey Annis and Murray Watson were both convicted only under Count I of the indictment and were sentenced to three years custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-14\">1. <em>Defendants were improperly sentenced under a general criminal statute when their conduct violated a specific statute.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b947-16\">The sentencing in the present case violates the time-honored rule of statutory construction that \u201ca more specific statute will be given precedence over a more general one, regardless of their temporal sequence.\u201d <em>Busic v. United States, </em>446 U.S. 398, 406 (1980). This rule has long been followed to prevent a defendant from being convicted under a general statute when a specific statute more particularly describing his criminal conduct has been enacted. <em>Enzor v. United States, </em>262 F.2d 172 (5th Cir.1958) (conspiracy to sell narcotics must be punished under statute respecting con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>spiracy to violate narcotics laws, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(b), rather than under general conspiracy statute); <em>United States v. Bates, </em>429 F.2d 557 (9th Cir.1970) (conspiracy to sell narcotics must be punished under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237 rather than under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, the general conspiracy statute); <em>Robinson v. United States, </em>142 F.2d 431 (8th Cir.1944) (property stolen from the post office must be punished under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 313 rather than 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 99, which prohibits stealing personal property belonging to the United States).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">The continued reliability of this doctrine of statutory construction has been called into question by a recent United States Supreme Court opinion. In <em>United States v. Batchelder, </em>442 U.S. 114 (1979), the Court held that the U.S. Attorney had the discretion to choose which of two statutes prohibiting receipt of firearms by a convicted felon he would proceed under, even though the statute he proceeded under carried a longer maximum term of imprisonment for its violation. Since <em>Batchelder </em>some courts have held that there is no federal rule limiting the government\u2019s discretion to proceed under a general statute in opposition to the provisions of a specific statute. <em>See United States v. Carpenter, </em>611 F.2d 113 (5th Cir.1980); <em>United States v. Simon, </em>510 F.Supp. 232, 237 (E.D.Pa. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">I find this reliance on <em>Batchelder </em>improper and decline to follow the reasoning of these cases. <em>Batchelder </em>did not involve a general and a specific statute but dealt with two statutes which proscribed, in almost identical terms, the conduct for which the defendant was convicted. Thus the holding in <em>Batchelder </em>does not undermine the longstanding rule that a specific statute governs over a general statute, particularly in light of the <em>Busic </em>Court\u2019s subsequent reliance upon this doctrine in holding the general enhancement statute section 924(c) inapplicable in face of the specific enhancement provision found in section 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">Moreover, the rule that a specific statute should govern over a general statute should not be lightly disregarded. As the Court explained in <em>Simpson v. United States, </em>435 U.S. 6 (1978), the rule that a specific statute should prevail is a corollary to the rule of lenity (\u201cambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity\u201d, <em>United States v. Bass, </em>404 U.S. 336, 347 (1971)), and has \u201cspecial cogency where a court is called upon to determine the extent of the punishment to which a criminal defendant is subject for his transgressions____ [The rule is] an outgrowth of our reluctance to increase or multiply punishments absent a clear and definite legislative directive.\u201d <em>Simpson, </em>435 U.S. at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">I therefore conclude that, despite <em>Batchelder, </em>the rule remains that where a defendant is convicted of a specific crime for which Congress has intentionally proscribed a more lenient punishment, the prosecution and the courts are not at liberty to defy that specific congressional mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-12\">Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 is a general statute that prohibits interference with federal officers in the conduct of their duties, whereas 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7212(a) prohibits the forcible interference with the duties of IRS agents.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>The indictment and evidence at trial proved a violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7212(a). From the foregoing discussion, it is clear that the defendants were convicted under the wrong statute and were therefore improperly sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">II. <em>Defendants\u2019 sentences violated Busic v. United States</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">While normally (as the majority has noted) <em>Busic v. United States, </em>446 U.S. 398 (1980), would require reversal of the section 924(c) sentence, properly analyzed this case does not require this remedy. Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7212(a) under which defendants should have been sentenced does not contain an enhancement provision for the use of firearms. Thus, sentencing under this provision can be accompanied by an enhanced sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) without violating <em>Busic.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">III. <em>Remedy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">The remedy for sentencing under the wrong statute is to remand the case to the district court for resentencing under the proper statute, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7212. <em>See Enzor v. United States, </em>262 F.2d 172,175 (5th Cir.1959); <em>United States v. Bates, </em>429 F.2d 557, 559-60 (9th Cir.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">I concur in the court\u2019s opinion as it relates to the first six issues addressed therein. I would affirm but remand the ease for resentencing on Count I under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7212(a).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b947-9\">.
