We conclude that a petition for certiorari would be frivolous. Appointment of counsel in a case such as this is discretionary, and is to be made \u201cas the interests of justice may dictate.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(c) (1982). Since petitioner has no substantial grounds on which to petition for certiorari, appellant\u2019s petition for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
