We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-27\">SUMMARY OF APPLICABLE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-28\">Sometimes it is useful in a disability case to restate the legal matrix within which such cases arise. This is such a. case. To qualify for disability benefits, a claimant must prove that he is unable to \u201cengage in any substantial gainful activity\u201d attributable to a \u201cmedically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected ... to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A) (1982); <em>Waters v. Gardner, </em>452 F.2d 855, 857 (9th Cir.1971). The claimant\u2019s disability must be \u201cof such severity that ... considering his age, education, and work experience, [he cannot] engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1548\">*1548</page-number>The Secretary has promulgated a regulation to guide the Administrative Law Judge (AU) in determining whether a claimant qualifies for disability benefits. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520 (1984). The regulation sets out a list of factors for the AU to consider during a disability inquiry. First, the AU considers whether the claimant is currently working: \u201cIf you [the claimant] are doing ... substantial gainful activity, we will find that you are not disabled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(b). Second, the claimant\u2019s impairment must be severe: \u201cIf you do not have any impairment(s) which ... limits your ... ability to do basic work activities, we will find that you do not have a severe impairment and are, therefore, not disabled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(c). If the AU finds that an impairment is not severe, the claimant will be denied disabled status regardless of his age, education, and work experience. <em>See id. </em>Third, if a claimant suffers from an impairment listed in Appendix 1 of the regulation, the claimant is presumptively disabled. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 404.-1520(d). When a claimant has a severe impairment that is not enumerated in Appendix 1, the AU determines whether the claimant can perform the kind of work he has done in the past: \u201cIf you can still do this kind of work, we will find you are not disabled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(e). Finally, if a severe impairment precludes a claimant from \u201cdoing past relevant work,\u201d the AU will \u201csee if you can do other work. If not, you are disabled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(f)(1). With the requirements of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423 and 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520, arrayed like the pales of a stockade in mind, we turn to their application to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-5\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"A9x\">Key, a fifty-five year old man, has received electrical engineering training and in previous years has worked as a draftsman, a gardener, and a warehouseman. In 1959, Key sustained a severe head injury but subsequently returned to work and engaged in substantial gainful activity until 1981. On October 14, 1981, he applied for disability benefits. Key claims that his head injury, a heart condition, a balance problem, and difficulty in walking has rendered him disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-10\">At the disability hearing, Key testified that he can walk a mile, can sit for an hour, and can stand for two hours. Key also testified that he can lift 150 pounds, that he drives a car, that he performs household chores, and that he attends a prayer meeting and Bible study at his church that lasts for two hours. Key\u2019s wife corroborated the claimant\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-11\">Based on the medical evidence submitted at the hearing and Key\u2019s own testimony, the AU found that, although Key suffers from post-right hemisphere trauma with mild left-hemiparesis, he retains the ability to perform basic work-related activities.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The AU therefore determined that Key is not disabled. The Appeals Council affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-12\">Key filed a complaint for review of the Secretary\u2019s decision in district court. The district court affirmed the Secretary\u2019s decision. Key filed a timely appeal with this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-14\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-15\">Key advances four arguments on appeal. First, he alleges that the AU\u2019s categorization of his impairments as \u201cnon-severe\u201d and therefore not disabling lacks substantial evidence. Second, Key argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1549\">*1549</page-number>AU failed to fully and fairly develop the record at the disability hearing. Third, he asserts that this court should remand the case to the AU for consideration of new evidence. Finally, Key attacks the validity of the Secretary\u2019s \u201cseverity\u201d regulation and maintains that 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(c) (1984) conflicts with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A) (1982). We hold that none of these contentions justifies a reversal of the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"AUOg\">A. <em>Substantial Evidence of a Non-Se</em>vene <em>Disability</em></p>\n<p id=\"AN_\">Our scope of review of disability determinations is limited: \u201cThe findings of the Secretary as to any fact, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive ....\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1982); <em>Chavies v. Finck, </em>443 F.2d 356, 357 (9th Cir.1971); <em>Rhinehart v. Finch, </em>438 F.2d 920, 921 (9th Cir.1971). Substantial evidence means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind would accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1427, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971); <em>Vidal v. Harris, </em>637 F.2d 710, 712 (9th Cir.1981). Where the evidence as a whole can support either outcome, we may not substitute our judgment for the AU\u2019s. <em>See Sample v. Schweiker, </em>694 F.2d 639, 642 (9th Cir.1982). This latter principle is particularly applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"AUjp\">Here, the AU heard conflicting reports from medical experts. Dr. Sung, Dr. Jesson, and Dr. Peterson concluded that Key\u2019s physical ailments prevented him from engaging in substantial gainful activity. The clinical findings of Dr. Mehta and Dr. Hunter, however, contradict their reports. Dr. Mehta confirmed Dr. Sung\u2019s and Dr. Peterson\u2019s diagnoses of Meniere\u2019s disease, but noted that the condition had been treated with Antivert. Dr. Mehta, although offering no opinion on the appellant\u2019s employability, indicated that Key seemed well-oriented and under no apparent distress. Dr. Hunter, moreover, con-eluded that the physical symptoms stemming from the 1959 accident did not render Key totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"AkM\">The AU, after considering all the evidence regarding his physical condition, con-eluded that Key did not have a severe disability and could perform basic work-related activities. The medical evidence Panted perhaps would permit a reason-ab*e m\u2122d make a finding of disability. <em>U </em>also would Permit a finding of no disabi1' ^ When there is evidence sufficient to suPPort either outcome, we must affirm the decision actually made- <em>See Rhinehart </em>438 F.2d at 921.</p>\n<p id=\"A8n\">Key argues, however, that none of the reports of the medical experts conflict with regard to the diagnosis of Meniere\u2019s disease. Therefore, Key contends, he suffers from an impairment listed in Appendix 1, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 2.00 B.2, and is presumptively disabled, <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(d). This does not carry the day for Key, however.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A-L\">The mere diagnosis of an impairment listed in Appendix 1 is not sufficient to sustain a finding of disability. The Listing of Impairments does describe conditions that are generally considered severe enough to prevent a person from doing any gainful activity. But the AU \u201cwill not consider your impairment to be one listed in Appendix 1 solely because it has the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1550\">*1550</page-number>diagnosis of a listed impairment. It must also have the <em>findings </em>shown in the Listing of that impairment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1525(d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-4\">Dr. Sung, Dr. Peterson, and Dr. Mehta all diagnosed Meniere\u2019s disease. For the diagnosis of Meniere\u2019s disease to qualify as a listed impairment, though, a number of other findings are necessary. The findings must include disturbances of balance characterized by \u201can hallucination of motion or loss of position sense and a sensation of dizziness____ Nausea, vomiting, <em>ataxia </em>and incapacitation are frequently observed.\u201d 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, App. 1 \u00a7 2.00 B.2 (emphasis added). Yet Dr. Hunter, who performed a full neurological examination, found no evidence of ataxia. Meniere\u2019s disease, when severe, is characterized by \u201cparoxysmal attacks of vertigo, tinnitus, and fluctuating hearing loss.\u201d 20 C.F.R. pt.. 404, subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 2.00 B.2. Here, however, Dr. Hunter found that \u201cauditory acuity was normal.\u201d Because of the lack of the required findings, the AD\u2019s conclusion withstands Key\u2019s attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-7\">Likewise, the diagnosis of mild lefthemiparesis does not establish the existence of persistent disorganization of motor function, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 11.00(C), or a central nervous vascular accident, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 11.04. The assessment of an impairment under section 11.00(C) \u201cdepends on the degree of interference with locomotion and/or interference with the use of fingers, hands, and arms.\u201d 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 11.00(C). Yet Dr. Hunter found that Key\u2019s muscle size, strength, and tone were normal and that Key showed surprisingly good bilateral grip strength. Under section 11.04, a claimant must exhibit \u201cineffective speech or communication\u201d or \u201csignificant and persistent disorganization of motor function.\u201d 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 11.04. But while Dr. Mehta noted that Key\u2019s speech was mildly dysarthic and that he walked with a broad based gait, Dr. Hunter described Key as \u201ccommunicative\u201d and found no objective evidence to support the claimant\u2019s complaints of \u201cunsteadiness.\u201d Given this conflict in medical evidence, the AU properly declined to consider Key\u2019s condition as equivalent to either listed impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-9\">Key also relies on the report submitted by Dr. Dorr to the Appeals Council after the AU\u2019s decision. Dr. Dorr, a psychiatrist, diagnosed dementia, a condition which satisfies the criteria of a listed mental impairment in the Secretary\u2019s regulations. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 12.02. Dr. Hunter\u2019s mental status examination, however, revealed that Key displayed average intellectual functioning with fully intact recent and remote memory, judgment, affect, and sensorium and no sign of emotional disturbance or delusional thinking. He concluded that Key did not suffer from dementia. Again, the AU has the power to weigh conflicting evidence and reach the conclusion that Key did not suffer from a severe mental impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-10\">Key argues that the AU should have excluded Dr. Hunter\u2019s medical report on the ground that it was biased. We disagree. Nothing in the record indicates that Dr. Hunter demonstrated any bias toward Key during the medical examinations or during the preparation of reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-11\">Therefore, we conclude that the AU\u2019s finding that Key did not suffer from a severe disability is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-12\">B. <em>Failure to Fully and Fairly Develop the Record</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1626-13\">Appellant urges us to remand the case for a further hearing because the AU did not fully and fairly develop the record. Key proceeded at the administrative hearing without the assistance of counsel and now claims that the AU did not conduct the hearing in a manner designed to elicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1551\">*1551</page-number>all his pertinent testimony regarding his disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-5\">Administrative procedures \u201cshould be understandable to the layman claimant ... and not strict in tone and operation.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 400, 01, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1426, 1427, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971). When a claimant appears at a hearing without counsel, the AU must \u201cscrupulously and conscientiously probe into, inquire of, and explore for all the relevant facts. He must be especially diligent in ensuring that favorable as well as unfavorable facts and circumstances are elicited.\u201d <em>Cox v. Califano, </em>587 F.2d 988, 991 (9th Cir.1978). <em>See also Vidal v. Harris, </em>637 F.2d 710, 713 (9th Cir.1981). Lack of counsel does not affect the validity of the hearing unless the plaintiff can demonstrate prejudice or unfairness in the administrative proceedings. <em>Vidal, </em>637 F.2d at 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-7\">Key marshals a number of charges directed at the AU. He asserts that the AU interrupted his answers, did not explore his heart condition, failed to inquire about the effects of Meniere\u2019s disease, and neglected to develop important vocational information to determine whether he worked in a sheltered or competitive capacity in California. The record contradicts each of these contentions. The AU did not \u201cthwart meaningful responses,\u201d but merely sought to clarify unclear statements by Key. The AU questioned Key about his alleged heart condition and his answers are part of the record. The AU also inquired about the frequency of Key\u2019s dizzy spells resulting from Meniere\u2019s disease. Finally, whether Key worked in a sheltered or competitive environment and can perform his past work is irrelevant in determining whether he now can perform basic work-related activities. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-8\">The AU, then, did not fail to fully and fairly develop the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-9\">C. <em>Consideration of New Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1627-10\">Key urges us to remand the case to the Secretary for consideration of new evidence. This court has jurisdiction to remand matters on appeal for consideration of newly discovered evidence. <em>See Goerg v. Schweiker, </em>643 F.2d 582, 584 (9th Cir.1981); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Section 405(g) expressly provides for remand where new evidence is material and there is good cause for the failure to incorporate the evidence in a prior proceeding. <em>See Burton v. Heckler, </em>724 F.2d 1415, 1417 (9th Cir.1984). To meet the materiality requirement, the new evidence must bear directly and substantially on the matter. <em>Id. </em>If new information surfaces after the Secretary\u2019s final decision and the claimant could not have obtained that evidence at the time of the administrative proceeding, the good cause requirement is satisfied. <em>See Booz v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>734 F.2d 1378, 1380 (9th Cir.1984). At a minimum, such evidence must be probative of mental or physical impairment. <em>Hall v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>602 F.2d 1372, 1377 (9th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-12\">Key\u2019s new evidence is a medical report prepared by Dr. Jacobs, dated April 23, 1984, that tends to show that he suffered from severe ataxia, lack of balance, and mild double vision. Key, however, offers no reason why he had not solicited this information from Dr. Jacobs earlier. Nor does Key tell us why he did not ask the district court to consider the evidence. The obvious explanation is that when Key failed to succeed on his disability claim in the agency and district court hearings, he sought out a new expert witness who might better support his position. The \u201cgood cause\u201d requirement would \u201cbe meaningless if such circumstances were sufficient to allow introduction of new evidence.\u201d <em>Allen v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>726 F.2d 1470, 1473 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-13\">Since Key failed to meet the \u201cgood cause\u201d requirement, we decline to remand the case for consideration of new evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-14\">D. <em>The Validity of the Severity Regulation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1627-15\">Finally, Key argues that the Secretary\u2019s \u201cseverity\u201d regulation, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1552\">*1552</page-number>1520(c) (1984), conflicts with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A) because in some instances a no disability determination may be made on the basis of medical evidence alone without consideration of the claimant\u2019s age, education, work experience, and ability to perform past work. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A) provides that an individual is disabled if his impairments are of such severity that he cannot do his past work and, considering his age, education, and work experience, cannot do any other work which exists in the national economy. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.-1520(c) provides, however, that if an impairment is not severe, i.e., one that does not \u201csignificantly limit[] [the claimant\u2019s] physical or mental ability to do basic work activities,\u201d a finding of not disabled is mandated without consideration of the claimant\u2019s age, education, and work experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-4\">A lack of symmetry certainly appears to exist. Key correctly points out that the regulation shifts the focus from his ability to do past work to his ability to perform \u201cbasic work activities.\u201d The regulation also precludes the Secretary from considering a claimant\u2019s age, education, and work experience when the impairment is not severe. Instead, the regulation focuses entirely on the severity of the impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-5\">Our criticism is checked, however, by the fact that Congress has entrusted the Secretary with the primary responsibility for interpreting the Social Security Act. We are not free to set aside a regulation promulgated by the Secretary simply because we might have interpreted the statute differently. <em>See Batterton v. Francis, </em>432 U.S. 416, 425, 97 S.Ct. 2399, 2405, 53 L.Ed.2d 448 (1977). We should declare a regulation invalid only if the Secretary exceeded his or her statutory authority or if the regulation is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law. <em>See id. </em>at 426, 97 S.Ct. at 2406.</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-6\">In this case, however, we need not reach the issue of the validity of the severity regulation. The AU determined that Key had failed to establish the presence of any significant restrictions on his ability to perform basic work activities and thus had no severe impairment. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(c). But even assuming the invalidity of this provision, the finding of no disability is still supported by substantial evidence. If a claimant does have a severe impairment, the last step of the sequential analysis requires that the AU see whether that claimant \u201ccan do other work.\u201d <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(f)(1) (1984). To make this determination, the AU considers the claimant\u2019s functional capacity, age, education, and past work experience. <em>Id. </em>This is precisely the inquiry made by the AU under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A). Here, Key has testified that he lost his last job not because of a disability but because \u201cmy time ran out with the State of California.\u201d Dr. Hunter, moreover, opined that \u201cnothing ... would support his claim of total disability\u201d and that Key could return to other gainful employment. Therefore, the AU properly concluded that Key did not qualify for disability benefits even if we do not consider the severity regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment affirming the Secretary\u2019s determination that Key is not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1624-6\">. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1521 (1984) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1624-7\">(a) <em>Non-Severe Impairment. </em>An impairment is not severe if it does not significantly limit your physical or mental abilities to do basic work activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1624-8\">(b) <em>Basic Work Activities. </em>When we talk about basic work activities we mean the abilities and aptitudes necessary to do most jobs.

Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1629-8\">Appendix 1 sets forth impairments which the Secretary considers to be \u201csevere\u201d and if the claimant\u2019s impairment is either listed or equal to a listed impairment, \u201cw.e will find you disabled without considering your age, education, and work experience.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1629-9\">Section 404.1525(a) of Title 20 of the Code of Federal Regulations sets forth the purpose of the Listing of Impairments as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1629-12\">The Listing of Impairments describes, for each of the major body systems, impairments which are considered severe enough to prevent a person from doing any gainful activity. Most of the listed impairments are permanent or expected to result in death, or a specific statement of duration is made. For all others, the evidence must show that the impairment has lasted or is expected to last for a continuous period of at least 12 months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1629-13\">Each section of the Listing of Impairments contains a general introduction giving definitions of key concepts and certain required medical findings to support impairments used in that section. In addition, the required level of severity is shown by one or more sets of medical findings under \u201cCategory of Impairments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1629-14\">One of the listed impairments is Meniere\u2019s disease. Appendix 1 discusses special sense and speech impairments in sections 2.00 through 2.09. Section 2.00(B)(2) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1629-15\"><em>Vertigo associated with disturbances of labyrinthine-vestibular function, including Meniere\u2019s disease. </em>These disturbances of balance are characterized by an hallucination of motion or loss of position sense and a sensation of dizziness which may be constant or may occur in paroxysmal attacks. Nausea, vomiting, ataxia and incapacitation are frequently observed, particularly during the acute attack____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1629-16\">Meniere\u2019s disease is characterized by paroxysmal attacks of vertigo, tinnitus, and fluctuating hearing loss. Remissions are unpredictable and irregular, but may be long-lasting; hence, the severity of impairment is best determined after prolonged observation and serial reexaminations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1629-17\">The AU does not dispute the diagnosis of Key as having Meniere\u2019s disease and in fact indicated it formed a part of the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1554\">*1554</page-number>dence considered in reaching his decision. While the AU is not obligated to find a claimant\u2019s impairment to be one listed in Appendix 1 solely because it has the diagnosis of a listed impairment (20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1525(d)), he must examine the evidence to determine if the appropriate findings are present as listed therein. In this case, the AU made no determination as to whether the medical findings of the physicians who examined Key and submitted reports met or equaled the findings required under the category of impairments for special sense and speech impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1630-4\">Likewise, the diagnosis of left hemiparesis noted by the AU and confirmed by Drs. Mehta, Peterson and Sung was not considered in conformity with Appendix 1. The left hemiparesis occurred as a result of an automobile accident in which Key suffered major brain damage, and such impairment is also listed in Appendix 1, section 11.00(C), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1630-5\"><em>Persistent disorganization of motor function </em>in the form of paresis or paralysis, tremor or other involuntary movements, ataxia and sensory disturbances (any or all of which may be due to cerebral, cerebellar, brain stem, spinal cord, or peripheral nerve dysfunction) which occur singly or in various combinations, frequently provides the sole or partial basis for decision in cases of neurological impairment. The assessment of impairment depends on the degree of interference with locomotion and/or interference with the use of fingers, hands, and arms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1630-6\">Further, section 11.04 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1630-7\"><em>Central nervous system vascular accident. </em>With one of the following more than 3 months post-vascular accident:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1630-8\">A. Sensory or motor aphasia resulting in ineffective speech or communication; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1630-9\">B. Significant and persistent disorganization of motor function in two extremities, resulting in sustained disturbance of gross and dexterous movements, or gait and station.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1630-10\">Dr. Mehta\u2019s report of December 3, 1981 indicates Key\u2019s speech is mildly dysarthric, he walks with a broad based gait, and has diminished arm swing on the left with a slightly left accent to the gait. These medical findings support the required level of severity as required under section 11.04 and should have been considered by the AU.</p>\n<p id=\"b1630-11\">The AU should also consider the reports of Dr. Dorr (a psychiatrist who examined Key in 1982 but whose report was not submitted to the appeals council until after the AU\u2019s decision) and Dr. Jacobs (whose report dated April 23, 1984 was directed to Dr. Donald Klotz and was not received by Key\u2019s counsel until May 14, 1984). <em>See Burton v. Heckler, </em>724 F.2d 1415, 1418 (9th Cir.1984) (fact that the evidence did not exist at the time of the AU\u2019s decision establishes good cause for a claimant\u2019s failure to introduce it before the AU). The materiality of these two reports is clear. Dr. Dorr found Key suffering from dementia, post traumatic. Appendix 1 discusses mental disorders in sections 12.00 through 12.05 and specifically provides in section 12.02 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1630-12\"><em>Chronic brain syndromes (organic brain syndromes). </em>With both A and B:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1630-13\">A. Demonstrated deterioration in intellectual functioning, manifested by persistance of one or more of the following clinical signs:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1630-14\">1. Marked memory defect for recent events; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1630-15\">2. Impoverished, slowed, perseverative thinking, with confusion or disorientation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1630-16\">3. Liable, shallow or course affect;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1630-17\">B. Resulting persistence of marked restriction of daily activities and construction of interests and deterioration in personal habits and seriously impaired ability to relate to other people.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1630-18\">Dr. Dorr specifically sets forth the clinical evidence upon which he relied in forming his opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1555\">*1555</page-number>There are no signs of a primary thinking disorder but many clinical evidences of an organic brain syndrome, to wit: psychomotor retardation (long delays in answering personal data questions); confusion about which side of his brain was injured; inability to recall the name of the drafting school he attended for many months; only approximate orientation; poor immediate recall; perserveration of thought; peculiar use of the word \u201copen\u201d in place of \u201cunemployed\u201d; and an exaggeration of the intellectual tasks involved in his jobs since his accident. In my opinion he grossly overestimates his ability to work as a draftsman (since he can no longer use a slide rule and has been unable to learn to use a computer).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1631-5\">The report of Dr. Jacobs sets forth medical findings as a result of his neurologic examination of Key which the AU should consider in determining whether Key\u2019s impairments meet the required level of severity as provided in Appendix 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1631-6\">It is clear from the record in this case that Key\u2019s impairments (Meniere\u2019s disease, left hemiparesis and dementia) are all listed as \u201csevere\u201d impairments in Appendix 1 of Subpart P of Regulations No. 4, and the AU should have reviewed the evidence to determine if the medical findings met or equaled the required showing contained in Appendix 1 for these listed impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1631-7\">Because the AU failed to consider whether the medical evidence supported the required level of severity in conformity with the guidelines of Appendix 1, this case should be remanded so the proper determination can be made in conjunction with Title 20 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
