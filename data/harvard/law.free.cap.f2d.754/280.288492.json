For reversal, the Kuceras allege that their complaint stated violations of the Truth in Lending Act (Act), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601 <em>et seq. </em>(1982), by the Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Company (Bank), and Dan B. McNair, an employee of the Bank.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">After carefully reviewing the record, we agree that the district court properly dismissed the complaint. The Kuceras\u2019 argument that the Bank violated the general disclosure requirements of the Act is barred by the Act\u2019s one-year period of limitation. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(e). Moreover, all of the loans are exempt from coverage under the Act\u2019s right-of-rescission provision. The right of rescission only applies to loans secured by the debtor\u2019s principal place of residence. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1635(a). Although the Kuceras alleged that the loans were secured by their principal place of residence, all of the loans show they were secured by a 1978 security agreement, and that they were renewal or refinancing transactions. \u201c[A] transaction which constitutes a refinancing * * * of an existing extension of credit by the same creditor secured by an interest in the same property\u201d is exempt from the right-of-rescission provision. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1635(e)(1)(B). Therefore, even if the loans were secured by the Kuceras\u2019 principal residence, the seven refinancing transactions are exempt from coverage under the right-of-rescission.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-14\">The Kuceras\u2019 complaint also sets forth a variety of additional claims listing numerous federal statutes, state and federal constitutional provisions, and assorted equitable principles as bases of jurisdiction. We have carefully reviewed the complaint and agree with the district court that the additional claims are without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-11\">. The Honorable Warren K.
