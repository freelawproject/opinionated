Appellant sought review of the administrative denial of his claim for veterans\u2019 benefits. The district court dismissed his complaint because judicial review of decisions of the Veterans\u2019 Administration is barred by 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 211(a) (1982) and because appellant\u2019s complaint did not constitute the type of constitutional challenge to veterans\u2019 legislation subject to judicial review under <em>Johnson v. Robison, </em>415 U.S. 361, 366-74, 94 S.Ct. 1160, 1165-69, 39 L.Ed.2d 389 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-13\">We have carefully reviewed the record and summarily affirm the order of the district court dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint with prejudice. 8th Cir.R. 12(a).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b880-14\">.
