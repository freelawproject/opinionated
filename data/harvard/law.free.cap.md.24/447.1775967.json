The principal is notwithstanding answerable when discovered.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b455-12\">And such is the law with regard to a plaintiff principal who contracts by an agent. If the agent contracts in his own name without disclosing the principal, either the agent or the principal may sue upon the contract; the defendant in the latter case being entitled to be placed in the same situation at the time of the disclosure of the principal as if the agent had been the contracting party.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b455-13\">In all cases of contracts by agents without disclosing their principals, the Courts in affording remedies will look to the substantial parties in interest, in order to avoid circuity of actions ; saving however to the defendant any rights which he may justly acquire as against the plaintiff by the course of dealing anterior to the disclosure, either with the agent of the plaintiff or his own agent.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>The principal will not be made personally liable if in the intermediate time he has settled with his agent without any suspicion of his own personal liability, or if he would otherwise, without any default on his own part be prejudiced by being made personally liable.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b456-5\">In such cases it is essential that the plaintiff should in some way have either deceived the principal or induced him to alter his position and account towards his agent before he is deprived of his remedy against the principal.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b456-6\">It is now settled that the simple fact that the principal has paid his agent the funds with which to pay the plaintiff, does not deprive the plaintiff of his right to look to the principal if the agent fail to pay over according to his orders.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b456-7\">-: --: Province oe Court and Jury. \u2014 In an action at law where the question of agency is involved, if there is evidence to establish such agency, the jury are the exclusive judges of its weight.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b456-9\">Appeal from the Court of Common Pleas for Baltimore City.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-10\">This was au action instituted hy the appellant to recover a balance due on a loan of $3,000 made by it to the appellees on the 11th of March, 1861, payable in 90 days.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-11\"><em>Exception. </em>\u2014 At the trial of the cause, the plaintiff, to maintain the issues on its part joined, proved by George Small, a competent witness, that a few days before the transactions out of which this case arose, the president of the plaintiff, who was the father of the witness, and who lived in York, Pennsylvania, being then in the City of Baltimore, called, at the suggestion of the witness, at the office of several brokers, in company with the witness, and among others, at that of J. R. McGinn, and stated that the plaintiff had money to lend on good collateral security, and inquired if said broker knew of any one who wished to borrow, and that said McGinn, in reply to the inquiry made of him, said that one of his customers, then present, would take said loan, and in the presence of said customer named the collaterals which he had to offer, and that the president replied that he was not authorized to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>make said loan on said collaterals without the authority of his hoard, and promised on his return home to telegraph the witness, Small, on the subject; that he did so telegraph said witness, and that said loan was not made; that said McGinn, in a few days after, called on the witness and inquired whether or not the plaintiff still had any of said money to lend, and stated that one of his, the said McGinn\u2019s customers, desired to borrow 03,000 thereof, on 05.000 of Virginia bonds as collateral security ; that said witness communicated said proposition to the president of the plaintiff, and in reply received a letter, which he had diligently searched for, hut was unable to find, authorizing him to accept said proposition, and enclosing him for that purpose a check for the amount of the loan after deducting the discount; that when witness received the check and the authority of the bank to make the loan, he notified McGinn, and closed the transaction he thinks in McGinn\u2019s office ; that the loan was of 03,000, for 90 days on the security of $5,000 Virginia bonds ; that witness handed McGinn the check, and received from him the bonds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-6\">The plaintiff then produced the paper marked A, which is as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-7\"><em>u </em>We have this day received of Mr. George Small the sum of three thousand dollars (03,000) returnable on 11th day of June next.

That Small and McGinn, both being agents, and so known to each other, had no right to make the con-contract in their own names, and the rights of the parties to this cause were precisely the same as if the principals had themselves negotiated the loan without the intervention of agents. <em>Story on Agents, sec. </em>28.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b467-9\">2nd. That the appellant was entitled to sue, either on the implied <em>assumpsit </em>arising from the ownership of the money or on the express contract, notwithstanding its having been made in the agent\u2019s name. <em>Higdon vs. </em>Thomas, 1. <em>H. &amp; </em>G., 153. <em>New Jersey Steam Nav. Co. vs. Merchants\u2019 Bank, </em>6 <em>Howard, </em>378. <em>Ford vs. Williams, </em>21 <em>Howard, </em>289.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b467-10\">3rd. Even if credit was given by Small to McGinn, although he knew that McGinn was acting as a broker, he did not know for whom he was so acting, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>undisclosed principal can, when discovered, be sued. <em>Henderson vs. Mayhew, </em>2 <em>Gill, </em>408.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-5\">4th. The appellees were not entitled to credit for any payments made to McGinn after they knew that the appellant was a principal; the proof is that they were so informed when they received the money, long before they made any payment, and were then told that Small was the appellant\u2019s agent. Any payment subsequently made by them to McGinn was at their own risk. 6 <em>Howard, </em>381.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-6\">5th. Small was only an agent to consummate the loan on the terms which had been proposed and accepted. That done, he was <em>functus officio. </em>He had no right to alter the contract after it was made so as to authorize a a call for margin. He was not entitled to receive the money even when it was due, still less to receive a payment in advance, still less to authorize any one else to do so; and the appellant was not bound by his call for a margin, except as to the $500, which it received. <em>Story on Agency, sec. </em>109.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-7\">6th. If Small\u2019s agency was more extensive he had no right to delegate his trust to any one else. The bank would not, therefore, be chargeable with the money paid to McGinn, even if Small authorized him to receive it. But it is clear he gave no such authority. He called on McGinn for margins, which McGinn had contracted to furnish; McGinn acted throughout as the agent of the appellees, and they have no right to shift upon others the loss resulting from their misplaced confidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-8\">1th. The contract between Small and McGinn, before it was altered by them without authority from the appellant, gave Small no right to call for margins. The contract between McGinn and the appellees gave Mc-Ginn no right to require any. The appellees recognized no such right. Instead of paying the margin called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>for they made a payment in advance on account of the loan. This was the payment which McGinn appropriated, and about which the controversy exists. It is clear that, even if McGinn had been the agent of the appellant, he had no right to receive such a payment, and the appellant is not hound thereby.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-5\">8th. The fact o\u00ed the appellees having paid McGinn for negotiating the loan shows that he was their agent. If not clearly so, there was, at least, evidence from which the jury was entitled to find that he was, and the Court erred in deciding that the appellant was responsible for all the payments made to him without leaving that question to the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-6\">9 th. Even if McGinn had been originally the agent of the appellant, or of both parties, his agency terminated with the making of the loan, and he was not entitled, as against the appellant, to receive margins or payment in advance. <em>Story on Agency, sec. </em>109.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b469-7\"><em>Wm. F. Frick </em>for the appellees contended.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-8\">I. That Small was the agent of the plaintiffs, not merely to make the loan, hut to do all that he did in the transaction. And that the plaintiffs are not at liberty to repudiate any ot his acts. It was on their behalf that he made the contract, in manner and form as he did ; on their behalf that he superadded to the contract, the condition about \u201cmargins;\u201d and on their part, and for their benefit, that he called for the margin, received one, and paid it over to the plaintiffs. Whether originally authorized to go to this extent, matters not. Their subsequent conduct ratified his acts. <em>Story on Agency, secs. 253, </em>259. <em>Also secs. 244, 249. </em>And their receipts of the margin precludes them from objecting to his proceedings. In ratifying them in part they adopt <em>the </em>whole. <em>Story on Agency, sec. </em>250.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>II. The allowance hy the hank of the manner and terms in which Small contracted with McGinn, and called for margins through him, and the acceptance hy the hank of the margins received under that contract and call, justified the act of Small in making McGinn the sub-agent in the bank; and McGinn became, <em>quoad </em>the calls for and receipts of margins from Stein, the agent of the bank. <em>Story on Agency, sec. </em>249.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-5\">III. But whether these points be well taken or not it is clear that this is a case where the contract was in writing, and on its face McGinn was the principal. It is true that he was known to be only an agent, but his principal was not disclosed or asked for by the other party. McGinn was therefore personally responsible upon the written contract, and cannot be discharged as such by parol evidence. It is true that the principal when disclosed was also bound ; but with this important qualification, that if he in the intermediate time had settled with his agent, he could not be held bound. <em>Story on Agency, sec. </em>449, <em>and note. And Paley on Agency, (by Lloyd,) </em>246-254.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-6\">The different cases in which the agent alone, or the principal alone, or both are bound, are well put in this note. The point, however, is settled by the case of <em>Thompson vs. Davenport, </em>9 <em>Barn. </em>&amp; <em>Cress., </em>78 <em>et seq. </em>Lord Tenderdoet says, the case of a party dealing with an agent, knowing him to be such, but not inquiring who is the principal, is like that of a party dealing with an agent, and supposing him to be a principal. That is to say, in both cases, the principal when disclosed may be charged, \u201csubject, however, to this qualification, that the state of the account between the principal and agent is not altered to the disadvantage of the principal.\u201d Justice Bayley puts it in this language: \u201cIf the principal has paid the agent, or if the state of the accounts between the agent and principal would make it unjust that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Seller should call on the principal,\u201d it is an ansAv.er to the action, &amp;c.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b471-5\">Weisel, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AC0\">delivered the opinion of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The appeal in this case is from a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas for Baltimore City, and the questions raised by the record and briefs are :</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">First. Whether the action can be maintained betAveen the parties;</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Secondly. If so, whether the defendants were entitled to a certain credit for five hundred dollars claimed by them under their plea of payment, which was resisted by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">The facts set out in the exception, as proved in the cause, and Avhich were to be found by the jury, show that the contract sued on was made by the agents of the respective parties ; the plaintiff being made known to the defendants at the time of the contract, but the defendants not being disclosed until some time afterwards, but before the day of payment arrived ; it being known however to the plaintiff at the time of the contract that McGfinn, a broker, was acting as an agent in the premises for one of his customers. As to the liability of the defendants to the plaintiff in such a case this Court entertains no doubt or difficulty. The laAV is avcII settled that the principal is personally responsible in all .cases of contracts made by an agent, within the scope of his authority, and this is not varied by the fact that the agent contracts in his own name, whether he discloses his agency or not, provided the circumstances of the case do not shoAV that an exclusive credit was given to the agent. The circumstance that the name of the principal was not disclosed at the time of the contract, does not determine the election of the plaintiff to look to the agent alone for the fulfillment of the contract. The principal is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>notwithstanding, answerable when discovered. <em>Story on Agency, sec. </em>446 <em>and notes. Thomson vs. Davenport, </em>9 <em>Barn. &amp; Cres., </em>73. And such is the law with regard to a plaintiff, principal, who contracts by an agent. If the agent contracts in his own name without disclosing the principal, either the agent or the principal may sue upon the contract; the defendant in the latter case being entitled to be placed in the same situation, at the time of the disclosure of the principal as if the agent had been the contracting party. <em>Sims vs. Bond, </em>5 <em>Barn. &amp; Adol., </em>389. <em>New Jersey Steam Nav. Co., vs. Merchants' Bank of Boston, </em>6 <em>How. </em>380, 381. In all cases of contracts by agents, without disclosing their principals, the Courts in affording' remedies, will look to the substantial parties in interest, in order to avoid circuity of actions, saving however to the defendant any rights which he may justly acquire as against the plaintiff by the course of dealing anterior to the disclosure, either with the agent of the plaintiff, or his own agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The liability of the defendants in this case, under the law as herein stated, was not disputed by their counsel in the argument, but it was insisted, and that is the main point of inquiry, that their responsibility must be taken with this qualification, that if in the meantime, before their names were disclosed, they had settled with their agent they could not be held bound, and that the payment by them of both the margins called for the plaintiff to their agent before their names were made known, enured to their benefit and should be credited on the plaintiff\u2019s claim in suit, whether paid over by their agent to the plaintiff or his agent, or not. That the rule of the defendant\u2019s liability is subject to a qualification, arising from his transactions in relation to the contract with his agent in the interval, which will discharge it under certain circumstances, is true. This qualification is stated by Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Story <em>(Agency, Sec. </em>449,) thus : \u201cThat the principal will not be made personally liable, if, in the intermediate time, he has settled with his agent, without any suspicion of his own personal liability, or if he would otherwise, without any default on his own part, be prejudiced by being made personally liable.\u201d Examples are given and the authorities cited both in the text, and in the notes, to illustrate and explain the extent and bearing of this qualification, and the section concludes with the author\u2019s view of it, as derived from the later decisions. In all the cases he declares it essential that the plaintiff should in some way have either deceived the principal, or induced him to alter his position and account towards his agent, before he is deprived of his remedy against the principal; and that it is how settled that the simple fact that the principal has paid his agent the funds with which to pay the plaintiff, does not deprive the plaintiff of his right to look to the principal, if the agent fail to pay over according to his orders. Same sec. and Pabkh Baron <em>in Heald vs. Kenworthy, </em>10 <em>Ex., </em>739, and other cases cited in note 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The instruction of the Court below to the jury on the trial of this cause, was, that if they believed the facts stated in the bill of exceptions, then the defendants were entitled, as against the plaintiff, to be credited with all the money paid by them to McGinn, whether paid over by him to Small or the plaintiff, or not. This was given upon one of two grounds, either that McGinn, in the matter of the margins, acted as the agent of the plaintiff, and that his receipt of them was the receipt of the plaintiff ; or, that the payment of the margins to McGinn, as the agent of the defendants, exonerated them under the circumstances from their amount in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">If the former, then the Court erred, inasmuch as it took from the jury the question of fact as to McGinn\u2019s agency for the plaintiff in the receipt of the margins, and assumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>that there was not only evidence, but sufficient evidence of it, and upon such assumption absolutely instructed the-jury to allow the credits. If there was evidence to establish such an agency, the jury were the exclusive judges of its weight. <em>Henderson vs. Mayhew, </em>2 <em>Gill, </em>409.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">If, however, the Court acted upon the other ground, and considered, as a conclusion of law, that the payment of the margins by the defendants to their own agent, before the disclosure of their names to the plaintiff, discharged them from further liability for such amount of them a\u00bb was not paid over to the plaintiff or its agent, we think that in -this view the Court also erred in the instruction given. In looking at the evidence.in the exception we discover nothing that would tend to show that the plaintiff or his agent, in calling for the margins through McGrinn, either deceived the defendants or induced them to alter their position or account towards their agent, or so acted as manifestly to make it unjust in the plaintiff to recover the amount. The contract was made with McGrinn as a broker and agent for a then unknown principal, the defendants, who received by way of loan the plaintiff\u2019s money, upon a security that was failing to answer the purpose, and which it was agreed should be strengthened by what are termed margins, or additional collaterals. Under the circumstances, McGrinn was. the proper party to whom the application for the margins should have been made. They were made to him as the only known channel of communication with the real borrower, or as the party personally bound to furnish the required collaterals, and within three days of each other ; and the only response to both was the receipt of five hundred dollars which was applied to the plaintiff\u2019s claim ; but whether this was the money of the agent, or was paid by the defendants, neither the plaintiff nor its agent, Small, then knew. In this we see nothing that could bring the payment of the margins to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>the defendant\u2019s agent, within the qualification of the rule of liability as understood and settled by the authorities to which we have adverted. In other words, we do not see in the record any evidence that would exempt the defendants from the payment they claim to have made.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AnU\">(Decided April 11th, 1866.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The instruction given to the jury being therefore erroneous upon both grounds, the judgment of the Court below must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">In passing upon the prayer of the plaintiff and the instruction asked in it, we see nothing objectionable in them as presented. The controversy was narrowed by the pleadings to the one margin that had been received by McGinn and not paid over by him to the plaintiff or its agent. It was not therefore necessary for the Court to instruct the jury that the defendants should be protected in their verdict for the proceeds of the collaterals sold. Looking at the evidence we can discover no proof which would have justified the jury in finding that McGinn acted in the matter of the margins and of their receipt by him from the defendants, as the agent of the plaintiff. In view, therefore, of this state of the case and of what has been said of the law governing it in its other aspects, the instruction asked by the plaintiff was correct, and its prayer, in our opinion, should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and procedendo awarded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
