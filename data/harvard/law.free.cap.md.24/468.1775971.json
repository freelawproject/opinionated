My business in 1855 was coach-making, and I was engaged in that business seven or eight years previous to 1855. My brother, in the year 1855, was engaged in peddling with a horse and wagon, and had been so engaged for five or six years ; he failed in business in the year 1855 ; before he failed I had a conver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>sation -with him in reference to his postponing the payment of his debts. In talking over matters he told me he had made np his mind to fail. In the course of his conversation he said he was going to put off the payment of his notes by renewals, or getting extensions for the purpose of getting in debt as deep as he could ; he said he was going to fail, and that he intended not to fail empty-handed\u2014 those were about the words he used. This conversation was some four or five months before he failed ; he failed in the summer of 1855. I had been in the habit of borrowing money from him before he failed; he was in the habit of loaning money to me about the time he told me he was going to get his paper renewed. When he failed I was indebted to him in about $500 or $1,000 ; he did not call in the loans he made me at the time he failed ; he continued to loan me immediately after he failed ; from the time of his failure up to the year 1858, my indebtedness to him increased up to $5,000. \u201cComplainants\u2019 Exhibit. E E,\u201d filed under the commission-in-chief on 17th December, 1860, being shown to witness, he further proved as follows: The property therein described is the property that he and his brother, George Jackson, leased from Henry Hursh and wife. Almost immediately after we leased said property we began to improve it, and had the improvements completed in about six months thereafter at a cost of about $5,500 ; George advanced the greater part of the money for the improvements. \u201cComplainants\u2019 Exhibit G,\u201d filed under the commission-in-chief on 17th December, I860, now shown to witness, is the assignment of said property from witness to his brother George. At the time of the said assignment we adjusted our accounts, and I was found indebted to George, after having made the assignment, in the sum of $2,378 or $2,379 and some cents. George went into my employ about the 1st January, 1857, at a salary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>of $500 ; he was my general superintendent; he remained in my employ from January, 1851, until the fall of 1858, during which time he was absent about three months. I know a lot of ground on Lee street which my brother George told me he paid $2,000 for. I have seen the house on Aisquith street; he leased the said lot from Jas. Mullin, and George himself improved it; he told me it cost $1,400 to improve it. I have seen the property he owned on Bur\u00e9n street; he said it cost him from $1,000 to $1,100. Some time after George\u2019s failure, he stated in a conversation that he had with me, that if he was successful in winding up his business he expected to be worth from $16,000 to $18,000. I remember that in a conversation with George, soon after his failure, George told me that he could have paid all his debts and have something left. I remember when George was compromising with his creditors- \u2014 I endorsed his compromise notes. I do not know the amount I endorsed ; I did not, about that time, refuse to endorse any notes that he wanted me to endorse. I never refused to endorse any of the compromise notes on the ground that I wanted the old notes held by the creditors first to be returned ; I endorsed all the compromise notes when and as he wanted me to endorse them. About the time of the compromise George never asked me to advance any money for the payment of any of his creditors ; I had no communication with any of George\u2019s creditors in reference to the compromise; I did not tell George that I would pay his creditors fifty cents on the dollar, deducting one per cent, a month for twelve months. From the time I had the settlement with George in February, ISS^, when we adjusted our accounts, he increased my indebtedness to him by loans and merchandise, so that in the summer of 1858 I was indebted to -him in the sum of $5,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>The cause having been heard, the Court (Krebs, J.) ore the 28th of November, 1861, passed a decree by which the deed, dated .the 6th of November, 1858, from Geo.

This allegation is the sole foundation of the bill. All other allegations in the bill, and all the evidence in the case, need only be considered as they bear upon this one single inquiry. If the appellees fail to make -out affirmatively the above proposition, their bill will have to be dismissed. The bill itself alleges that the complainants released their indebtedness in 1855 ; if, therefore, there was no fraud on the .part of George Jackson, that indebtedness is entirely extinguished; and no matter how prosperous Jackson became afterwards, the .bill must be dismissed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-9\">The bill charges that this release and settlement was procured by fraud.

And 2d. That he so concealed and hid away his assets from his creditors, that they could not ascertain their real condition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-5\">Two things must therefore he shown: 1st. Sufficient assets, and knowledge on the part of Jackson of such sufficiency. 2nd. Concealment of the means of such knowledge from the creditors, and false and fraudulent representation of the condition of said assets.'</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-7\">The appellees say, that Jackson is shown to have had money and to have bought property soon after th o settlement ; and that therefore he must have had assets sufficient to pay his debts when he made the settlement. There is no doubt that be did purchase property subsequent to his settlement, and loaned money to bis brother James. But in order that this acquisition of property should benefit the case of the complainants, it must be shown : That this possession of said property after the settlement of August, 1855, was absolutely inconsistent with any representations which be is proved to have made to bis creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-8\">We respectfully submit that in the absence of all direct proof to show that Jackson had more stock in bis store, or more debts due him, or more money in band than was embraced in bis written or oral statements made to bis creditors, no Court will infer a fraudulent and false representation of his assets, from the possession by him of the amount of property shown to have been in bis possession subsequent to the settlement. <em>Sto.

The fraud is alleged to consist in his falsely representing himself as unable to pay more than fifty per centum of his debts, when in fact he had property enough to pay them in full; and in his concealing from his creditors the real amount and value of his property, and thereby inducing them to accept the composition proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">As fraud is never presumed, but must be established by proof, it is our duty to examine the evidence contained in the record, and to determine whether in our opinion, it is sufficient to prove the fraud and deception charged in the bill of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">It appears from the evidence, that in order to induce his creditors to accept the terms offered, George Jackson exhibited to them a statement of the amount of his debts, and the estimated amount or value of his property, consist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>ing of his stock of goods on hand, and the debts due him considered as good. These statements are not produced, nor is there any very distinct evidence of the several amounts or estimates .contained in the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">It plainly appears from the testimony of <em>Allen T. Lewis, </em>one of the creditors, who was examined as a witness both for the complainants and the defendants, that the statement exhibited by George Jackson did not contain an invoice of his stock of goods, or specify in detail either the items of his property or a list of the sperate debts due him, but merely the aggregate amount of his liabilities, and two items showing the aggregate amount of his property and sperate debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">There is no dispute about the amount of his liabilities ; by an agreement signed by the <em>solicitors, they are </em>admitted to have been in the aggregate $18,546 -16.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The witness, <em>Allen T. Lewis, </em>states that he made the calculation from the statement shown, and the result was that after paying fifty per cent, there, would be left to George Jackson a surplus or margin of $1,800 or $2,000, which he thought was \u201cno more than lie was entitled to have for selling the goods, making the collections, and for the risk he would run, and including also a little margin to enable him to go on and continue business.\u201d He also states that George Jackson represented that the statement \u201c embraced all his property except his household furniture, which he (witness) thought the creditors ought not to require of him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">This evidence is conclusive to show <em>that </em>the whole amount of his property as represented to his creditors, was from $11,000 to $11,278. This is ascertained by adding $1,800 to .$2,000 to the sum of $9,273, the sum proposed to be paid to the creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">What was the whole value or amount of his assets at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>that time is not proved by direct evidence. But he concedes in bis answer that the estimate be then put upon his stock of goods was $13,000, (and that they were actually sold for more.) James Jackson, his brother, owed him $500 to $1,000. What other debts were due him is not shown. He owned two improved lots, one on Bur\u00e9n street, and one on Aisquith street, both of which, however, were encumbered with mortgages, and their value, if any, beyond the amount of the incumbrances, does not clearly appear. But estimating only the stock of goods on hand, and the debt then due him from James Jackson, it is clear that these items together exceed by the sum of $2,500 or $3,000, the whole amount represented by him on his statement, shown to the creditors to he the whole value of his property. In addition to this, the proof shows that within six months after he effected the composition with his creditor\u2019s, he purchased a lot on Lee street for $2,000, and in little more than a year had advanced in cash for the improvement of the property on Howard street (leased by him and his brother James,) the additional sum of $5,500. And as no other explanation is afforded by the evidence, we are compelled to the conclusion that his property and effects at the time of the settlement greatly exceeded the amount represented by him to his creditors, and were sufficient to pay his debts in full. This is the irresistible conclusion from the evidence in the cause, independently of the positive testimony of James Jackson, of which we shall speak presently.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">There are some other facts conclusively established by the proof, that are inconsistent with honesty, truth and fair dealing on the part of George Jackson, in procuring the settlement with his creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">He represented that his disasters in business had been occasioned by the protracted illness, of his wife, and the consequent large expenses incurred by him. The proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>shows that her illness was of short duration ; and though he had the misfortune to lose her in-the spring of 1855, the evidence of Dr. Flemming, the family physician, shows that his medical bill did not exceed twenty dollars, and there is no evidence of any large losses or expenses incurred by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">'His correspondence with his creditors in New York and Philadelphia, Messrs. Johns <em>&amp; </em>Payne, Sharpless Brothers, Amer <em>&amp; </em>Co., and Hammil, Wevil <em>&amp; Go., </em>exhibited in the record, both in its tone and substance, shows a reckless disregard of truth and fair dealing on his part.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">While, dictating to them his own terms in a most arbitrary way, he represents to them that his brother James, whom he offers as endorser on his notes, insists upon having the old notes surrendered before he is willing to\" become his surety, when in fact, according to James\u2019 testimony, he was not even consulted on the subject. He represents that his brother James is willing to discount the new notes at the rate of one per cent, a month, and in some .cases the new notes were actually shaved at that rate, not by his brother .James, but by himself; showing that he had at that time ready money on hand..</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">From these facts, combined with the evidence that within a brief period after his composition with his creditors, he was in possession of property of large value, amounting, according to his own statement made to Hayward, the Justice of the Peace, in 3859, to $15,000 or $20,000, as proved by the witness McCauley, in the absence of any satisfactory explanation of the way in which this property was acquired, are convincing proofs that the statement made to his creditors by George Jackson, upon which they relied,, and by which they were induced to enter into the composition with him, was grossly untrue and fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">If there were any doubts, however, on this subject, they would be removed by the positive evidence of -James Jack<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>son, who testifies to the fraudulent purposes of George Jackson, and the deception practiced by him upon his creditors in procuring the settlement of 1855.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"A3x\">(Decided April 18th, 1866.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">If' the case of the complainants rested exclusively upon the testimony of this witness, unsupported by other proof, we should hesitate in affirming the decree of the Circuit Court. But that testimony is corroborated by other proof, and in those particulars in which it is not positively supported it seems to us to be consistent with the other evidence, and is therefore not to be absolutely rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The result of a most careful examination of the whole case, has convinced us that the fraud charged in the bill has been established by the proof, and therefore that there is no error in the conclusion reached by the Circuit Court upon the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">We are of opinion that the exceptions to the bill, on the ground of multifariousness, are not well taken, even if they had been made in time. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">We are also of opinion that the defence, under the statute of limitations, is not supported. In such case, according to all the authorities, the statute does not begin to run until the fraud has been discovered, or becomes known to the complainants, whiefcothe proof in this case shows was not until a few months before the filing of the bill. A decree will be signed affirming the decree of the Circuit Court, with costs, and remanding the cause for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">\n<em>Decree affirmed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
