C. W. Smith, for $2,000,\u2014 provided there should be any balance in their hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-8\">The garnishees continued the sale of the said goods after -the attachment, until June, 1862, when the last parcel was \u2022disposed of, \u2014 the case having, in the meantime, been continued from term to term. The entire proceeds of the said \u2022sales were not more than sufficient for the reimbursement of the advances made by the appellees, and the discharge \u2022of the said order in favor of Smith, and there consequently remained no balance in their hands, applicable to the attachment of the appellant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-9\">With a view to ascertain the state of the account between the garnishees and the defendants, the plaintiff filed interrogatories which the garnishees duly answered.

The liability of the appellees, as garnishees, to the appellant, in respect of the goods consigned to them by the defendants, must mainly depend upon their responsibility to the defendants on account of those goods. <em>Balto. &amp; Ohio R. R. Co. Garn. of Cent. O. R. R., vs. Wheeler, </em>18 <em>Md. Rep., </em>379. It will hereafter be shown in what cases it is less than that which the defendants might enforce against them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-11\">2nd. That at the time of the consignment of the goods to the appellees, and their advances thereon, there were no limits imposed, or instructions given, by the defendants, either as to the time or mode of sale. The appellees acquired, therefore, the ordinary rights of factors to sell, in the exercise of a sound discretion, at such time and in such mode, as the usage of trade, and their general duty required. <em>Brown and others vs. McGran, </em>14 <em>Peters, </em>479\u2014495, 496.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>3rd. That contemporaneously with the said consignment and advances, there was no contract or agreement, express or implied, in relation to the time or mode of selling the said goods. Neither the defendants, nor the appellant, could, therefore, <em>by any subsequent orders or instructions, </em>suspend, modify, or control the right of sale thus acquired hy the appellees,' \u2014 such orders or instructions, if any, not having been accompanied with any offer to reimburse the appellees for their advances. See cases cited under third point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-5\">4th. That there is no evidence to show that any limits were, <em>at any time, </em>imposed by parties authorized to do so ; and that if any limits were so imposed, they were removed by the action of the assignee of J. Ripka <em>&amp; Co.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-6\">5th. That the interview between Messrs. Garter and Dobbin, and the subsequent receipt and delivery to them of the plaintiff\u2019s letter, did not create a contract or agreement, by which the appellees relinquished, or surrendered the <em>previous </em>legal right, thus so clearly acquired by them, of selling the said goods for the purpose of realizing their advances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-7\">A. Because no proposition to that effect was made, either in the said letter of the plaintiff, or by Mr. Dobbin, in the course of his interview with Mr. Garter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-8\">.B. If there was, the appellees never assented to it, either expressly, or by implication, directly or through the medium of Mr. Garter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-9\">G. If Mr. Garter assented, expressly or impdiedly, he had no authority, as an Attorney at Law to do so ; nor did he possess any authority, derived by virtue of any special delegation from the appellees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-10\">D. Because, if the element of assent were not wanting, the agreement on the part of the appellees, having neither been founded on any valid consideration, nor made under seal, can only be regarded as a <em>nudum pactum.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>6th. Factors and other bailees for hire are generally held only for a reasonable exercise of skill, and for ordinary care and diligence in their vocation. It having been admitted at the trial in the Court below, that in the sale of said goods, the appellees acted in good faith, and obtained the best market prices for them, the manner and character of the sales cannot he called in question. <em>Story on Bailments, secs. </em>455, 456.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-5\">7th. But in any event, there having been no credit or balance in the hands of the appellees, after the reimbursement of their advances, and the discharge of the order in favor of D. C. W. Smith, nothing can be recovered by the appellant, under the pleadings in this case. If a limit had been imposed, or instructions given, contemporaneously with the said consignment and advances, as to the time or mode of sale, and that limit, or those instructions had been violated ; or if there had been any other breach of duty in making <em>the </em>sales, the appellees would have been liable to an action for the damages sustained by the defendants, J. Ripka <em>&amp; Co., </em>or by the appellant, if his legal rights had been violated. But a claim restingin damages, and depending upon a possibility merely, is not attachable. The reason is, that it can only be recovered by an action <em>ex delieto, </em>and not by an action <em>ex contractu. </em>It can in no sense be regarded as a credit. 1 <em>Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>351. <em>Sergeant on Attachment, </em>76, 77. <em>Drake on Attachment, </em>\u00a7 527, \u00a7 525, \u00a7 526, and \u00a7 529.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-6\">8th. Admitting that we are wrong on other points, the measure of damages as laid down in the plaintiff\u2019s prayer, is not law. 3 <em>Parsons on Cont., </em>190, <em>(notes.) Frothingham vs. Everton, </em>12 <em>N. H., </em>239.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b149-7\">Cochran, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AM\">delivered the opinion of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">We understand it to be finally settled, that a factor, who receives goods on consignment, without any limit as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>time, mode, or rate of sale, and makes advances or incurs liabilities on account of the goods consigned, thereby acquires a special property in them, and a right to sell, according to the usual course of his duty, so much thereof as may he necessary to reimburse such advances or meet such liabilities ; and further, that the consignor has no right, by any order given after the advances have been made or liabilities incurred, to control this right of sale, except so far as relates to the surplus of the goods not necessary for the reimbursement of such advances or liabilities, unless he stands ready, and offers to reimburse the advances or liabilities. <em>Brown vs. McGran. </em>14 <em>Peters, </em>479.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The consignments in this case were general ; the appellees having received, and made their advances on them, without any instructions from the consignors in regard to the selling prices, time, or mode of sale. The letter of the 10th of December 1861, fixing limits below which the goods were not to be sold, was written long after the appellees received the consignments and made the advances, and there 'is nothing in the record to show that the consignors offered or tendered themselves ready to reimburse the advances, either at the time or after this letter was written ; nor do the appellees appear to have assented to, or agreed with them, to comply with the instructions it contained. Under these circumstances, the limit put on the goods by the consignors was not of a character to affect in any degree the then existing right of the appellees to sell according to the usual course in such cases ; and, in that particular it is admitted that they acted in good faith, and obtained the best market price for the goods sold. We find nothing in the communications from the appellees to the appellant, nor in his reply to them to relieve the case from the operation of the rule stated. That of the former was a simple request for the views or wishes of the latter in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>regard to the unsold goods, and Ms reply, contained in the letter to Mr. Dobbin, instead of requiring them to regard the limits prescribed in the December letter from Ripka <em>&amp; </em>Co., clearly authorized such a variance or disregard of them as would enable the appellees to sell the goods. The clear inference from all the correspondence offered in evidence, is that the appellees were to sell the goods in the exercise of a sound discretion, and as there is no pretence that they did not make the best possible disposition of them, we think there was no error in rejecting the appellant\u2019s prayer, nor in granting the first and second of the appellees.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AT6\">(Decided March 2nd, 1866.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
