Mr. Irving M. Tullar, Washington, D.

Appellee, a resident of the Western District of the State of Washington, was not served with process in the District of Columbia. He appeared specially and moved to dismiss appellant\u2019s complaint for lack of jurisdiction. The District Court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">The patent law provides: \u201cAny party to an interference dissatisfied with the decision of the board of patent interferences * * * may have remedy by civil action \u2022\" * 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 146. The law concerning \u201cDistrict Courts; Jurisdiction\u201d provides: \u201cThe district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents, copyrights and trade-marks.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(a). The District Court therefore had jurisdiction of the subject matter of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-13\">A separate paragraph of \u00a7 146 permits suit to be brought in the District of Columbia under certain special circumstances. But those circumstances are not present here and that paragraph is therefore irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-14\">The law concerning \u201cDistrict Courts; Venue\u201d provides: \u201cA civil action wherein jurisdiction is not founded solely on diversity of citizenship may be brought only in the judicial district where all defendants reside, except as otherwise provided by law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(b). But it also provides, under a heading \u201cCure or waiver of defects\u201d, that \u201cThe district court of a district in which is filed a case laying venue in the <em>wrong </em>division or district shall dismiss, or if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a). Since this case is one \u201claying venue in the wrong division or district\u201d, the \u201ccure or waiver\u201d clause allows the District Court an option. If it be in the interest of justice the court, instead of dismissing the case, may transfer it to the district \u201cin which it could have been brought\u201d. The court had jurisdiction of the subject matter, and the defect of venue could be cured by transfer. The court\u2019s lack of jurisdiction over the person of the defendant is immaterial. Schiller v. Mit-Clip Co., Inc., 2 Cir., 180 F.2d 654; Internatio-Rotterdam, Inc. v. Thomsen, 4 Cir., 218 F.2d 514; Orion Shipping &amp; Trading Co. v. United States, 9 Cir., 247 F.2d 755; United States v. Welch, D.C., 151 F.Supp. 899 ; Petroleum Financial Corp. v. Stone, D.C., 116 F.Supp. 426. It follows that in our opinion the court erred in granting appellee\u2019s motions \u201cto dismiss for want of jurisdiction, to quash the return of service of summons, and to dismiss the action for want of jurisdiction of the person of the Defendant * * The order is reversed and the case remanded to enable the District Court to consider whether it is in the interest of justice to transfer the case to the Western District of Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-15\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
