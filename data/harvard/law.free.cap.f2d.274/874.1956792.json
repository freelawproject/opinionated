The District Judge denied the motion and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">Defendant argues that Counts 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 are void because they contain repugnant allegations, in that if, as stated in those counts, the writing was falsely forged and counterfeited, then the signature of the payee could not be forged thereon; that the indictment does not allege a forged endorsement to a genuine writing of the the United States. Defendant applies the same reasoning to Counts 2, 4, and 6, as they incorporate the alleged repugnant allegations by reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">Apart from disputing the allegations of repugnancy, the government also contends that defendant has failed to preserve the question of sufficiency of the indictment for review in this Court. It was raised for the first time after the District Court had lost jurisdiction to entertain the motions sought to be made to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">It is defendant\u2019s position that all counts are fatally defective and void, and that hence the defect may be raised at any time. To this we cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">The record before us clearly shows that defendant was at no time misled or prejudiced in any way by reason of the alleged repugnancy. We are left with no doubt that he fully understood the charge brought against him, on which he stood trial, and of which he was found guilty. The record indicates that he understood he was charged with forging endorsements to genuine United States Treasury checks, which, when so forged, became falsely forged and counterfeited certificates of the United States, and with knowingly uttering the same. If a defect can be said to exist in the indictment here, (and we do not believe such defect does exist) then it cannot be held to be a fatal defect at this stage of the proceedings. Prussian v. United States, 1931, 282 U.S. 675, 680-681, 51 S.Ct. 223, 75 L.Ed. 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">Defendant failed to preserve the alleged insufficiency of the indictment for review and may not now raise the issue in this Court. United States v. Ansani, 7 Cir., 1957, 240 F.2d 216, 223, certiorari denied sub. nom. Milner v. United States, 353 U.S. 936, 77 S.Ct. 813, 1 L.Ed.2d 759. The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
