Miller, the carpentry subcontractor for the construction of two apartment buildings, had assigned a foreman, Adams, and three or four carpenters to the project. All, including Miller, were members of the Carpenters District Council of Milwaukee County and Vicinity of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, APL-CIO (hereafter District Council). The District Council rules provided that \u201cMembers shall not install or erect trim, miilwork or fixtures that do not bear the label or stamp of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters &amp; Joiners of America.\u201d Each member was charged with the duty of preferring written charges against fellow members who violated the rules. The rules were enforceable by fine or expulsion.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">Kitchen cabinets manufactured by the Del-Mar Cabinet Company had been delivered to the apartment project for installation by Miller\u2019s crew. Those cabinets bore the label of a union not recognized by the United Brotherhood. When petitioner Kamoske, a business representative of the District Council, learned of this during a routine visit to the project, he told Adams not to install the cabinets because they did not bear the United Brotherhood label. Adams passed this information on to the carpenters in his crew because he \u201cthought they should know.\u201d There was no testimony from Kamoske or Adams or from any other source tending to show whether in fact Kamoske\u2019s statement that the cabinets should not be installed was meant by Kamoske, and treated by Adams, as a directive to be conveyed to union members, or as a call for employer cooperation.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-15\">The Board held (in a 2-1 decision) that Kamoske\u2019s action constituted a violation of \u00a7 8(b) (4) (A). This provision \u201cforbids a union to induce <em>employees </em>to strike against or to refuse to handle goods for their employer when an object is to force him or another person to cease doing business with some third party.\u201d Local 1976, United Brotherhood of Carpenters, etc. v. National Labor Relations Board, 1958, 357 U.S. 93, 98, 78 S.Ct. 1011, 1015, 2 L.Ed.2d 1186 (emphasis supplied). However, \u201ca union is free to approach an <em>employer </em>to persuade him to engage in a boycott, so long as it refrains from the specifically prohibited means of coercion through inducement of employees.\u201d Id., 357 U.S. at page 99, 78 S.Ct. at page 1016 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-16\">It is undisputed that Adams, as a \u201csupervisor,\u201d was not an \u201cemployee\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2(3) of the Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, a necessary predicate for its conclusion that Kamoske and the District Council had violated the Act was the Board\u2019s finding that Adams had merely acted as a \u201cmedium of transmission\u201d to Miller\u2019s employees of Kamoske\u2019s order not to install the Del-Mar cabinets. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Kamoske and the District Council were held responsible for Adams\u2019 transmission of Kamoske\u2019s order as the \u201cnatural and foreseeable consequence\u201d of Kamoske\u2019s action (cf. Radio Officers\u2019 Union, etc., A. F. L. v. National Labor Relations Board, 1954, 347 U.S. 17, 45, 74 S.Ct. 323, 98 L.Ed. 455). In reaching this conclusion, the Board relied not upon the nature of Kamoske\u2019s language itself, which was apparently viewed as equivocal, nor upon any actual understanding between Kamoske and Adams, but rather upon the presumed effect of Adams\u2019 obligations as a union member.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">In the absence of evidence, as noted above, tending to show that Adams and Kamoske regarded Kamoske\u2019s words as a directive to be conveyed to union-member employees, we are constrained to hold that the statement must be viewed as an attempt to enlist the aid of Miller, the employer, through Adams, as his representative. This view rests upon our analysis of the congressional purpose in enacting \u00a7 2(3) (and its companion provision, \u00a7 14(a) <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ) in 1947. Congress was aware of the potential conflict between the obligations of foremen as representatives of their employers, on the one hand, and as union members, on the other. Section 2(3) evidences its intent to make the obligations to the employer paramount. That provision excepts foremen from the protection of the Act. Its purpose was to give the employer a free hand to discharge foremen as a means of ensuring their undivided loyalty, in spite of any union obligations. See H. Rep.No.245, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 14-17 (1947); S.Rep.No.105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 3-5 (1947); L. A. Young Spring &amp; Wire Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 1947, 82 U.S.App.D.C. 327, 163 F.2d 905, certiorari denied 1948, 333 U.S. 837, 68 S.Ct. 607, 92 L.Ed. 1121.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, we should assume that this employer prerogative has had the effect which Congress contemplated. Therefore, we are unable to uphold the Board\u2019s conclusion that the \u201cnatural and foreseeable consequence\u201d of Kamoske\u2019s statement to Adams was that Adams, because of his union obligations, would ignore his role as a representative of Miller and become merely a \u201cmedium of transmission\u201d of Kamoske\u2019s order to Miller\u2019s employees. But see National Labor Relations Board v. Local 1976, United Brotherhood of Carpenters, etc., 9 Cir., 1957, 241 F.2d 147,156, affirmed on other grounds 1958, 357 U.S. 93, 96, note 1, 78 S.Ct. 1011, 2 L.Ed.2d 1186.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">We think, however, that if evidence necessary to sustain the Board\u2019s conclusion is available, the Board should have the opportunity to present it in further supplementary proceedings. We therefore set aside the Board\u2019s order and remand the case for further supplementary proceedings or dismissal of the complaint as the Board shall determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">In light of this disposition, the Board\u2019s request for enforcement of its order is dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">So ordered.</p>\n<author id=\"b658-10\">PRETTYMAN, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">I dissent. The pivotal question is whether, when Kamoske spoke to Adams, twice in the presence of Awve, he was addressing Adams as a policy-making participant in management or as a union member bound by union requirements. That was a question of fact. The Board decided it. There was ample evidence to support the finding, in my view. One of the only three carpenters on the job (Awve) was present during both conversations. Adams repeatedly testified that Kamoske told \u201cus\u201d. Kamoske spoke peremptorily\u2014 \u201cHe told us not to hang the cabinets\u201d. The language was certainly not that of a petition for a change in management policy. The union\u2019s requirement of its members was unequivocal. I would affirm the Board\u2019s findings as supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b657-10\">. 121 N.L.R.B.

But Awve\u2019s presence gives no support to the Board\u2019s order. The Board did not even find that Awve heard what Kamoske said. In any event, the Board did not base its decision on that circumstance. See Securities and Exchange Comm. v. Chenery Corp., 1943, 318 U.S. 80, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b658-12\">.
