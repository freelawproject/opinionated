The court-martial imposed a sentence of forty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-15\">The Board of Review in the Judge Advocate General\u2019s office reduced the sentence to thirty years, and as modified affirmed the findings of the convening authority. After the Military Court of Appeals denied review of the Board\u2019s decision, United States v. Burns, 6 U.S.C. M.A. 834, the sentence as modified was ordered into execution. After temporary confinement in the United States disciplinary barracks in California, the petitioner was transferred for confinement in the United States penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas, whence he sued out this writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-16\">Petitioner\u2019s contentions are: (1) that the court-martial lacked jurisdiction of the person or the offenses; and (2) that the court committed prejudicial error by allowing his wife to testify against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-17\">It seems unnecessary to restate that the scope of our inquiry in habeas corpus cases of this kind is limited to whether the court-martial had jurisdiction of the person and the offense; and whether in the exercise of that jurisdiction the accused was accorded due process of law as contemplated and vouchsafed by the Uniform Code of Military Justice. And, in the determination of the latter question, we will inquire only whether the competent military tribunal gave full and fair consideration to all the procedural safeguards deemed essential to a fair trial under military law. Bennett v. Davis, 10 Cir., 267 F.2d 15. See also McKinney v. Warden, 10 Cir., 273 F.2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-18\">The petitioner does not contend that the court was improperly constituted. He does seem to contend, however, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>court lacked jurisdiction of the offenses charged, and particularly the charge of rape, relying upon Lee v. Madigan, 358 U.S. 228, 79 S.Ct. 276, 3 L.Ed.2d 260. But that case involved charges brought under Article of War 92, which, prior to the adoption of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (64 Stat. 108, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq., enacted May 5, 1950) governed trials for murder or rape before courts-martial. Article 92 contained a proviso that \u201cno person shall be tried by courts-martial for murder or rape committed within the geographical limits of the States of the Union and the District of Columbia in time of peace.\u201d But the comparable Section 120 of the Uniform Code contains no such proviso. And, Article 2 of the Uniform Code, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 802, provides that all persons who are \u201cmembers of a regular component of the armed forces * * * \u201d are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice; and, Article 5, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 805, provides that the Code \u201capplies in all places.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Admittedly, the petitioner was a member of the armed forces at the time of the commission of the alleged offenses, and the Uniform Code, not Article 92, was in force and effect. The power of Congress to dispense with civil trials in cases of this kind cannot be denied. Whelchel v. McDonald, 340 U.S. 122, 71 S.Ct. 146, 95 L.Ed. 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Relying on Hawkins v. United States, 358 U.S. 74, 79 S.Ct. 136, 3 L.Ed. 2d 125, the trial court was of the opinion that it was error to permit the petitioner\u2019s wife to testify against him over his objection. But the court did not think the error was so \u201cglaring and persistent\u201d as to constitute a denial of due process and thus deprive the court-martial of jurisdiction of the offense. Both the court-martial and the Military Court of Appeals undoubtedly gave full and fair consideration to the question of the admissibility of the testimony. The case was tried and decided in the military tribunals before Hawkins, and it may well be that in the light of that case, the tribunals would now hold the wife\u2019s testimony reversibly inadmissible. But even so, we cannot say that the admission of the testimony before Hawkins was so palpably erroneous and prejudicial as to destroy the jurisdiction of the military tribunals. Cf. Whelchel v. McDonald, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
