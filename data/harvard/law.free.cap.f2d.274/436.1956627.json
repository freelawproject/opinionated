United States Senior District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, designated to participate <em>in place of Judge O\u2019Connell, </em>pursuant to provisions of section 294(d), Title 28 United States Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b528-26\">RICH, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b528-27\">This appeal is from the decision of the Commissioner of Patents sustain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>ing the examiner\u2019s final refusal to register the trademark \u201cCultured Bemberg.\u201d The application drawing depicts those two words in white arranged one above the other on a black oval background. Nothing else appears on the drawing or the specimen accompanying the application. The goods enumerated in the application are \u201cwoven, knitted, netted, textile, and pile fabrics in the piece, comprised of rayon, or in substantial part of rayon combined with cotton, wool, silk, nylon, and other synthetic fibers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The sole ground of rejection is predicated on section 2(d) of the Trade-Mark Act of 1946 (the Lanham Act) 15 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1052(d), which requires the Patent Office to refuse registration to any trademark which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">\u201c(d) consists of or comprises a mark which so resembles a mark registered in the Patent Office * *, as to be likely, when applied to the goods of the applicant, to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Appellant\u2019s application, serial No. 689,801, filed June 20, 1955, claims May 16, 1955, as the date of first use. The Patent Office has rejected the application because of the prior registration, on the Principal Register, of \u201cCultured Cotton\u201d for \u201ccotton textile fabrics in the piece,\u201d registration No. 604,522 of April 12, 1955. Both the examiner and the Commissioner were of the opinion that registration was proscribed by section 2(d), the opinion of the Commissioner, acting through Assistant Commissioner Leeds, concluding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-8\">\u201c \u2018Cultured,\u2019 when applied to fabrics, represents an arbitrary use of an ordinary word. Applicant\u2019s use of the word will, I believe, inevitably cause purchasers to assume that the fabrics marked \u2018Cultured Bemberg\u2019 and \u2018Cultured Cotton\u2019 emanate from a single source * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Considering the diverse reactions of purchasers to the psychological impact of trademarks, it is perhaps going too far to say that they will inevitably react in any particular way; but we do agree with the conclusion to the extent that it is \u201clikely\u201d that purchasers will be confused or mistaken or deceived as to the source of the goods. No more than that is required to sustain the refusal to register. If the intention was to say that some confusion would be inevitable, we fully agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">Appellant has attacked the conclusion in various ways and on various grounds, none of which has convinced us that it is wrong. We shall comment briefly on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">First, appellant urges us to regard \u201cCultured\u201d as descriptive (or at least highly suggestive) and to regard \u201cBemberg\u201d as the dominant feature of its mark, emphasizing that the latter has been promoted with six million dollars worth of advertising since 1930 and that what it is really trying to do here is to obtain an additional registration of its \u201cBemberg\u201d mark, admittedly already registered ten times for piece goods, \u201cin the form as actually used upon its goods in commerce.\u201d Answering this we would point out that it has not been shown in what way \u201cCultured\u201d is descriptive of piece goods, that some of the best trademarks are those which are highly suggestive and that what is here sought to be registered is not \u201cBemberg\u201d but \u201cCultured Bemberg\u201d and it is registrability of the latter which is at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-13\">Appellant, with its brief on appeal to the Commissioner, offered to file a disclaimer (not entered and still, therefore, <em>merely </em>an offer) of the word \u201cCultured,\u201d apart from the mark as shown. Appellant admits in its brief that \u201cfor the purpose of this proceeding, it is immaterial whether or not the word \u2018Cultured\u2019 is disclaimed apart from its applied-for mark by applicant, or whether such term is considered descriptive.\u201d Although appellant also urges in its brief that the disclaimer should be entered, it seems itself to have disposed of any argument that might be based on disclaimer by admitting its immateriality. In any case, disclaimer of any exclusive right to one of the words of a two word trade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>mark, \u201capart from the mark as shown,\u201d does not affect the fact that it is the two words together that constitute the trademark sought to be registered. This mark must be considered as a whole on the issue of likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Another line of argument is based on the specimen label which was filed with the application to register \u201cCultured Cotton,\u201d which label bears another trademark, \u201cRuby Set.\u201d Appellant argues that the prior registrant\u2019s goods would be identified by the latter mark and that \u201cCultured Cotton\u201d is a \u201csecondary mark and is not a primary origin indicator.\u201d This argument is coupled with the contention that appellant\u2019s \u201cdominant trademark\u201d is \u201cBemberg\u201d and it is then stated \u201cthat there is no similarity between the dominant trademarks employed by the respective parties, namely \u2018Bemberg\u2019 and \u2018Ruby Set\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">We decline to be led away from the only issue before us which is the registrability of \u201cCultured Bemberg\u201d in view of the prior registration of \u201cCultured Cotton.\u201d We are in no way here concerned either with the trademark \u201cRuby Set\u201d or with the specimen label on which it appears. It is not the label that was registered. The language of the statute is specific. We are concerned only with a prior registration which was granted for the trademark \u201cCultured Cotton\u201d and the proposed registration of \u201cCultured Bemberg\u201d and nothing else. This court has rejected similar arguments several times in the past. See Burton-Dixie Corp. v. Restonic Corp., 234 F.2d 668, 43 CCPA 950, and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Another argument is that appellant is here seeking only to have its application for registration passed for publication for opposition purposes and that this court should reverse so that this may be done, leaving it to the future to see whether the owner of the \u201cCultured Cotton\u201d registration will file an opposition. We are told that in such an opposition the registrant could show a number of facts as to how it is actually using its mark so that the Patent Office would not have to base its decision \u201con pure hypothesis.\u201d Part of the answer to this is supplied by appellant\u2019s own admission that \u201cthe Patent Office has the duty to refuse to register a mark which so resembles a mark previously registered in the Patent Office, or a mark previously used in the United States, as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers.\u201d So far as the office is concerned, passing a mark for publication is tantamount to granting the registration. The rest of the answer is that if the prior registrant did oppose, it would be entitled to stand on its registration if it wished, thus presenting the Patent Office with the identical issue it has already decided and, furthermore, if by \u201cpure hypothesis\u201d appellant means a subjective opinion as to a state of affairs not established by proof, the duty of forming such opinions is, unhappily, imposed on the Patent Office and this court by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Appellant attempts to draw a parallel between the present case and this court\u2019s opinion in Hart Schaffner &amp; Marx v. Empire Manufacturing Co., 197 F.2d 558, 39 CCPA 1042, while conceding that \u201cprior decisions are of little value and each case must be decided on its own set of facts, North Star Mfg. Co. v. Wells Lamont Corp., 193 F.2d 204, 39 CCPA 764.\u201d Though some superficial similarities can be noted, they appear to be exceeded by significant differences. Notably, appellant has glossed over the fact that in that contested opposition the applicant\u2019s mark \u201cDixie Leader,\u201d was for overalls and similar work clothes while the well-known opposer, Hart Schaffner &amp; Marx, based its opposition on the trademark \u201cDixie Weave\u201d for men\u2019s suits of a porous weave for hot weather wear. The court obviously felt the differences in the merchandise were most significant on the issue of likelihood of confusion as to origin. The merchandise of both the applicant and prior registrant here is piece goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">Finally, appellant claims that \u201cthe goods of the parties here are normally purchased with considerable care.\u201d (Of course, there is only one party, the appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>cant.) Among the purchasers appellant includes all \u201chousewives normally skilled in the sewing arts.\u201d We would expect, as the Patent Oflice Solicitor has pointed out, that this class of purchasers would be an extensive group including all shades of literacy, intelligence and education, not exactly a class of \u201cdiscriminating purchasers\u201d in the usual trademark sense of that term. Surely, while this group as a whole will appreciate that cotton and Bemberg \u2014 and also rayon, nylon and silk' \u2014 are different <em>fabrics, </em>it is likely, in our opinion, that many, if not most, of the group would not know that \u201cBemberg\u201d is a trademark and that rayon and nylon are not trademarks. They are as likely to think that \u201cBemberg\u201d is a kind of cloth, as indeed it appears to be, as a species of rayon or artificial silk;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> so thinking, they are likely to believe that cotton piece goods and artificial silk piece goods both marketed under the name \u201cCultured\u201d emanate from a common source.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">In saying that \u201cBemberg\u201d is a kind of cloth we do not intend to detract from its value, importance or legal significance as a trademark. More accurately we should probably say it is a family of cloths and yarns, but yarns are not involved here. The point we wish to make is that many in the class of people who buy \u201cBemberg\u201d piece goods are not trademark sophisticates and in making a \u201cpure hypothesis\u201d about the likelihood of confusion or mistake as to origin we cannot assume them to be such. For this reason we have not been swayed by the $6,000,000 spent since 1930 in advertising \u201cBemberg\u201d products or by the ten prior registrations of that mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-5\">.

They differ in length and in spelling, with no letter of the alphabet in common. They differ in meaning and are used on different fabrics. How, then, can an ordinary word like \u201ccultured\u201d be endowed with such strength as to overcome the sharp differences between \u201cBemberg\u201d and \u201cCotton,\u201d and so dilute them as to create a likelihood of confusion where none could possibly have existed before? Although that question is vital to the issue here, there seems to be no unanimity as to exactly why such is the case. The examiner said the word was \u201cfanciful and arbitrary;\u201d the Assistant Commissioner said it was \u201can arbitrary use of an ordinary word;\u201d the applicant strongly contends that it is descriptive, or at least highly suggestive; yet the majority does not say expressly what it is, but holds that appellant has not proved its contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">I find nothing in the definition of the word \u201cculture\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or its proposed use by appellant to support the unusual veto power accorded it. It is not a coined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>word, but one belonging in the public domain; as such its use should not be denied those in the \u2022 trademark world without sounder reasons than those advanced here. Indeed, in view of the sharp contrast between \u201cBemberg\u201d and \u201cCotton\u201d it is not unreasonable to suppose that denial of appellant\u2019s application would vest in the prior registrant a virtual monopoly of the word \u201ccultured,\u201d at least in the textile field. In my opinion we are sorely underestimating the intelligence of the average purchaser in holding that concurrent use of the instant marks would be likely to result in confusion, especially since it is reasonable to assume that the average purchaser of the instant fabrics in the piece would be expected to exercise at least some degree of selectivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">I would reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">MARTIN, J., concurs in dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
