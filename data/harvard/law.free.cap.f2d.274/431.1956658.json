The District Court sustained a motion for summary judgment filed by the insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">The opinion of the District Court is reported in 1959, 175 F.Supp. 3, 7. It was there stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-14\">\u201cIf called upon to instruct the jury on the interpretation of what is meant by the words \u2018external means\u2019, it would be incumbent upon this Court to find, under the uncontradicted facts, that the insured did not die from injuries solely through \u2018external means\u2019 * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-15\">The immediate cause of death of the insured was determined to be suffocation, due to aspiration of vomitus. There was no \u201cmechanical lodging of food in the windpipe\u201d. The pathological diagnosis, contained in the report of autopsy, revealed \u201cacute aspiration of gastric contents to trachea, bronchi and bronchi-oles\u201d and the probable cause of death was stated as \u201cacute aspiration of gastric contents to trachea\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-16\">We affirm and adopt the opinion of the District Court, insofar as it is based upon its interpretation of \u201cexternal means\u201d and its determination that the death of the insured was not a direct result of bodily injury effected through external means, within the meaning of the double indemnity provisions of the insurance policies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AQA\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-10\">. The District Court referred to, and briefly discussed, the case of Landress v. Phoenix Mut. Life Ins. Co., 1934, 291 U.S. 491, 54 S.Ct. 461, 78 L.Ed. 934, which involved the construction and application of insurance policy provisions pertaining to death by accidental means. For a discussion. of the applicable law in the Commonwealth of Virginia as to insurance coverage in event of death by \u201caccidental means\u201d see the decision of this court on rehearing, speaking through Judge Soper, American Nat. Ins. Co. v. Belch, 4 Cir., 1938, 100 F.2d 48, 50, 51.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
