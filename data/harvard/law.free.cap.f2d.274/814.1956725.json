Giving full consideration to the factual work situation, including the appellee\u2019s \u201cIncentive Plan\u201d, he found that appellee had made a reasonable time allowance to the plaintiffs and was entitled to judgment in its favor on the first count of the complaint. On the second count the trial court held that a penalty statute was involved which did not give rise to a private cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-24\">From our own study of the case, we find the district court\u2019s conclusion on the Fair Labor Standards Act claim strongly supported by the facts, and sound in law as to the action under the state statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-25\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
