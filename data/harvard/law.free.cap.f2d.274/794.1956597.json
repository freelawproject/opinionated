BROWN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">The question here is whether there is a legal means of requiring the Deputy Commissioner to proceed to decision in a matter properly before him under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 901 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">It is of vast importance as parties related to maritime injuries to a non-seafaring amphibious worker attempt to answer the riddle which Jensen<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> conjured up.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">Self-help is unavailing for with the traditional prohibition in Workmen\u2019s Compensation Acts, both state and this federal one, against contractual waivers or releases there is no end to a potential claim until the last gong has rung in the last and highest tribunal which will listen. Guidance by experienced maritime counsel is uncertain. For his tools must be the jurisprudence which, to say the least, is more, not less, complex than it was in the pre-Davis<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> day, and all the more so since Hahn <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as the changes of this Court in Noah<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> shortly on the heels of Flowers,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> revealed. And while this Court has now firmly ruled that maritime injuries to- one engaged in the classic occupation of a longshoreman loading or unloading a vessel,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and one engaged in repair of an existing vessel<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal Act, not that of a state, the access of litigants to state tribunals makes ours an academic deliverance <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> until either the state courts concerned accept it as authoritative or their contrary decisions are upset by the possibility<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of certiorari from the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-18\">So it is here. After voluntary payment of substantial compensation under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act, the Employer now finds himself faced with a claim under the Louisiana Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, LSA-R.S. 23:1021 et seq., in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>the state court while the case file yet remains open \u2014 at least not closed \u2014 before the Deputy Commissioner. The Employer did not seek coercive injunctive relief against either the Claimant or the state court. Rather it sought (a) a declaration under 28 \u00a7\u00a7 2201, 2202, that the Longshoremen\u2019s Act was the Claimant\u2019s exclusive remedy and, alternatively, (b) a mandatory order directing the Deputy Commissioner to \u201cproceed with a hearing to determine * * * the * * * issues raised\u201d by the Employer\u2019s application before the Deputy Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">The District Court sustained the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss for \u201cfailure to state a claim on which relief can be granted and the lack of jurisdiction for this court to hear and determine the issues presented prior to administrative action taken by the Deputy Commissioner upon a claim first filed for that purpose.\u201d Consequently, we accept as true the facts set forth in the complaint.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Their summary we take, with but slight change of paraphrase, from the Employer\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Charles Cook, the Claimant, injured his right leg on February 18, 1957 while employed by Employer as a longshoreman. He was landing a pallet board on No. 3 deck aboard the S/S Haria Rosa docked in the Mississippi River at the Congress Street Wharf, New Orleans.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">The accident was reported to the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s office on February 22, 1957 and Employer continued to make reports to that office. Compensation payments of $18 a week were started immediately, but on May 16, 1957 Cook\u2019s attorney notified the Deputy Commissioner that Cook\u2019s claim was for $26.61 a week under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act and he submitted statements to support the claim. Acting on this information, the Deputy Commissioner found that the weekly compensation payments should be $26.60 and so informed Employer. Employer complied with the ruling and adjusted payments so that Cook received eleven weeks\u2019 compensation from May 8, 1957 through July 27, 1957, or $292.71. Payments terminated July 27, 1957 when Cook was given medical clearance and returned to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">Almost a year later Cook, through his attorney, wrote the Deputy Commissioner to make claim for further compensation for his February 18, 1957 injury. But before any action was taken on this request, he filed a suit for Louisiana Workmen\u2019s Compensation benefits, plus 12% penalties and attorneys\u2019 fees, in the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">The Employer thereafter formally requested the Deputy Commissioner to fix a hearing to determine: (i) if the Deputy Commissioner had jurisdiction of the claim; (ii) if Cook\u2019s claim under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act had prescribed; and (iii) if the Deputy Commissioner had jurisdiction, and the claim had not prescribed, whether Cook was entitled to further compensation benefits under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act, and the amount, if any, due under that Act. The Employer\u2019s request for a hearing was refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">In seeking to justify this dismissal, the Deputy Commissioner devotes nearly all of his energy to combating that part of the relief requested in the complaint summarized above as (a) a declaration by the Court under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2201, 2202, that the Longshoremen\u2019s Act was claimant\u2019s exclusive remedy. But this is no longer in the case. The Employer does not undertake now to have us review either the power of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>District Court to grant declaratory relief or the propriety of its exercise.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">All that is now involved is the power of the District Court to issue a mandatory decree compelling the Deputy Commissioner to proceed with the hearing\u2014 a hearing in which the Deputy Commissioner would arrive at his own decision, and which, under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 921, would then, and only then, be subject to judicial review. This is a command to hear and adjudicate. Not a command to tell him <em>how </em>it is to be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">The Deputy Commissioner\u2019s position is difficult to understand. By statute, see note 22, infra, he is charged with the responsibility of deciding all matters relating to compensation payable to persons sustaining specified maritime injuries. The Act by its terms prescribes that it shall be the exclusive remedy, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 905, with respect to \u201can injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States * * * if recovery for the disability * * * through workmen\u2019s compensation proceedings may not validly be provided by State law.\u201d 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 903(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Whatever may be the position of claimants who are so far free to try to get a state court to allow recovery under state compensation acts, the Deputy Commissioner is patently subject to the authoritative declarations of the Federal Courts, and certainly this one, as to a Deputy Commissioner who functions within the geographical confines of this Circuit. So bound, it must have been clear that on the facts asserted, this was an alleged injury sustained by a person while engaged in performance of his duties as a longshoreman in the handling of cargo on a vessel in the Mississippi River. As such, it was, if the evidence bore out the allegations, one exclusively under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act, as we had by that time so plainly held in Noah.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">The Deputy Commissioner does not really challenge this. Nor does he contend that the claim was not under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act. Rather, his position is that he is <em>required, </em>i. e., compelled, by the statute to hold a hearing only when a claim, as such, has been filed. Since compensation was here paid without the filing of a formal claim and none has ever yet been filed, he is not required to hold a hearing. As the Act does not require a hearing under this situation, the Court cannot compel him to do so. At most, the argument goes, a Court may compel only that which the statute orders. And that is lacking here.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-12\">It is at this point that the dispute narrows. For the Employer finds explicit direction to the Deputy Commissioner to hold hearings when requested by an interested party on all material questions arising in connection with liability for compensation payments or other benefits under the Act. This it finds in \u00a7\u00a7 914(h)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>919(c).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> But to them, the Deputy Commissioner insists that by their use of the word \u201cclaim\u201d each section has in mind the written, signed formal claim on the usual prescribed official form which was not filed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">A consideration of the whole Act and the automatic \u201calmost self-executing\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> nature of it is convincing that this is to read the Act and the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s responsibilities in much too technical a way. In contrast to many compensation acts which require a formal claim at the outset, what sets the whole thing in motion under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act is the accidental maritime injury. The employer must keep a record and make a report within ten days after it has knowledge of a maritime injury. Failure to do so subjects it to liability for $500 civil penalty and tolls the administrative one-year limitation period under \u00a7 913(a) until the notice is filed.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">The momentum, though, is more than mere paper reports. Knowledge of the maritime injury by the employer and the coincidence of resulting disability to the employee sets in train important substantive obligations <em>unless </em>the employer takes affirmative action to controvert liability. Thus, he must, without a preliminary coercive order, \u201cfurnish such medical, surgical, and other attendance or treatment, nurse and hospital service, medicine * * * for such period as the nature of the injury or the process of recovery may require.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Perhaps even more important the Act provides that \u201cexcept where liability to pay compensation is controverted by the employer,\u201d this knowledge of the maritime injury and the coincidence of resulting disability for the requisite time<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> automatically requires that \u201ccompensation * * * shall be paid periodically, promptly, and directly to the person entitled thereto, without an award.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Payment must be made within 14 days \u201cafter the employer has knowledge of the injury * * <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and a failure to begin payment or make subsequent installment payments within a like period of 14 days subjects the employer to a penalty of 10%.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-16\">While the payment of compensation and furnishing medical benefits may be, and generally is, on such a self-executing automatic basis without preliminary coercive legal orders, it does not mean that such actions are over and beyond the Act or that the Deputy Commissioner has no responsibilities during that period. Quite to the contrary, it works that way because the Act prescribes that way. And the Deputy Commissioner, charged generally with administration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>such cases,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> has many continuing responsibilities and duties in which he functions as the impartial administrator.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">That is of extreme importance for if the Deputy Commissioner has continuing responsibilities during the period a case is being processed on this self-executing basis, it must be recognized that he functions as an impartial administrator bound to accord to the employer no less than to the employee all the rights and protection that the Act prescribes. In other words, his duty to determine relevant matter extends to both parties, not just one. During all of this time the employer is no less an interested party than he is when a formal claim has been filed. Just as the Deputy Commissioner has during this interim the obligation to ascertain relevant fact-legal questions having importance to the employee, so must he determine the merits of those significant to the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>This analysis demonstrates that neither the responsibilities of the Deputy Commissioner nor the right of either one or both of the parties to call on him to determine relevant matters committed to him by the Act, can depend on a formal claim having been filed. If that were so, the Act would be one-sided, the employer would have no means of exerting his statutory right to have the Deputy Commissioner pass on his contentions, and would be left to the uncontrollable contingency of the claimant filing or not filing a claim. The only alternative would be for the employer to file, within the 14 days after notice of the injury, a formal controversion<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> in every case. Any such practice would effectually destroy the statutory goal that \u201ccompensation * * * shall be paid periodically, promptly, and directly * * *, without an award.\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Consequently, the word \u201cclaim\u201d as found in \u00a7 919(c), note 14, supra, or 914 (h), note 13, supra, is not to be read in the technical sense of a formal claim signed by the claimant. It refers generally to the case involving that particular injured employee against that employer for the specified accidental injury. Construed in this fashion to achieve a balanced judicial adjudication of adversary rights, both sections affirm that the Deputy Commissioner has the duty \u201cupon application of any interested party\u201d to \u201corder a hearing thereon.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Of course, the Act does not undertake to prescribe the form or content of the hearing. A reasoned flexibility and an adaptation to the requirements of a particular situation is recognized by the language of \u00a7 914(h), note 13, supra, that the Deputy Commissioner shall \u201c * * * hold such hearings, and take such further action as he considers will properly protect the rights of all parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">Again, without anticipating the kind of hearing which must be held, or the decision to be made from it, it is clear that the facts alleged in the complaint showed that the Employer was asserting a valuable right which \u00a7 914(h) says the Deputy Commissioner must \u201cproperly protect.\u201d That \u201cright\u201d is the Employer\u2019s right to have his liability determined under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act if it in law is the applicable one. For the Longshoremen\u2019s Act is not a one-way street. It imposes severe liabilities on an employer. At the same time, it accords to him substantial protection. For a case within the Act, the employer is assured that under no other law, in no other forum, will he finally be compelled to pay money to the employee. The liability of the employer for compensation under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act \u201c * * * shall be exclusive * * * of all other liabilities of such employer to the employee * * * and anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages from such employer * * * on account of such injury * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-13\">That right is as valuable at the end of the case as it is either in the beginning or some place down the line. Indeed, where the employer contends that his obligations under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act have been fulfilled, he is, if that contention is borne out by the facts, entitled to an adjudication by the Deputy Commissioner in order to make effective the bar which the exclusive liability of \u00a7 905 raises. There is, then, nothing inconsistent with the employer demanding a hearing whose object is to establish judicially that the Longshoremen\u2019s Act applies, but that on the merits <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> no further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>compensation is due. Quite to the contrary, after payment of substantial compensation and the furnishing of medical benefits unlimited in duration and cost, the most valuable right would be a determination that all obligations to the employee have been fulfilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Since, as we have held, the Longshoremen\u2019s Act imposes the duty on the Deputy Commissioner to hold a suitable hearing to pass upon and adjudicate the contentions now made by the Employer and properly before him for decision, little need be said of the District Court\u2019s power to compel him to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">If it is not inherent in the Longshoremen\u2019s Act itself, it certainly is in the Administrative Procedure Act which, as we and others have held, controls proceedings under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The APA provides categorically that \u201cevery agency shall proceed with reasonable dispatch to conclude any matter presented to it * * <footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Apparently in recognition that a failure or refusal to hear and decide could be as destructive as bad deciding,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Congress provided in \u00a7 10(e) that Courts may review the inaction of an agency and specifically \u201ccompel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.\u201d <footnotemark>32</footnotemark> And enforcement may be by a mandatory injunction.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>The Deputy Commissioner, on the facts set forth in the complaint, has failed and refused to hold any hearing or determine the contentions made by the Employer. This is in derogation of his statutory duty, and if the facts are established the District Court was empowered to issue suitable orders to \u201ccompel agency action unlawfully withheld,\u201d 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1009(e) (A), note 32, supra. It was error to dismiss the complaint and the matter must be reversed and remanded for further consistent action.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b888-8\">.

Obviously this opinion does not undertake to decide that question or influence it in any way.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b888-20\">. See, for example, the state cases which have arrived at conclusions contrary to Flowers and Noah, but on which certiorari has been denied. See, e. g., Richard v. Lake Charles Stevedores, Inc., La.App. 1957, 95 So.2d 830, certiorari denied 355 U.S. 952, 78 S.Ct. 535, 2 L.Ed.2d 529; Sullivan v. Travelers Ins.

Marshall, Tex.Civ.App., 1957, 308 S.W.2d 174, writ ref. n. r. e. in which certiorari was not sought. Of course, the explanation, conceptually unsatisfactory as it is, is that denial of certiorari is of no significance. Brown v.

In contrast to a traditional court, the Deputy Commissioner does not sit like a judge waiting for the parties to make a move. The Act imposes upon him the duty of making such investigations as he considers necessary, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 919 (c), 923(a). In the routine handling of cases, he was many decisions to make, e. g., the need for and appointment of an umpire physician to determine disability, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 907(b), the time at which temporary total disability ceases, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 908(b), the extent, nature or percentage of permanent, partial disability, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 908(c), ascertainment of difference in wage-earning capacity, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 908(h), determination of applicable average weekly wage for purpose of computing compensation benefits, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 910, and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"Ax5\">That the successful operation of the Act rests principally upon this continuous informal administration of cases by the Deputy Commissioners rather than the few isolated formal hearings after claim and controversion is reflected by the Annual Reports of the Department of Labor which the Act, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 943, requires the Secretary to make to Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">The Annual Report, Department of Labor 1957, p. 70, describes the operation under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act: \u201cUnder the law, the first payment of compensation must be made within 14 days after the employer has knowledge of the injury or death. Known as the direct payment method, the record of timeliness of payment has been similarly good on the part of the majority of private insurance companies and self-insurers. Formal hearings and court proceedings are the exception. Because of the large number of injury eases involved, however, the amount of administrative work necessarily involved in the district offices is impressive. During 1957, there were 33,-981 personal interviews with claimants and employers or their representatives, 11,848 informal conferences relating to claims, 8,027 independent medical examinations ordered, and 342 formal hearings completed.\u201d The 1958 Report indicates that \u201calthough such administrative activity in 1958 remained relatively the same as in the previous year, the number of informal conferences on claims increased * * Annual Report, Department of Labor 1958, p. 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-14\">The 1958 Annual Report at pages 74-75 demonstrates that large numbers of employees are involved and that fulfillment of its purpose demands routine, regular, certain, informal administration:</p>\n<p id=\"b892-15\">\u201cIt is believed that close to 350,000 longshoremen, ship repairmen, and other maritime workers are affected. * *</p>\n<p id=\"b892-16\">For 1958 there were 71,076 injury/death cases reported. During the same period 74,954 cases were closed with compensation benefits (excluding medical) totaling $8,903,192, at the year end 13,968 cases were still active. The annual average for 1947-1949 is even more imposing: 114,296 reported injuries, 116,857 cases disposed of, 11,293 remaining active.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-18\">This is in contrast to the few cases disposed of by formal hearings: 342 in 1957 and for 1958 only 371 under Longshoremen\u2019s as well as District of Columbia, Defense Bases and Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act coverages. This is achieved by informal continuous administration as the 1958 Report emphasizes. \u201cDuring 1958, there were 34,061 personal interviews with claimants and employers or their representatives, 13,764 informal conferences relating to claims, 6,938 independent medical examinations ordered, and 371 formal hearings completed. Although such administrative activity in 1958 remained relatively <em>the same as </em>in the previous year, the number of informal conferences on claims increased 16 percent.\u201d 1958 Report at p. 74.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b893-6\">. 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 914(d) provides: \u201cIf tlie employer controverts the right to compensation he shall file with tlie deputy commissioner on or before the fourteenth day after he has knowledge of the alleged injury * * * a notice * * * stating that the right to compensation is controverted * * * and the grounds upon which the right to compensation is controverted.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b893-14\">. 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 914(a).

This might, as here, include the question of the timeliness of the claim. A formal claim, as we have explained, is not essential to impose liability for compensation where no controversion is filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>by the employer. \u00a7 913(a) does provide, however, that \u201cif payment of compensation has been made without an award * * * a claim may be filed within one year after the date of the last payment.\u201d The limitation may also be waived, \u00a7 913(b), or tolled, \u00a7 930(f). We may assume, without deciding, that upon the hearing the employer can present what is effectually a controversion even though filed long after the 14 days subsequent to the injury as prescribed in \u00a7 914(d), note 24, supra. See Leonard v. Liberty, Mutual Ins. Co., 3 Cir., 1959, 267 F.2d 421, 425; Simmons v. Marshall, 9 Cir., 1938, 94 F.2d 850. And we would point out, again without deciding, that the provision for suspending further voluntary payments made without a formal award, \u00a7 914(c), making the time for filing claim for further compensation date from the time of the last of such payments, \u00a7 913(a), and the requirement of \u00a7 914(h), note 13, supra, that where payments have been stopped the Deputy Commissioner shall take steps to investigate and hold hearings, seem to reflect that prior automatic voluntary payments do not preclude the employer from thereafter denying liability for further benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b894-9\">.
