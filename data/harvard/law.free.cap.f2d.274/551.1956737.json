After unsuccessful collective bargaining negotiations, petitioner called a strike and commenced to picket the employer\u2019s various establishments. The picketing continued for about two years during which time the employer discharged the striking help and replaced them with non-union employees. As a result of the events of these two years, the union lost decisively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>a new representative election conducted early in 1955 at the instance of the employer. Petitioner continued to picket the retail store, asserting in its placard, <em>inter alia, </em>that Curtis Brothers employed non-union \u201cDrivers, Helpers, Warehouse-men, etc.\u201d This picketing was conducted by, at most, two union members at any one time, and was admittedly peaceful in all respects. Curtis Brothers filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Board, claiming that the union\u2019s conduct violated \u00a7 8(b) (1) (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Relying mainly on previous Board decisions, the Trial Examiner concluded that the alleged conduct was not a violation as charged. The Board disagreed. It reasoned that the picketing was intended to impose economic injury upon the employer so long as he refused to recognize the union as bargaining agent for its employees, that any loss to the employer might reasonably jeopardize the employees\u2019 economic status, and that as a result of such threatened effect the employees might be influenced against their will to join the picketing union. The Board found that the picketing therefore restrained and coerced the employees in the exercise of their right to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing. It consequently held petitioner\u2019s conduct violated \u00a7 8(b) (1) (A) and ordered the union to cease and desist. This is the order we review.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">The Board interpretation of \u00a7 8(b) (1) (A), and of the meaning of \u201ccoerce and restrain,\u201d presents implications of serious and far reaching consequences. But extended discussion by us would only duplicate the very complete and able expositions of the issues in the Examiner\u2019s decision, the Board\u2019s opinion, and in the opinions of the concurring and dissenting members.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">We adopt the positions expressed by the Trial Examiner and the Board\u2019s dissenting member Murdock in holding that \u00a7 8(b) (1) (A) is inapplicable to peaceful picketing, whether \u201corganizational\u201d or \u201crecognitional\u201d in nature, subject always to the limitations of \u00a7 8(b) (4) (C). Broadly stated, we find this conclusion necessitated by the impact which \u00a7 8(b) (1) (A) would have upon other provisions of the Act were any different interpretation adopted. For example, if \u00a7 8(b) (1) (A) were made applicable to the practice of striking or picketing itself, rather than to the violent conduct which may accompany those practices, \u00a7 18, which prohibits interference with the right to strike except as <em>specifically </em>provided for elsewhere in the Act, would effectively be expunged therefrom;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u00a7 8 (b) (1) (A) does not specifically sanction picketing or striking. In fact, it is one of the most general provisions of the entire Act. Similarly, since \u00a7 8(b) (4) (C) expressly makes illegal picketing for recognition if a union has already been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>certified as bargaining representative, the Board\u2019s construction of \u00a7 8(b) (1) (A) would make the former section entirely redundant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">Legislative history and post-legislative history both confirm this interpretation of \u00a7 8(b) (1) (A). Although ambiguities do exist in the legislative history of that provision, the overall impression clearly emerging is that peaceful picketing to secure recognition is not prohibited by the Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And while conduct and expressions of attitude subsequent to the enactment of legislation are not necessarily determinative of the meaning of that legislation, in this case the legislators principally responsible for \u00a7 8(b) (1) (A), and the Board itself, have, for the ten years since its enactment, adhered to the interpretation which this court now adopts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Such universal acceptance of this interpretation presents a convincing confirmation of our views.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The order of the Board is therefore set aside and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-16\">. 49 Stat. 452 (1935), as amended, 29 U.S. O.A. \u00a7 358(b) (1) (A).

MILLER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AAz\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Although rejected by the Curtis employees by a vote of 28 to one, the union thereafter continued to picket the company. The Board held that, under these circumstances, the picketing constituted a violation of \u00a7 8(b) (1) (A) of the Taft-Hartley Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in that it restrained or coerced employees in the exercise of guaranteed rights, saying <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-16\"><em>\u201c </em>* * * There can be no<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> more direct deprivation of the employees\u2019 freedom of choice than to impose upon them a collective bargaining agent they have not chosen or have expressly rejected. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-17\">There can be no doubt that the purpose of the Teamsters\u2019 picketing was either to compel Curtis employees to join the union in order to keep on working, or to put pressure on the employer to grant recognition to the very union its employees had just rejected.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-18\">Section 8(b) (1) of the Labor Act makes it an unfair labor practice for a union \u201cto restrain or coerce (A) employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed\u201d in \u00a7 7.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The latter section guarantees to employees \u201cthe right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and * * * to refrain from any or all of such activities * * * .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ad6\">When these two sections of the statute are read together, it becomes clear that it is immaterial whether the union restrains or coerces the employees directly or through the medium of the employer. For using the employer as an economic club does not protect the union from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>charge of illegal coercion if such coercion in fact results. Thus, both of the only two possible <em>purposes </em>of the picketing are illegal. The purposes of it being unlawful under the plain language of the Act, the picketing itself is, of course, illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">In effect, the majority hold it lawful for the Hoffa labor organization, after it had been repudiated almost unanimously by the employees, to put a picket line around the place of business in an effort to force the employer to tell the employees to join the union or be discharg<em>ed </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>in an attempt to force the employees into the union they had just emphatically rejected. Such an interpretation of the Act, which I think is clearly wrong, is an invitation to labor racketeers and hoodlums to use its processes for unlawful purposes.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-22\">. 61 Stat. 140 (1947), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158 (b) (l) (A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b645-23\">.
