On October 27, 1952, he was sentenced to 20 years on Count 1, 20 years on Count 2, and 25 years on Count 3, being the maximum on each count, to be served concurrently. He failed to prosecute his appeal. Starting with this common-place script petitioner has woven an extensive serial story, the last episode of which was before this court a month ago in Green v. United States, 1 Cir., 1959, 273 F.2d 216. The present installment, a motion under Rule 35, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C., introduces a new element, and seeks to revive one long departed. Taking this last first, it is that, the sentence on Count 3 was \u201cinvalid and void\u201d because of error in the charge. This contention cannot be converted into a Rule 35 matter by the semantic device of alleging that \u201cbecause of the erroneous instructions no verdict responsive to the allegation of the third count of the-indictment was found and hence the sentence of the Court was invalid.\u201d Rule 35 is for the correction of illegal sentences, \u201cthose that the judgment of conviction did not authorize,\u201d United States v. Morgan, 1954, 346 U.S. 502, 506, 74 S.Ct. 247, 250, 98 L.Ed. 248, not for the correction of improper convictions. \u201cA motion for correction of sentence under Rule 35 presupposes a valid conviction and affords a procedure for bringing an improper sentence into conformity with the law.\u201d Cook v. United States, 1 Cir., 1948, 171 F.2d 567, 570, certiorari denied, 1949, 336 U.S. 926, 69 S.Ct. 647, 93 L.Ed. 1088. Any errors committed\u2019 in the charge, or for that matter, any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>question of the sufficiency of the evidence, were reviewable on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Petitioner\u2019s other point has some semblance of merit, but he attempts to draw from it more than he is entitled to. Petitioner correctly points out that sentencing him on the three counts was, as we stated in Campbell v. United States, 1 Cir., 1959, 269 F.2d 688, 692, \u201ctechnically incorrect.\u201d With regard to the relationship of Count 1, charging entry with intent to commit a felony, to Count 2, charging robbery, the matter is determined by Prince v. United States, 1957, 352 U.S. 322, 77 S.Ct. 403, 404, 1 L.Ed.2d 370. While the actual issue decided in that case was the narrower one of \u201cwhether unlawful entry and robbery are two offenses <em>consecutively punishable </em>* * *\u201d (emphasis supplied), the court also refers to the broader question of \u201cwhether the crime of entering a bank with intent to commit a robbery is merged with the crime of robbery when the latter is consummated * *' * \u201d 352 U.S. at page 324, 77 S.Ct. at page 404. The inference to be drawn from the decision is that it is. Similarly, Holiday v. Johnston, 1941, 313 U.S. 342, 349, 61 S.Ct. 1015, 85 L.Ed. 1392, suggests, and there is ample other authority for the proposition, that the offense of robbery, and the offense of aggravated robbery under section 2113(d) are not separate crimes to the extent that consecutive sentences can be imposed on separate counts. See Annotation, 1958, 59 A.L.R.2d 946, 965-70, 992-94. Strictly, consecutive or otherwise, we hold that petitioner should have received only a single sentence. But we do not agree with him that by the imposition of the 20-year sentence on Count 1 the court \u201cexhausted its power\u201d to go any further. Many cases have discussed the general problem of an erroneous number of sentences, applying various theories, but, it has been pointed out, \u201cin every instance the sentence on the count which carried with it the greater penalty was held valid.\u201d 59 A.L.R.2d, supra, at 996. We concur in that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The remaining issue, then, is whether petitioner should receive the paper satisfaction, for which relief he has not in fact asked, of having the sentences under Counts 1 and 2 vacated, leaving him only with the single sentence under Count 3. In Campbell, supra, we indicated that this was merely a technical matter because the sentences were concurrent, and we refused to vacate the incorrect sentences on the ground that \u201cthe defendants are not harmed.\u201d 269 F.2d at page 692. Had the sentences related to different transactions, at different times, petitioner\u2019s opportunity for parole might be affected. See Hibdon v. United States, 6 Cir., 1953, 204 F.2d 834, 839; cf. Audett v. United States, 9 Cir., 1959, 265 F.2d 837, 848, certiorari denied 361 U.S. 815, 80 S.Ct. 54, 4 L.Ed.2d 62. Here we do not see even that danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Judgment will enter affirming the order of the District Court denying the motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
