He brought suit alleging his injuries were caused by defendant\u2019s negligence. Trial was before Judge Rayfiel and a jury. A verdict was returned for plaintiff in the amount of $13,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">First, defendant contends that, on plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the allegedly dangerous condition of the doors could have no relation to plaintiff\u2019s injuries. Judge Rayfiel ruled that the evidence was sufficient to take this question to the jury. We agree with this ruling. Second, defendant contends that, prior to the accident, it had not been notified of the dangerous condition. However, not only was there evidence that defendant\u2019s agent had received a complaint concerning the condition of the doors one day prior to the accident, but there was also evidence that the dangerous condition had existed for a year prior to the accident, thus charging defendant with constructive notice of this condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
