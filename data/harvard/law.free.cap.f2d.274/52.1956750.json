Claim is made that the sentence was void because the trial court, having had reasonable cause to believe appellant mentally incompetent under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4244, failed to make inquiry relative to appellant\u2019s mental capacity before accepting the plea of guilty and imposing sentence thereupon. The contention is based solely upon the fact that the trial court was aware that appellant had a history of epilepsy.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-19\">We find no merit to the contention. The record shows that appellant was represented by competent counsel at the time of plea and that no indication of any nature was made that appellant was not fully competent at such time. The appellant\u2019s disease was considered by the sentencing court and its consideration is indicated in the sentence itself and in the plan of confinement provided. Epilepsy is not insanity and is distinguished therefrom medically and legally. Gann v. Gough, D.C.N.D.Ga., 79 F.Supp. 912; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, Fourth Edition, 629; cf. 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1182(a) (2) and (4). We hold, therefore, that mere awareness upon the part of the trial judge that appellant had a history of epilepsy is not, as a matter of law, a prohibition against the acceptance of plea and imposition of sentence. If, in fact, appellant was or is now mentally incompetent adequate remedy lies in the provisions of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4245. Gordon v. United States, 10 Cir., 250 F.2d 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-20\">The trial court properly denied appellant\u2019s motion and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
