Did the court below err in stating (a) it did not think the question,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cHave you ever had possession of marijuana? \u201d was proper on defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>examination of a government informer, and stating (b) further questioning about marijuana was improper and that \u201cthe Court had ruled,\u201d (again after the previous question nad been answered).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Thus here no question was unanswered ; no objection actually sustained; no offer of proof made or rejected; and counsel for appellant was permitted to ask many more questions in his endeavor to show bias and prejudice on the part of the informer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Counsel for appellant asked all the questions he desired to put and answers were permitted to all such questions. No restrictions whatsoever were placed on efforts of appellant\u2019s counsel to establish bias and prejudice on the part of the informer, save as reported above.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">As the case principally relied upon by appellant<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> points out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-12\">\u201cThe extent of cross-examination with respect to an appropriate subject of inquiry is within the sound discretion of the trial court. It may exercise a reasonable judgment in determining when the subject is exhausted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-13\">An exercise of that judicial discretion here took place. We hold it proper, and affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b173-12\">. 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b173-23\">.

As a matter of fact, Mr. Munson, were you arrested and in possession of marijuana, isn\u2019t that right? A. October 14, 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">\u201cQ. And as a result of this arrest that is why you went to work for the Government, isn\u2019t <em>that true? </em>A. That is not true, and I was arrested for suspicion of possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">\u201cQ. There was marijuana there, wasn\u2019t there? A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">\u201cQ.
