Excess Profits Taxes, \u00a7 722,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the section for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>relief as to so-called abnormalities. Not only have the parties stipulated that during the base period two changes occurred in the character of the petitioner\u2019s business, as that phrase is defined in \u00a7 722(b) (4), but also they agreed as to the appropriate adjustments resulting from such changes, and as to the fact that such adjustments would not duplicate \u201e . , \u201e \u2022 any of the petitioner s earnings included . .. , __, \u2022 m its average base period net income (ABPNI), as computed under \u00a7 742(h). The Tax Court, drawing upon the Ianguage of \u00a7 722, accordingly framed two issues for decision, viz., \u201cwhether the petitioner has shown that its average base period net income, without the benefit of section 722, is an inadequate standard of its normal earnings because of the admitted change in the character of its business * * * \u201d and \u201cwhether it has established what would be a fair and just amount representing normal earnings to be used as a constructive average base period net income (CABPNI) \u2018in lieu of the average base period net income otherwise determined under this sub-chapter\u2019 in computing the excess profits credit based on income.\u201d The issues thus posed were both decided adversely to petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"AJ5S\">At the threshold we are met with the Commissioner\u2019s contention that, by reason of \u00a7 782(c), we are without jurisdiction to review the determination below because it was of questions made \u201cnecessary solely by reason of * * * section 722.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We proceed, therefore, to a consideration of this jurisdictional problem,</p>\n<p id=\"AYD\">As shown above, the Tax Court stated that the only issues involved were the establishment by the taxpayer of two conditions upon which relief under \u00a7 722 depended.</p>\n<p id=\"A35\">The Commissioner m his brief defined the question presented as follows: ^ <em>v</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANN\">\u201cThe broad issue in this case is whether the taxpayer was entitled to relief under Section 722 of the 1939 Internal Revenue Code, where a proper reconstruction of its base period income for the items quality-as grounds for relief under Section 722 resulted in an amount which was less than its average base period net income computed (without the benefit of Section 722) under Section 742(h) of that Code,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-I\">\u201cMore specifically, the question presented is whether, in arriving at its \u2018constructive average base period net income\u2019 under Section 722(a), the taxpayer was also entitled to the benefits of the so-called \u2018growth formula\u2019 used in computing its \u2018average base period net income\u2019 under Section 742(h) \u2014 i. e., whether the taxpayer was entitled to <em>both </em>relief under Section 722 <em>and, </em>the benefits of the \u2018growth formula\u2019 computation under Section 742(h).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>The taxpayer in its reply brief defines the issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgaX\">\u201c * * * The issue, more accurately stated, is whether in determining the amount of the credit, petitioner is entitled to a \u2018constructive average base period net income\u2019 under Section 722(a) computed by the sum of the Section 742(h) formula applied only to its own actual base period earnings and one or both of the two unrelated stipulated reconstructions under Section 722(b) (4), and to use such \u2018constructive average\u2019 in place of the base period average otherwise determined, when the two sets of computations are entirely independent, one from the other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUq\">It thus appears plain that in each of these three definitions of the issues it is recognized that the only problem involves a determination of the proper \u2018constructive average base period net income\u201d under \u00a7 722(a).</p>\n<p id=\"AvK\">Moreover, our own independent analysis of the issues, in the light of the stipulation in the Tax Court and the findings in the thoughtful opinion of Judge Murdock, convinces us that the determination sought was one made \u201cnecessary solely by reason of * * * section 722.\u201d It will be noted that there is no dispute between the parties as to the existence and amount of any \u201cchange in the character of the business\u201d of the taxpayer under \u00a7 722(b) (4), and no dispute that such changes as occurred were properly re-fleeted in the Commissioner\u2019s computation of the taxpayer\u2019s CABPNI. Nor is there any dispute as to the amount of the excess income tax credit under the \u201cgrowth formula\u201d of \u00a7 742(h). And the Commissioner gave the taxpayer the full benefit of this credit. The only question is one of method in determining the CABPNI under \u00a7 722(a), i. e., whether for purposes of determining the excess profits credit petitioner\u2019s CABPNI may properly reflect the Supplement A ABPNI computed under \u00a7 742(h) in addition to the credits for \u201cchange[s] in character of the business\u201d authorized by \u00a7 722(b) (4). We cannot escape the conelusion that the only determination involved is one \u201cnecessary solely by reason of * * * section 722.\u201d Consequently, we hold that under \u00a7 732(c) we are without jurisdiction to review,</p>\n<p id=\"Ahi\">Our conclusion is in accord with Helms Bakeries v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 9 Cir., 236 F.2d 3; 263 F.2d 642, certiorari denied 360 U.S. 903, 79 S. Ct. 1285, 3 L.Ed.2d 1255; Colorado Milling &amp; Elevator Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 10 Cir., 205 F.2d 551; cf. Brown Paper Mill Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 5 Cir., 255 F.2d 77, certiorari denied 358 U.S. 906, 79 S. ct. 229, 3 L.Ed.2d 227. It is not in confliet with our decisions in George Kemp Real Estate Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 2 Cir., 205 F.2d 236; Stern &amp; Stern Textiles, Inc. v. Commissoner of Internal Revenue, 2 Cir., 263 F. 2d 538; Headline Publications, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 2 Cir., 263 F.2d 541. We reviewed on the \u201cerjnts \u201c ^e former two cases because the fax Court s decisions were based up-01\\tIle dof of collateral estoppel and not uP\u00b0n \u00a7 7/2 as was its decision m the case now before us\u2019 and in the Iatter caff because the only contested issue which had been submitted to the Tax Court was a question as to the statute of limitations,</p>\n<p id=\"AIk\">The petitioner relies on Dowd-Feder, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 6 Cir., 173 F.2d 673, and Stimson Mill Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 9 Cir., 163 F.2d 269, certiorari denied 332 U.S. 824, 68 S.Ct. 165, 92 L. Ed. 400, rehearing denied 332 U.S. 839, 68 S.Ct. 218, 92 L.Ed. 411, affirming 7 T.C. 1065, in both of which cases jurisdiction was sustained over challenge by the Commissioner. We think that in each of these cases, as in this, only a \u00a7 722 question was involved, i. e., the proper eomputation of the taxpayer\u2019s CABPNI under \u00a7 722, and with deference we cannot accept the analysis of the problem made in those opinions. We suggest that the Stimson Mill case may no longer control in the Ninth Circuit: it appears to have been overruled, <em>sub silentio, </em>by Helms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Bakeries v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, supra. And the Court in the Sixth Circuit in its Dowd-Feder decision relied upon Stimson Mill.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajf\">Petition dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AFN\">. \u201c\u00a7 722. <em>General relief </em>\u2014 Constructive <em>average Vase period net income</em></p>\n<p id=\"AZr\">\u201c(a) <em>General rule. </em>In any case in which the taxpayer establishes that the tax computed under this subchapter (without the benefit of this section) re-suits in an excessive and discriminatory tax and establishes what would be a fair and just amount representing normal \u25a0earnings to be used as a constructive \u25a0average base period net income for the purposes of an excess profits tax based upon a comparison of normal earnings \u25a0and earnings during an excess profits tax period, the tax shall be determined by using such constructive average base period net income in lieu of the average \u25a0base period net income otherwise determined under this subchapter.
