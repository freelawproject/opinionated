As counsel for the Commissioner has pointed out, when \u00a7 214 of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 214, was added, Congress intended to give a taxpayer in the position of Halina Lustig a tax benefit in addition to the exemption for a dependent. Now to hold that by \u00a7 214 the rule of the Lovett case was no longer valid would amount to saying that when Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>gress granted the rights set forth in \u00a7 214 it automatically withdrew from Mrs. Lustig rights which she theretofore had to claim the dependency exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"AMb\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
