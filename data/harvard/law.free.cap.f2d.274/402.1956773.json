Appellant Todd Shipyards Corporation, one of 57 claimants against the government, made a motion to dismiss the petition. The motion was denied and this appeal taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-23\">We agree with the trial court that there is a possibility of claims being asserted in this cause which are clearly subject to limitation, and further we are of the opinion that the questions presented by this motion to dismiss can best be decided after a hearing is had on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-24\">The denial of the motion to dismiss is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
