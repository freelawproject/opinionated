In addition to the $4,-700 debt, Leuthold prayed for interest from the date the notes fell due, plus reasonable attorney\u2019s' fees and costs. Rosden denied liability and counterclaimed for $2,182.23 plus interest and costs, This amount was represented to be the unpaid balance of a $12,000 note of Leuthold\u2019s upon which Rosden had incurred liability as an accommodation endorser, The District Court found for each party in the amount claimed on their respective causes of action, allowed interest on each from the date of judgment, and granted Leuthold $1,000 attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"AyDd\">Only Rosden appeals. He contends that the trial judge erred in three respects: (1) attorney\u2019s fees should not have been awarded to appellee, (2) appellant should have been permitted to amend the amount requested in the countef3aim in <em>order to correct </em>an arithmeti<em>Ca </em>error&gt; an\u00bf (3) interest on the counterclaim should have been allowed from the date the note fell due and not from the date of judgment. We shall discuss each of these points in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"AL1\">(1) Appellee\u2019s attorney's fees: Appellee supports the allowance of attorney\u2019s fees on the ground that the notes were executed in Switzerland and Swiss law awards attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party. Even if this were true,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it would not avail appellee. The prevailing conflicts rule holds that, unless the parties manifest a contrary intent, the measure of damages for failure to honor a bill of exchange is governed by the place of payment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since attorney fees are an element of damages,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and since these bills were payable in the District of Columbia, that law determines whether they are recoverable in an action upon a note.</p>\n<p id=\"AkGP\">The District of Columbia Code provides that in actions at law attorney\u2019s fees may not be taxed to either party, unless provided for by law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>code does not provide for attorney\u2019s fees in such a case as this, and since the parties did not agree that appellant should bear these costs, the award of counsel fees must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"AhD\">(2) Amendment to the counterclaim: On December 31, 1956, the appellant Rosden filed his answer to the appellee\u2019s complaint and counterclaimed for $2,182.23. At the pre-trial conference on November 5, 1958, the hearing judge recited that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArI\">\u201e , , , , . . , Defendant counterclaims against T 1fd/btedTneSS of $2,182.23 with interest from June H \u2019 74.0-,^ \u2022, 4\u00bb 1, 1950 as a result of defendant s en- \" . \u201e , . .. . dorsement of plaintiffs promissory , n / note which defendant was obliged to , \u00ab , . , t , pay and of which plamtiif repaid a part. * * * Plaintiff asserts as <em>% </em>, , . far as defendants counterclaim is ... , , . concerned there was a mutual release , . .. , . y <em>y y t, </em>barring said claim * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9M\">Appellant subsequently discovered at the trial that the amount demanded in his counterclaim had been erroneously computed. The error apparently occurred either in adding the seven partial payments which appellee had made over a four-year period, or in subtracting this sum from the total indebtedness. In either event, appellant\u2019s Exhibit 4 showed the balance due as $2,987.75.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the conclusion of the trial, after all the evidence was in, appellant\u2019s attorney pointed out the error to the court. In the ensuing discussion, in which appellee\u2019s attorney took no part, the judge ruled that he was bound by the pre-trial order and denied appellant\u2019s motion for leave to amend,</p>\n<p id=\"Aio\">^ , \u201e \u201e , _ , , \u201e , . Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A., provides that the court may direct \u00edhe Parties to atte\u00bbd a conference to consider, <em>inter aha, </em>(1) The simplification of the issues; (2) The necessity or desirability of amendments to the pleadings; * * * [or] (6) Such other matters as may aid in'the ... \u00ab ,, ^ disposition of the action. Rule 16 iur- ,, ,, , ,, .. , , . ,, ther provides that the action taken at the , . , \u00ab , \u201e , pre-trial conference shall be recited m a court order, and such order when entered controls subg t course of ,, ,. , .... , the action, unless modified at trial to T\u201e prevent manifest injustice. We neea , . ., , ,, ,, , , . . not decide whether the amount claimed . . ... \u201e .. ,. as money damages is an issue or other matter\u201d within the meaning of Rule 16 so that a pre-trial order reciting an erroneously computed claim \u201cgoverns the subsequent course of the action.\u201d Nor is it necessary to determine whether the amendment which appellant requested was necessary \u201cto prevent manifest injustice.\u201d For we think that this case is governed by the rules applicable to retrospective amendment of the pleadings and of the prayer for relief in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>that they may conform to the evidence adduced at trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Amendment of issues is required by Rule 15(b), Fed.R.Civ.P.: \u201cWhen issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties they <em>shall </em>be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) And amendment of the prayer for relief to conform to the evidence is required by Rule 54(c): \u201cexcept as to a party against' whom a judgment is entered by default, every final judgment <em>shall </em>grant the relief to which the party in whose favor it is rendered is entitled, <em>even if the party had not demanded such relief in his pleadings.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) The purpose of these rules is to avoid the tyranny of formalism. This is in harmony with the spirit of the pre-trial practice under Rule 16, which seeks to define the claims and defenses of the parties for the purpose of eliminating unnecessary proof and issues, lessening the opportunities for surprise and thereby expediting the trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">As applied to the instant case, we find no conflict in the rules upon the propriety of allowing the amendment which appellant requested. Appellee\u2019s sole defense asserted at pre-trial and trial was the alleged existence of a valid release. He did not object to appellant\u2019s exhibit on the ground of surprise, even though it disclosed that the balance due on the' notes was greater than the amount stated in the pre-trial order. He has never said that disclosure of the exhibit impeded the trial. Nor has he ever claimed that he was prejudiced by surprise or that he was otherwise deprived of the opportunity to challenge the greater amount. In these circumstances, we think the trial court erred in refusing judgment on the counterclaim in the amount shown by the evidence to be the balance due upon the notes, namely, $2,687.75. Accordingly, we reverse and remand this phase of the case with directions to enter judgment in that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-12\">(3) Interest on the counterclaim: The District of Columbia Code provides that in \u201can action to recover damages for breach of contract\u201d interest runs from the date of judgment unless judge or jury include it as an element of damages. D.C.Code \u00a7 28-2708 (1951). But where the action is to recover a \u201cliquidated debt,\u201d on which \u201cinterest is payable * * * by law or usage\u201d any judgment <em>\u201cshall </em>include interest * * * from the time [the debt] was due * * * until paid.\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 28-2707 (1951). (Emphasis supplied.) It is clear that appellant\u2019s action as an accommodation endorser was for a liquidated amount, and that interest is payable by law or usage.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Consequently interest should have been awarded from the date the obligation became due.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We remand this aspect of the case to the District Court with directions to determine when the obligation fell due, and to award Rosden interest on the counterclaim from that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-15\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AKD\">. American courts treat foreign law as a fact which, like any other fact, must be proven at trial. Ennis v. Smith, 1852, 55 U.S. 400, 425-428, 14 L.Ed. 472 ; see also cases and authorities collected in Note, Proof of the Law of Foreign Countries: Appellate Review and Subsequent Litigation, 72 Harv.L.Rev. 318 (1958). Yet appellee, who had the burden of establishing his right to reimbursement of attorney\u2019s fees, did not attempt to prove the relevant Swiss law. For this reason, we would at least be forced to remand the case with directions to permit the appellee to introduce evidence on this question, see Walton v. Arabian American Oil Co., 2 Cir., 1956, 233 F.2d 541, 546 (opinion of Judge Frank, dissenting in part), if not to reverse outright, ibid, (majority opinion). Since we find that foreign law does not control, we do not reach this question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A4W\">. There does not appear to bo any controlling precedent in the District of Columbia. The Supreme Court has looked to the law of the place of payment to determine: (1) the mode and timeliness of presentment, Pierce v. Indseth, 1882, 106 U.S. 546, 1 S.Ct. 418, 27 L.Ed. 254; Wiseman v. Chiapella, 1859, 64 U.S. 368, 380, 16 L.Ed. 466; (2) the sufficiency of performance by the principal obligor, Scudder v. Union National Bank, 1875, 91 U.S. 406, 412-413, 23 L.Ed. 245 (dicta); and (3) the \u201cformal and essential validity * * * [and] incidents of obligation,\u201d United States v. Guarantee Trust Co., 1934, 293 U.S. 340, 345, 347, 55 S.Ct. 221, 224, 79 L.Ed. 415 (dicta). The rule stated in text is unanimously stated and approved by the commentators.

Since Leuthold\u2019s claim was apparently also for a liquidated debt, he too would have been entitled to interest from the date the debt fell due.

He is free, of course, to petition the District Court to reopen the judgment under applicable portions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
