Moran, a time charterer of the tug, was granted indemnification on its impleader petition against Conners-Standard Marine Corporation, the owner and operator of the tug. D.C.S.D.N.Y., 175 F.Supp. 375.</p>\n<p id=\"A1c\">The respondents\u2019 principal claim for reversal is that Judge Murphy erred in holding that the libels, which were filed three months and six months, respectively, after the New York three-year statute of limitations for negligence had run, were not barred by laches, Judge Murphy, holding that the suit was, at least for time limitation purposes, one <em>ex delicto </em>rather than <em>ex contractu </em>for breach of an implied warranty of workmanlike performance of the towage contract, quite properly permitted the libel-ant to amend its pleadings to include <em>the </em>proof that it offered tending to show that the respondents were not prejudiced by the late filing. Gilmore &amp; Black, The Law of Admiralty, \u00a7 9-81. We need not consider libelant\u2019s alternative claim that its libels are governed by the New York six-year statute of limitations. For Judge Murphy, while recognizing that it was incumbent on the libelant to prove facts negating laches, Gilmore &amp; Black, supra, Redman v. United States, 2 Cir., 176 F.2d 713, Redman v. United Fruit Co., 2 Cir., 185 F.2d 553,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> properly found, primarily on the basis of correspondence passing between libelant\u2019s insurance brokers and Moran with copies to Con<em>ners,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that the respondents were not prejudiced. Todd Shipyards Corp. v. Moran Towing &amp; Transportation Co., 2 Cir., 247 F.2d 626, Virginia Shipbuilding Corporation v. United States Shipping Board E. F. Corp., D.C.E.D.Va., 11 F.2d 156. We find that the equities of the parties were fully considered and that the discretion of the trial court was reusonably exercised. Gardner v. Panama R. Co., 342 U.S. 29, 72 S.Ct. 12, 96 L.Ed. 31; Czaplicki v. The Hoegh Silvercloud, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"AC4\">The suggestion, that there is no legally admissible evidence supporting the finding of negligence in the operation an(j navigation of the tug, is without <em>merit. The </em>respondents overlook the room for a proper inference that accidents such as these \u2014 striking a lock wall and grounding outside the Canal channel \u2014 arising during the routine naviga-\u00a1\u00bfon 0f -\u00a1^g tug, -without intervention of other craft or of third parties, would not occur absent negligence,</p>\n<p id=\"APv\">Lastly, the respondents claim that certain accident reports and notes protest filed by the master of the barge improperly received. It is not necessary now to decide whether this ma-terial was admissible under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1732, or under the liberal practice of the admiralty courts. See, e. g., The Rosalia, 2 Cir., 264 F. 285; Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Downer Towing Corporation, 2 Cir., 11 F.2d 466; The Denny, 3 Cir., 127 F.2d 404; cf. Pennsylvania R. Co. v. The Buchanan Boys, 2 Cir., 155 F.2d <em>585; </em>Benedict on Admiralty, 6th Edition, 1940, Vol. 3, \u00a7 381(b); Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd Edition, 1940, Vol. 1, \u00a7 4d. For the meager content of the reports was such that, especially in view \u00b0f the entire evidence, it could not possibly have been prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"AnE\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Aar\">.
