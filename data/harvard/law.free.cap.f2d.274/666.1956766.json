The judgment followed a verdict in favor of the plaintiff in a jury trial. The defendant attacks both the jury\u2019s finding upon the existence of negligence and the causal connection between any possible negligence and the death of the plaintiff\u2019s decedent. As usual, in these cases, the evidence is somewhat conflicting and inferences to be drawn from it are, likewise, not sun-clear. The jury resolved' the issues in favor of the plaintiff. The trial judge has thoroughly analyzed the facts and reached the conclusion that the\u2019 jury\u2019s verdict is not to be disputed. We agree with his analysis and do not find it necessary to repeat it. See D.C.W.D. Pa. July 24, 1959, 180 F.Supp. 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-27\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
