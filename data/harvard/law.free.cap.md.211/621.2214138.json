He complains that the trial court made \u201cdisparaging remarks\u201d in charging the jury, and there was insufficient evidence to convict him. As we have repeatedly said, it is not the function of a court, on application for <em>habeas corpus, </em>to review alleged errors or irregularities, which can be reviewed on appeal, and do not go to the fundamental jurisdiction to try the accused. Nor can the question of jail time, as a credit against sentence, be reviewed in such a proceeding. The whole matter is within the discretion of the judge imposing sentence. See <em>Agner v. Warden, </em>203 Md. 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-13\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
