He was represented by court-appointed counsel, found guilty on both indictments and sentenced to the Penitentiary for a term of eight years on each conviction, to run concurrently. He complains that his bail was excessive, the evidence was insufficient, his attorney did not represent him properly, and that there was some irregularity in the first indictment. We shall not attempt to comment on these complaints, for they are the same ones we considered in <em>Lievers v. Warden, </em>210 Md. 670.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
