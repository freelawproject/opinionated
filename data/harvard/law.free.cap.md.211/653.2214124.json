He seems to contend that he is not guilty because he \u201ckept company\u201d with the girl with her parents\u2019 consent, and her pregnancy was reported to the police by the school principal. He married the girl the day after he had been sentenced. Petitioner was represented at the trial by court-appointed counsel, and there is nothing in his petition to indicate that he was innocent of the offense charged. As we have repeatedly said, questions of guilt or innocence cannot be retried on <em>habeas corpus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
