Pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>titioner did not know the meaning of an appeal. Petitioner further alleges that at the trial below his attorney did not say a word in his defense. The attorney did not note an appeal, file a motion to quash the indictment, or make a motion in arrest of judgment. Petitioner does not allege fraud, bad faith, or collusion on the part of his attorney with any State officer, nor does he allege that he complained to the trial judge concerning the attorney appointed to defend him by the court. <em>Sykes v. Warden, </em>201 Md. 662, 93 A. 2d 549; <em>Roberts v. Warden, </em>206 Md. 246, 111 A. 2d 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">Petitioner further contends that a confession was obtained from him by illegal means and that he was \u201cframed\u201d for arson. The question of whether a statement or a confession was obtained by illegal means can be raised on appeal but not on <em>habeas corpus. Randall v. Warden, </em>208 Md. 667, 119 A. 2d 712; <em>Davis v. Warden, </em>208 Md. 675, 119 A. 2d 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Petitioner further claims that there was not sufficient evidence to convict him and that he should have been found not guilty of arson by reason of insanity and given treatment for his mental condition. The sufficiency of the evidence and the weight given it cannot be raised on <em>habeas corpus. Georgevich v. Warden, </em>207 Md. 632, 114 A. 2d 891; <em>Davis v. Warden, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
