Circuit Court for Allegany County. His complaints as to the legality of his arrest, and the improper admission of a confession in evidence, cannot be reviewed on <em>habeas corpus, </em>as we have repeatedly said. The complaint that court-appointed counsel did not properly protect his rights is not a ground for a writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>in the absence of any allegations of collusion or fraud with State officials, or objections raised in the trial court. Cf. <em>Bowen v. Warden, </em>202 Md. 646, and <em>Thanos v. Superintendent, </em>204 Md. 665. The docket entries show that he waived in writing his right of an indictment and a jury trial, and was properly tried by the court on an information. Cf. <em>Heath v. State, </em>198 Md. 455, 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
