J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AYV\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-13\">The petitioner, Arthur H. Clements, asks leave to appeal from an order of Judge Emory H. Niles, sitting in the Baltimore City Court, denying the petitioner\u2019s application for a writ of <em>habeas corpus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b644-14\">The petitioner was tried and convicted in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on a charge of false pretenses. Judge Thomas M. Anderson sentenced him to five years in the Maryland Penitentiary. The petitioner complains: (1) that he was not of sound mind when the crime was committed; (2) that he was still of unsound mind when tried; (3) that his insanity prevented him from knowing right from wrong; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>(4) that his insanity prevented him from knowing what transpired at his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Judge Anderson had the petitioner examined by a group of doctors at the State Hospital for the insane at Crownsville. These doctors found the petitioner sane and the court so held in finding him guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">All the petitioner\u2019s complaints deal with his sanity and since the trial court found him to be sane the matter is thus <em>res judicata </em>and cannot be retried on <em>habeas corpus. Kohnen v. Warden, </em>202 Md. 658, <em>97 </em>A. 2d 329. Petitioner\u2019s remedy was by way of appeal and not by <em>habeas corpus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
