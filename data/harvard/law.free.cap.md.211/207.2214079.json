Austin Swann, prayed the equity court in Charles County to determine that he could sell his one-fourth remainder interest in certain stock, under Item 4 of his father\u2019s will, free and clear of the claims of his own children. His two brothers and his sister were not made parties to the proceeding. His mother, the life tenant and trustee, joined in the bill and agreed to the sale provided it \u201cis consummated without prejudice to\u201d her right to the income and voting privileges during her life. His married daughter opposed the proposed sale, claiming that his interest was contingent upon his surviving the life tenant. His four other children, being infants, answered by guardian <em>ad litem. </em>The Chancellor, in an able and succinct opinion, found the complainant entitled to the relief prayed. This appeal fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>lowed. No questions are raised as to the right to declaratory relief or necessary parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Harold S. Swann died in October of 1948, leaving a will dated November 12, 1946, which was duly probated. After some minor bequests, Item 4 provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">\u201cI give and bequeath all of the stock of the Southern Maryland Oil Co., Inc., registered in my individual name at the time of my death, to my devoted wife, Elizabeth P. Swann, if she survives me, in trust to receive the full income therefrom for her sole benefit during the period of her natural life, my said Trustee to have full authority and power to vote said stock and to act in every respect she deems for the best interest of the corporate business; and upon the death of my wife said trust shall cease, or if she should predecease me, I hereby give and bequeath the aforesaid stock (or the proceeds from the sale of the same if purchased by James W. Wills pursuant to his option in this respect) to my four children, namely, Anna Swann Wills, Harold Austin Swann, T. Allen Swann and William Hayes Swann, share and share alike, per stirpes and not per capita; and in the event James W. Wills does not elect to exercise his option to purchase said stock within the time prescribed by said agreement, it is my will that my children shall receive said stock absolutely and without any restrictions whatsoever, with full authority to divide the same in kind or liquidate said stock as they see fit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">In Item 5, the residue of the estate was left to his widow \u201cto have and to hold absolutely as her own and without any restrictions whatever.\u201d By Item 6, the widow was appointed executrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">It was stipulated that 7,494 shares of the stock of the Southern Maryland Oil Co., Inc. now stand registered on the books of the company in the name of \u201cElizabeth P. Swann, Trustee of Harold S. Swann Estate\u201d, and that the widow and the four children named in the will still survive.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>The \u201coption\u201d referred to in Item 4 of the will is explained by a written agreement filed as an exhibit, dated July 16, 1946. This recites that Harold S. Swann and James W. Wills are the owners of one-fourth each of the capital stock of Southern Maryland Oil Co., Inc., the remaining one-half of the issued stock being owned by the respective wives of the parties. It recites that the parties had issued one share of voting stock in their joint names, with the right of survivor-ship, and that the survivor should have the \u201cfurther option\u201d of purchasing the stock of the party first dying. The agreement then provided \u201cThat the survivor of them, upon the death of the party first to die, if said deceased party has been predeceased by his wife, (and if not, upon the death of the widow of the party first to die) shall have the option of purchasing from the estate of the deceased all the stock of every class * * * registered as of July, 1946 on the books of said Company in the name of the party first to die less the one share otherwise provided for * * *\u201d at a price to be determined by appraisal as therein provided. The agreement was declared to be binding on the heirs, personal representatives or assigns of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The appellant\u2019s first contention is that Item 4 does not create a remainder in any of the children named. The argument is that all of the language following the phrase, \u201cupon the death of my wife said trust shall cease\u201d, relates only to the disposition in the event that she should have predeceased the testator. It is contended that no disposition is made of the corpus of the terminated trust, and that therefore it passes to the wife under Item 5. It is true that Item 4 has a curious verbal gap between the termination of the trust and the subsequent bequest of the stock or its proceeds. But the subsequent language declaring, \u201c* * * it is my will that my children shall receive said stock absolutely and without any restriction whatsoever * * can hardly be restricted to the alternative of the wife\u2019s not surviving. The option, which is twice referred to, was applicable not only in the event that the wife predeceased the testator, but \u201cupon the death of the widow of the party first to die\u201d. The testator must have used the language quoted with full knowledge that the option had a double aspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Giving effect to the word \u201cor\u201d as one alternative, we can readily imply the other alternative to be the death of the life tenant, at which time the trust is terminated. The appellants\u2019 construction would produce the capricious result that the survival of the wife would not merely delay the children\u2019s entry into possession, but cut off a legacy to which they would be entitled without question if she failed to outlive the testator. It can hardly be supposed that the testator could have intended such a thing. Again, if the testator intended the remainder to pass to the widow under Item 5, in the event she survived him, there would be no point in creating a trust and a life estate. The same result could be accomplished by an outright gift of the stock or proceeds to her. We find no difficulty in concluding that remainders were created in the four named children.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The appellants further contend that if H. Austin Swann has a remainder interest, it is not a vested one. At the outset, it may be noted that the interest would be alienable regardless of its future or contingent character, so long as the persons to take are identified or identifiable. <em>In re Clayton\u2019s Trust Estate, </em>195 Md. 622, 625; <em>Hammond v. Piper, </em>185 Md. 314, 318; <em>Miller, Construction of Wills, </em>\u00a7 233. See also <em>Simon v. Safe Dep. &amp; Trust Co., </em>190 Md. 468, 473. But the question here posed calls for a determination of the character of the estate, for that will affect its present market value. It is not suggested that there would be any gift over in default of issue, nor are we asked to pass on the question. It would probably be inappropriate to do so, in a case to which the other named remaindermen are not parties. The sole question is whether H. Austin Swann can sell his interest free and clear of the claims of his own children and descendants in the event that he fails to survive the life tenant. The appellants contend that his remainder is contingent, or subject to be divested, in the event of his failure to survive the life tenant, and that if he dies before the life tenant the interest would pass to such of his descendants per stirpes as might be living at the death of the life tenant. The answer depends upon the intention of the testator, as gathered from the will and surrounding circumstances, aided by recognized canons of construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>One of <em>the most </em>powerful of these canons <em>is the </em>rule of early vesting, and it would require rather explicit language to show a testamentary intent to delay the vesting of a remainder in named individuals, the testator\u2019s own children, in favor of a shadowy class of descendants. We find nothing in the language of the will to support such a construction. The use of the phrase following the bequest to his children, \u201cabsolutely and without any restriction whatsoever\u201d, may be compared with the phrase in Item 5 disposing of the residue to his wife \u201cabsolutely as her own and without any restrictions whatever\u201d. Both speak from the date of the testator\u2019s death and are quite unconditional. Of course, the words \u201cshare and share alike\u201d relate only to the equality of the distribution and not its time. There are here no qualifying words, such as \u201cthen living\u201d, \u201cfrom and after\u201d, or \u201cpay over and divide\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The appellants place their chief reliance upon the words \u201cper stirpes, not per capita\u201d. But this phrase has no meaning at all, with regard to named beneficiaries. As was said in <em>Lycett v. Thomas, </em>153 Md. 443, 448: \u201cThe words <em>\u2018per stirpes\u2019 </em>could have no application to the children of the respective life tenants. * * * [They] are naturally applied to descendants, and mean according to stock or by representation.\u201d Again it was said (p. 449) : \u201c \u2018The words <em>\u201cper stirpes\u201d </em>are not strictly applicable to named legatees or legatees, designated as a class, and are ordinarily, at least, appropriate, and are used with respect to substitutional gifts to substituted legatees in the case of the death of the primary legatee.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Nor is the case altered if we assume that the testator had in mind the descendants of the named legatees. The mere fact that a bequest in remainder is to a named legatee and his descendants, <em>per stirpes, </em>would not in itself impose a condition of survival. The cases of <em>Wilson v. Pichon, </em>162 Md. 199, and <em>Grace v. Thompson, </em>169 Md. 653, seem directly in point. Cf. <em>Robinson v. Mercantile Trust Co., </em>180 Md. 336. See also <em>Restatement, Property, </em>\u00a7 157, Comments i and j, and <em>Reno, Future Interests, </em>15 Md. L. R. 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Since we fully agree with the decision of the Chancellor below, the decree will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">\n<em>Decree affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
