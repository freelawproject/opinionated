The People\u2019s theory at his preliminary hearing was that he did attempt (see Pen. Code, \u00a7 664), by <em>false pretenses, </em>to defraud certain undercover officers of money in excess of $200, with intent thus to commit grand theft as defined by Penal Code sections 484<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 487.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">The superior court record indicates that over the district attorney\u2019s objection the following proceedings were taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>Weltsch had moved under Penal Code section 995 to set aside the information charging attempted grand theft, and to amend the information to charge only a violation of Penal Code section 351a, a misdemean- or. A subsequent order of the court recited: \u201cDefendant\u2019s motion under 995 PC is granted with the stipulation that Information be amended to charge a violation of Section 351(a) PC alleged to have occurred on November 3, 1976. Defendant enters a plea of Guilty to VS [j/c] 351(a) PC. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">The parties construe the above order as a dismissal of the information insofar as it charged Weltsch with grand theft. We also so construe it.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">The People appeal from the order of dismissal. They contend that Weltsch was properly charged with attempted grand theft. Weltsch has cross-appealed, contending that the evidence upon which his misdemean- or plea and conviction were founded was unconstitutionally seized by the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">The transcript of Weltsch\u2019s preliminary hearing discloses the following uncontroverted evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">\u201cJoy\u201d is the trademarked brand of a perfume which is \u201cMade in France\u201d and the sole distributor of which in the United States is \u201cJean Patou\u201d of New York. An ounce bottle of the substance is sold wholesale in this country for $60, and retail for $100. Weltsch told a police officer and an agent of the United States Custom Service who, unknown to him were acting in an undercover capacity, that he had 200 one-ounce bottles of Joy perfume which he would sell for $18.50 each, and 100 half-ounce bottles priced by him at $10 per bottle. He said that it was \u201cthe real thing,\u201d that it was not \u201chot,\u201d and \u201cthat the shipment was bound for Mexico, but the peso had been devalued and therefore he got a real, real bargain on it, . . .\u201d He produced one of the bottles for the officers; it was marked: \u201cMade in France. Jean Patou.\u201d Weltsch then agreed, for $4,500, to sell the lot to the officers who, upon its production, seized it. The bottles\u2019 contents were not Joy perfume, but an imitation of little or no value.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">The above mentioned felony charge of attempting to obtain money in excess of $200 by false pretenses followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">The question presented by the People for our determination is whether <em>all </em>of the elements of the general statute proscribing obtaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>money by false pretenses, i.e., Penal Code section 484, are included in the requirements of the \u201cspecial statute\u201d of this case, Penal Code section 351a.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">The controlling authority of our immediate concern is <em>People </em>v. <em>Ruster, </em>16 Cal.3d 690 [129 Cal.Rptr. 153, 548 P.2d 353, 80 A.L.R.3d 1269].  It teaches, in simple language, that: \u201cProsecution under a general statute is precluded by a special statute when the general statute covers the same matter as, and thus conflicts with, the special statute. . . . However, a special statute does not supplant a general statute unless <em>all </em>of the elements of the general statute are included in the special statute . . . .\u201d  \u201cStatutes are to be construed so as to effect the intent of the Legislature. ... To ascertain legislative intent, the court should construe a statute with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part.\u201d (16 Cal.3d, pp. 694, 696, and see authority there collected.)</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">As is well known, an essential element of the crime of obtaining money by false pretenses is that the victim <em>must rely </em>upon the false pretenses in parting with his money. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ashley, </em>42 Cal.2d 246, 259 [267 P.2d 271] [cert, den., 348 U.S. 900 (99 L.Ed. 707, 75 S.Ct. 222)]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Random, </em>32 Cal.App.3d 164, 172 [108 Cal.Rptr. 326]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>275 Cal.App.2d 984, 996 [80 Cal.Rptr. 418]; 1 Witkin, Cal. Crimes (1963) \u00a7 410, p. 384.) Without such reliance the crime is not committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">Penal Code section 351a, the special statute with which we are concerned, provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who sells, attempts to sell, offers for sale . . . any goods, product or output, and who willfully and falsely represents such goods, product or output to be the goods, product or output of any dealer, manufacturer or producer, other than the true dealer, manufacturer or producer ... is guilty of a misdemeanor \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>It will be seen that Penal Code section 351a does <em>not </em>require as an element of that crime\u2019s commission, that the person to whom the \u201cgoods, product or output\u201d are \u201cwillfully and falsely\u201d represented and sold or offered for sale, <em>must rely </em>upon the willful and false representation. Unlike the crime of theft by obtaining money by false pretenses, as initially charged in Weltsch\u2019s information, such reliance is not a necessary element of a criminal violation of section 351a. The rule of <em>People </em>v. <em>Ruster, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 690, that \u201ca special statute does not supplant a general statute unless <em>all </em>of the elements of the general statute are included in the special statute,\u201d thus appears apposite here.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">But Weltsch points out that his offense was not a completed sale; instead it was an \u201cattempt\u201d or \u201coffer\u201d to sell the bogus Joy perfume. He then argues, correctly (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Camodeca, </em>52 Cal.2d 142, 146-147 [338 P.2d 903]), that \u201cin a prosecution for <em>attempted </em>grand theft by false pretenses it is not necessary that the defendant\u2019s intended victim be deceived by the falsity of the representations made to him . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) It follows, he says in effect, that the elements of <em>attempted </em>theft by false pretenses of Penal Code sections 484 and 664 are the same as those of an attempt or offer of sale under Penal Code section 351a.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">In an inquiry whether a special criminal statute supplants a general criminal statute, our prime, if not only, consideration is whether the Legislature so intended. Weltsch so concedes. <em>People </em>v. <em>Ruster, supra, </em>declares, as noted, that such \u201c[statutes are to be construed so as to effect the intent of the Legislature.\u201d In this area, as elsewhere, that rule has been consistently reiterated. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Ali, 66 </em>Cal.2d 277, 280 [57 Cal.Rptr. 348, 424 P.2d 932]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>64 Cal.2d 574, 582 [51 Cal.Rptr. 225, 414 P.2d 353]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>259 Cal.App.2d 589, 591-592 [66 Cal.Rptr. 432]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Swann, </em>213 Cal.App.2d 447, 451 [28 Cal.Rptr. 830].)</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Applying this rule, reason does not permit the suggested conclusion that by enacting Penal Code section 351a, the Legislature intended the odd result that the special statute (\u00a7 351a) would control where the accused attempted to sell goods under its proscribed false representations, but that the special statute would lapse and the general statutes (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 484, 487) would then take over, where such an attempt was successful. \u201c[I]n construing a doubtful statute, that construction is always to be preferred \u2018which leads to the more reasonable result.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Murata, </em>55 Cal.2d 1, 7 [9 Cal.Rptr. 601, 357 P.2d 833].)</p>\n<p id=\"b837-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>We give further consideration to the rules of <em>People </em>v. <em>Raster, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">A fair construction of the <em>language </em>of section 351a (see fn. 3, ante) indicates a legislative intent to prevent <em>unfair competition </em>by penalizing those who intentionally sell goods by representing them \u201cto be the goods, product or output of any dealer, manufacturer or producer, other than the true [and competing] dealer, manufacturer or producer, . . .\u201d The statute is concerned with the maintenance of fair competition in the marketplace. No intent is seen to abate the general theft, or \u201cfalse pretenses\u201d statutes in the area of the seller\u2019s fraudulent relations with his customers or the general public. It is often said that the best evidence of the legislative intent is the language used. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>193 Cal. 428, 431 [255 P. 1]; <em>Rosas </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>10 Cal.App.3d 77, 90 [88 Cal.Rptr. 907, 43 A.L.R.3d 537]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>229 Cal.App.2d 221, 228 [40 Cal.Rptr. 121]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>222 Cal.App.2d 221, 227 [34 Cal.Rptr. 907].)</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Another indication of the Legislature\u2019s intent as to the coverage of section 351a is the description given its enactment in 1917: <em>\u201cAn act to add a new section to the Penal Code to be numbered three hundred fifty-one a, relating to unfair competition and </em>substitution.\u201d (Double emphasis added; Stats. 1917, ch. 487, p. 570.) Where there is doubt or ambiguity as to the legislative intent, such a description may reasonably be relied upon in ascertaining that intent. <em>(In re Bandmann, </em>51 Cal.2d 388, 392 [333 P.2d 339]; <em>Adoption of Sewall, </em>242 Cal.App.2d 208, 224 [51 Cal.Rptr. 367]; <em>Orange County Water Dist. </em>v. <em>Farnsworth, </em>138 Cal.App.2d 518, 525 [292 P.2d 927].)</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Further such evidence will be observed in the placement of section 351a in the Penal Code. Section 351a will be found in that code\u2019s title 9, \u201cCrimes Against the Person . . .,\u201d and that title\u2019s chapter 12 entitled \u201cOther Injuries to Persons.\u201d The persons injured are patently those \u201cdealers, manufacturers or producers\u201d who are subjected to the \u201cunfair competition\u201d proscribed by section 351a. On the other hand, the offense, or attempted offense, of theft by obtaining money by false pretenses is defined and proscribed in the Penal Code\u2019s title 13, \u201cCrimes Against Property.\u201d The crime of theft by obtaining money by false pretenses is a \u201ccrime against property\u201d (see 1 Witkin, Cal. Crimes (1963) pp. 334-335), i.e., the property of the immediate victim of the false pretense. A code\u2019s title and chapter headings will properly be resorted to in doubtful cases for determination of the legislative intent. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>3 Cal.3d 150, 158-159 [89 Cal.Rptr. 721, 474 P.2d 673] [cert, den., 402 U.S. 910 (28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>L.Ed.2d 652, 91 S.Ct. 1388)]; <em>Gonzales </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>3 Cal.2d 260, 263 [44 P.2d 320]; <em>Ex parte Koser, 60 </em>Cal. 177, 192.) As said in <em>People </em>v. <em>Raster, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 690, \u201cthe court should construe a statute with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Significant also is Penal Code section 35la\u2019s apparent concern only for \u201cthe true dealer, manufacturer or producer\u201d of goods, and not the purchasing public. For if section 351a were to be deemed to supersede the general theft by false pretenses statute, then the special statute\u2019s \u201cperson\u201d might, if for some reason he so chose, with criminal immunity defraud the general public by representing cheap and shoddy goods with its \u201cdealer\u2019s, manufacturer\u2019s or producer\u2019s\u201d consent, as those of his own carefully fabricated and high quality name or brand. (See last sentence of \u00a7 351a, fn. 3, <em>ante.) </em>Such an intent will not reasonably be attributed to the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">And, finally, we opine, a legislative purpose, without apparent reason, to abrogate the felony theft by false pretenses statute in the area of a merchant\u2019s relations with the purchasing public\u2014and substituting therefor the sanctions of a minor misdemeanor<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\u2014 seems most improbable.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">We hold that the enactment of Penal Code section 351a was intended to relate to \u201cunfair competition and substitution\u201d only, and that it does not supplant the general criminal statutes in respect of a seller\u2019s relations with his customers or members of the public generally. The People\u2019s contention that Weltsch was properly charged with attempted grand theft is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">Our consideration turns now to the issue of Weltsch\u2019s appeal, whether the Joy perfume\u2019s seizure was violative of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">On this issue the officers who participated in the Joy perfume\u2019s seizure testified to the following. Prior to the seizure they knew the perfume\u2019s producer, or its New York distributor, to be the owner of its \u201cregistered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>trademark.\u201d 19 United States Code section 1526 forbade importation of such goods except with the trademark\u2019s owner\u2019s written consent. Without such consent, the statute said, the goods \u201cshall be subject to seizure.\u201d Weltsch had, as heretofore noted, told the officers \u201cthat the shipment was bound for Mexico, but the peso had been devalued and therefore he got a real, real bargain on it, . . .\u201d Because of the low price for which Weltsch had offered the perfume, and because it had been \u201cbound for Mexico\u201d before Weltsch had acquired it, the customs agent believed \u201cthat if he had that much Joy perfume, outside of the distribution channels, it was <em>smuggled or stolen.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">If smuggled into the United States, the perfume\u2019s entry was without the written consent of the trademark\u2019s owner and subject to seizure under 19 United States Code section 1526 and undoubtedly under other customs laws. If stolen property in plain view, it was also subject to seizure under well-known constitutional authority. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ramsey, </em>431 U.S. 606, 617 [52 L.Ed.2d 617, 627, 97 S.Ct. 1972]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Peck), </em>10 Cal.3d 645, 648 [111 Cal.Rptr. 565, 517 P.2d 829].) We conclude that the officers, from information at that time known to them, had probable cause to seize the bottled substances produced by Weltsch. His cross-appeal is found to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">The order dismissing the information insofar as it charged attempted grand theft is reversed. The purported appeal of the People from certain nonappealable rulings, i.e., \u201cThe amendment of the information, on the court\u2019s motion and over the objection of the People, to charge violation of California Penal Code Section 351a, a misdemeanor, and the court\u2019s action in allowing the defendant to plead guilty to said amended information,\u201d is dismissed. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 1238; 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Appeal, \u00a7 31, p. 4046.)</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Racanelli, P.
