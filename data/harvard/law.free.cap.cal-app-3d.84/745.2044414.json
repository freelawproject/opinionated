J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATA\">Defendant Richard Barnes was convicted of involuntaiy manslaughter (Pen. Code, \u00a7 192, subd. 2). He was examined psychiatrically, was declared not to be a mentally disordered sex offender (MDSO), sentence was suspended and he received probation. Two years later, Barnes was booked for kidnaping (Pen. Code, \u00a7 207) and the charges were dismissed when the victim could not be found; probation was revoked, criminal proceedings were adjourned on August 26, 1977; he was certified to the psychiatric department of the superior court and found to be a MDSO not amenable to treatment (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6300 et seq.). He claims the superior court erred because he did not commit a sex offense as required by the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">Effective January I, 1977, certification must be based on a conviction of a sex offense, where registration is required under Penal Code section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>290, or by clear proof the offense was committed primarily for purposes of sexual arousal or gratification (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6302).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">Here the only conviction Barnes had was for involuntary manslaughter, not an offense requiring registration under section 290. The certification is on an old superior court form when section 6302 required only that it \u201cappear ... to the Court that the defendant has been convicted of a criminal offense\u201d rather than requiring there be clear proof of a sex offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Because the certification order fails to make the finding required by law the judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Wiener, J., and Welsh, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied September 27, 1978.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
