Proc., \u00a7 1285 et seq.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">By agreement, a dispute between petitioner, Airfloor Company of California, Inc. (Airfloor), and the Regents of the University of California (Regents) was submitted to arbitration. The board of arbitration, composed of executives of the University of California, awarded Airfloor $99,852.19 for extra work performed in the construction of facilities at the San Diego campus of the university. Airfloor petitioned the superior court to confirm the award. In response, Regents did not contest the award but claimed entitlement to set off an alleged debt, not subject to arbitration, in the sum of $418,137.87.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The debt is denied by Airfloor and it is the subject of litigation currently pending in the Superior Court for Alameda County. Regents further contend Airfloor does not have legal capacity to sue because it did not comply with the Contractors License Law (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 7031; <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Nat. C. Goldstone Agency, </em>33 Cal.2d 628 [204 P.2d 37]).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">We agree with the trial court,  Litigation of a nonarbitrable debt is beyond the scope of this special proceeding. The evidence supports the conclusion Airfloor substantially complied with the Contractors License Law <em>(Latipac, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>64 Cal.2d 278 [49 Cal.Rptr. 676, 411 P.2d 564]).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">The Affirmative Defenses</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">The policy of the law which provides for the enforcement of arbitration agreements is to enable persons to resolve disputes through a tribunal of their choosing and avoid the expense and delay incident to court proceedings <em>(McRae </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>221 Cal.App.2d 166, 171 [34 Cal.Rptr. 346, 98 A.L.R.2d 1239]).  Hearings to confirm an arbitration award are \u201cspecial proceedings\u201d as contrasted with \u201cactions.\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 22 and 23.) Special proceedings are creatures of statute and the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>jurisdiction in such proceedings is limited by statutory authority (Woods<em>Drury, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>18 Cal.App.2d 340, 344 [63 P.2d 1184]). The legislation that provides for the enforcement of arbitration awards gives priority to such proceedings (\u00a7 1291.2), narrowly limits the issues (\u00a7 1286.2), and provides for the presenting of evidence in a summary way, i.e., by declarations (\u00a7 1290.2). These provisions reflect the legislative intent to free such hearings from delays incident to ordinary court trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">The response to a petition for confirmation \u201cmay request the court to <em>dismiss </em>the petition or to <em>confirm, correct </em>or <em>vacate </em>the award\u201d (\u00a7 1285.2; italics added). An award shall be confirmed unless the court corrects, vacates or dismisses the proceedings (\u00a7 1286).  The record provides no basis to correct or dismiss the proceedings (\u00a7\u00a7 1286.2, 1287.2). Regents do not contend otherwise. They seek to vacate the award, admittedly correct, because of their \u201ccounter-claim,\u201d neither tried nor triable by arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">\u201cThe sole grounds for vacating an arbitration award are those set forth in Code of Civil Procedure, section 1286.2 .... These grounds are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-6\">\u201c \u2018(a) The award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-7\">\u201c \u2018(b) There was corruption in any of the arbitrators;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-8\">\u201c \u2018(c) The rights of such party were substantially prejudiced by misconduct of a neutral arbitrator;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-9\">\u201c \u2018(d) The arbitrators exceeded their powers and the award cannot be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-10\">\u201c \u2018(e) The rights of such party were substantially prejudiced by the refusal of the arbitrators to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause being shown therefor or by the refusal of the arbitrators to hear evidence material to the controversy or by other conduct of the arbitrators contraiy to the provisions of this title.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Canadian Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Ohm, </em>271 Cal.App.2d 703, 707 [76 Cal.Rptr. 902].) Regents\u2019 setoff fits into none of these categories.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>The totality of the legislative scheme is inconsistent with the use of this forum to resolve nonarbitrable disputes. The provisions for compulsory cross-complaints do not apply to special proceedings and permissive cross-complaints are only allowed where the cross-complaint responds to a complaint or another cross-complaint (not a petition) (\u00a7\u00a7 426.60, 428.10). A setoff can be alleged where \u201can action [not a special proceeding] is . . . commenced\u201d (\u00a7 431.70).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">Regents contend that unless all claims and \u201ccounter-claims\u201d between the parties are resolved in one forum, Regents will be forced to pay nearly $100,000 to an impecunious Airfloor who will be unable to respond to the judgment they expect to get in Alameda County. This plea is without merit. Regents had the option to move to abate the confirmation hearings pending determination of the Alameda County litigation. It did not do so. If that litigation were resolved in their favor, Regents could then set off the judgment in the confirmation proceedings with the judgment in the action at law <em>(Haskins </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>123 Cal. 157 [55 P. 786]; <em>Layne </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>121 Cal.App. 206 [8 P.2d 895]). Even now, upon remand, Regents can move the trial court to stay execution until the superior court case has been decided <em>(Erlich </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>63 Cal.2d 551, 555-556 [47 Cal.Rptr. 473, 407 P.2d 649]).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Legal Capacity to Sue</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">We next consider the defense of noncompliance with the Contractors License Law. The statute provides that no person acting as a contractor may maintain an \u201caction in any court\u201d to collect compensation for such work if he did not have a required license \u201cat all times during the performance of such\u201d work (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 7031). This defense is available in proceedings to confirm arbitration awards. It is an issue under section 1286.2, subdivision (d), because an award to a contractor without a license would be in excess of the arbitrator\u2019s powers <em>(Loving &amp; Evans </em>v. <em>Blick, </em>33 Cal.2d 603, 609-610 [204 P.2d 23]).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">Airfloor obtained a contractor\u2019s license on February 19, 1970, and signed the construction contract on August 25, 1970. Work was performed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>on the project through July 30, 1971, but the license expired June 30, one month earlier. Application to renew the license was not signed by the proper individual and the check to the licensing authority was not honored because of insufficient funds in the drawee bank. Thus there was not literal compliance with Business and Professions Code section 7031.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Strict observance of the statute is not required if \u201cthe facts clearly indicate that the contractor has \u2018substantially\u2019 complied with the statute and that such compliance has afforded to the obligor [Regents] the protection contemplated by the statute\u201d <em>(Latipac, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>64 Cal.2d 278, 281). \u201cSubstantial\u201d compliance is found if \u201cthe policy of the licensing statute has been effectively realized\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 287). This policy is directed toward protecting the public from incompetent and untrustworthy artisans <em>(Vitek, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alvarado Ice Palace, Inc., </em>34 Cal.App.3d 586, 594 [110 Cal.Rptr. 86]). Courts have looked for various factual elements in applying this doctrine but no rigid formula can be devised to measure the facts of each case against the standard <em>(Latipac, supra, </em>atp. 281).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">We have examined the evidence and find the following: Airfloor was licensed when the contract was executed and remained licensed for the entire time it performed the contract except for the last month. Application for license renewal, though defective, was made before the license expired. The Contractors\u2019 License Board notified Airfloor that if it resubmitted a proper application, a license would issue. The arbitration board that awarded Airfloor nearly $100,000 for extra labor and materials was composed of executives of the University of California, reflecting the obligor\u2019s satisfaction with the quality of the work performed. This evidence fully supports the trial court\u2019s finding of substantial compliance with Business and Professions Code section 7031.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Regents claim the court erred in refusing to set aside the submission and reopen the cause for further evidence on this subject. The trial court\u2019s discretion in such matters will not be reversed unless there is a clear showing of abuse of discretion <em>(De Angeles </em>v. <em>Roos Bros., Inc., </em>244 Cal.App.2d 434, 440-441 [52 Cal.Rptr. 783]). A prerequisite to the granting of such a motion is a showing that the evidence sought to be introduced was not available or known to the moving party during the trial <em>(Malibou Lake Mountain Club, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>219 Cal.App.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>181, 185 [33 Cal.Rptr. 74]). No such showing was made in the instant case. There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Brown (Gerald), P. J., and Wiener, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied October 11, 1978, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied November 15, 1978.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b879-9\"> Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b879-10\">All citations to code sections are to the Code of Civil Procedure unless otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b879-11\">The debt arose out of a different but related contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b881-8\">Regents cite <em>Loving &amp; Evans </em>v. <em>Blick </em>in support of their contention that affirmative defenses available in \u201cactions\u201d are also available in confirmation proceedings. The case is not authority for this proposition. The defense of setoff cannot be categorized within the five issues permitted by section 1286.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
