We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\n<em>The Bond</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">On March 11, 1971, Fireman\u2019s Fund issued to Liberty National Bank a \u201cBankers Blanket Bond\u201d on its Standard Form No, 24 (revised to April 1969). Under Insuring Agreement (E) of the bond, Fireman\u2019s Fund agreed to indemnify and hold the bank harmless for: \u201cLoss (1) through the Insured\u2019s having in good faith and in the course of business, whether for its own account or for the account of others . . . purchased or otherwise acquired, accepted or received ... or given any value, extended any credit or assumed any liability, on the faith of, or otherwise acted upon, any securities, documents or other written instruments which prove to have been [\u00b6] (a) Counterfeited or forged as to the signature of any maker, drawer, issuer, endorser, assignor . . . or as to the signature of any person signing in any other capacity . . . . [\u00b6] The word \u2018counterfeited\u2019 as used in this Insuring Agreement shall be deemed to mean only an imitation of a security, document or other written instrument, as set forth in (a) above, which is intended to deceive or to be taken for an original.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Section 2(e) of the bond\u2019s \u201cExclusions\u201d provides that \u201cThis Bond Does Not Cover: . . . (e) loss resulting from the complete or partial non-payment of, or default upon, [\u00b6] (1) any loan or transaction in the nature of, or amounting to, a loan made by or obtained from the Insured, or [If] (2) any note, account, agreement or other evidence of debt assigned or sold to, or discounted or otherwise acquired by, the Insured whether procured in good faith or through trick, artifice, fraud or false pretenses unless such loss is covered by Insuring Agreement (A), (D), or (E). . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">\n<em>The Space Data Loan</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">Space Data Sciences Corporation (hereafter Space Data) was engaged in the business of printing technical literature and manuals, providing technical writing and drawing services, and supplying part-time technical personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>On March 5, 1970, the bank entered into an \u201cAccounts Receivable Financing Agreement\u201d with Space Data to secure upon Space Data inventory and accounts receivable, advances to be made by the bank. Under this financing arrangement, whenever Space Data delivered goods or services to its customers it was to send a copy of the purchaser\u2019s invoice to appellant bank which would credit Space Data with loan entitlement in an amount equal to 80 percent of the invoice amount. When Space Data received payments from its customers, it was to prepare a \u201cCollection and Credit Schedule\u201d showing the invoice against which the payment should be credited. The schedule and payments were then sent to the bank, which applied the payments against the outstanding loan balance and eliminated the paid invoices from the collateral base against which the loan was calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">In November 1971, Space Data\u2019s president and principal financial officer informed bank officials that Space Data had discovered a billing error of approximately $180,000. There had been a duplicate billing of $180,000 by Space Data to the Navy Printing and Publications Office which resulted in an overstatement of the actual amount of the accounts receivable assigned to the bank. The bank immediately began an audit of the accounts receivable pledged by Space Data to determine their accuracy and validity. This audit revealed that Space Data had transmitted to the bank several invoices showing amounts due which were not in fact then due and owing. The trial court determined that \u201cthese false accounts receivable fell into three general categories: (1) those created by Space Data and sent to [the] Bank as loan collateral without ever having been transmitted to Space Data\u2019s customers; (2) those submitted for work purportedly completed, [where] in fact such work had only been partially completed; and (3) those invoices in amounts greater [than] those actually billed to Space Data\u2019s customers . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The trial court concluded that invoices submitted to the bank by Space Data which contained false statements but were otherwise genuine were not \u201ccounterfeited\u201d or forged within the meaning of the coverage provided by Insuring Agreement (E) of the bond. Thus, the trial court concluded: \u201cUnder the terms of the Bond, loss to the Bank as a result of the complete or partial nonpayment of any loan is excluded under Exclusion (e) unless coverage is afforded under Insuring Agreements (A), (D) or (E). No claim has been made under Insuring Agreements (A) or (D) by the Bank and there is no coverage under Insuring Agreement (E) and therefore Exclusion (e) applies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>The bank contends that the false invoices of Space Data constituted documents or other written instruments \u201cwhich proved to have been counterfeited\u201d within the meaning of Insuring Clause (E), and that the trial court erred when it determined that the loss was not covered under Clause (E) of the bond. The argument is that the word \u201ccounterfeited\u201d is ambiguous and that any doubts as to its meaning must be resolved against the insurer (see <em>Century Bank </em>v. <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 319, 321 [93 Cal.Rptr. 569, 482 P.2d 193]; <em>New York Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hollender </em>(1951) 38 Cal.2d 73, 81 [237 P.2d 510]). Fireman\u2019s Fund contends that the word \u201ccounterfeited\u201d is not ambiguous and in fact is specifically defined in the policy. It points out that \u201cwhere the terms of the policy are plain and explicit, the court will indulge in no forced construction so as to cast a liability upon the insurance company which it has not assumed.\u201d <em>(New York Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hollender, supra, </em>38 Cal.2d 73 at p. 81; see <em>Aas </em>v. <em>Avemco Ins. Co. </em>(1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 312, 321 [127 Cal.Rptr. 192].)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">In cases involving similar bonds, where the term \u201ccounterfeit\u201d was not specifically defined in the instrument, it has usually been held that the word is not ambiguous and that it means an imitation of an authentic document or writing intended to deceive and to be taken for the original. Fictitious invoices and accounts receivable, such as those involved here, have thus not been considered counterfeit within the meaning of Insuring Clause (E). <em>(Richland Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Federal Insurance Co. </em>(6th Cir. 1974) 494 F.2d 641; <em>Whitney Nat.

Co., supra, </em>213 N.E.2d 191, the bank made loans on the basis of collateral consisting of duplicate certificates of title procured through false representations of fact in applications made by the borrower to the clerk of courts. The court held that clause (E) of the banker\u2019s blanket bond did not provide coverage under such facts. The court stated: \u201cThe majority of courts which have encountered this problem as it applies to fictitious invoices or accounts receivable (in those instances where the signature of the defrauder was genuine) have not considered such documents <em>counterfeit </em>within the meaning of insuring clause (E) of the bond. There appears to be general agreement that the word, \u2018counterfeit,\u2019 <em>as used means an imitation of a genuine document having a resemblance intended to deceive and be taken for the original.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">\u201cFor holdings to this effect generally see: Exchange National Bank of Olean v. Insurance Co. of North America (2d Cir. 1965), 341 F.2d 673; State Bank of Poplar Bluff v. Maryland Casualty Co. (8th Cir., 1961), 289 F.2d 544; First National Bank of Memphis v. Aetna Casualty and Surety Co. (6th Cir., 1962), 309 F.2d 702, cert, denied 372 U.S. 953, 83 S.Ct. 951, 9 L.Ed.2d 977 (1963); United States Fidelity and Guaranty Co. v. First National Bank of Fort Morgan (1961), 147 Colo. 446, 364 P.2d 202; Metropolitan Nat. Bank of Minneapolis v. National Surety Co. (D.C.Minn. 1931), 48 F.2d 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">v.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\u201cWe would again stress that a document or writing is counterfeit if.it is an imitation, i.e., if an attempt has been made to simulate another document which is genuine. However, the certificates of title in this case arise not from imitation, but rather from a false representation of fact to the clerk of courts in the applications filed therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">\u201cIt seems clear to us that the facts show a loss resulting from a default on a loan procured \u2018through trick, artifice, fraud, or false pretenses,\u2019 liability for all of which is expressly excluded under Section I (a) of the bond.\u201d (213 N.E.2d at pp. 196-198. Italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Similarly, in <em>Exchange Nat. Bank of Olean </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of No. Amer., supra, </em>341 F.2d 673, the court held that invoices representing nonexistent transactions were not \u201ccounterfeit\u201d within the meaning of insuring clause (E).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">In the present case, the word \u201ccounterfeited\u201d is specifically defined. Under Insuring Agreement (E), the bond states that \u201cThe word \u2018counterfeited\u2019 . . . shall be deemed to mean only an imitation of a . . . document . . . which is intended to deceive and to be taken for an original.\u201d This definition conforms to the construction given the word \u201ccounterfeited\u201d in the above-cited cases as <em>\u201can imitation of a genuine document having a resemblance intended to deceive and be taken for the original.\u201d (Union Banking Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., supra, </em>213 N.E.2d 191 at p. 196; italics in original.) As the trial court stated in its memorandum of decision: \u201cHere we are not dealing with words that have not been defined. The Insuring Agreement contains a definition of counterfeit in clear and unambiguous language. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\u201cIn the Court\u2019s opinion the invoices were not forged or counterfeited within the meaning of Insuring Clause \u2018E.\u2019 They were signed and issued by the person authorized to sign and issue them. Falsity lies in the representation of facts contained in the invoices and not in the genuineness of their execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\u201cIn the opinion of the Court the invoices fall within the provisions of Exclusion (e).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The determination of the trial court is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">Caldecott, P.
