Case continued ... for . . . possible dismissal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">\u201cPeople feel the defendant should be on probation and the People are prepared to go to jury trial. Court ordered case continued to 2/14/77 [five months later] at 2:00 P.M. for possible dismissal if no further violation by the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">\u201cCourt indicates that pursuant to the pre-trial conference discussions he will continue this case for one year for possible dismissal if defendant . . . is not involved in any other illegal acts. Case continued to 1/11/78 at 1:30 p.m. for possible dismissal. . . Mr. Courteau [the prosecutor] states . . . that the People are not a part of the disposition indicated and disagreed with the same at the pre-trial conference and feel it an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion; . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-12\">\u201cMatter having been discussed in chambers by court and counsel, court states he is prepared to continue the case six months for dismissal on condition the defendant does not contact the victim, . . . and conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>himself in a law-abiding fashion throughout the probationary period. Time waived. People state they would like the record to reflect their objection to this disposition. Case continued to 2/23/77 at 1:30 p.m. for possible dismissal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">Robert Michael Gelardi, the real party in interest of this appeal, was charged in the Municipal Court with the misdemeanor violation of Penal Code section 417, to wit, brandishing a weapon. Following its above described practice and over the People\u2019s objection, the court continued the case six months for \u201cpossible dismissal.\u201d Thereafter, before dismissal and within the six-month period, the People sought to nullify the court\u2019s \u201cillegal action\u201d by petition to the superior court \u201cfor a Writ of Prohibition and/or Mandate . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The superior court ordered the writ application denied, apparently on the theory that the People\u2019s only remedy lay in an appeal, under Penal Code section 1466, subdivision 1(a), from the contemplated order of dismissal, when and if entered. The People have appealed from the order denying the extraordinary writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">It is of significance, as will hereafter appear, (1) that the order of \u201ccontinuance for dismissal\u201d was made before the court had entered upon <em>a trial </em>of the charge against Gelardi, and (2) that such an order of continuance is not an <em>appealable order. </em>(See Pen. Code, \u00a7 1466, subd. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">As he did in the superior court, Gelardi here contends, relying on <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Howard), 69 </em>Cal.2d 491 [72 Cal.Rptr. 330, 446 P.2d 138], that the writ of prohibition or mandate was not legally available to the People for review of the Municipal Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Howard), supra, </em>a jury had found Howard guilty of robbery. Thereafter the trial court, finding the evidence, of guilt to be of little weight, dismissed the information in the \u201cinterests of justice\u201d as was, at least arguably, permitted by Penal Code section 1385. The People sought from the high court a writ of mandate compelling the trial court to vacate its order of dismissal. The application was denied, and the court\u2019s reasons therefor may be summarized in this manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-9\">\u201cThe Legislature has determined that except under certain limited circumstances the People shall have no right of appeal in criminal cases.\u201d (69 Cal.2d, p. 497.) \u201cThe restriction on the People\u2019s right to appeal is not merely a procedural limitation allocating appellate review between direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>appeals and extraordinary writs but is a substantive limitation on review of trial court determinations in criminal trials.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>p. 498.) \u201cTo permit the People to resort to an extraordinary writ to review where there is no right to appeal would be to give the People the very appeal which the Legislature has denied to them.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>p. 499.) \u201cAssuming that in some cases the matter may be of such importance that mandate may be available to the People to review determinations where appeal does not lie, we are satisfied that the proper balancing of these considerations prohibits review by mandate at the request of the People where, as here, there is a danger of further trial or retrial. Such a rule will give meaningful effect to the legislative policy limiting review and the burdens on the defendant. [Certain earlier cases] which permitted the issuance of mandate where there was a danger of retrial, are disapproved.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>p. 501.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">It is worthy of emphasis here that <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Howard), supra, </em>69 Cal.2d 491, forbade proceedings by the People for extraordinary writs <em>only </em>where \u201cthere is a danger of further trial or retrial.\u201d In the case at bench there had been neither trial nor jeopardy, nor would invalidation of the Municipal Court\u2019s order result in \u201cfurther trial or retrial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Edmonds), 4 </em>Cal.3d 605, 609 [94 Cal.Rptr. 250, 483 P.2d 1202], thereafter held in a case where there was no danger of \u201cfurther trial or retrial,\u201d that \u201cmandate [on request of the People] would be appropriate under the principles set forth in <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court [Howard),. . </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">We find further elaboration of the rule of <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Howard) </em>in decisions of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Lozano), </em>69 Cal.App.3d 57, 62 [137 Cal.Rptr. 767]. \u201cMoreover, in our view <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Howard) </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 491 . . . does not foreclose to the People review by writ in all cases in which there was no remedy by appeal. . . . [Since] in the instant case the order was made before there was any trial and therefore jeopardy had not attached,\u201d an extraordinary writ was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Brodie), </em>48 Cal.App.3d 195 [121 Cal.Rptr. 732]. Here the reviewing court, on motion of the People and before trial, granted a writ of mandate requiring the superior court to set aside a pretrial order striking \u201can allegation of special circumstance\u201d from an information charging murder. The court said (pp. 200-201): \u201cWhen a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>trial judge strikes out such an allegation solely because of a misinterpretation of the statute, its order is in excess of its jurisdiction. (See <em>Howard, supra, </em>69 Cal.2d at p. 500.) In the case at bench, considering the gravity of the charge, the importance of the issue and the absence of any showing of prejudice by the delay involved in the review procedure, a weighing of the factors referred to in the <em>Howard </em>opinion does not preclude review by this mandate proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Montano), 26 </em>Cal.App.3d 668, 670, 671 [102 Cal.Rptr. 925]. The court granted mandate compelling the superior court to set aside a pretrial order of dismissal which order, it concluded, would \u201c \u2018stultify the statutory scheme ....\u201d\u2019 Finding the case \u201cunlike <em>Howard,\u201d </em>and the dismissal to be \u201cbeyond the court\u2019s [statutory] power,\u201d it stated that \u201c[s]ince there is no danger of [further] trial or retrial, the writ of mandate may properly issue to correct an abuse of discretion . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Biggs), </em>19 Cal.App.3d 522 [97 Cal.Rptr. 118]. The People\u2019s application for prohibition to set aside an erroneous dismissal was denied, but only because the dismissal was ordered by the superior court <em>after commencement of trial </em>of the action. The court said (p. 535): \u201c[A]s we view <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Howard), supra, </em>the absence of a statutory prosecution appeal expresses a legislative policy against exposing the accused to a possible retrial, even though the policy transmutes an erroneous trial court ruling into an erroneous dismissal. This court is without power to issue the writ of prohibition because the writ would expose the accused to a possible retrial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>10 Cal.App.3d 129 [88 Cal.Rptr. 753]. Finding no danger of \u201ca further trial or retrial\u201d the appellate court, after a thorough analysis of <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Howard), supra, </em>69 Cal.2d 491 \u201clet a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the [superior court] to annul its order . . . which set aside the guilty plea\u201d without statutory sanction. (P. 138.)</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Notable also are the several judicial comments that extraordinary writs will more readily be granted on the People\u2019s request where, as here: there is no prosecutorial \u201charassment\u201d of the accused (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.3d 129, 137); the issue does not \u201cinvolve any question of guilt or innocence\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Lozano), supra, </em>69 Cal.App.3d 57, 62); and the case is of \u201csignificant public interest\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Lozano), supra, </em>p. 62; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Montano), supra, </em>p. 670).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>It will be observed from the foregoing that mandate or prohibition may be allowed, before trial of an accused and on the People\u2019s application, to rectify such \u201cexcess of jurisdiction\u201d of the trial court \u201cbecause of a misinterpretation of the statute\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Brodie), supra, </em>48 Cal.App.3d 195, 200-201), or \u201cfailure to follow a decision by the Court of Appeal directly in point\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Lozano), supra, </em>69 Cal.App.3d 57, 61), or a ruling prohibited, or unauthorized, by statute <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Montano), supra, </em>26 Cal.App.3d 668, 671; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Biggs), supra, </em>19 Cal.App.3d 522, 534-535), or an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d in vacating a guilty plea <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.3d 129, 137).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Patently, the here discussed practice of the Municipal Court is designed to effectuate a sort of nonstatutory diversion, probation, or rehabilitation procedure prior to the accused\u2019s conviction of crime, by holding out to him the promise of dismissal under Penal Code section 1385 upon his future good behavior. On this subject the state\u2019s Legislature and reviewing courts have spoken.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Orin, </em>13 Cal.3d 937, 946-947 [120 Cal.Rptr. 65, 533 P.2d 193], states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">\u201c[AJppellate courts have shown considerable opposition to the granting of dismissals under section 1385 in instances where the People are thereby prevented from prosecuting defendants for offenses of which there is probable cause to believe they are guilty as charged. Courts have recognized that society, represented by the People, has a legitimate interest in \u2018the fair prosecution of crimes properly alleged.\u2019 . . . \u2018 \u201c[A] dismissal which arbitrarily cuts those rights without a showing of detriment to the defendant is an abuse of discretion.\u201d . . .\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">\u201cPermitting trial judges to make liberal use of section 1385 to avoid criminal prosecutions where probable cause exists to believe conviction is warranted would be contrary to the adversary nature of our criminal procedure as prescribed by the Legislature. . . . Under the statutory scheme which has been established for the prosecution of crimes, the district attorney is required to \u2018institute proceedings before magistrates for the arrest of persons charged with or reasonably suspected of public offenses when he has information that such offenses have been commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>ted.\u2019 (Gov. Code, \u00a7 26501.) The committing magistrate <em>must </em>hold the defendant to answer \u2018if there is some rational ground for assuming the possibility that an offense has been committed and the accused is guilty of it.\u2019 . . . Under ordinary circumstances, it would frustrate the orderly and effective operation of our criminal procedure as envisioned by the Legislature if without proper and adequate reason section 1385 were used to terminate the prosecution of defendants for crimes properly charged in accordance with legal procedure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">In the same vein <em>People </em>v. <em>McAlonan, 22 </em>Cal.App.3d 982, 986-987 [99 Cal.Rptr. 733], tells us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">\u201cSince an order of dismissal under Penal Code section 1385 is a matter of public concern . . . , proper dismissal under the section' requires a balancing of society\u2019s interest against that of the defendant. Sincere though an individual judge\u2019s belief may be that a guilty defendant\u2019s rehabilitation would be facilitated by avoiding conviction, we are convinced society\u2019s interest that justice be dispensed with an even hand and in accordance with statutory authority precludes use of the dismissal statute to avoid conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">\u201cAfter conviction, the Legislature has wisely provided judges with alternatives which they may properly consider in the sentencing process. As to the crime with which defendant was charged, these alternatives are set forth in Health and Safety Code sections 11530 and 11710 et seq. Among other things, these statutes are concerned with rehabilitation and the limits within which courts may properly act to effect it. Under the circumstances of this case, we are convinced the dismissal provisions of Penal Code section 1385 cannot be used for rehabilitative purposes. To hold otherwise would completely stultify the statutory scheme and would exalt the rule of men above the rule of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">And expressly and immediately bearing upon the <em>continuances </em>with which we are concerned, Penal Code section 1050 asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">\u201cThe welfare of the people of the State of California requires that all proceedings in criminal cases shall be set for trial and heard and determined at the earliest possible time. To this end the Legislature finds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>that the criminal courts are becoming increasingly congested with resulting adverse consequences to the welfare of the people and the defendant. It is therefore recognized that both the people and the defendant have the right to an expeditious disposition, and to that end it shall be the duty of all courts and judicial officers and of all counsel, both the prosecution and the defense, to expedite such proceedings to the greatest degree that is consistent with the ends of justice. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-4\">\u201cTo continue any hearing in a criminal proceeding, including the trial, a written notice must be filed within two court days of the hearing sought to be continued, together with affidavits or declarations detailing specific facts showing that <em>a </em>continuance is necessary, unless the court for good cause entertains an oral motion for continuance. Continuances shall be granted only upon a showing of good cause. The convenience of the parties is not in and of itself good cause. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Another legislative consideration is noted. The high court in <em>In re Lane, </em>58 Cal.2d 99, 102 [22 Cal.Rptr. 857, 372 P.2d 897], stated: \u201cWhenever the Legislature has seen fit to adopt a general scheme for the regulation of a particular subject, the entire control over whatever phases of the subject are covered by state legislation ceases as far as local legislation is concerned.\u201d In this state the Legislature has formulated statutory schemes for diversion (see Pen. Code, \u00a7 1000 et seq.), probation, and rehabilitation of the criminally inclined or involved. Although <em>In re Lane </em>applies to \u201clocal legislation,\u201d its rationale would seem to apply reasonably and equally to trial courts; they should not substitute their own rehabilitation concepts for those of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">In adopting and following the judicial practice at issue, we conclude that the Municipal Court has made rulings prohibited, or unauthorized, by statute (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Montano), supra, </em>26 Cal.App.3d 668, 671; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Biggs), supra, </em>19 Cal.App.3d 522, 534-535; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.3d 129, 137), and has failed \u201cto follow a decision by [the Supreme Court and by] the Court of Appeal directly in point\u201d (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Lozano), supra, </em>69 Cal.App.3d 57, 61). The practice was thus in excess of the Municipal Court\u2019s jurisdiction. The superior court should have permitted, and ruled favorably upon, the People\u2019s application for an extraordinary writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">We observe nothing in the Penal Code\u2019s newly enacted (eff. Sept. 13, 1977) chapter 2.7, sections 1001-1001.11, entitled \u201cDiversion,\u201d which authorizes the above described \u201ccontinuance,\u201d \u201cdismissal,\u201d and \u201crehabil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>itation\u201d procedures. Further, those statutes were not in effect at the time of the criticized orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">The judgment is reversed, and the superior court will issue an appropriate peremptory writ as requested by the People.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Racanelli, P.
