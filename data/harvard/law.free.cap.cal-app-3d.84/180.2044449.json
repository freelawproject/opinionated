Brown appeals the denial of her petition for a writ of prohibition to restrain the San Diego Municipal Court from retiying her on a charge of driving under the influence of alcohol (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23102, subd. (a)). An earlier trial resulted in a mistrial after a hung juiy.  She contends Penal Code sections 1140, 1141, 1150 and 1151, requiring unanimous acquittal, violate the United States and California Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">Brown states she does not base her petition on double jeopardy grounds. She argues the necessity of unanimity for conviction (see <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>406 U.S. 356 [32 L.Ed.2d 152, 92 S.Ct. 1620]) does not mean unanimity for acquittal is necessary and due process does not require a unanimous verdict for acquittal. She further argues an acquittal rather than a mistrial is the proper remedy for less than unanimous jury verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>In <em>People </em>v. <em>Troche, </em>206 Cal. 35, 43 [273 P. 767], the court stated: \u201cJuries at the common law were not always the same, but, through changing conditions and gradual development, it came about that a jury for the trial of a cause was established to be a \u2018body of twelve men, . . . who, after hearing the parties and their evidence, a\u00f1d receiving the instructions of the court relative . . . and deliberating, . . . must return their unanimous verdict upon the issues submitted to them.\u2019 [Citations.] To the same effect . . . was the first definition of a trial jury adopted by the legislature in this state. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">The <em>Troche </em>court went on to point out the definition of a jury remains the same other than striking \u201cunanimous\u201d which was done \u201cto permit of a verdict by three-fourths of the jury in civil cases\u201d and substituting \u201cpersons\u201d for \u201cmen.\u201d This is the guarantee in the federal and state Constitutions <em>(id., </em>at p. 44) as established by common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The sections of the United States and California Constitutions cited by Brown neither express nor imply a defendant has the right to be acquitted of a crime when a jury disagrees. The practice of discharging a hung jury and declaring a mistrial in a criminal case is long-established in United States and California courts. The jury\u2019s inability to reach a verdict is recognized as a reason for retrial by the Supreme Court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579 [6 L.Ed. 165] and more recently in <em>Brock </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>344 U.S. 424 [97 L.Ed. 456, 73 S.Ct. 349]). California courts adhere to the same view <em>(People </em>v. <em>Doolittle, </em>23 Cal.App.3d 14, 22 <em>[99 Cal.Rptr. </em>810]).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Brown\u2019s second contention that retrials are coercive and violate constitutional rights of due process is unmeritorious. In no way is a retrial a device to compel a verdict other than in the sense any trial is a device to compel a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">A new trial may, of course, be limited in issues if it takes place after a case has been tried once. A retrial denotes only that a case has been tried before and does not change any of the defendant\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">Where a jury fails to agree on a verdict it is the same \u201cas if there had been no trial on that issue\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Messerly, </em>46 Cal.App.2d 718, 721 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>[116 P.2d 781]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Doolittle, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.3d 14, 18). The case may be reset for trial <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ham, </em>7 Cal.App.3d 768, 775 [86 Cal.Rptr. 906]).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b163-12\">Before Brown (Gerald), P.
