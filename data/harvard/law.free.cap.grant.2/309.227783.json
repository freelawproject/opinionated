Hecksher was to ship the coal at Schuylkill Haven, by Reading Railroad to Reading, for Wright, to Wright\u2019s consignee, to be named thereafter.

Part was still in the shutes when the sheriff levied on the coal. Frees &amp; Mull paid the freight on the coal, and for the use of the shutes, to the Reading Railroad Company. Wright had also purchased coal from McDonald \u2014 that was brought down the Reading railroad about the same time \u2014 that was also in the care of Frees &amp; Mull, and dumped into the same shutes. McDonald\u2019s coal and Hecksher\u2019s were mixed. Hecksher had nothing to do with the shutes into which the coal was dumped, neither with the wharf, to which a part was taken, nor was he to pay any freight, after the coal left Schuylkill Haven. When the contract was made, no other place where the coal was to be sent, was named than Reading, to a firm to be named thereafter. Hecksher knew not what was to be done with the coal after it reached Frees &amp; Mull, at Reading, other than what he may have learned from Wright\u2019s letter of the 21st of February, 1852.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-8\">About the 8th or 9th of March, 1852, Wright had four wagon-loads of coal hauled from Frees &amp; Mull\u2019s wharf to Lebanon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-9\">On the 2d of April, 1852, Jacob Light entered up judgment in Berks county, against Wright, and issued a <em>fi. fa. </em>on the same day, which <em>fi. fa. </em>came to the sheriff\u2019s hands at ten minutes before ten o\u2019clock, A.

Some of the Hecksher coal arrived at Reading on the 2d, 3d, 5th and 6th of April \u2014 this coal was also dumped into the shutes marked Frees &amp; Mull, with the exception, perhaps, of three, four, five or six cars of coal; being probably the cars that came down on the 6th of April.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-10\">On the 7th of April, 1852, Mr. Strong, with Hecksher, and for him, gave notice to the agent of the railroad, where part of the coal still remained, that he claimed the coal for Hecksher, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>as his \u2014 he gave the same notice to the sheriff, and also to Frees &amp; Mull, as to all the coal at the railroad and on the wharf.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-6\">On the 9th of April, Light gave his bond of indemnity to the sheriff, and on the 19th of April, 1852, the sheriff sold the lot of coal on the wharf to Jacob Light for $700, and the lot at the railroad to Frees &amp; Mull for $300.

Light was already indorser and bail for Wright, in the Lebanon and Harrisburg Banks, and to others, exceeding $2000, being embarassed and pressed by a creditor. In January or February, 1852, in conference with that creditor\u2019s attorney, he informed him that he had bought, or could, or intended to buy coal, convert it into money and pay off. The attorney gave him time, but finding he could get nothing, brought suit the 2d of February, 1852. The 12th of February, 1852, Wright entered into a contract for 250 tons of white ash lump coal with Hecksher. The cost of the coal was to be $2, at Schuylkill Haven, then it was to be sent to Reading. 18th of February, Light indorsed a note in the Lebanon Bank for Wright for $1000, discounted. On the 20th of February, 1852, Wright saw Frees &amp; Mull and arranged for the reception of the coal. February 21, 1852, letter from Wright to Hecksher, announcing that Frees &amp; Mull would receive the coal at Reading. February 23, 1852, letter, Wright to Mull &amp; Frees, that Hecksher would send 400 tons. March 3, 1852, Light indorsed two notes for $1052. On the 6th of March, 1852, ordered Patton that the coal be shipped to him as quick as possible, and same day wrote to Hecksher.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-6\">\u201c Letter on the 8th of March, Wright to Frees &amp; Mull, sending four teams with flour, and they to bring back coal. On the 9th of March, 1852, coal began to be delivered, and was delivered from day to day to 6th of April. March 23,1852, letter from Wright to Hecksher to send six or eight ears a day \u2014 disappointed \u2014 could make a good arrangement if he could get the coal now. About 1st of April, sale of the personal estate of Wright in Lebanon county, bought mostly by Light and Wengert. Wright went on as before, retaining possession in the name of Light and Wengert. A few days before the 2d of April, Wright tells Mr. Barclay that a judgment bond would be sent from Kline and Weidman, where the property was to be levied, at the wharf and at the railroad. Instructed Barclay as to the value of the coal, acting as agent apparently of Light.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-7\">\u2022 \u201c April 1, 1852, Wright gave judgment to Light for $1990. Entered 2d of April. Same day another judgment for $199, entered April 1st. Same day another judgment for $2686, entered April 1st. Same day he gave a judgment to Light and Wengert for $497. Wright was clearly insolvent it is evident. April 2d, 1852, levy in Berks county, at the suit of <em>Light </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>and Light indemnified the sheriff. April 9th, letter from Wright to Hecksher, not to send more coal \u2014 professed friends were tearing him to pieces \u2014 come after him like the hawks of destruction. April 9th, same kind of letter to Frees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>&amp; Mull. April 19th, sheriff\u2019s sale in Berks county. Wright at the sale. Light buys the coal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-6\">\u201c 1. Frees &amp; Mull were certainly designated by Wright\u2019s letter of the 21st of February, 1852, to Hecksher, as his agents, for such purposes as are mentioned in that letter, and in the counterpart agreement of the 12th of February, 1852, signed by Hecksher. Hecksher was to send 250 tons of coal to Reading, (agreement of 12th of February, 1852, signed by Jonathan Wright,) and by agreement signed by Hecksher, to be sent to Reading by railroad for Jonathan Wright, to a firm to be given us by him. Frees &amp; Mull being indicated, Patton says he sent the coal mentioned in the tickets, to Frees &amp; Mull, Reading, on account of Jonathan Wright.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-7\">\u201cIt is a question of fact, whether Frees &amp; Mull were the agents of Jonathan Wright, and for what purposes. They seem to have been agents of Jonathan Wright to receive the coal at Reading, though as a fact in the cause it is for the jury. They do not seem to have been the agents of Hecksher.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-8\">\u201c2. A delivery.of the coal to Frees &amp; Mull, in Reading, as tb.e agents of Jonathan Wright, would be in law a delivery to Jonathan Wright, if they so far represented him, as to make a delivery to them a full, effectual and final delivery to Wright, as contra-distinguished from a delivery to them acting as a mere medium of transit towards Wright. Cross on Liens, 372.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-9\">\u201c If the transit is once at an end the delivery is complete, and the transit cannot commence again, merely because the 'goods are again sent to a new and ulterior destination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-10\">\u201cWhen by arrangement an intermediate delivery occurs, before the goods reach their ultimate destination, it is to be enquired whether the party to whom they are so delivered is invested with power to receive them and to alter their destination, or is a mere agent to see them forwarded, agreeably to original directions. If clothed with a general and unlimited power, in this respect, the transit ends when goods reach his hands, as between vendor and vendee ; this is the ulterior- delivery in view as between them. It is an actual delivery, not constructive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-11\">\u201cWhen goods are ordered to be forwarded to A. at X. for the purpose of being shipped to Y., it has been held that at X. they had so far got to the end of their journey, for they then required new orders to put them again in motion, or they must otherwise continue stationary. It is in the option of the vendee to send them where he thinks proper. Cross on Liens, 373.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-12\">\u201c These coals were sent from Hecksher to Frees &amp; Mull, at Reading, on account of Jonathan Wright.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-13\">\u201cIf an agent be clothed only with specified and limited authority to forward goods to a particular destination, the <em>transitus </em>is not at an end till the goods have reached the place,\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>named by tbe buyer to tbe seller, as such destination. Cross on Liens, 736, 737.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-6\">\u201c3. The coal was certainly in possession of Frees &amp; Mull, when it was taken to their wharf, and it may be said, that so even was the coal in the shutes under the special arrangement with the company for the use of their shutes for that coal. The shutes, under that arrangement, were the same as the yard, so far as manual possession of the coal went.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-7\">\u201c The question still recurs, what was the nature of that possession ? That has been brought to your attention under number 2.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-8\">\u201c 4. That depends on the right to stop <em>in transitu. </em>If Hecksher had that right to stop <em>in transitu, </em>that is, if the delivery to Frees &amp; Mull, was not final, but a delivery <em>in transitu, </em>he may maintain his action of trespass against the sheriff for selling his goods; if he had not that right, the goods would not have been his, and his action would fail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-9\">\u201c 5. This point goes to the foundation of this action. We will not say that the action cannot be sustained. The alleged right of stoppage cannot be defeated by any claim against the consignee, whether by process against the consignee, or the carriers\u2019 claim to a general lien for ^alance due him from consignee, for the seller\u2019s power of intercepting the goods is the older and preferable claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-10\">\u201c 6. This proposition is unquestionably true. The ease in 9 Harris goes to that extent, apparently, and, if it b\u00e9 not presumption in us to express satisfaction with a decision of the Supreme Court, as we think, most wisely.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-11\">\u201c The question of fraud is put on the ground of fraudulent combination between Wright and Light, to get this coal from Hecksher, and into their possession, which, if it were so, would avoid the sale. The single-handed rascality of Wright in knowing of his insolvency when he bought, and intending not to pay for the coal, if such be the fact, would not avoid the sale; there must have been an artifice intended and fitted to deceive Hecksher.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-12\">\u201c 7. Whether the right of stoppage <em>in transitu </em>be gone in this case or not, is for the jury to say, applying the law already given them to the facts of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-13\">\u201cIf the jury should find for the plaintiff, either on the ground of fraud of Wright and Light, or that the coal was <em>in transitu </em>at the 'time of the levy, they will ascertain what quantity of coal was levied and sold, and give its value with interest from the sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-14\">\u201c If the jury find against the plaintiff, on either ground of fraud or <em>transitus, </em>they will then ascertain how much coal was sold, that was not levied, and give its value and interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>\u201cTo this charge the plaintiff and defendant excepted, and at the request of each party, the same was written out, sealed and filed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-6\">The admission of evidence, to prove a fraudulent combination between Jacob Eight and Jonathan Wright, to get Eichard Heeksher\u2019s coal into their possession, to affect the sheriff, and the charge of the court, were the errors assigned.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b316-7\"><em>Smith, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATG\">\u2014 The action was trespass against the sheriff, for taking and selling the plaintiff\u2019s coal, who had sold it to Wright. The sheriff justified under a judgment and execution in favor of <em>Light </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>in a court of competent jurisdiction. The judgment and execution were legal and valid, and in full force, at the time of the sale. The court permitted evidence to be given to show a fraudulent combination between Light and Wright. That the judgment and execution were fraudulent, and therefore did not justify the sheriff. Where a court has jurisdiction, it is sufficient to justify the officer executing its process; for the officer is not bound to examine into the validity of its proceedings, or the regularity of its process. <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Shed, </em>10 Johns. 138; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Bateman, </em>1 Strange, 711; <em>Marshalseza\u2019s Case, </em>10 Coke, 76. Where a judgment is vacated or set aside, trespass may then be brought against the plaintiff, but the sheriff who executed the execution is excused. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Folgate, </em>1 Levins, 95; <em>Perkin </em>v. <em>Proctor and Grreen, </em>2 Wilson, 385; Buller, Nisi Prius, 84; opinion of Sergeant, J., in <em>Day </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>4 Wharton, 341.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-8\"><em>As to the charge of the court. </em>\u2014 Whatever Wright may have said, written, or done, there was no evidence to implicate Light in any fraud, or that had a tendency to prove him in combination with Wright, to defraud Hecksher.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-9\">The execution was a lien on all the personal property of defendant. 3 W. &amp; S. 440. The <em>transitus </em>of the goods, and consequently the right of stoppage is determined by actual delivery to the vendee, or by circumstances which are equivalent thereto. 2 Kent, Com. 543; 7 Barr, 303. Eogers, J. It will continue until the place of delivery be, in fact, the end of the journey of the goods, and they have arrived to the possession or under the direction of the vendee himself. 2 Kent, Com. 544. If they were landed at the wharf, where the goods of the vendee were usually landed and kept, the <em>transitus </em>was at an end, and the right of stoppage gone. Ib.; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Lawes, </em>4 Esp. 82. Eor which a number of cases are cited. The point of inquiry is, whether the property is to be considered as still in its transit; for if it has once fairly arrived at its destination, so as to give the vendee the actual exercise of dominion and ownership over it, the right is gone. 2 Kent, Com. 545; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Lawes, </em>4 Esp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>82. This last case also shows, that a delivery at the vendee\u2019s place of abode, is not necessary; it is sufficient that he has exercised some act of ownership over the goods. A complete delivery of part of an entire parcel or cargo, terminates the <em>transitus, </em>and the vendor cannot stop the remainder. 2 Kent, Com. 545, 546; 2 H. Blackstone, 504; 4 Bos. &amp; Pull. 69; 6 East, 627. A delivery of the key of the vendor\u2019s warehouse to the purchaser, or paying the vendor rent for the goods left in his warehouse, or lodging an order from the vendor, for delivery with the keeper of the warehouse; or delivering to the vendee a bill of parcels with an order on the storekeeper for delivery .of the goods. <em>Coates </em>v. <em>Railton, </em>13 Eng.

If the purchase of the coal was fraudulent, then neither the title of Hecksher, nor his possession, was ever divested, and trespass would lie.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-6\">2.'If even the possession of Hecksher was divested, and his right to stop the goods <em>in transitu </em>remained, and he did stop them on the 7th of April, 1852, his possession was then restored; at all events, he had an immediate right of possession, which was sufficient to enable him to maintain trespass.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-7\">These were facts to be found by the jury. How could the court say trespass would not lie ? That the sheriff had levied on the 2d.of April, before the coal was stopped <em>in transitu, </em>on the 7th, is immaterial. The right of stoppage is superior to any lien of any third party against the purchaser. It is anterior and paramount to it. 2 Kent, Com. 541, 2d ed.; <em>Merrel </em>v. <em>Rankin, </em>1 Bald. 528; <em>Hays </em>v. <em>Mouille, 2 </em>Har. 48; <em>Lelar </em>v. <em>Brome, 2 </em>H. 217; <em>Gibbs </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>10 Mass. 128; 1 Met. 31; 5 Cow. 735; <em>Wintringham </em>v. <em>Lafoy, </em>8 Wend. 610; Cross on Liens, 372-377; 2 Kent, Com. 540, <em>et seq.; Whitehead </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>9 Mees, <em>&amp; </em>W. 534; 15 Wend. 137; <em>Naylor </em>v. <em>Dennie, </em>8 Pick. 198.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-8\"><em>Covell </em>v. <em>Hitchcock, </em>23 Wend. 611. \u201c The right of stoppage continues while the goods remain in the hands of a warehouseman, <em>though at the place to which they were directed to be sent, if that be an intermediate point between the place of sale and the ultimate destination of the goods.\u201d </em>20 Wend. 167; 5 Denio, 629; <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Moss, 5 </em>Wharton, 189; <em>Donath </em>v. <em>Bloomfield, </em>7 Barr, 301; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Mercein, </em>1 Ash. 103.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b318-10\">The opinion of the court was delivered August 14th, 1855, by</p>\n<author id=\"b318-11\">Lowrie, J.</author>\n<p id=\"APE\">\u2014 This cause was so thoroughly tried in the Common Pleas, and its principles are so fully and accurately presented in the charge of the learned president of that court, that we can scarcely speak of the points discussed without repeating what was rightly said before the cause came here.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">The sheriff\u2019s justification' depended upon the validity of Wright\u2019s title; and very certainly, the fraud used by him in trying to get it was an important test of its validity. The conspiracy between Wright and Light did not affect the judgment given by one to tbe other, but it helped to make out the fraud of Wright in his bargain with Hecksher. The judgment and execution remain valid, but they give no authority to seize Hecksher\u2019s property, and therefore were no'lien upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-13\">There is some room for a difference of opinion upon the facts that raise the question of the right of stoppage <em>in transitu; </em>but the principles on which the decision of the right was submitted to the jury, are entirely correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-14\">The finding of the jury on the foregoing points is, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>title was still in Heeksher, and that Wright had not even a possession to justify the sheriff\u2019s seizure; and it follows, of course, that his seizure was a trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
