Viewers were appointed, performed their duty, made their report, awarding the plaintiffs in error $1500, which report was confirmed, and judgment entered thereon, December 23, 1854. <em>Fi. fa. </em>was issued to December Term, 1854, and returned <em>nulla bona. Alias fi. fa. </em>was issued to March Term, 1855, and levy made on personal property of defendants. January 9, 1855, at the instance of defendants, a rule was granted to show cause why the <em>alias fi. fa. </em>should not be set aside for the following reasons, to wit :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-14\">That a confirmation of the view and damages does not entitle the said Neal and others, to issue execution against said railroad company, until they signify their intention of taking possession of the land; and they have not signified their intention, nor have they occupied the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-15\">Further, that it is not necessary for the said president, directors and company, to enter in and upon, and occupy, for the purpose of making said railroad, any land upon which part of the same may be located, belonging to, or claimed by the said Neal and others, the present defendants. That the said railroad company has not finally decided upon the route of said road, and they now do, and have for some time past, contem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>plated and designed a change of the location, which would not in any way touch or interfere with the land of the defendants ; and refer to the deposition filed, and the resolution of the board of directors of the 4th of December, 1854.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-5\">On the argument of the rule, the affidavit <em>{exparte) </em>of O. W. Barnes, chief engineer, was read by the defendants in error, setting forth, <em>inter </em>alia, that the route of said railroad through the lands of the plaintiffs, had not been adopted by the board of directors, as the route for the finalloeation of said road, and that said route had not, at any time, been recommended by him, as chief engineer, as the line of final location. That the application for the appointment of viewers was made for the purpose of ascertaining the relative land damages of the present and other routes examined, and under the consideration of the board of directors. And that it was not now (then) the intention of the board \u201c to enter upon and occupy, for the purpose of making said railroad, any lands upon which the said route was located.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-6\">In connection with the foregoing affidavit, a certified copy of a resolution of the board of directors was read, authorizing the president and chief engineer of the company to negotiate with the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, on the subject of a connection with that road at Turtle Creek.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-7\">After argument, the rule to show cause was made absolute, and <em>alias fi. fa. </em>set aside, which is the error here complained of.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b138-8\"><em>Geo.

Wilkins </em>and <em>Sewell, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b138-10\">The opinion of the court was delivered, January 10,1856, by</p>\n<author id=\"b138-11\">Lowrie, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Avv\">\u2014 Though railroad companies may make experimental surveys at pleasure, before finally locating their route; yet, certainly it has never been granted to them to have'experimental suits at law, as a means of chaffering with the landowners for the cheapest route.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">So soon as the company locate their road, and have made an effort to agree with the landowner, and not before, the process may be commenced by either party, for ascertaining the damages; and when they have been ascertained, by report, and judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>thereon, the judgment settles the right of the landowner to such damages, just as completely as any other judgment, and he has just the same right to execution upon it. He is not to wait until the company say they are ready to go on, else all improvements by the owners of property along such a route, must be indefinitely suspended .upon a contingent appropriation. If judgments are to be the end of strife, they must bind both parties; and the power of taking any man\u2019s land is exhausted by a location which it is too weak to retain; it cannot be indulged with another choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Here the petition to settle the damages, is filed by the company, and they say that they have located their road over the land for which these damages are assessed. A report having been made and judgment entered thereon, it is a final judgment, entitling the party to execution. If the company have any equitable ground of relief, they must present it in some other form, than a mere motion to set aside a regular execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The order setting aside the execution in this case is reversed, and the plaintiffs in error have leave to proceed on their judgment, and the record is remitted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
