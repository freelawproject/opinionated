On the 8th of January, Alexander McKee, agreed to sell T. J. Coleman (who afterwards assigned to Demarest) three acres of land for $2400, $400 of which was to be paid in cash, and $2000 in the stock of the Chartiers Coal Company. The debt was presently payable. The coal company failed, and Demarest purchased all its property at sheriff\u2019s sale, and its stock became worthless; after which the' company closed operations, March 1st, 1854. About \u25a0August, 1855, Demarest tendered to McKee the money and stock mentioned in the contract \u2014 the consideration of the land\u2014 and demanded ' a deed. The court, Williams, J., directed a verdict for defendant; whereupon this writ of error was taken, and the entry of judgment complained of as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b249-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number><em>Hamilton, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AklJ\">referred to 10 Watts, 387; 1 Jones, 510; 1 W. &amp; S. 554; 1 Seld. 229; 2 Bos. &amp; P. 238; 2 M. &amp; S. 288; 2 Bl.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGK4\">\u2014 Without admitting, we may assume that there is here a contract of sale that equity would enforce, if properly performed by the party asking its enforcement; and that it might, in such circumstances, be set up as title against the vendor\u2019s right of distress under a former lease; and this brings us to the question, would equity enforce the contract under this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">It was made in December, 1853, and the chief consideration was $2000 in stock of the Chartiers Coal Company. No time was fixed for payment, and therefore it was payable presently; yet payment was not offered until August, 1855. In the meantime, the coal company had totally failed, and all its effects had been sold out by the sheriff, and the plaintiff became the purchas\u00e9r, and thus the stock had become utterly valueless. This was such a change of the circumstances existing at the time of the contract, as makes the plaintiff\u2019s delay matter of essential importance in equity. The plaintiff held on to his stock, and to the advantages to be gained from it, and from his power as the holder of it, until it became worthless, and then he tendered it. If the company was failing, he ought to have transferred the stock promptly, and then the defendant might have used the corporate power which it conferred, so as to save the company, and his own investment, from the threatened wreck. The contract furnishes no ground of equitable defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">Judgment affirmed and record remitted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
