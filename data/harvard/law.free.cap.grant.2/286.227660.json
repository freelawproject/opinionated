Mrs. Mackinson took possession of the property and enjoyed the rents, issues and profits thereof, to the time of her death, which occurred on the 30th of August, 1853. The defendant, her executor, filed an inventory of her personal estate, amounting to $1539.87, to wit, goods and chattels appraised at $144.12, cash $87.75, bond and mortgage with interest, $1308.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-11\">The lots thus devised by Thomas Mackinson to his widow, were subject to a ground-rent or rent charge to John B. Newman, trustee of Hamilton\u2019s heirs, of four pounds sterling per annum. This rent Mrs. Mackinson for many years omitted to pay; and at the time of her death the arrearages had accumulated, with interest, to the sum of $1045.58. This bill 'was brought to require her executor to pay to John B.

We do not see bow tbe jurisdiction in equity is to be sustained in such a case. Tbe Orphans\u2019 Court is the proper tribunal to distribute tbe assets of tbe decedent; and tbe form of procedure is by settlement of tbe administration account, and decree of distribution thereon, among all tbe creditors or persons entitled. In tbe present bill, tbe other creditors, if there be any, are not made parties. If a decree be made for tbe plaintiffs, it would necessarily be for tbe whole of their claim, if tbe assets be sufficient. This might produce gross injustice to other creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">Tbe Common Pleas of Lancaster county does not possess general equity jurisdiction. The Act of 16th June, 1836, does not seem to embrace tbe case. A tenant for life may be, in some sort, a trustee for tbe remainderman, but such a tenant is not a trustee within the meaning of that act. He occupies tbe estate in bis own right, and for bis own benefit. He cannot be \u201c controlled, removed or discharged,\u201d under tbe Act of 1836, as a trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">If tbe remainderman should be compelled to pay incumbrances, which tbe tenant for life ought to have- paid, we see no reason why they coulu not apply to tbe Orphans\u2019 Court for a decree of distribution, awarding to them such portion of tbe assets of tbe tenant for life as they may be entitled to.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">Tbe bill was dismissed, and we affirm tbe decree of tbe Common Pleas, upon tbe ground that that court bad no jurisdiction in equity over tbe case made by tbe bill. This is of course without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-12\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
