If any of the above named four children should die, it is my will that the share of such one should be equally divided among the survivors ; and it is my will that all of the above named heirs contribute equally towards paying my just debts, and funeral expenses. And to my grand-daughter, Esther Craig, I bequeath one horse and saddle, one cow, a bed and bedding, which she is to receive at her marriage or her grand-mother\u2019s death. And lastly, I constitute and appoint my well beloved friends, Robert Montgomery, Esquire, and William Hughes, my executors. The expense of procuring a patent for the land, to be at the joint.expense of all the legatees.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-11\">Upon which the court, Burriui, P., entered judgment as follows: \u2014 \u201c The Court is of opinion that the words in the will of James Fulton, deceased, \u2018If any of the above named four children should die, it is my will that the share of such one should be equally divided among the survivors,\u2019 are referable to the death of the testator; being unable from the will to find any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>other period. As all these four children survived the testator, their estates were absolute. On the death of Mary, adverse possession seems to have been taken of her estate by the other three; and Benjamin would be protected now by the Statute of Limitations, as to one-third of Mary\u2019s, at least; upon the death of Cochran and Martha, their estates descended to all the brothers and sisters together. Dividing the estate into thirtieth parts, it leaves in Benjamin fourteen undivided thirtieth parts. Judgment is therefore entered for the plaintiffs, upon the case stated, for sixteen undivided thirtieth parts of the land. The plaintiffs having disclaimed as to the portion for which Guthrie took special defence, that is not included in the recovery.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b30-6\">\u25a0 <em>Armstrong </em>and <em>Cowan, </em>for plaintiffs in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJ1\">referred to 2 Jar. on Wills, 458; <em>Haines </em>v. <em>Witmer, </em>2 Yates, 400, and cases there cited; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>3 S. &amp; R. 470; <em>Lapsley </em>v. <em>Lapsley, </em>9 W. &amp; S. 130; Powell on Devise, 723; 1 Jar. 427; <em>Cochran </em>v. <em>Shale, </em>2 Paige, 122; <em>Anon., </em>1 And. 33; <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Atkins, </em>Cro.

Perhaps he never thought of the mother outliving any of the children. Much of it is a difficulty purely imaginary; for it is not true that a legatee or devisee and his estate are discharged by death from the duties imposed upon him by the testator in consideration of the devise or bequest.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">We think the court put the right construction upon this will, as well as upon the effect of the former action. It has the weight of authority in its favor. It avoids the fault of converting an express fee simple estate into a life estate or an estate tail by implication. . It avoids the fault of seeming to give a fee tail or a life estate in .personal property \u2014 both the realty and personalty being granted by the same words. It follows the. rule that that construction ought to be favored, that makes an estate vest absolutely at the earliest possible period. And it is much more equal in its apparent results than the one contended for on the other side.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
