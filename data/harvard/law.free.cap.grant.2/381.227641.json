Rogers his wife, exhibited by William Carpenter, executor of said Israel Carpenter, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-11\">On the 30th of October, A. D. 1840, Henry Rogers, and Sarah B. Rogers his wife, assigned to Israel Carpenter, as trustee, the share of the said Sarah B. Rogers, in a certain fund, charged upon certain real estate in Lancaster county. The share of the said Sarah, in the said fund, amounts to ten thousand dollars, payable, at the death of her mother, Dorothy Brien, who is still living. The object of the trust, was to secure the payment to certain creditors of the said Henry Rogers, of the several amounts of their debts, which were divided into two classes; those of the first class, were directed to be first paid in full, and the balance to be appropriated to the payment of those of the second class. The assignment provided, that the trustee should collect, receive, and release for the assigned fund, forthwith after the death of the said Dorothy Brien, or sell and dispose of, and assign the same, as soon as conveniently and advantageously could be done <em>in the meantime. </em>It contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>also, this further provision and trust: \u201cthat the said trustee shall have full power and authority, to borrow and raise at any time or times, such sum or sums of money, as shall be necessary for the payment of the first class of debts aforesaid, upon the hereby assigned estate, right, and interest, and upon the credit thereof, by assigning or transferring the same, or such part thereof, as shall be requisite in security for such loan or loans, until the hereby assigned estate shall become available as aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-6\">Israel Carpenter, the trustee, paid off, out of his own estate, the whole of the debts of the first class. This he did, as appellant contends, in accordance with the provisions of the deed, advancing the money himself, instead of borrowing from others; and in pursuance of an arrangement, as is alleged, by which he was to become entitled to compound the interest, at the end of every three years, as long as Mrs. Brien lived. The trustee made several attempts to raise money on the trust fund, but was unsuccessful.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-7\">On the 9th of February, 1846, he exhibited his account of these advances, in the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster county, resulting in a balance in his favor of $2096.57; which account was duly confirmed by the said court, on the 19th day of March, !846.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-8\">Israel Carpenter, Esq., the trustee, having died in June, 1851, and no trustee having been appointed in his place, William Carpenter, his executor, on the 27th of January, 1857, exhibited the account of the said trust, claiming credit for the balance of \u2022 $2096.57, due his testator on the former account, and also interest on said balance from March 16th, 1846, compounding the said interest at rests of every three years, showing a balance due the estate of said trustee, out of the assigned fund, of $3879.09.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-9\">Upon exceptions filed to this account, by E. C. Reigart, who claims as assignee and representative of creditors of the second class, the auditor appointed by the court, decided that Israel Carpenter\u2019s estate, was entitled only to simple interest on the amounts advanced by him, and that there was no occasion for filing any account. He, therefore, dismissed the account, and directed the accountant to pay all the expenses incurred in the exhibition of the account, as well as the expenses of the audit. His report having been excepted to, was on the 12th day of January, 1858, confirmed by the court, from which decree of confirmation this appeal is taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b382-10\">Franklin, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b382-11\"><em>Champneys, </em>for appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMt\">cited Act of 14th June, 1836, Purd. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Dig. 8th ed. 804; <em>Carlisle\u2019s Appeal, </em>9 Watts, 332; <em>Hamaker\u2019s Estate, </em>5 Id. 204; <em>Barclay </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>16 S. &amp; R. 130; <em>Schenck\u2019s Adm\u2019rs Acct., </em>5 W. 86; <em>Roberts\u2019 Appeal, </em>Bright.

The application of the rule had been attempted only in cases of trustees neglecting or omitting to put assets, under their control, out to interest, and in cases of delay in accounting; but in no case has it as yet been adopted. In England\", it has been applied to cases of malfeasance of trustees, but I discover no case of the kind in Pennsylvania. The 18th section of the Act of 29th March, 1832, fixes the rate of interest chargeable to executors, administrators and guardians, at six per cent. The judicial and legislative sentiment with us, is averse to the allowance of compound interest. But the allowance was claimed here by the representative of the trustee or assignee. There was no obligation on the assignee to advance his money for the benefit of the creditors of the estate, or for any party. It was his own voluntary act, and had no merit in it beyond what would be fully compensated by six per cent, interest. Nor did he, in his life-time claim it, for he settled his account in 1846, in which, only simple interest is charged, although the money was advanced not later than 1841.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">There was not the slightest necessity for the exhibition and settlement of the second account. Assets unaccounted for by the original trustee had not come into the accountant\u2019s hands, nor was ho or the trustee out of pocket for anything done since the last settlement, so that the settlement of the second account could have been for no other purpose than to charge the assignee\u2019s estate with compound interest. We adopt the rulo applicable to trusts in the Orphans\u2019 Court, and say as we decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number><em>in Schenck\u2019s Administrator's Account, </em>5 Watts, 84; and <em>in Clauser\u2019s Estate, </em>1 W. &amp; S. 208, that the accountant will not be permitted to settle an account for the mere purpose of charging the estate of the assignor, or rather the second-class creditors of the estate, with compound interest in favor of an estate of which he is an heir, if not the sole heir. It was right to charge the accountant with the costs of the second account.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The decree is affirmed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
