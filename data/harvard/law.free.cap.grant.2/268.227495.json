And the same rule equally applies to chattel interests. 3 P. Wins. 258; 1 El. Rep. 188; 7 T. R. 100. There is, therefore, no objection to the will, on the ground of its tending to create a perpetuity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-6\">\u201cAlthough the estate has vested in the plaintiffs, it does not follow, that it is to be paid to them, or their guardians during their minority, contrary to the positive directions of the testator in his will. The owner of the estate designated the trustee and the times of payment, and the Act of 20th March, 1846, authorizing. a sale of the real \u25a0 estate, does not interfere with the directions of the testator, touching the distribution. The judgment is, therefore, given for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-7\">The entry of judgment for defendant was the error assigned.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b270-8\"><em>Ellmaker, </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuX\">\u2014 The plaintiffs, as also all the children of Daniel Hoffman, (who occupy the same position in regard to the moneys in controversy,) were born <em>since </em>pro'bate of will of Valentine Hoffman, (their grandfather,) on 5th April, A. D. 1833.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-9\">The tenth clause of his will, which is that first quoted in the case stated, makes a clear and absolute provision for Samuel and Daniel Hoffman, and if one of them dies without issue in the life-time of the other, then the survivor is to receive the share of the one so deceased, and the question submitted is, whether this portion of the will of Valentine Hoffman is controlled and restricted by the 13th clause, (second quoted in case stated,) of the same instrument?- And this, too, under the aspect now of an entirely personal estate to operate upon, and an impossibility arising from events, since testator\u2019s death, and in life-time of his sons, Samuel and Daniel, to carry out the requirements of that thirteenth clause of the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-10\">The clause last mentioned provides, that if any grand-child, legatees, or persons interested in the real estate, shall be minors at sale thereof, their shares are to be a charge upon the real estate, payable, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-11\">Oliver, a son of Daniel, was born 25th April, 1849; he may die 24th April, 1870, leaving a child one day old, and if clause 13 be in force, such child would draw its share 23d April, 1891, a period of fifty-eight years from death of testator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-12\">To adopt the view of the case necessary to sustain the opinion of the court below, would also violate a well-settled legal principle, that devises having \u201c a tendency to create a .perpetuity,\u201d are void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-13\">As to tendency to create a perpetuity, see 2 U.

Rep. 102; 13 Pa. Rep. 600.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-6\">Clause 13 goes beyond children of Samuel and Daniel Hoffman, and reaches their grand-children, or the great-grand-children of Valentine Hoffman, the testator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-7\">By the word <em>heirs </em>in that clause, is meant children. 1 Binney, 562, by Breckenridge, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b271-8\"><em>J.

The testator\u2019s sons, Samuel and Daniel, were in being at both the date and probate of the will, and the sale of the real estate was directed to be made within one year after their deaths, and was actually effected a few years afterwards. The executory bequests then completely vested in their children, part of whom are the present plaintiffs, within the bounds prescribed by the rules against perpetuities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-10\">The vesting of the executory bequests to the plaintiffs, is not postponed 'until the time prescribed for their payment, although even that would fall within the legal limits ; nor are the plaintiffs\u2019 interests affected by the subsequent bequests to their heirs, although even they would vest within the period required by the rules. 2 Fearne, 83, note <em>a. </em>It is, therefore, submitted, that the question of perpetuity cannot affect this case.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b271-11\">Opinion.</p>\n<author id=\"b271-12\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"A8l\">\u2014 This judgment is affirmed, for the reasons given by the judge of the Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">Judgment afiirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
