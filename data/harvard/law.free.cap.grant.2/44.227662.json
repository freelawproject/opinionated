An erasure, or interlineation, in \u00e1 deposition, which is shown to have existed at the time the commission was returned, and opened by the prothonotary, will be presumed to have been made with the knowledge and consent of the witness, at the time his testimony was taken.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b44-8\">3. The decision of the court below, that an interlineation, or erasure, in a deposition, was made with the consent of the witness, is the determination of a fact, which will not be reversed on a writ of error, except where the paper-book shows that clear and undoubted evidence, tending to repel the presumption, was laid before the court.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b44-9\">'4. Where a commission is returned by a person, of the same name with the commissioner to whom it was directed, there is a presumption of identity, and the decision of the eourt below, on'that question, will not be reversed, except where clear evidence, tending to prove the contrary, has been laid before them.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b44-10\">5. If an answer to an interrogatory contain a detail of facts, which the opposite party did not anticipate, and touching which, he was not prepared to file cross-interrogatories, the objection lies to the form of the interrogatory, and not to the extent of the answer, and is too late, after the party objecting has joined in the commission, and filed eross-interrogatories.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b44-11\">6.

Plaintiff objected, that these matters were not receivable under the pleas upon the records, and if so at all, only under a plea in abatement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-8\">Plaintiff further objects, that the allegations* if true, would convert the plaintiff into a trustee; and defendant having no defence against him, Mills, cannot set up the interest of the <em>cestui que trust, </em>against the legal title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-9\">Plaintiff further objects to the reading the deposition; that it was not properly executed, and that there was an erasure in a material part, which did not appear to have been made at the time, and with the knowledge and consent of the witness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-10\">Plaintiff further objected, to the answer to second interrogatory, in said deposition, as not responsive to the question.

An answer, which notes all the material circumstances, relative to the plaintiff\u2019s right to the note on which the action is founded, is responsive to an interrogatory, requesting the witness to \u201cstate all that he knows about the note.\u201d If the answer contains a detail of facts, which the opposite party did not anticipate, and touching which he was not prepared to file cross-interrogatories, the objection lies to the form of the interrogatory, and not to the extent of the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">An objection to the form of an interrogatory, comes too late, after the party objecting has joined in the commission, and filed cross-interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">If injustice is likely to arise, from the manner of executing a commission to take testimony, the court below, in a proper case, will, on application, suppress the depositions, or award a new commission. An objection of this kind, which is delayed until the time of the trial, and then urged, not for the purpose of obtaining in a proper manner, the material testimony in the case, but where the effect is to exclude it entirely, and to obtain a verdict in its absence, should be viewed with disfavor by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">.The errors assigned are not sustained, and the judgment is to be aflirmed</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">Judgment affirmed. \u2022</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
