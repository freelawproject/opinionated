MILLETTE, JR.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This appeal concerns whether an intended third-party beneficiary of a will contract, who failed to successfully take under the will instrument due to the drafting attorney's error, may sue the attorney for malpractice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2003, Alice Louise Cralle Dumville, then a resident of Chesterfield County, met with James B. Thorsen, an attorney, at his office in Richmond, Virginia, in order to prepare her last will and\n   testament. At the end of the initial meeting, Thorsen understood that Dumville wanted him to prepare a will that would, upon her death, convey all of her property to her mother if her mother survived her, and, in the event her mother predeceased her, to the Richmond Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (\"RSPCA\"). At the time, Dumville was forty-three and her mother was in her late seventies or early eighties. Dumville lived with three cats, which she desired to go to the RSPCA upon her death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Thorsen prepared the will. At no time in the preparation of the will did Thorsen provide any tax advice, such as attempting to minimize tax burdens on the estate. On April 16, 2003, Thorsen wrote a letter to Dumville informing her of the completion of her will, and Dumville executed the will as drafted by Thorsen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Dumville died on May 16, 2008, her mother having predeceased her. Thorsen, in his capacity as co-executor of the estate, notified the RSPCA that it was the sole beneficiary of Dumville's estate. Thorsen was subsequently informed that, in the opinion of the title insurance company, the will left only the tangible estate, not real estate, to the RSPCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Thorsen brought suit in a collateral proceeding to correct this \"scrivener's error\" based on Dumville's clear original intent. The Circuit Court of Chesterfield County, however, found the language unambiguously limited the bequest to the RSPCA to tangible personal property, while the intangible estate passed intestate to Dumville's heirs at law, Helen Boyle and Kathleen Davis. Thorsen v. Boyle , Rec. No. CL09-718 (April 9, 2010) (unpublished).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 14, 2011, the RSPCA brought suit against James B. Thorsen, Thorsen &amp; Scher, LLP, and James B. Thorsen, P.C. (collectively, \"Thorsen\") for breach of contract-professional negligence, as a third-party beneficiary of the contract between Thorsen and Dumville. Thorsen demurred, arguing, among other things, that: (1) the RSPCA was not an intended third-party beneficiary of the contract and Thorsen undertook no obligation on its behalf, and so he could not be liable to the RSPCA; and (2) in the Commonwealth, an action by a third-party beneficiary arises under Code \u00a7 55-22 and requires a written agreement. Additionally, Thorsen filed a plea in bar premised on the statute of limitations. The circuit court overruled the demurrer and denied the plea in bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At trial, the parties stipulated that Thorsen, as Dumville's attorney, had a duty to incorporate her intent into her will accurately and that he did not accurately incorporate her intent as to the disposition of real property to the RSPCA. The RSPCA received $72,015.60 from the tangible estate, but the ultimate bequest, less expenses, would have totaled $675,425.50 absent the error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The circuit court admitted Thorsen's testimony from the previous collateral proceedings regarding his understanding of Dumville's intent. After considering both this evidence and trial testimony, the court found for the RSPCA. The final order incorporated the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law offered by the RSPCA and found damages for the RSPCA in the amount of $603,409.90. Thorsen now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A. Requirement of a Written Contract\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Thorsen assigns error to the circuit court's \"ruling that Virginia Code \u00a7 55-22 applied to the oral contract between Alice Louise Cralle Dumville and James B. Thorsen.\" We agree with Thorsen that Code \u00a7 55-22 does not apply to the oral contract between Dumville and Thorsen. However, we do not agree that this is fatal to the RSPCA's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This issue of statutory interpretation presents a pure question of law which we review de novo. Conyers v. Martial Arts World of Richmond, Inc. ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=273%20Va.%2096\">\n    273 Va. 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 104,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12637489\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/639/174/#p178\">\n    639 S.E.2d 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 178 (2007). \"When the language of a statute is unambiguous, we are bound by the plain meaning of that language. Furthermore, we must give effect to the legislature's intention as expressed by the language used unless a literal interpretation of the language would result in a manifest absurdity.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12637489\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/639/174/#p178\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Code \u00a7 55-22 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   An immediate estate or interest in or the benefit of a condition respecting any estate may be taken by a person under an instrument, although he be not a party thereto; and if a covenant or promise be made for the benefit, in whole or in part, of a person with whom it\n   is not made, or with whom it is made jointly with others, such person, whether named in the instrument or not, may maintain in his own name any action thereon which he might maintain in case it had been made with him only and the consideration had moved from him to the party making such covenant or promise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Thorsen argues that the language of Code \u00a7 55-22 refers to the third-party beneficiary of an \"instrument.\" An instrument is a \"written legal document that defines rights, duties, entitlements, or liabilities, such as a statute, contract, will, promissory note, or share certificate.\" Black's Law Dictionary 918 (10th ed. 2014) (emphasis added). Thorsen therefore contends that, under the plain language of the statute, the oral nature of the contract in question is fatal to the RSPCA's cause of action, and the RSPCA has no recourse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The parties do not dispute, nor can they in good faith, that the plain meaning of the term \"instrument\" as employed in this statute refers to a written document. Because the benefit to the third party referred to in the first phrase of the statute derives from an \"instrument,\" Code \u00a7 55-22 must refer to a benefit from a written document. This interpretation is bolstered by the second half of the statute: although the term \"covenant or promise\" is not preceded by a modifier specifying \"written,\" it is nonetheless closely followed by reference to \"the instrument\" (emphasis added). The definite article makes clear that the source of the benefit referred to in this statute must be a written agreement or other benefit that is memorialized in a written document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   While we agree with Thorsen's construction of the statute, we cannot agree that this statute abrogates the common law so as to prohibit the ability of third-party beneficiaries to sue upon oral contracts. We have previously noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   At common law,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   the general rule was that, whether the contract was express or implied, by parol or under seal, or of record, the action must be brought in the name of the party in whom the legal interest was vested, and that this legal interest was vested in the\n   person to whom the promise was made, and consequently that he or his privy was the only person who could sue in a court of law upon such contract.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Thacker v.

Oral contracts are not under seal, and the Court has never held, in the centuries prior to Thacker or the century since, that the oral nature of a contract\n   limits a third-party beneficiary's ability to sue upon it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Code \u00a7 55-22 is silent as to oral contracts. By its plain terms, it applies only to written contracts. Its enactment therefore does not affect the ability of a third-party beneficiary to bring a common law action based on an oral contract made for his or her benefit, which remains intact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Additionally, \"statutes are not to be considered as isolated fragments of law, but as a whole, or as parts of a great connected, homogeneous system, or a single and complete statutory arrangement.\" Prillaman v. Commonwealth ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2055770\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/199/401/#p405\">\n    199 Va. 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 405,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20S.E.2d%204\">\n    100 S.E.2d 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7 (1957) (quoting 50 Am. Jur. Statutes \u00a7 349 ). Code \u00a7 11-2, entitled \"When written evidence required to maintain action,\" more commonly known as the Statute of Frauds, sets forth limitations on oral contracts under some circumstances. A third-party beneficiary cannot sue upon an oral promise to answer for his or her debt, for example. Code \u00a7 11-2(4). However, there is no prohibition in Code \u00a7 11-2 on the ability of third-party beneficiaries to sue upon oral contracts generally. To so hold would be to judicially amend the Statute of Frauds, an action we decline to take.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Neither the complaint in this case nor the final order invoke or rely on Code \u00a7 55-22. This issue is raised only on demurrer by\n   Thorsen, who sought to apply Code \u00a7 55-22 due to his belief that it prohibited oral contracts and no common law cause of action existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Because the RSPCA had the authority to proceed under common law as a third-party beneficiary of an oral contract, and the circuit court had the authority to enter judgment accordingly, and nothing in the pleadings frustrates this authority, we therefore conclude that the demurrer was properly overruled and proceed to the next assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   B. Standing\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Thorsen next assigns error to the circuit court's holding that the RSPCA has standing to sue for breach of contract while not party to the attorney-client relationship. Standing is a question of law which we review de novo. Kelley v. Stamos ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=285%20Va.%2068\">\n    285 Va. 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 73,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=737%20S.E.2d%20218\">\n    737 S.E.2d 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 220 (2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This assignment of error requires us to consider two legal components: first, whether Virginia recognizes a cause of action for breach of contract against attorneys by third-party testamentary beneficiaries, and, if so, whether the RSPCA's pleadings were sufficient to accord it standing as a third-party beneficiary of the attorney-client contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   1. The Cause of Action\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   While, as a general rule, strangers to a contract acquire no rights under such contract, third-party beneficiary contracts represent a well-recognized exception in our law under which a nonparty can nevertheless enforce the contract under certain circumstances. 13 Williston on Contracts \u00a7 37:1, at 14-15 (Richard A. Lord ed., 4th ed. 1990 &amp; 2013 rev.) ; see supra Part II.A. A primary rationale for supporting third-party beneficiary claims was that donee contracts, of which testamentary instruments are one example, otherwise could rarely be enforced, as the promisee could recover only nominal damages upon nonperformance: \"The party to the contract would have no action for its breach except nominal damages since he was not the one who suffered by the promisor's default. If the beneficiary could not sue there could be no adequate recovery even though the breach was established.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Isbrandtsen Co. v.

Thus, \"through this travail ... the common law has given birth to a distinct, new principle of law which takes its own place in the family of legal principles, and gives not only to a donee beneficiary, but also to a creditor beneficiary, the right to enforce directly the promise from which he derives his interest.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1268108\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/204/495/#p497\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting 2 Williston on Contracts \u00a7 357 (rev. ed. 1936) (alteration omitted)). \"[A]s stated in one leading decision: 'The tendency of American authority is to sustain the gift in all such cases and to permit the donee-beneficiary to recover on the contract.' \" 13 Williston on Contracts \u00a7 37:13, at 134 (Richard A.

While this rule remains throughout many aspects of the attorney-client relationship, courts in the majority of our sister states have recognized some form of cause of action against negligent drafters of estate instruments by frustrated\n   beneficiaries, through contract or tort principles, or both.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Virginia, \"an action for the negligence of an attorney in the performance of professional duties, while sounding in tort, is an action for breach of contract.\" Oleyar v.

Given those instructions, a lawyer might devise an estate plan with various features, including inter vivos trusts to certain relatives, specific bequests ... [and] many people and institutions might be beneficiaries of the estate, but none could fairly be described as beneficiaries of the contract between the client and his attorney because the intent of that arrangement was to avoid taxes as much as possible. By contrast, a client might direct his lawyer to put his estate in order and advise his lawyer that his one overriding intent is to ensure that each of his grandchildren receive one million dollars at his death and that unless the lawyer agrees to take all steps necessary to ensure that each grandchild receives the specified amount, the client will take his legal business elsewhere.

In short, there is an agreement out of which arises an obligation to benefit a third party, the breach of which causes damages to that third party.

Allegations of Third-Party Beneficiary Status\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The only element in dispute regarding standing is the RSPCA's status as a third-party beneficiary.

Prudential Ins. Co. ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2076473\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/226/376/#p380\">\n    226 Va. 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 380,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=309%20S.E.2d%20305\">\n    309 S.E.2d 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 307 (1983) (citing Valley Landscape Co. v.

We will accordingly limit the scope of our discussion to this element of the claim. An incidental beneficiary is so far removed from the obligations assumed by the contracting parties that a court will not allow him to sue on that contract, whereas an intended beneficiary is\n   such an integral part of the obligations assumed by the contracting parties that a court will permit him to sue on that contract.

Va. 1987).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In the complaint, the RSPCA alleges that, \"In engaging Mr. Thorsen's legal services ... Ms. Dumville informed Mr. Thorsen ... in the event that her mother predeceased her ... to designate the RSPCA as the sole beneficiary of all of her property.\" The RSPCA alleges that \"Mr. Thorsen was informed that Ms. Dumville sought to bestow a benefit on the RSPCA by leaving all of her property to this one recipient in the event her mother predeceased her\"; that, \"[w]hen agreeing to prepare [the will,]\" and \"as part of his Contract\"; Thorsen specifically agreed to draft the will as instructed by Dumville for the sole benefit of the RSPCA in the event that her mother predeceased her; that it was clear to\n   both Dumville and Thorsen that the RSPCA was \"an intended beneficiary of the Contract\"; and that Dumville was \"assured by Mr. Thorsen that he had written the Will to meet her testamentary intent to leave all of her property to the RSPCA in the event that her mother predeceased her\" before she executed the will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Here, the facts sufficiently allege that the contract was entered into for the benefit of Dumville's mother and the RSPCA. The RSPCA sufficiently alleges that Dumville \"sought to confer a benefit\" to the RSPCA upon her death; that she sought Thorsen's professional expertise to accomplish this task; that Dumville and Thorsen contracted so that Dumville would confer a benefit; and that Thorsen accepted that obligation, thus creating the clear and definite intent to create a benefit to the RSPCA. When, according to the allegations, Thorsen accepted the contract to prepare Dumville's will as she specified, the RSPCA became not only the intended beneficiary of Dumville's will but also the intended beneficiary of her contract of employment with Thorsen.

In sum, despite the practical difficulties in being able to prove such a case, the RSPCA alleges many of the elements set forth in the successful Copenhaver hypothetical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Accordingly, while we have suggested in the past that such a cause of action could exist under properly pled facts, today we affirmatively acknowledge the RSPCA's pleading as sufficient to allege a cause of action for breach of contract-professional negligence on behalf of a third-party beneficiary of the contract between the testator and her attorney. The RSPCA has standing to proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   C. Contingent, Residuary Beneficiaries as Third-Party Beneficiaries\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Thorsen next argues that a contingent, residuary beneficiary to a will cannot be a \"clearly and definitely intended\" third-party beneficiary as a matter of law. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Thorsen seeks to remove factual matters properly within the province of the trial court, thus creating a per se rule against certain classes of testamentary beneficiaries. The class of beneficiary in a will is one of many factors to be considered in weighing whether the nonparty was a \"clearly and definitely intended beneficiary\" to the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   1. Residuary Beneficiaries\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   First, we consider the residuary beneficiary, the beneficiary who takes after specific bequests. It is patently obvious that this beneficiary can be a \"clearly and definitely intended beneficiary\" under the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Consider the following example: a widowed and remarried woman living in a nursing home with her husband retains an attorney to create a will for the benefit of her own biological son. She leaves a specific bequest to her husband of her wedding ring and bequeaths the entire residue of her estate to her son. Although the residuary taker, the son receives nearly the entirety of the estate, and, although there may have been multiple purposes to the will, the son was a \"clearly and definitely intended beneficiary\" of the contract and not an incidental beneficiary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Depending on circumstances, a residuary beneficiary may take all of the estate, none of the estate, or anything in between. Evidence may support a finding that\n   the residuary beneficiary was clearly and definitely intended by the testator, or may support the conclusion that the residuary was an incidental beneficiary, such as if the testator instructed the attorney to select a charity for the residuary estate. Whether the residuary beneficiary is a third-party beneficiary is a fact-intensive inquiry; the residuary beneficiary is not precluded from third-party beneficiary status as a matter of law.

Contingent Beneficiaries\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   At the time a will is drafted, the testator cannot know or at least could not be certain whether any particular contingency will be removed such that a contingent beneficiary will in fact take. Thorsen argues, therefore, that a contingent beneficiary by definition cannot be a \"definitely intended beneficiary.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Yet one of the most common scenarios in which parents enter into their first set of testamentary instruments shows this to be contrary to reason. Consider the couple who retains an attorney to draft reciprocal wills at the birth of their child. They will likely name each other as the primary beneficiaries, desiring that if something were to happen to only one of them, the other would benefit from the will. The child is a contingent beneficiary, sometimes through a trust if a minor and in his or her own name as an adult. An overriding purpose in entering into the contract with the attorney to draft such a will at this time is generally to account for the possibility that both parents might perish, perhaps in a common accident, and to provide for the child's long-term care. Although the surviving spouse remains the primary beneficiary of the will, and the child takes only as a contingent beneficiary, this does not alter the fact that the child is a \"clearly and definitely intended beneficiary\" of the contract to draft the will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Contrary to Thorsen's claims, the viability of a third-party contract claim in this context does not depend on identifying, or being able to identify, the specific party being benefitted when the contract is made.

Lord ed., 4th ed. 1990 &amp; 2013 rev.) (citing many sources). Contingent beneficiaries exist to accommodate changing circumstance, particularly age, and to direct the progression of beneficiaries without the constant need to revisit the instrument as time and eventuality go by. Thus, the fact that beneficiaries do not take first does not mean that they are not \"clearly and definitely intended beneficiar[ies]\" under the contract, but rather that they were not intended as the first takers given the circumstances at the time the will was drafted; yet, the will might still have been drafted, perhaps even primarily as in the example above, for their benefit.

To review the circuit court's finding that the RSPCA was a third-party beneficiary of the contract, we review both the evidence as to Dumville's intent and Thorsen's intent at the time of the contract to consider whether the RSPCA was a \"clearly and definitely intended\" beneficiary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   1. Dumville's Intent\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   First, we consider the question of whether the facts were sufficient for a factfinder to conclude that, for Dumville, an overriding purpose of the contract was to benefit the RSPCA. Thorsen's answer to an interrogatory from the prior collateral proceeding stated: \"The decedent was clear in her instructions to Thorsen ... that she wanted her entire estate to go to her mother and if her mother predeceased her, then her entire estate be to the Richmond SPCA. These were her instructions and intentions at the time of the initial interview and the creation of her last will and testament and throughout the drafting period.\" The RSPCA introduced a letter from Thorsen to the title insurance company stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   [I]t was the clear intent of Alice and the intent in my drafting, to make a full and complete conveyance of Alice's estate to her mother if she survived Alice, and if not, a full and complete bequeath/conveyance of all of Alice's entire estate to the RSPCA. Moreover, I had no idea Alice had any relative other than her mother, and did not become aware of Ms. Boyles [sic] until sometime after [Dumville's mother] died.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The parties stipulated that Dumville was forty-three and her mother was in her late seventies or early eighties when the will was drafted. Thorsen testified that he was aware that Dumville had a relationship with the RSPCA, had an affinity for the organization, and wanted her cats to go to the RSPCA after her death. Thorsen testified in the previous matter that these three cats \"were her babies\" and she \"probably cared for her cats more than she did herself.\" Finally, although there is error in the drafting, the RSPCA is named specifically in the will instrument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Thorsen testified in the current proceeding that Dumville's motivation for creating a will was in part to disinherit her husband\n   while divorce proceedings were underway. However, in the prior 2009 proceeding, he stated that \"it would not have been a consideration,\" and he \"did not discuss with [Dumville] any issue of her husband's rights of intestacy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The circuit court found Thorsen's answers in the 2009 proceeding credible. The factfinder is entitled to consider the nature and content of the instrument as evidence and draw reasonable inferences arising therefrom. Here, a single woman with an uncomplicated estate created a simple will devising her entire estate to the only relative with whom evidence suggests she had a close relationship, her elderly mother, or, if her mother predeceased her, a charity with which she had a preexisting relationship, upon her death. It is a fair inference that the client entered into a contract to draft a will for the purpose of benefiting one of those parties upon her death. Given the deference afforded to the factfinder, we find no error in the circuit court's conclusion that the primary or overriding purpose of the contract was for the benefit of the will beneficiaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The evidence was also sufficient to support Dumville's intent for the RSPCA specifically to benefit. There was testimony as to her relationship with the RSPCA, supporting the RSPCA as a purposeful choice. The ages of Dumville and her mother at the time the will was drafted make it not unlikely and, in fact, foreseeable that Dumville's mother would predecease her and the RSPCA would take the entirety of Dumville's estate. Finally, in the case of a residuary charitable beneficiary, affirmatively being named in the instrument lends additional support to the testator's clear and definite intention to benefit the charity in her contract with her attorney and his understanding of that obligation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Taking\n   these facts together, we find no error in the trial court's finding of sufficient evidence to conclude that Dumville clearly and definitely intended the RSPCA to be a third-party beneficiary of the contract.\n   2. Thorsen's Intent\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Thorsen alleges that there was no evidence that Thorsen agreed to benefit the RSPCA in entering into the retention agreement to draft the will, and so the RSPCA cannot be a third-party beneficiary of the contract. A third-party beneficiary rule \"has no application unless the party sought to be held liable has assumed an obligation for the benefit of the third party.\" Valley Landscape Co. ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2130567\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/218/257/#p260\">\n    218 Va. at 259-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=237%20S.E.2d%20120\">\n    237 S.E.2d at 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thorsen argues that, in the Copenhaver hypothetical, this Court explicitly included a requirement that a lawyer comply with the testator's specific directives at the outset of their retention.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2104520\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/238/361/\">\n    238 Va. at 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=384%20S.E.2d%20593\">\n    384 S.E.2d at 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thorsen desires the Court to distinguish between the obligation undertaken to make a will in a retention agreement and the obligation to benefit the parties in the will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   We disagree that Copenhaver requires some specific language in the contract between a testator and her attorney that the lawyer must comply with her directives or there will be no contract, and we do not find this cause of action necessarily so limited. The Copenhaver hypothetical indeed emphasizes that mutual understanding of the benefit to the third party is essential to the contract. Id. at 369,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=384%20S.E.2d%20593\">\n    384 S.E.2d at 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e.g. , \"unless the lawyer agrees ... the client will take his legal business elsewhere\"; \"if the lawyer agrees to comply with these specific directives\"). Yet, the agreement to comply with specific directives is implied when the client contracts with the attorney to perform a specific service which the attorney then undertakes to perform. We cannot separate the obligations of the client's intent from the agreement because, without the intent and the assent to take on those specific directives, there would be no retention agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   For this reason, when a client can terminate a contract at any time, a client's request six months into an attorney-client relationship to make a third party his or her beneficiary has the same weight as a request on the first day of the relationship: refusal of the attorney to draft the will according to his or her wishes would likewise result in the termination of the attorney-client relationship. Thus, we do not find it necessary to prove that this mutual assent was expressed prior to retention, but rather that, prior to the completion of the attorney's services, the attorney became aware of the directives of the client and agreed to undertake the obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   There may be many reasons for drafting a testamentary instrument which would not result in the creation of third-party beneficiaries to the attorney-client contract. But the evidence in this case supports the trial court's finding that Dumville went to Thorsen to draft a will for the purpose of benefiting her mother and the RSPCA. The parties stipulated that, at the end of their initial meeting regarding preparation of the will, \"Thorsen understood that Ms. Dumville wanted him to prepare a Will which would accurately incorporate and effectuate Ms. Dumville's decisions as to the distribution of her estate upon her death, i.e. that upon her death all of her property would be left to her mother if her mother survived her, and in the event her mother predeceased her, all of her property would be left to the RSPCA.\" Thorsen stated under oath that \"There was no doubt in my mind what she wanted in terms of the will, no doubt what she expressed.\" In that meeting, which Thorsen testified was their only meeting regarding the will prior to his drafting, Thorsen agreed to draft a will according to those specifications. We find no error below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Thus, taking these findings together as a whole, we find no error in the trial court's holding that the RSPCA was a clearly and definitely intended third-party beneficiary of the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   III.

Although, in that case, the Court discussed cases from other jurisdictions that have permitted third-party beneficiary claims\n   against attorneys and ultimately ruled that the claim of the beneficiaries in Copenhaver did not meet traditional rules governing third-party beneficiary claims, the Court did not address the issue of whether the common law requirement of privity in legal malpractice actions has been, or should be, abandoned in Virginia to accommodate third-party beneficiary claims against attorneys. This issue is squarely before the Court in this case and demands a careful and thorough discussion of the policies underlying the requirement of strict privity and the role this Court should play in determining whether this common law requirement should be abolished.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The abolishment of the common law requirement of privity in legal malpractice actions presents competing public policy concerns.

Although the public's interest in holding attorneys accountable in providing estate planning services is an\n   important consideration, there are competing policy concerns raised by the extension of legal malpractice standing to nonclients. \"The public policy of the Commonwealth is determined by the General Assembly [because] it is the responsibility of the legislature, and not the judiciary, ... to strike the appropriate balance between competing interests.\" Uniwest Constr., Inc. v.

Under the majority opinion, the common law requirement of privity in legal malpractice actions is now abolished in Virginia. From this date forward, attorneys will owe a legal duty to nonclients by virtue of legal services agreements with their clients whenever a \"lawyer knows that a client intends as one of the primary objectives of the representation that the lawyer's services benefit the nonclient.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the specific context of estate planning in which the cause of action will accrue upon the client's death, attorneys will be subject to liability for malpractice for a\n   period of time that could extend well beyond the date that the testamentary documents were drafted. Such uncertain and unlimited liability will undoubtedly deter attorneys from offering estate planning services. Additionally, this expansion of liability will likely lead to higher malpractice insurance premiums and ultimately affect the ability of potential clients to obtain affordable estate planning services from attorneys who choose to continue to offer such services.
