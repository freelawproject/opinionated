RUSSELL.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This appeal arises from a motion to suppress evidence obtained by police officers following the \"\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop\" of an automobile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The material facts are undisputed. At 2:30 p.m. on March 3, 2012, Officer Willie Richards of the Waverly Police Department was operating stationary radar on the side of Route 460 in the Town of Waverly, Sussex County. He was accompanied by another officer named Parker. Richards was watching for traffic speeding down a hill. He observed a green sedan that passed him. It attracted his attention only because he observed a dangling object hanging below its rear-view mirror. He followed it in his cruiser and brought it to a stop. He thought the dangling object might be in violation of the law. Code \u00a7 46.2-1054 provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   It shall be unlawful for any person to drive a motor vehicle on a highway in the Commonwealth with any object or objects, other than a rear view mirror, sun visor, or other equipment of the motor vehicle approved by the Superintendent, suspended from any part of the motor vehicle in such a manner as to obstruct the driver's clear view of the highway through the windshield, the front side windows, or the rear window, or to alter a passenger-carrying vehicle in such a manner as to obstruct the driver's view through the windshield.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   There were two occupants of the green sedan. The driver was Tony Jarrett and the appellant here, Loren Mason, was a front-seat passenger. The dangling object was an opaque plastic parking pass for a nearby military facility, approximately 3? by 5? in size, suspended from the rear-view mirror mounting. Richards asked Jarrett to step out of the car. Jarrett complied and walked to the rear of the car. Richards testified that he intended to charge Jarrett with a seat-belt violation as well as a violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-1054 and so advised Jarrett. He asked Jarrett whether he had any weapons on his person and Jarrett said no. He then asked Jarrett if he would consent to a \" pat-down\" search for weapons and Jarrett gave his consent. The search revealed no weapons but led to the discovery of a bag of marijuana in Jarrett's pocket. Richards detained him for possession of marijuana as well as the two traffic infractions, and read him his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Meanwhile, Officer Parker asked Mason to step out of the car. He then conducted a pat-down search of Mason, which revealed nothing. Richards testified that Mason would \"absolutely\" have been free to leave the scene at that point if he had so desired. Richards detected a strong odor of marijuana in the car, searched its interior and found a black backpack in the middle of the rear seat. Neither Jarrett nor Mason admitted ownership of the backpack. Richards opened the backpack and found a large number of individually-wrapped bags of marijuana, a bag containing \"Ecstasy\" pills, cocaine residue, a box of sandwich bags and several letters that had been written to Mason. Richards then arrested Mason, read him his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, and searched him incident to the arrest. The search revealed a cell phone and $3,381 in cash on Mason's person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mason was indicted, tried and convicted in the Circuit Court of Sussex County of three felony drug offenses arising from his arrest. He made a pre-trial motion to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the traffic stop, contending that it was an unconstitutional infringement of his Fourth Amendment rights. The circuit court denied his motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mason appealed to the Court of Appeals, assigning error only to the circuit court's denial of his motion to suppress. The Court of Appeals granted the appeal which was decided by a divided three-judge panel. In a published opinion,\n   <em>\n    Mason v.

Such brief investigatory detentions have become known as \"\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stops\" and have spawned many appeals, especially in cases where the stop resulted in the discovery of evidence of crimes far different from that which had motivated the officer to make the stop.

Mason contends that the officer's failure to articulate the second of these elements of the offense makes it obvious that the officer was unaware of the law's requirements and that he evidently thought\n   the offense consisted solely of driving with a dangling object suspended in the car, regardless of its character or placement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Mason's contentions that Officer Richards failed fully to articulate the requirements of the offense and might have misunderstood the law he was trying to enforce are insufficient to show reversible error in the circuit court's ruling on his motion to suppress. We therefore focus on the dispositive question: whether the facts and circumstances apparent to the officer at the time he decided to make the stop were such as to create in the mind of a reasonable officer in the same position a suspicion that a violation of the law was occurring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Although Code \u00a7 46.2-1054 proscribes conduct few might think unlawful, its legislative\n   purpose is far from trivial. When automobiles first appeared on public roads, drivers sat bolt upright on bench seats and looked forward through vertical windshields of flat plate glass. In present-day vehicles, they are seated in more comfortable cushioned seats adjustable in up to six directions to accommodate individual tastes and physical requirements. A driver may assume a semi-reclining position, if desired. At the same time, windshields have become markedly tilted, for streamlining and aesthetic reasons. In many vehicular configurations today, the net effect of these factors may be to reduce the vertical space through which the driver may view the road ahead to a relatively narrow band of glass. Any obstruction of that narrow band of glass can have serious consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On this continent, vehicles drive on the right side of the road while drivers sit on the left side of the vehicle. The rear-view mirror, expressly permitted by the statute, is placed behind the\n   windshield's center, partially obstructing the driver's view. Any opaque object suspended below it will probably obstruct the view to the driver's right to some extent. Any obstruction in that area can lead to tragic consequences when, for example, another vehicle backs out of a shrubbery-screened driveway ahead or a child darts out from between parked cars into a residential street in pursuit of a ball or a runaway pet. The legislative purpose underlying the statute is clearly to lessen such dangers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Police officers charged with enforcement of the statute are confronted with a demanding task. Some dangling objects may turn out not to obstruct the driver's clear view of the highway; others will. The officer's dilemma consists in the virtual impossibility of determining to which category the dangling object belongs while the car containing it is in motion. The offense exists only when a person \"drive[s] a motor vehicle on a highway.\" Code \u00a7 46.2-1054.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In the present case, the trial court, having examined the evidence, decided that an objective officer in the position Officer Richards occupied when deciding to make the stop, could reasonably conclude that the object dangling from the rear-view mirror might violate Code \u00a7 46.2-1054, justifying an investigatory stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In consideration of the totality of the circumstances, we find further support for the trial court's decision. Here, Officer Richards testified at the suppression hearing that he was in a stationary position along the highway and watched the green sedan as it came down the hill toward him to see whether it was speeding. He testified, \"when it got a little closer, I saw the tag on the rear-view mirror.... I can't say it was moving back and forth, just that I saw it when it came by.\" A reasonable person could readily conclude from the fact that the tag was sufficiently prominent to attract the officer's attention during the brief moments that it passed through his field of view that it might have violated the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We conclude that the objective facts and circumstances presented by the Commonwealth were such as to create a reasonable suspicion that a violation of the law was occurring, justifying an investigatory stop of the vehicle in which Mason was a\n   passenger and that his Fourth Amendment rights were not violated thereby. Accordingly we will affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Affirmed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Justice POWELL, with whom Senior Justice MILLETTE joins, dissenting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   According to the majority, Officer Richards' clear misinterpretation of the law \"is irrelevant if the facts and circumstances at the time of the stop would have been sufficient to create in the mind of a reasonable officer in the same position a suspicion that a violation of the law was occurring or was about to occur.\" Stated another way, the majority today holds that an officer's mistake of law may be disregarded if another, hypothetical officer would not have made the same mistake. As I believe that the United States Supreme Court has explicitly held that an officer's mistake of law must be considered, especially where it serves as the\n   basis for initiating an investigatory stop, I must respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   It is undisputed that, at a minimum, in order to initiate a traffic stop like the one at issue in the present case, an officer must have a reasonable suspicion that a crime is being committed or is about to be committed. The difficulty lies in determining what, exactly, the term \"reasonable suspicion\" encompasses. Recognizing that \"the concept of reasonable suspicion is somewhat abstract,\" the United States Supreme Court has avoided establishing a rigid definition of the term.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Mason's appeal is based, in part, on the notion that the underlying traffic stop was invalid because Officer Richards initiated the traffic stop due to an unreasonable mistake of law. Applying the logic of\n   <em>\n    Heien\n   </em>\n   to these facts, it is clear that Officer Richards' stated reason for initiating the stop indicates that he initiated the stop based on a mistake of law. The record clearly demonstrates that Officer Richards misunderstood\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Code \u00a7 46.2-1054, as it is apparent that Officer Richards believed that Code \u00a7 46.2-1054 prohibited any object dangling from a rear-view mirror, regardless of its potential to obstruct the driver's view. Code \u00a7 46.2-1054 prohibits driving in a motor vehicle with \"any object or objects ... suspended from any part of the motor vehicle in such a manner as to obstruct the driver's clear view of the highway through the windshield.\" However, at trial, Officer Richards' stated that he initiated the traffic stop because of a \"[d]angling object on the rearview mirror.\" At no point did Officer Richards indicate that he believed that the parking tag obstructed Jarrett's view of the highway or that he initiated the stop to investigate whether the parking tag obstructed Jarrett's view.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given that there is no prohibition\n   against objects dangling from the rearview mirror\n   that do not obstruct the driver's view of the highway, it is clear that Officer Richards either misunderstood or misapplied Code \u00a7 46.2-1054.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Once it is determined that a traffic stop was initiated based on a mistake of law,\n   <em>\n    Heien\n   </em>\n   instructs that the next step is to determine whether the mistake of law was reasonable. Code \u00a7 46.2-1054 is not ambiguous. The statute clearly establishes that it does not prohibit all objects suspended from a rearview mirror, only those that obstruct the driver's view. There are no competing interpretations of the statute that do not include such a requirement. Furthermore, unlike the statute in\n   <em>\n    Heien,\n   </em>\n   the Court of Appeals has, on at least one occasion, interpreted Code \u00a7 46.2-1054.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Bryant,\n   </em>\n   Record No. 0076-04-1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%201313044\">\n    2004 WL 1313044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2004 Va.App. LEXIS 283 (June 15, 2004) (unpublished). Thus, it cannot be said that Officer Richards' mistake of law was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Therefore, I would find that Officer Richards was not justified in initiating an investigatory traffic stop.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and direct that it remand the matter to the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Although Officer Richards testified at the suppression hearing that he had made the stop because he observed a dangling object hanging from the car's rear-view mirror, later at that hearing the Commonwealth's Attorney asked him whether the object could obstruct the driver's view. He responded, \"It could. Yes ma'am.\" The record is unclear as to the time the officer reached that conclusion. It could have been based on his observation of the car after he had stopped it, rather than the time he decided to make the stop. In any event, we shall never know what Richards' understanding of the law may have been when he decided to make the stop because he was never asked the question. Instead, he was asked what brought his attention to the vehicle. He responded, \"Dangling object on the rearview mirror.\" He might have been mistaken as Mason contends, but it is equally likely that he fully understood the law's requirements but could not determine whether they were being violated unless he stopped the car to investigate further. We need not speculate as to his state of mind, but will adhere to the standard of objective reasonableness.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    The majority points out that \"we shall never know what [Officer] Richards' understanding of the law may have been when he decided to make the stop because he was never asked the question.\" I do not disagree with this statement. However, as\n    <em>\n     Heien\n    </em>\n    demonstrates, the majority's concern is unfounded. Notably, the Supreme Court was in the same position when it decided\n    <em>\n     Heien,\n    </em>\n    because no one had asked the officer what his understanding of the law was at the time he initiated the traffic stop, just as no one asked Officer Richards in the present case. Rather than speculate about what the officer did or did not know about the law, the Supreme Court looked no further than the officer's stated reason for initiating the traffic stop. In my opinion, this Court should similarly look no further than Officer Richards' stated reason for initiating the traffic stop.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    At the suppression hearing, the Commonwealth did not ask Officer Richards whether the parking tag could obstruct\n    <em>\n     the\n    </em>\n    driver's view. Had the Commonwealth actually asked this question, Officer Richards' affirmative response would have allowed for the implication that he believed at the time of the stop that the parking tag could have obstructed Jarrett's view. The actual question asked was, \"you can't see through [the parking tag], so it could obstruct\n    <em>\n     a\n    </em>\n    driver's view?\" (Emphasis added.) In my opinion, the difference is subtle, but significant. Any opaque object can potentially obstruct\n    <em>\n     a\n    </em>\n    driver's view; a violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-1054, however, requires evidence that the dangling object obstruct\n    <em>\n     the\n    </em>\n    driver's view. It is further worth noting that Officer Richards was also asked by the Commonwealth if anything about the parking tag caused him concern for the driver. In response, Officer Richards stated, \"Just that there was a dangling object.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    I take no position as to whether an officer with a proper understanding of the law would have reasonable suspicion to initiate a traffic stop under the facts of the present case. Nor am I saying that a dangling parking tag like the one at issue in the present case cannot be the basis for a legitimate traffic stop. My position is simply that\n    <em>\n     Heien\n    </em>\n    applies to the present case and, under\n    <em>\n     Heien,\n    </em>\n    an officer who initiates a traffic stop based on an unreasonable mistake of law lacks reasonable suspicion and violates the Fourth Amendment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
