We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-5\">This case was tried as a class action under the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 &amp; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 based upon the claim that the repossessions of automobiles subject to security interests were made under \u201ccolor of State law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and in violation of due process because effective without notice and opportunity for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-7\">Each of the named appellees financed the purchase of an automobile either through an installment sale contract or a loan agreement which required periodic payments over a specified period of time. Each named appellee had created a security interest in his automobile as collateral security for the indebtedness. The agreements provided that, in the event of default by an appellee, the creditor would have the right to retake the automobile, with or without judicial process \u2014 a practice commonly referred to as self-help repossession.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1173-9\">The challenged statutes neither compel nor prohibit peaceable self-help repossession. Section 9-503 of the UCC, 12A Pa.Stat. \u00a7 9-503 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1173-10\">\u201cUnless otherwise agreed a secured party has on default the right to take possession of the collateral. In taking possession a secured party may proceed without judicial process if this can be done without breach of the peace or may proceed by action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1173-11\">Section 23 subd. A of the MVSFA, 69 Pa.Stat. \u00a7 623, subd. A provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1173-12\">\u201cWhen the buyer shall be in default in the payment of any amount due under a motor vehicle installment sale contract or when the buyer has committed any other breach of contract, which is by the contract specifically made a ground for retaking the motor vehicle, the seller or any holder, who has lawfully acquired such contract, may retake possession thereof. Unless the motor vehicle can be retaken without breach of the peace, it shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>be retaken by legal process, but nothing herein shall be construed to authorize a violation of the criminal law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1174-4\">The district court found that there was sufficient state involvement to constitute \u201cstate action\u201d and held that under Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972), lack of prior notice and an opportunity to be heard renders extra-judicial repossession unconstitutional. Since we believe that the requisite \u201cstate action\u201d is not present and that therefore a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 has not been alleged, we need not reach the due process issue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-5\"> It is well-settled that the fourteenth amendment applies only to actions of the \u201cStates\u201d and not to actions which are \u201cprivate.\u201d Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the \u201cunder color of state law\u201d requirement is the same as the \u201cstate action\u201d requirement of the fourteenth amendment. Adickes v. S. H. Kress &amp; Co., 398 U.S. 144, 152 n. 7, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970); United States v. Price, 383 U.S. 787, 794-795 n. 7, 86 5. Ct. 1152, 16 L.Ed.2d 267 (1966).<footnotemark>6a</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-7\">Unlike pre-judgment seizures recently considered by the Supreme Court in which state action was clearly present,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the seizures complained of here were effected by private individuals without the aid of any state official. Therefore, absent direct state involvement by the State of Pennsylvania, appellees\u2019 claim of \u201cstate action\u201d rests on one of two general theories: 1) by comprehensively regulating the field of automobile financing, without prohibiting the practice of self-help repossession, the State of Pennsylvania has become so involved and has so encouraged this private remedy that it becomes \u201cstate action,\u201d or 2) by allowing the practice of self-help repossession, the State of Pennsylvania has abdicated or delegated to private individuals a traditional state function, thus infusing the private act of repossession with \u201cstate action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-12\">COMPREHENSIVE STATE REGULATION</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-13\">Unquestionably the legislature of Pennsylvania, in enacting the MVSFA, comprehensively sought to regulate the area of automobile financing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But the act complained of \u2014 i. e., the seizure of appellees\u2019 automobiles \u2014 is neither compelled<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> nor prohibited by the MVSFA. The statute simply permits what private parties have agreed upon. Section 23 of the MVSFA, 69 Pa.Stat. \u00a7 623 provides that the creditor \u201cmay retake possession\u201d peaceably, without resort to legal process, if the default \u201cis by the contract specifically made a grounfl for retaking the motor vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-14\">. Under the MVSFA, self-help repossession remains a private remedy enforced by purely private conduct pursuant to an agreement made privately and not under state compulsion. Thus, the state plays no significant role. Where, as here, \u201cthe impetus for the [act complained of] is private,\u201d we are simply unable to conclude, as required under Moose Lodge v. Irvis, 407 U.S. 163, 173, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>92 S.Ct. 1965, 1971, 32 L.Ed.2d 627 (1972), that the State of Pennsylvania has <em>\u201csignificantly </em>involved itself\u201d in the alleged conduct so as to constitute \u201cstate action.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-5\">Nor do we believe that by enacting the MVSFA has the State of Pennsylvania formed a \u201csymbiotic relationship\u201d with creditors as was present in Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715, 81 S.Ct. 856, 6 L.Ed.2d 45 (1961). <em>Cf. </em>Moose Lodge v. Irvis, 407 U.S. 163, 174-175, 92 S.Ct. 1965, 32 L. Ed.2d 627 (symbiotic relationship lacking).</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-6\">Nor do we find in the statutory scheme the kind of encouragement and fosterage of the alleged unconstitutional act as in Reitman v. Mulkey, 387 U.S. 369, 87 S.Ct. 1627, 18 L.Ed.2d 830 (1967). In <em>Reitman, </em>the State constitutional amendment repealed prior state legislation regulating racial discrimination in housing. Thus, in effect, the State constitutionally authorized discrimination by repealing prior law and by substantially inhibiting any subsequent change.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1175-7\">The case before us is vastly dissimilar to the situation in <em>Reitman. </em>Appellees concede that the self-help remedy of repossession \u201cexisted in some form in the common law from a very early time.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Unlike <em>Reitman </em>then, the State of Pennsylvania has not by the enactment of the MVSFA permitted a practice which was formerly prohibited. It is true, as appellees suggest, that \u201cthe protections surrounding the use of [this self-help] remedy have continuously ebbed and flowed.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But any encouragement or fosterage of self-help repossession resulting, if at all, from statutory modification of safeguards surrounding this private remedy is indirect and highly conjectural and is simply far less significant than the state involvement in <em>Reitman. </em>We think that <em>Reitman </em>and <em>Moose Lodge, supra, </em>read together, suggest that absent direct state action, private repossessions are not infused with the quality of \u201cstate action\u201d unless we can conclude that the involvement of the State of Pennsylvania (through its enactment of the MVSFA) has \u201csignificantly\u201d encouraged or fostered self-help repossessions. <em>Reitman, supra, </em>387 U.S. at 380, 87 S.Ct. 1627; <em>Moose Lodge, supra, </em>407 U.S. at 173, 92 S.Ct. 1598. <em>See Burton, supra, </em>365 U.S. at 772, 81 S.Ct. 856. We cannot so conclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-17\">Actually, far from encouraging private repossessions, the MVSFA was enacted in 1947, among other reasons, to curb the abuses associated with private repossessions.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The statute displays a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>noticeable concern for protecting a broad range of consumer interests, including, but not limited to, private repossessions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The MVSFA then not only makes it more difficult to repossess, but also, by protecting various other interests of the buyer, indirectly minimizes the circumstances which give rise to repossessions. We think the Second Circuit\u2019s characterization of an installment sales financing act of another state is equally appropriate to the MVSFA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aoy\">\u201cThe state enactment was ameliorato-ry not regressive; it did not \u2018move in\u2019 on the . . . buyers, but rather on the installment sellers. \u2022X- -X- -X- -X- -X- -X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1176-6\">\u201cThe partnership, if any, is with the purchaser and not the [sellers]. See Adickes v. S.\u2018 H. Kress &amp; Co., 398 U.S. 146, 90 S.Ct. 1598 (1969)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1176-7\">Shirley v. State National Bank, No. 73-1783, 493 F.2d 739, at 743 (2nd Cir., filed Feb. 14, 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-8\">At least an aspect of appellees\u2019 argument, distilled to its essence, is that when a state attempts to comprehensively regulate an area of private conduct, its failure to prohibit is equivalent to \u201cstate action.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Such a rule, however, would virtually obliterate the distinction between state and private action. As the Ninth Circuit noted in Adams v. Southern California First National Bank, 492 F.2d 324, 330-331 (9th Cir. 1973):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5Np\">\u201cStatutes and laws regulate many forms of purely private activity, such as contractual relations and gifts, and subjecting all behavior that conforms \u25a0to state law to the Fourteenth Amendment would emasculate the state action concept.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>* </em>\u2022* * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>Lastly, we reject two other contentions of appellees by noting our agreement with the Ninth, Eighth, Fifth and Second Circuits (1) that private repossessions are not infused with \u201cstate action\u201d merely because the state enacted sections 9-503 and 9-504 of the UCC,<footnotemark>15a</footnotemark> James v. Pinnix, No. 73-1866, 495 F.2d 206 (5th Cir., filed June 10, 1974); Nowlin v. Professional Auto Sales, Inc., No. 73-1348 and Mayhugh v. Bill Allen Chevrolet Co., No. 73-1450, 496 F.2d 16 (8th Cir., filed April 25, 1974); Shirley v. State National Bank, <em>supra; </em>Adams v. Southern California First National Bank, <em>supra; </em>and (2) that private repossessions are not infused with \u201cstate action\u201d merely because a state issues a certificate of ownership <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> to the secured party enabling it to transfer the automobile to a third party purchaser at a sale following repossession,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Nichols v. Tower Grove Bank, No. 73-1621, 497 F. 2d 404 (8th Cir. filed May 13, 1974); Shirley v. State National Bank, <em>supra; </em>Adams v. Southern California First National Bank, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1177-9\">DELEGATION OF TRADITIONAL STATE FUNCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-10\">In Evans v. Newton, 382 U.S. 296, 299, 86 S.Ct. 486, 488, 15 L.Ed.2d 373 (1966), the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-11\">\u201cConduct that is formally \u2018private\u2019 may become so intwined with governmental policies or so impregnated with a governmental character as to become subject to the constitutional limitations placed upon state action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-12\">[W]hen private individuals or groups are endowed by the State with powers or functions governmental in nature, they become agencies or instrumentalities of the State and subject to its constitutional limitations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1177-13\">Although we find no similarity between <em>Evans </em>(and the cases cited therein)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and the present case, appellees nevertheless suggest and the district court agreed that the State of Pennsylvania has delegated to private individuals a traditional state function, i. e., the power to decide that one\u2019s rights are superi- or to another\u2019s and to carry out that decision by seizing another\u2019s property. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>Probably the chief obstacle to concluding that self-help repossession involves a traditional state function is the fact, recognized by the district court and the appellees, that in one form or another the common law very early recognized repossession as a private remedy. As the Ninth Circuit has noted, \u201c[biased on this history, it does not appear likely that the Fourteenth Amendment, when written, was intended to eliminate self-help in light of the prevailing use of peaceful repossession.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We do not believe, moreover, that this obstacle can be surmounted by concluding as the district court did that this self-help remedy was not a \u201chistorically sound principle of the common law\u201d and that it \u201cought never have been deemed applicable to the American state of society.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\">Nor do we believe that the district court was correct in reading Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972), as suggesting that \u201cstate action\u201d encompasses any abdication by the state of \u201cthe power to decide that your rights are greater that another\u2019s.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Although <em>Fuentes </em>clearly involved state action,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the plurality opinion nonetheless spoke of a state\u2019s abdication of effective control over \u201cstate power.\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> However, contrary to what the district court suggested, the \u201cstate power\u201d to which <em>Fuentes </em>referred was the use of state power in the form of state officers to accomplish the seizures for the creditor. The plurality opinion recognized that at common law a creditor could \u201cinvoke <em>state power\u201d </em>through the action of debt or detinue or alternatively a \u201ccreditor could . proceed <em>without the use of state power, </em>through self-help, by \u2018distraining\u2019 the property before a judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The dissent in <em>Fuentes </em>also read the majority opinion as clearly distinguishing between state action and purely private action such as repossession:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-9\">\u201cIt would appear that creditors could withstand the attack under today\u2019s opinion simply by making clear in the controlling credit instruments that they may retake possession without a hearing, or, for that matter, without resort to judicial process at all.\u201d 407 U.S. at 102, 92 S.Ct. at 2005.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1178-10\">Thus, we find no support for the contention that the State of Pennsylvania has delegated a traditional state function.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1178-11\">We therefore conclude that appellees have failed to show the requisite \u201cstate action\u201d necessary to support a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>Accord, </em>James v. Pinnix, No. 73-1866, 495 F.2d 206 (5th Cir., filed June 10, 1974); Nichols v. Tower Grove Bank, No. 73-1621, 497 F.2d 404 (8th Cir., filed May 13, 1974); Nowlin v.

Such exploitation is evident in the unfair provisions of the installment sale contract, exorbitant charges for credit, extortionate default, extension, collection, repossession and other charges for credit, unconscionable practices respecting execution of contracts, refinancing of contracts, prepayment, refunds, insurance, <em>repossession </em>and redemption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1175-19\">\u201c(d) That practices enumerated, and others equally pernicious, have existed to such an extent that regulation of the installment selling of motor vehicles is necessary to the adequate protection of the public interest. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1175-20\">\u201cTherefore, it is hereby declared to be the policy of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to promote the welfare of its inhabitants and to protect its citizens from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>abuses presently existing in the installment sale of motor vehicles, and to establish a system of regulation for the purpose of insuring honest and efficient consumer credit service for installment purchasers of motor vehicles; and to provide the administrative machinery necessary for effective enforcement.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1176-10\">.

If we were to accept the debtors\u2019 broad test, it would be very difficult to draw any line between state and private action. Indeed, the creditors point out this difficulty when they argue that if any action in conformance with a state law were state action for purposes of the statute (\u00a7 1983) or the constitutional amendment, then the action of the debtors in withholding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>payments without affording the creditors due process is state action. See [UCC] \u00a7 2-717.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1176-20\">. In their brief appellees argue that the sellers have such a greater bargaining position than do buyers, that they can extract from buyers virtually any advantage not prohibited by law. They then suggest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1176-21\">\u201cThe only control, in such a situation, is not what extent the weaker party, not even aware of the extent of his obligation, can compel the stronger party to protect his rights. The only control, in reality, is what the law guarantees to the weaker party, or prevents the stronger party from compelling him to forfeit. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1176-22\">By enacting the statute challenged herein, the state has, in a very real sense, determined precisely how repossession will occur.

At oral argument it was represented that all contracts and agreements in issue and in the record contained default and repossession provisions.
