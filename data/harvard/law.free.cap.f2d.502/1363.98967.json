In 1971; Thomas, on active duty in the United States Armed Forces, underwent an elective vasectomy operation at Sandia Base, New Mexico. He was then provided with an analysis report indicating he was sterile. Subsequently, Laurie became pregnant and bore a child. The Hartens then brought this action under the Act, in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, against the military medical personnel involved in the operation and the United States. The complaint alleged the operation had been negligently performed and that the Hartens had negligently been provided with an inaccurate analysis report. Additionally, the complaint requested $50,000 for the necessary costs of raising and maintaining the child to the age of eighteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-8\">The government moved to dismiss the suit on jurisdictional grounds. The trial court found that appellees had not exhausted their administrative remedies, and dismissed the suit without prejudice. Appellees then filed a motion for reconsideration, and stated that an administrative claim had been filed with and disapproved by the United States Army Claims Service. The motion further stated that appellees\u2019 counsel had inadvertently neglected to submit the claim to the court. The trial court vacated its order dismissing the suit and allowed the parties two months to file additional authorities concerning the government\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-14\">The government\u2019s motion placed primary emphasis on the doctrine announced in Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135, 71 S.Ct. 153, 95 L.Ed. 152 (1950), that \u201c[t]he Government is not liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act for injuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.\u201d The trial court found that a vasectomy operation was not \u201cincident to service\u201d and denied the government\u2019s motion, but stated that an immediate appeal could be taken because the order involved a \u201ccontrolling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-15\">The question presented by this appeal appears to be one of first impression in the Tenth Circuit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>Whether a serviceman\u2019s injury arises out of activity \u201cincident to service\u201d depends on whether it stems from an official military relationship between the negligent person and the serviceman. In other words, it depends on the claimant's \u201cstatus\u201d at the time of the injury. <em>See, e. g., </em>Henning v. United States, 446 F.2d 774 (3rd Cir. 1971), cert. den\u2019d, 404 U.S. 1016, 92 S.Ct. 676, 30 L.Ed.2d 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-5\">Thus, if a claimant is on leave,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or on inactive status at the time of the injury,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or if the injury is not the product of a military relationship,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> suit under the Act may be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-6\">On the other hand, when a serviceman on active duty sustains an injury stemming from the military relationship, courts consistently have denied recovery under the Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Surgery, whether elective or required, is \u201cincident to service\u201d when performed upon a serviceman on active duty because the serviceman is taking advantage of medical privileges granted only to military personnel. Herreman v. United States, 476 F.2d 234 (7th Cir. 1973). A ease in point is Lowe v. United States, 440 F.2d 452, 453 (5th Cir. 1971), cert. den\u2019d, 404 U.S. 833, 92 S.Ct. 83, 30 L.Ed.2d 64, where a serviceman on active duty underwent elective surgerv. In affirming the dismissal of the action the appellate court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1429-12\">[I]t is obvious that the injured man could not have been admitted, and would not have been admitted, to the Naval Hospital except for his military status. He was there treated by Naval medical personnel solely because of that status. It inescapably follows that whatever happened to him in that hospital and during the course of that treatment had to be \u201cin the course of activity incident to service.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1429-13\">We believe Harten\u2019s injuries were sustained in the course of activity incident to service and that a suit thereon cannot be maintained under the Act. The trial court\u2019s order denying the government\u2019s motion to dismiss is therefore reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1428-10\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b) provides, in part: \u201cSubject to the provisions of this title, the district courts . . . shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the United States, for money damages, accruing on and after January 1, 1945, for injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1428-16\">. An analogous case is Barr v. Brezina Const. Co., 464 F.2d 1141 (10th Cir. 1972), cert. den\u2019d, 409 U.S. 1125, 93 S.Ct. 937, 35 L.Ed.2d 256, which involved a third-party indemnity claim against the government. Brezina obtained a contract to do remodeling work on a building at Hill Air Force Base, in Utah, and sublet the installation of an access stairway. Barr, an airman on active duty, fell down the stairway while engaged in the performance of military duties. Barr instituted suit against Brezina, who settled for $45,000 and brought an indemnity action against the government on the grounds it knew the stairway was defective. The trial court dismissed the suit because, inter alia, Barr would have been precluded from direct recovery himself under the <em>Feres </em>doctrine. This Court affirmed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1429-7\">. In Brooks v. United States, 337 U.S. 49, 69 S.Ct. 918, 93 L.Ed. 1200 (1949), suit under the Act was permitted by a serviceman on leave who was negligently injured on a public highway when the vehicle in which he was riding was struck by a government vehicle driven by a government employee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1429-8\">.
