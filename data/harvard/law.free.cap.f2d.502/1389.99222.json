BROWN, Chief Judge, with whom GOLDBERG, Circuit Judge, joins',</author>\n<p id=\"AF0\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-19\">I dissent to the Court\u2019s failure to rehear this case en banc and on such rehearing reverse and remand the cause to the District Court with appropriate instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-21\">It is, first, enbancworthy, FRAP 35, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 46(c), as a case of major importance presenting recurring questions on which this Court in the past 20 years has spoken with a clear voice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-22\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-23\">But it is equally enbancworthy as such a case of importance because the result is, in my view, wrong and contrary to what we have consistently held.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-24\">The basic error in the beguiling opinion of the Court, Thompson v. Sheppard, 5 Cir., 1974, 490 F.2d 830, is that it confuses two things: (i) proof of discrimination by race (or sex) and (ii) the appropriate remedy once discrimination is found to exist, either in fact, in law, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-25\">Although there is loose language in the Court\u2019s opinion about failure of plaintiffs to carry their burden of proof there is really no problem of burden of proof in this case. On the initial hearing the trial court assumed that the burden was on the state jury selection officials. And the defended officials, without questioning that in the least, undertook to shoulder that burden. Indeed, except for a few superficial witnesses produced by plaintiffs on aspects which the trial court thought were insignificant, all of the witnesses were put on the stand by the officials. Assaying the 1972 petit and grand jury lists the revelations 'of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1390\">*1390</page-number>that hearing were so shocking that the Judge from the bench held the list to be unconstitutional by reason of discrimination against blacks, as a race, and women, both white and black.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-5\">This was the picture:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1454-6\">Table A</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1454-7\">Percentage of Blacks in the Over-21 Community Percent on Master Jury List Percent on Grand Jury List</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aru-dedup-0\">30.23% 12.48% 10.7%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Av-\">Percentage of Women in the Over-21 Community Percent on Blaster Jury List Percent on Grand Jury List</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Az0g\">52.68% 24% 12.48%</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1454-19\">The District Court ordered the officials to compile a new list which would contain more blacks and women. On the hearing to show cause why the revised list should not be approved the officials again produced all of the testimony. This showed improvement \u2014 even substantial improvement \u2014 but again there was revealed a staggering, uncontradict-ed, difference between the percentage of these classes in the adult population of the county and the percentage of such classes on the petit and grand jury lists. This glaring disparity was reflected not only on the difference in percentage points but, more significantly, the percentage of underrepresentation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1454-21\">Table B</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ3\">(1) (2) (3) .

Jury Commission of Greene County, 1970, 396 U.S. 320, 340, 90 S.Ct. 518, 529, 24 L.Ed.2d 549, 563 (emphasis added), quoting Louisiana v. United States, 1965, 380 U.S. 145, 85 S.Ct. 817, 13 L.Ed.2d 709. Acting under that duty the Judge ordered the preparation of a new and better list. But in the face of continued flagrant underrepresentation shown by Table B that same duty remained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-4\">No explanations really were offered as to why that result was the best attainable \u201cas far as possible\u201d, <em>Carter, supra. </em>And what evidence was offered, affirmatively proved a number of sources making the system vulnerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-5\">Intending no disparagement of the use of data computers in the law <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Court nevertheless seems in my view to be almost mesmerized because a data computer was used. But the role of the computer here was very limited and wholly mechanical. It did only two things. First it merely created a \u201cuniverse\u201d of 7,308 names from the most recent voter list<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of 29,204 voters, the racial-sex-composition of which was never established. And second it identified the race-sex categories in the \u201cuniverse\u201d. From that point on the computer did nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-8\">But the universe of 7,308 dwindled to 2,721 in the course of the further processing by the human beings comprising the officials. This was partly because of certain exemptions, required or claimed, in the answering questionnaire. But larger in numbers, in percentages, and legal significance under this Court\u2019s holding in Broadway v. Cul-pepper, 5 Cir., 1971, 439 F.2d 1253 were the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1455-9\">Addressees Not Returning Questionnaires 1,489</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1455-10\">Returned By Post Office, Address Unknown 1,240</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1455-11\">2,729</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1455-12\">Thus the so-called computer created \u201crandom\u201d list of 7,308 was nothing of the kind. At most the universe was reduced to 4,579. But even this was an illusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-13\">Although I think the Court\u2019s declaration that \u201ca jury list drawn objectively, mechanically, and at random from the entire voting list of a county is entitled to the presumption that it is drawn from a source which is a fairly representative cross-section.of the inhabitants of that jurisdiction\u201d, 490 F.2d at 833 is an acceptable working principle <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> its conclusion that the plaintiffs \u201cfailed to carry the burden * * * \u201d of \u201cshowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1392\">*1392</page-number>that the product of such a procedure is, in fact, constitutionally defective\u201d, <em>id., </em>is not sustainable on this record. In the first place, there was nothing to prove \u2014nothing, that is, beyond that shown by the testimony from the officials. And the result of the \u201csecond try\u201d was still glaring, spectacular, underrepresentation of 36% and 45% as to blacks. (See Table B.) This was proof that for some reason the so-called random selection from the voter list was not adequate to create a fair cross-section of the community.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6What those reasons might be, and more importantly, what steps should be taken to achieve a fair cross-section and eliminate the causes of the disparity were factual things which <em>Carter </em>and <em>Broadway, supra, </em>imposed on the officials to prove.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-4\">But having responded to the duty following the initial hearing the District Court at this point did nothing. It did not, for example, require or even consider whether sources other than voting lists ought to be used and if so what ones would be the most reliable. Nor did it require that undelivered or unanswered questionnaires be followed up.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nor did it require an explanation as to why more blacks than whites were excluded when grand jurors were selected under the subjective standards of.\u201cintelligence\u201d and \u201cuprightness\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-9\">Finally, the Court\u2019s decision is in conflict with other decisions with regard to the degree of underrepresentation held to require further remedial action. Thus, in Turner v. Fouche, 1970, 396 U. S. 346, 90 S.Ct. 532, 24 L.Ed.2d 567, the Supreme Court held that further relief was required upon a showing that only 37% of the master list was black in a county 60% black, an underrepresen-tation of 40%, and in Preston v. Mande-ville, 5 Cir., 1970, 428 F.2d 1392, the master list was 16% black in a county 29.3% black, an underrepresentation of 45.4%.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-10\">I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1454-54\">. This was obviously regarded as the significant thing in the analysis made by the Court in this excerpt from Alexander v. Louisiana, 1972, 405 U.S. 625, 629, 92 S.Ct. 1221, 1225, 31 L.Ed.2d 536, 541:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1454-55\">In Lafayette Parish, 21% of the population was Negro and 21 or over, therefore presumptively eligible for grand jury service. Use of questionnaires by the jury commissioners created a pool of possible grand jurors which was 14% Negro, a reduction by one-third of possible black grand jurors. The commissioners then twice culled this group to create a list of 400 prospective jurors, 7% of whom were Negro \u2014 a further reduction by one-half.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANvg\">Thus, in <em>Alexander, </em>the Court did not subtract 7% from 14% for a disparity of only 7%, but calculated that the reduction was one-half, <em>i. e., </em>50%.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1455-14\">.
