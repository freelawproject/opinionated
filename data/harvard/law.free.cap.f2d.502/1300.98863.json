They operated through a California corporation, Wyn-gate &amp; Bevins, Inc. The corporation mailed sexually explicit advertisements to persons on various mailing lists who had not solicited the material, mailed similar advertisements with each order, and advertised in various magazines. The United States indicted the two Rat-ners and Wyngate &amp; Bevins for violations of the federal obscenity statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1461. A jury found the defendants guilty. The trial court sentenced the individual defendants to five years imprisonment on each of seven counts, the sentences to run concurrently. The court fined Wyngate &amp; Bevins $35,000, $5,000 for each count. All the defendants appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-14\">We withheld decision of this appeal pending the progress through the courts of another obscenity case, in which some of the issues were identical and some related to those raised by the appellants here. That case was United States v. Groner, 5 Cir. 1972, 475 F.2d 550, rev\u2019d en banc, 1973, 479 F.2d 577, vacated, 414 U.S. 969, 94 S.Ct. 278, 38 L.Ed.2d 213. The Supreme Court remanded <em>Groner </em>for reconsideration in light of Miller v. California, 1973, 413 U.S. 18, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419, and its companion cases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This Court rendered its decision on remand on May 24, 1974. United States v. Groner, 5 Cir. 1974, 494 F.2d 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-15\">Shortly after this Court decided <em>Groner </em>on remand, the Supreme Court decided Hamling v. United States, 1974, 418 U.S. 87, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 41 L. Ed.2d 590. Together, <em>Groner </em>and <em>Ham-ling </em>squarely reject the following arguments of the appellants: (1) that the prosecution must introduce expert testimony to enable the jury to determine the obscenity of the material in question, (2) that evidence of pandering may not be admitted into evidence to show the obscenity of the materials in question where pandering has not been charged in the indictment,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (3) that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>mere knowledge of the character of the materials mailed, without knowledge that they are obscene, does not satisfy the constitutional and statutory requirements of scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-4\">The test of obscenity governing at the time of the trial was that set forth by the plurality in Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 1966, 383 U.S. 413, 86 S.Ct. 975, 16 L.Ed.2d 1:</p>\n<p id=\"Ah9\">\u201c. . . three elements must coalesce: it must be established that (a) the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to a prurient interest in sex; (b) the material is patently offensive because it affronts contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters; and (c) the material is utterly without redeeming social value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-7\">383 U.S. at 418, 86 S.Ct. at 977, 16 L.Ed.2d at 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-8\">The appellants do not contend that the charge given by the district court was inconsistent with that definition. Rather, they contend that the United States failed to establish the obscenity of the materials in question. We have examined the record and exhibits and find that the jury could reasonably find, as it did, that the materials were obscene under the <em>Memoirs </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-9\"> After the appellants had been convicted, however, and while this appeal was pending, the Supreme Court decided Miller v. California, 1973, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419, \u2022 and its companion cases. The <em>Miller </em>reformulation of the test of obscenity provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"abn-dedup-0\">\u201cThe basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be: (a) whether \u2018the average person, applying contemporary community standards\u2019 would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law, and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1366-14\">413 U.S. at 24, 93 S.Ct. at 2615, 37 L.Ed.2d at 431 (citations omitted). We find no basis for believing that the defendants would have fared better had they been tried under this standard of obscenity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See Hamling v. United States, 1974, 418 U.S. 87, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 41 L.Ed.2d 590, 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-15\">The appellants further contend that their conviction as to Count 6 must be reversed because there is a fatal variance between the allegations made in that count and the proof offered by the government at trial. They did not raise this objection at trial. They are barred from raising it on appeal under Rule 51, Fed.R.Crim.P., unless it constitutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>\u201cplain error\u201d. See United States v. Hyde, 5 Cir. 1971, 448 F.2d 815; Pur-year v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 378 F.2d 29. We find that the alleged variance does not rise to the level of \u201cplain error\u201d. We decline, therefore, to consider whether there was a variance at all, or if there was, whether it was material.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-4\">The appellants raise other points on this appeal. We have considered all of the appellants\u2019 contentions. We conclude that they do not merit discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1365-16\">.

The court liad instructed the jury that it might consider evidence of pandering in determining whether the materials mailed were obscene. This instruction was proper under Ginzburg v. United States, 1966, 383 U.S. 463, 86 S.Ct. 942, 16 L.Ed.2d 31. The ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>pellants also argue that there was insufficient evidence of pandering to justify such an instruction. This argument deserves little discussion. The advertising material mailed by the appellants was sufficiently lurid to permit a jury to infer that it pandered to the prurient interest of recipients.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1366-10\">. In general, the effect of the <em>Miller </em>standard is to relax appellate review of the jury\u2019s findings. This is implicit in the court\u2019s emphasis that what \u201cappeals to the prurient interest\u201d and what is \u201cpatently offensive\u201d are \u201cessentially questions of fact\u201d, which the jurors may resolve by reference to the standards of their <em>local </em>community, rather than to \u201csome hypothetical standard of the entire United States of America.\u201d 413 U.S. at 31, 93 S.Ct. at 2618, 37 L.Ed.2d at 434, 435. In this case, as in <em>Hamling, </em>the district court instructed the jury that it must apply a national standard. We conclude, as the Supreme Court concluded in <em>Hamling, </em>that consideration of the record and the charge as a whole shows that there is no substantial probability that elimination of the references to a \u201cnational community\u201d would have materially affected the jury\u2019s deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-17\">The <em>Miller </em>standard is also less stringent to the extent that it discards the \u201cutterly without redeeming social value\u201d test of <em>Memoirs </em>in favor of a test requiring only that \u201cthe work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\u201d 413 U.S. at 24, 93 S.Ct. at 2615, 37 L.Ed.2d at 431-432 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
