He sued Respondent under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act (hereinafter' FELA), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51 et seq., seeking compensation for personal injuries and expenses caused by the railroad\u2019s alleged negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">During pretrial proceedings, Petitioner discovered that Respondent had scheduled private interviews with the railroad-designated physicians who had treated him. Petitioner objected to the private nature of the proposed interviews. His manner of objection was, according to the District Court, to threaten a suit in an Ohio state court to enjoin the doctors from talking with Respondent\u2019s attorneys, based on the argument that such discussions would violate the physician-patient privilege which Petitioner asserts under Ohio law. The District Court also intimated that Petitioner had threatened the physicians with a malpractice action if they talked with Respondent\u2019s lawyers. The physicians are apparently unwilling to talk privately with Respondent\u2019s attorneys under the cloud of Petitioner\u2019s threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">In order to assure the physicians that Petitioner\u2019s threat was based on an unfounded assumption (that the physician-patient privilege existed in this case), Respondent requested the District Court to order Petitioner to sign waivers of the privilege, \u201cso as to permit counsel for defendant to interview, privately, plaintiff\u2019s treating physicians,\u201d in the words of the District Court. The District Court granted the motion. It ordered Petitioner to present a complete list of names and addresses of \u201cevery doctor whom he has consulted at any time in relation to anything.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s counsel was then to \u201cdetermine what consultations or treatments have any . relevance to this case.\u201d Next, Petitioner was to file a list of doctors with relevant knowledge. Along with this list, Petitioner was told to file \u201ca waiver or consent in respect of each doctor . clearly consenting to the doctor involved talking to defense counsel and disclosing anything involved in his professional relationship with the plaintiff if the doctor sc wishes.\u201d The Court emphasized that the choice of whether to talk with Respondent\u2019s attorneys was that of the doctors, not that of Petitioner. The District Court further stated that a civil contempt order would issue if Petitioner failed to do these things. In the alternative, the District Court offered to dismiss the action without prejudice if Petitioner agreed to take his case to a state court, where the District Court advised Petitioner he would \u201cbe governed . probably by Ohio law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">On March 23, 1973, a document in the form of an order was initialed by the district judge with his longhand inscription, \u201cWill enter unless prohibited.\u201d On the face of this document, over the district judge\u2019s signature appears his longhand notation: <em>\u201cTo the Clerk </em>\u2014 File &amp; enter on docket as a <em>Proposed </em>Order (not an Order).\u201d A copy of that document is affixed to the petition presently before us, and the fact that it is entirely unconformed has occasioned difficulty in our consideration. It seems apparent from the extensive attention which has been directed to the issue attempted to be presented to this Court, both in the District Court and here, that the present proceeding is one agreed upon below, tacitly if not expressly, as designed to elicit an advisory opinion. We decline the invitation to resolve an issue not properly before us. See, Wright, Law of Federal Courts, \u00a7 102; Labuy v. Howes Leather Company, 352 U.S. 249, 77 S.Ct. 309, 1 L.Ed.2d 290 (1957); Will v. United States, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>389 U.S. 90, 88 S.Ct. 269, 19 L.Ed.2d 305 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">We express no opinion concerning the <em>\u201cProposed </em>Order\u201d other than to determine that its existence, and notation thereof on the docket of the District Court, does not clothe this Court with jurisdiction to entertain an interlocutory appeal not certified to us pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) or otherwise, and the Petition For Writ of Prohibition is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
