Several panels of this court, at differing stages, have reviewed the underlying controversy in connection with a petition for writ of mandamus brought by Fidelity Television, Inc., to compel the Federal Communications Commission to issue a decision in that proceeding which had been pending before it for almost eight years. The court ultimately dismissed the mandamus petition as moot when the Commission finally rendered a decision on 6 December 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-14\">Fidelity subsequently filed a petition to review the 6 December order in this court. Contending that the decision is not a final order after all, the Commission now moves to dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction. We hold that the Commission\u2019s decision of 6 December constituted a final order for purposes of judicial review, and accordingly deny the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-15\">I. HISTORY OF THE LOS ANGELES PROCEEDING</p>\n<p id=\"b508-16\">There are in fact two Commission proceedings involved in this matter. The 6 December order at issue emanated from what we shall refer to as the Los Angeles proceeding, which was initiated in <em>19 6S </em>by the filing of an application by RKO General, Inc., for renewal of its license to operate station KHJ-TV in Los Angeles<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and of the mutually exclusive application by Fidelity for a construction permit to operate on the same frequency.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under consideration in another proceeding still pending before the Commission, which we shall designate the Boston proceeding, are a license renewal application filed by RKO for station WNAC-TV in Boston and mutually exclusive applications filed by two other corporations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-17\">Comparative hearings were held in the Los Angeles proceeding in 1967, which culminated in a decision by the Hearing Examiner<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> on 13 August 1969, <em>five years ago, </em>awarding the license to Fidelity as the preferable applicant on a comparative basis.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Pending appeal to the Commission, however, RKO was permitted to continue operation* of KHJ-TV pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 307(d);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>that </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number><em>interim authority continues to date. </em>In addition to consideration of RKO\u2019s past service and comparison of RKO and Fidelity in the areas of local ownership, diversification of mass communications media, and local support, the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision was based in part on evidence of alleged coercive reciprocal trade practices between RKO and its parent corporation, General Tire and Rubber Company,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as those practices affected RKO\u2019s qualifications to operate KHJ-TV.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That evidence of anti-trust activity persuaded the Department of Justice to file a brief <em>amicus curiae </em>with the Commission urging it to disqualify RKO as a licensee.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Evidence of RKO\u2019s alleged antitrust activities and other corporate misconduct was also adduced on a broader scope in hearings in the Boston proceeding, which began in 1971, to determine whether RKO should be disqualified as a licensee of WNAC-TV. On the basis of the more extensive evidence being produced in that proceeding, the Commission\u2019s Broadcast Bureau petitioned the Commission to reopen the record in the Los Angeles proceeding \u2014 which was then before the Commission on review of the Hearing Examiner's decision \u2014 to introduce the additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-13\">By order of 2 August 1971<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the Commission denied the Bureau\u2019s request, resolving instead to proceed expeditiously with its review. The Commission stated that the Boston proceeding was immaterial to its evaluation of the record in the Los Angeles proceeding and the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision, and that it would become material only if the Commission reversed the Hearing Examiner and concluded on the basis of the Los Angeles record that RKO was the preferable applicant. The order provided that if the Commission did determine that RKO was to be preferred, award of its license would be subject to the outcome of the Boston proceeding and its revelations concerning the antitrust allegations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>It is significant to note for purposes of the motion before us that the Commission\u2019s 1971 order neither consolidated the two proceedings, nor permitted the record to be reopened for receiving the antitrust evidence from the Boston proceeding, though it did permit Fidelity to participate in that aspect of the Boston proceeding which pertained to RKO\u2019s alleged antitrust activity.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">In August 1971 RKO filed with the Commission, and subsequently supplemented, a petition to dismiss Fidelity\u2019s application or, alternatively, to enlarge the issues and reopen the record for further hearings, alleging that Fidelity had failed timely to report to the Commission changes in its corporate structure and acquisition of certain newspaper interests by one of its stockholders. On 28 September 1971 the Commission ordered that the issue be addressed at oral argument, which was held on 12 October 1971, over two years after the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision. The Commission did not act on RKO\u2019s petition until two years after argument, when it dismissed the petition as moot.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">On 22 March 1973, nearly two years after the Commission's announced decision (2 August 1971) to proceed expeditiously with its review of the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision, Fidelity filed in this court a petition for writ of mandamus to compel the Commission to reach a final decision. The sole explanation for the delay offered by the Commission was that it was simply adhering to the procedure it had announced in its order of 2 August 1971. As the Commission then interpreted that order, it had decided to await the termination of the Bos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>ton proceeding before reviewing the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision in the Los Angeles proceeding. <em>&gt;</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">In view of the Commission\u2019s unequivocal statement in its 2 August order that it would \u201cproceed with a <em>disposition </em>of the Los Angeles proceeding on the basis of the evidence <em>now </em>of record,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and that the Boston proceeding would be <em>relevant only if, </em>after review of that record, the Commission reversed the Hearing Examiner on the merits,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> this court concluded in an order released 11 June 1973 <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> that the Commission\u2019s decision in the Los Angeles proceeding had been unreasonably delayed in contravention of section 10(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> But, \u201cbeing satisfied that [the Commission would] act in accord with\u201d that finding \u201cwithout the necessity of the issuance of a writ of mandamus\u201d to compel a final decision, the court ordered the petition held in abeyance for 30 days during which time the Commission was directed to file a statement of the action it had taken in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Exactly 30 days later, the Commission represented to the court that on 2 July it had \u201cinstructed the staff to prepare a written decision as expeditiously as possible.\u201d On the basis of that representation, and in the belief that it was made in good faith and that the Commission intended to fulfill its directive, the court denied the petition for writ of mandamus on 20 September 1973, \u201cwithout prejudice to its renewal in the event a <em>final decision </em>on petitioner\u2019s application is further unreasonably delayed\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Two months later, when it had been in excess of four years since the Hearing Examiner\u2019s initial decision, over five months since this court\u2019s determination that the final decision had been unreasonably delayed, and more than four months from the date the Commission ordered its staff to prepare a decision, Fidelity renewed its petition for writ of mandamus in accordance with this court\u2019s order of 20 September 1973. On 10 December, as a ruling on Fidelity\u2019s petition was about to issue, the court received a letter from Fidelity\u2019s counsel notifying the court that the Commission, by a three-to-two vote, rendered a decision reversing the Hearing Examiner.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Commission concluded that RKO was the preferable applicant on a comparative basis,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and in view of that conclusion dismissed as moot RKO\u2019s petition to dismiss Fidelity\u2019s application.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Commissioner Reid joined in the decision by Commissioner Robert E. Lee. Chairman Burch, who has since left the Commission, concurred in the result only. Commissioners Johnson and H. Rex Lee, who have since resigned, vigorously dissented.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">Fidelity\u2019s notification, a copy of which was sent to counsel for the Commission and for RKO, requested the court to dismiss its renewed petition for writ of mandamus \u201cas moot\u201d in light of the 6 December order. The Commission did not respond in any fashion to the notification or the request to dismiss. Accordingly, the court on 21 December dismissed the renewed petition for mandamus as moot. The Commission now contends, in the instant motion filed two months after the petition for review was filed by Fidelity, that its 6 December order is <em>not a final decision </em>and therefore is not properly before the court at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>II. FINALITY OF THE ORDER OF 6 DECEMBER 1973</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">This court\u2019s jurisdiction over decisions by the Commission is controlled by section 402(b)(1) of the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and judicial interpretations of these statutes. Section 402(b)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">Appeals may be taken from decisions and orders of the Commission to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in any of the following cases:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">(1) By any applicant for a construction permit or station license, whose application is denied by the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Under section 10, \u201c[ajgency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court are subject to judicial review. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">The 6 December order reversed the Hearing Examiner\u2019s conclusion that on a comparative basis Fidelity should be preferred over RKO, the only other applicant in the Los Angeles proceeding. Yet the Commission steadfastly maintains that the decision is not presently reviewable because it did not finally \u201cdeny\u201d Fidelity\u2019s application within the meaning of section 402(b)(1). Counsel point to the concluding paragraph of the 6 December order which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-9\">[It is ordered:]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-10\">(d) That the application of RKO General, Inc. ... IS DEEMED- TO BE GRANTED, and that the application of Fidelity Television, Inc. ... IS DEEMED TO BE DENIED, subject to whatever action may be deemed appropriate following resolution of the matters in [the Boston proceeding].<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-17\">To bolster their position, counsel include as part of their motion the affidavit of Vincent J. Mullins, Secretary of the Commission, which asserts, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c[n]o license has been issued, on condition or otherwise.\u201d Additionally, they argue that the Commission could not finally grant RKO\u2019s application because of the outstanding antitrust issues in the Boston proceeding which could lead to disqualification of or a comparative demerit against RKO with respect to its operation of KHJ-TV. Nor could the Commission grant Fidelity\u2019s application, it is urged, where RKO\u2019s petition to reject Fidelity\u2019s application, which alleged misconduct on the part of Fidelity, was dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-18\">The principle of finality in administrative law is not, however, governed by the administrative agency\u2019s characterization of its action, but rather by a realistic assessment of the nature and effect of the order sought to be reviewed.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Hence, \u201ca final order need not necessarily be the very last order\u201d in an agency proceeding,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> but rather, is final for purposes of judicial review when it \u201cimposes[s] an obligation, denies] a right, or fix[es] some legal relationship as a consummation of the administrative process.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s appraisal of its order ignores these principles and the immediate and continuing impact of the order on Fidelity.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>A. <em>Indicia of Finality Within the Order Itself and Its Historical Context</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\"> That the 6 December order is final for purposes of judicial review is demonstrated on the face of the order itself and as read in light of past orders of this court and the Commission in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">As we noted earlier,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> by its order of 2 August 1971, the Commission elected <em>to \u201cproceed to the disposition </em>of the Los Angeles proceeding on the basis of the evidence\u201d produced in that proceeding, <em>rather than </em>reopen the record or consolidate the case with the Boston proceeding for a more comprehensive inquiry into the allegations of RKO\u2019s antitrust activities. The Commission <em>now </em>contends that it is <em>the lack of such an expanded inquiry </em>in the Los Angeles proceeding which renders the 6 December order inappropriate for judicial review. However, <em>it is clear that the 2 August order contemplated a final evaluation of the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision, </em>and that the outcome of the Boston proceeding would act only as a possible condition subsequent in the event the Commission reversed the Hearing Examiner\u2019s award to Fidelity. The merit of Fidelity\u2019s application simply was never made contingent in any manner on the Boston proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">The 6 December order itself purports to be a complete review of the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision in favor of Fidelity. The Commission adopted his findings of facts, with certain modifications, but reversed his conclusions.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Except for the question of general anticompetitive activity being investigated in the Boston proceeding and the questions raised by RKO\u2019s petition to dismiss and rejected by the Commission as moot, all the comparative qualifications of RKO and Fidelity were evaluated at length by the Hearing Examiner and on review by the Commission,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> which concluded on the basis of this extensive evaluation that RKO was the preferred applicant. The finality of that determination is manifest in the 6 December order.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> If the Commission intended merely an interim appraisal of the competing applications on the basis of the Los Angeles record, we are at a loss to decipher why the Commission undertook such a thorough review of each applicant\u2019s qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-16\">Moreover, an <em>interim decision </em>is not what was involved in the two mandamus proceedings. The Commission was confronted by two decisions of this court wherein we unequivocally concluded that a <em>final order </em>in the Los Angeles proceeding <em>must issue, </em>but declined to so order the Commission on the basis of its representations that a final decision was forthcoming.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <em>The 6 December Commission order either expressed the Cornumission\u2019s purported effort to comply with this court\u2019s implied </em>directives,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <em>or was a deliberate effort to deceive this court or evade its decision.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-17\">Fidelity interpreted the 6 December order as final. As we noted earlier,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> in November 1973, four months after the Commission\u2019s representation that it would reach an expeditious decision in the Los Angeles proceeding, Fidelity renewed its efforts to compel a final decision. When it learned that the 6 December order had issued, it felt that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>relief it sought \u2014 release of a final order \u2014had been provided by the Commission, and accordingly requested the court to dismiss its renewed petition for writ of mandamus as moot. Had the Commission felt that the order was <em>not </em>a final determination, we fail to perceive why the Commission did not respond to this request. Regarding the Commission\u2019s silence as indicative of its concurrence, we dismissed the petition as moot. The Commission\u2019s attempt at this late stage to hinder Fidelity\u2019s efforts to obtain judicial review on the ground that the order is not final is perturbing, to say the least.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Another aspect of the 6 December order which reveals its finality is its disposition of RKO\u2019s petition to dismiss Fidelity\u2019s application for a license as moot. If the 6 December order was not a final resolution of the Los Angeles proceeding, the Commission\u2019s rationale indis-missing RKO\u2019s petition escapes us, since such a dismissal is logical only if a final decision on the basis of that record had been made. The order suggests that absent this court\u2019s past orders in this case, the Commission would \u201cordinarily enlarge the issues and remand [the record to the Hearing Examiner] for a further hearing to determine all of the facts surrounding [RKO\u2019s allegations] and their impact upon both the basic and comparative qualifications of Fidelity before considering a grant of its application.\u201d <footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Yet the Commission sat on RKO\u2019s petition for over two years before acting. The Commission has never explained to this court why it did not attempt a further inquiry during that time. Thus, it cannot at this point rely on the absence of a complete record on that issue as grounds for dismissing this appeal. Furthermore, although RKO\u2019s petition was dismissed by the Commission \u201cas moot,\u201d according to the 6 December order the Commission <em>did </em>consider the allegations contained in the petition and addressed during argument on 12 October 1971 in its evaluation of Fidelity\u2019s qualifications.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> As Commissioner H. Rex Lee demurred in his dissent to the 6 December order, the Commission \u201ccannot reject or dismiss requests for hearing issues and then use the questions raised by the requests against the applicant in the comparative evaluation.\u201d <footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">B. <em>Impact on Fidelity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">The impact of the 6 December order on Fidelity buttresses our conclusion that the order is presently reviewable. Even if the order \u201cdeeming\u201d the denial of Fidelity\u2019s application is eventually reversed in the event RKO\u2019s award is vacated as a result of the Boston proceeding, Fidelity has felt and will continue to experience for some time the consequences of the 6 December order. Five years ago the Hearing Examiner concluded that Fidelity\u2019s application should be granted. However, RKO was permitted to continue its operation of KHJ-TV pending appeal to the Commission. That operation will continue at least until the Boston proceeding is terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">Therefore, the fact that no award has actually been granted RKO is irrelevant since, under the Commission\u2019s characterization of the 6 December order, an award is presently <em>unnecessary.</em><footnotemark><em>37</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Inas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>much as the Boston proceeding <em>began six years after </em>the Los Angeles proceeding, and involves a considerably broader investigation, it is unlikely that the Boston proceeding will terminate in the near future.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Until that time, Fidelity is denied the right to construct its station to which the Hearing Examiner concluded it was entitled. Hence, the effect of the 6 December order will be felt in a concrete way for quite some time.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">C. <em>Effect of Review on the Administrative Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The 6 December order may not be the very last order issued by the Commission in the Los Angeles proceeding if RKO ultimately loses its license for KHJ-TV as a result of the Boston proceeding. But as we have endeavored to emphasize, this eventuality does not defeat review at this time. The order was promulgated at the highest level of the Commission after complete evaluation of the entire evidence produced in a proceeding which, as early as 1971, the Commission decided to isolate from the Boston proceeding. That the only applicants involved in the Los Angeles proceeding were RKO and Fidelity, whose comparative qualifications have now been resolved on the basis of the complete record compiled in that proceeding, is persuasive of the order\u2019s finality. <em>There simply will be no further orders based on that record.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">The Commission nevertheless persists in its view that the contingency of the Boston proceeding renders the 6 December order an interim, and hence unre-viewable, decision. While it is true that an agency decision is inappropriate for judicial scrutiny where the court\u2019s intervention would \u201cdisrupt the orderly process of adjudication,\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> an analysis of the alternatives remaining to the Commission belie the Commission\u2019s asserted fears in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">In response to our question at oral argument on this motion,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> counsel for the Commission assured the court that if, as a result of the Boston proceeding, the 6 December award to RKO for renewal of KHJ-TV were vacated, and if Fidelity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>were not otherwise disqualified. Fidelity, the only remaining applicant, would be granted a construction permit for Channel 9. Accepting this representation as true, and while we need not speculate at this stage exactly how the court may ultimately dispose of the appeal, we foresee the following eventualities, none of which would be disturbed by review of the 6 December order at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">First, in the event the court affirms the Commission and no decisive evidence of anticompetitive activity on the part of RKO is developed in the Boston proceeding, RKO preserves its license for KHJ-TV. Second, even if the court affirms the Commission and the revelations of the Boston proceeding subsequently compel the Commission to vacate the 6 December order, then Fidelity, as the lone survivor of the Los Angeles proceeding, will simply obtain its .construction permit, if it is not otherwise disqualified, in accordance with the Commission\u2019s representations to this court at oral argument. Third, assuming the court reverses the 6 December decision that RKO is the preferable applicant on the basis of the Los Angeles record and remands the case to the Commission for further proceedings, then regardless of the outcome of the Boston proceeding, Fidelity, the only other contender in the Los Angeles proceeding, would obtain its license if it is not otherwise disqualified. These are the possibilities; none would cause disruption in the Commission\u2019s adjudication of the Los Angeles proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The tardigrade pace taken by the Commission with respect to Fidelity\u2019s repeated efforts just to obtain a ruling has now consumed nine years. The Commission took over two years before hearing argument in October 1971 on exceptions to the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision, and lingered another two years over the decision it resolved in 1971 to reach expeditiously, which it handed down only after prodding by this court. While assuring the court that it would reach the final decision we determined was mandatory, the Commission now maintains that the decision in fact is not final, since Fidelity\u2019s application is only \u201cdeemed\u201d to be denied. We cannot condone the Commission\u2019s attempted eradication of Fidelity\u2019s right to judicial review simply by its coinage of the phrase \u201cdeem to deny,\u201d in apparent defiance of this court\u2019s determination that a final decision should issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">Not only has the Commission procrastinated in ruling on Fidelity\u2019s application, but we find the Commission\u2019s arguments, its characterizations of events and the numerous orders involved in this case, and its various actions throughout this controversy to have been less than candid. It has been given the benefit of the doubt in the past by being afforded the opportunity to explain its delay and to reach a decision without being ordered to do so by this court, despite our finding that a final decision had been unreasonably delayed. The only explanation it ever offered for the delay was a patent misreading of its 2 August 1971 order.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">Despite the labels the Commission affixes to its various actions in this matter and the 6 December order, it is clear beyond peradventure that the December order is a final determination of Fidelity\u2019s application on the basis of the record in the Los Angeles proceeding. The Hearing Examiner' considered that record sufficient for his decision. The Justice Department was persuaded by that record to recommend that RKO be disqualified. The Commission felt that the record was sufficient for it to review and overturn the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision, without reopening the record or consolidating the case with the Boston proceeding. Hence, that record should be sufficient for this court to undertake a meaningful review. If the 6 December order cannot be sustained on the record compiled in the Los Angeles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>proceeding, the sole basis for the order, it will fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The Commission\u2019s 6 December 1973 order will be set for full review on the merits in September 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-10\">.

We see no purpose in reopening the Los Angeles proceeding either for the introduction of evidence concerning alleged antitrust activities of General Tire and RKO or for a hearing on the issues added by the Review Board. On the basis of his comparison of the qualifications of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>two applicants, the Examiner recommended against a renewal of the KHJ-TV license and in favor of a grant of Fidelity\u2019s application for a construction permit. Only if the Examiner committed errors of decisional significance in his comparative analysis and the Commission contemplates a grant of the RKO renewal application will the additional evidence sought to be introduced be material to a decision on the KHJ-TV renewal application. In these circumstances we believe that the better and more expedient procedure is as follows :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">(a) Deny the Bureau\u2019s motion to reopen and proceed with the disposition of the Los Angeles proceeding on the basis of the evidence now of record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">(b) Grant the request of the parties for oral argument and hold oral argument on the exceptions in Dockets Nos. 16679-16680 at the time and place scheduled herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-8\">(c) Make Fidelity a party to the Boston proceeding but limit its participation to matters pertaining to RKO\u2019s character qualifications to be a Commission licensee either by reason of antitrust or anticompeti-tive activities or by reason of the alleged conduct which forms the basis for the issues added by the Review. Board. In this connection we note that counsel which represents Fidelity in the Los Angeles proceeding also represents Community Broadcasting of Boston, Inc., a competing applicant in the Boston case; and the same firm of attorneys represents RKO in both proceedings. Therefore, we believe that neither RKO nor Fidelity, nor in fact any other party to these proceedings, will be prejudiced or inconvenienced by the procedure herein adopted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-12\">(d) In the event the Commission determines that on a comparative basis KHJ-TV is the preferable applicant, defer the issuance of a final decision until the conclusion of the Boston adjudicatory pro\u2019 ceeding in Dockets Nos. 18759-18761, and thereafter take such action as appears to be appropriate in light of the evidence introduced in, and the outcome of, the Boston proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-13\"><em>The procedure adopted herein will enable the Commission to proceed with the Los Angeles matter and bring it to a conclusion </em>with no risk to the public interest.

In Johnston Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 88 U.S.App.D.C. 90, 187 F.2d 202 (1950), a Commission order denying a petition by Johnston for a final grant of a construction permit was not reviewable as a final denial because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Commission had determined that the application should be considered in a comparative hearing. In Pauley v. FCC, 86 U.S.App.D.C. 294, 187 F.2d 292 (1950), where the Commission had scheduled several applications for comparative hearings, the severance of one application until the applicant\u2019s eligibility was evaluated was held unreviewable. In both of these cases, the Commission had not completed the comparative hearing scheduled in the proceeding at issue. In the case at bar, comparative hearings on RKO\u2019s and Fidelity\u2019s competing applications were concluded in 1969 and a decision by the Commission on the merits of the Hearing Examiner\u2019s award has issued.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b515-8\">.
