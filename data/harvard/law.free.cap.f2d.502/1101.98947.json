Cruz, Jr., a prisoner of the State of Texas, sued the three members of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles under the Civil Rights Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Cruz prayed for compensatory and punitive damages for their refusal to grant him parole; a declaratory judgment that he is entitled to be paroled; and an injunction against the board members\u2019 denial of his parole rights. The district court dismissed the complaint <em>sua sponte </em>for failure to state a claim. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-23\">The appellant\u2019s claim for monetary damages arose from the board members\u2019 failure to grant him parole. The district court held that the board members are immune from suit for damages under the Civil Rights Act, citing as authority Silver v. Dickson, 9 Cir., 1968, 403 F.2d 642, cert. denied, 394 U. S. 990, 89 S.Ct. 1477, 22 L.Ed.2d 765 (1969). The Ninth Circuit stated its holding in <em>Silver </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-24\">\u201cIn our opinion the members of the California Adult Authority and other state officials are, while employed in the processing of applications for parole, performing quasi-judicial functions. They therefore have immunity from suits for damages under the Civil Rights Act, just as do other public employees engaged in the performance of quasi-judicial duties. * * *\u201d 403 F.2d at 643.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>We are in full agreement with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision, and accordingly with the ruling below based on it. See, also, Keeton v. Procunier, 9 Cir., 1972, 468 F.2d 810, cert. denied, 411 U.S. 987, 93 S.Ct. 2276, 36 L.Ed.2d 965.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-4\">The district court denied appellant Cruz\u2019s claims for declaratory and injunctive relief on authority of Preiser v. Rodriquez, 411 U.S. 475, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439. The court below held that since the relief sought by Cruz was release from confinement, his proper federal remedy would be habeas corpus after exhaustion of his available state remedies. We agree. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b); Keeton v. Procunier, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1166-5\">The judgment of the district court dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint is due to be, and is hereby,</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A7b\">. 42 U.S.C., \u00a7 1981 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
