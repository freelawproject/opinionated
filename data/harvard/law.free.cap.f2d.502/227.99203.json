On April 16 and 17, 1973, Phillips was tried before a jury. At that trial, the government sought to prove that Phillips was one of four armed men who had entered the bank, perpetrated a robbery in the bank during which a gun was fired, and then made off with some $34,000 in bank funds. Phillips\u2019 counsel sought to establish an alibi defense, and specifically challenged prosecution witnesses whose testimony tended to place Phillips in the bank during the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-15\">At the conclusion of the evidence, and after closing statements by counsel, the district judge proceeded to instruct the jury on, among other things, the necessary elements of the crimes charged.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury retired to consider its verdict, but before concluding its deliberations posed the following query to the district judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-16\">\u201cIf we believe that Phillips was involved in the bank robbery <em>but not at the bank at the time of the robbery </em>is he considered guilty or not guilty ?\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-17\">(Emphasis added)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>The district judge responded to the jury\u2019s question with the following supplementary instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">\u201cI specifically tell you that insofar as the question of robbery of the bank, <em>if you do not believe, that Phillips was in the bank, he could not be found guilty of the crime of robbery of that bank. </em>If you believe that the event, that his participation was not as one of those who were in the bank, I repeat, you could not find him guilty of robbery of that bank.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> [Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">However, the district court proceeded to instruct the jury that it might find Phillips guilty of possession of, or disposing of, what he knew to be the proceeds of the bank robbery. This offense was styled by the trial judge a \u201clesser included offense\u201d under the indictment for bank robbery.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Ten minutes after the supplementary instruction was given, the jury returned the following verdict:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-9\">\u201cWe, the jury, find the defendant guilty of the lesser offense of possession of stolen money with knowledge that the money was stolen from the bank.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">On July 18, 1973, the district court set aside the conviction based on possession, on the grounds that it was not included in the indictment, and granted Phillips a new trial, \u201cto proceed only upon the lesser included charge of possession of money, knowing the same to have been stolen in a bank robbery.\u201d In September of 1973, the grand jury issued a new indictment, under U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2113(c), charging Phillips only with illegally possessing the money which he had earlier been indicted for stealing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On motion by the government, the earlier indictment for bank robbery was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-15\">Phillips proceeded to trial upon the new indictment on November 14, 1973. Prior to the swearing in of the jury, Phillips' counsel moved the district court to prohibit the introduction of any evidence tending to show Phillips\u2019 presence in the bank at the time of the robbery. The stated ground for this motion was that the issue of Phillips\u2019 presence at the bank during the robbery had been adjudicated in Phillips\u2019 favor at the first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-16\">Counsel for Phillips maintained that the first jury, by having failed to convict him of bank robbery, the offense for which he was primarily charged in the first trial, had determined that he was not in the bank during the robbery. Phillips\u2019 motion to exclude evidence showing his participation in the robbery was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-17\">The jury was sworn, the second trial proceeded, and the government, over continuing objection by Phillips\u2019 counsel, proferred evidence tending to establish that Phillips participated in the robbery itself, and specifically that he had been in the bank. Government counsel made several statements to show that Phillips had taken an active part in the robbery.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Before the jury returned, the district court gave the following instruction regarding the evidence of Phillips\u2019 involvement in the robbery:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-18\">\u201cAny evidence admitted at this trial concerning statements alleged to have been made by the defendant that he participated or had any connection with the bank robbery was admitted only on the question of knowledge of the defendant that if he possessed any money taken in the robbery he possessed it knowing it had been stolen.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYD\">The jury found Phillips guilty of possession of the stolen money, with knowledge that it had been stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>On this appeal Phillips invokes the principle of collateral estoppel and contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that the district court erred in admitting evidence at the second trial that tended to prove he was present at the bank when the robbery took place. Phillips further contends that testimony as to what occurred in the bank at the time of the robbery prejudiced him, since it showed the use of force on bank personnel. Phillips asserts that because of the prejudicial nature of this evidence, he is entitled to a new trial. We agree, and reverse Phillips\u2019 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Collateral estoppel \u201cmeans simply that when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Considerations of judicial economy, conservation of public funds, and avoidance of multiple litigations underly the doctrine.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Implicit, of course, in any limitation on relitigation of issues already determined in the criminal context is an appreciation of the substantial burdens, psychological as well as otherwise, placed on one who must defend against criminal prosecution.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> At least since 1916, collateral estoppel has been an acknowledged rule of federal criminal law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Since 1970, the rule has been recognized as an integral aspect of federal constitutional law as well, under the Fifth Amendment\u2019s guarantee against double jeopardy.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This Court, too, has heretofore signalled its acceptance of the general principle, and its readiness to apply it in an appropriate case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">Perhaps the most vexatious task facing a court in the application of collateral estoppel is the determination whether a particular factual issue has been settled by the prior adjudication.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> At common law, the inquiry was often an excruciatingly technical one, the court having to cull \u201cultimate fact\u201d from \u201cmediate data\u201d with an almost thomistic exactitude.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The federal courts, however, have exhibited a marked tendency to forego over-refined technique in favor of a more practical approach, at least in criminal cases. This modern attitude is articulated in Ashe v. Swenson, <em>supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A63\">\u201cThe Federal decisions have made clear that the rule of collateral estop-pel in criminal cases is not to be applied with the hyper-technical and archaic approach of a 19th century pleading book, but with realism and rationality. Where a previous judgment of acquittal was based upon a general verdict, as is usually the case, this approach requires a court to \u2018examine the record of a prior proceeding, taking into account the pleadings, evidence, charge, and other relevant matter, and conclude whether a rational jury could have grounded its verdict upon an issue other than that which the defendant seeks to foreclose from consideration.\u2019 The inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>\u2018must be set in a practical frame and viewed with an eye to all the circumstances of the proceedings.\u2019 Sealfon v. United States, 332 U.S. 575, 579, 68 S.Ct. 237, 240, 92 L.Ed. 180. Any test more mechanically restrictive would, of course, simply amount to a rejection of the rule of collateral estoppel in criminal proceedings, at least in every case where the first judgment was based upon a general verdict of acquittal.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Among the \u201chyper-technical\u201d devices to be eschewed under this view, then, is the notion that a general verdict of acquittal \u201cmay reflect only a belief that the Government had not met the higher burden of proof exacted in such cases . \u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Each general verdict of acquittal must be examined carefully, to determine what facts, if any, can be deemed to have been adjudicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Pursuing this approach, and after reviewing the indictments, the trial transcripts, the various colloquys between court and counsel, the exchanges between the court and jury, the jury\u2019s decision in the first trial to acquit Phillips of bank robbery, and setting the \u201cinquiry into a practical frame,\u201d we are convinced that the first jury effectively determined that Phillips was not in the bank at the time of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Several circumstances support this conclusion. First, the jury inquired specifically whether a finding of <em>presence in the bank </em>was requisite to a conviction under the robbery statute. They were instructed, in no uncertain terms, that it was.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> A scant ten minutes after being so enlightened, they declined to return a verdict of guilty on the robbery charge. A \u201crealistic and rational\u201d appraisal. of these facts tends to show that the pivotal factual question in the jury\u2019s deliberations was whether Phillips was present in the bank. The jury\u2019s decision not to convict, following so closely upon the heels of clarifying instruction, leads almost inexorably to the conclusion that, at least in the jury\u2019s eye, Phillips was not in the bank at the time of the robbery, or that the government had failed to prove that Phillips was in the bank at the time of the robbery. Any test more mechanically restrictive \u201cmight well amount to a rejection of the rule of collateral estoppel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">The conclusion by the first jury that Phillips was not in the bank is buttressed by a secondary matrix of factual circumstances. None of the witnesses called by the prosecution at the first trial could positively identify Phillips as one of the bank robbers. Moreover, Phillips\u2019 own witnesses testified that he was elsewhere at the time of the robbery. There thus existed a rationally supportive basis in the evidence for a conclusion by the jury that Phillips was <em>not </em>in the bank. Although it is possible, as the dissent suggests, to infer that the jury did not specifically determine the question whether Phillips was present at the bank, the evidence at the first trial, when taken together with the jury instructions and other factors, leaves little doubt concerning the significance of the jury\u2019s failure to convict Phillips of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">The dissent does not adopt the foregoing analysis for two reasons. First, it ascribes some weight to the fact that the jury did not affirmatively state that it found Phillips not guilty of bank robbery but, instead, convicted him of pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>session of stolen money while simply remaining silent with respect to the bank robbery count. The dissent correctly notes that the jury\u2019s response to the bank robbery charge is somewhat ambiguous. But in light of the substantial interests of criminal defendants at stake, it would appear inappropriate to attach significance to the absence of an affirmative statement by the jury indicating its finding of not guilty when, for all practical purposes, the jury\u2019s silence is to be treated in the same manner as an affirmative statement. For example, the defendant is entitled to a judgment of acquittal and, as the dissent acknowledges, the defendant receives full double jeopardy protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Second, the dissent suggests several explanations for the jury\u2019s failure to convict Phillips of bank robbery which are not bottomed on the assumption that the jury unanimously agreed that Phillips was not present in the bank at the time of the robbery. This speculation does not seem particularly persuasive when juxtaposed against the jury\u2019s question concerning the necessity of deciding that Phillips was in the bank in order to convict him of bank robbery, the judge\u2019s response in the form of a supplemental instruction and the jury\u2019s verdict shortly thereafter. Moreover, once a criminal defendant has undergone a trial and a favorable verdict, considerations of fairness and traditional judicial reluctance to explore the factors prompting jury decisions seem to dictate resolving doubts, at least under circumstances as here, in favor of the defendant.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Having ascertained that the result at the first trial established Phillips\u2019 absence from the bank during the robbery, the government was thus foreclosed from relitigating the question of Phillips\u2019 presence in the bank. The trial court\u2019s limiting instruction, to the effect that evidence of presence in the bank was intended only to show Phillips' knowledge that the funds he received were stolen, was insufficiently protective.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">At Phillips\u2019 second trial, government counsel opened his case by telling the jury that he hoped to prove Phillips\u2019 participation in the bank robbery.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> One government witness, the president of the bank, testified as to the aggravated nature of the robbery.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Another, Joseph Warren, testified that Phillips had told him that he (Phillips) had robbed the bank, and had been inside it during the robbery.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Finally, during his summation, government counsel again referred to Phillips\u2019 participation in the robbery, particularly as evidenced by Warren\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Thus, the government sought to prove precisely the same factual issue that had been foreclosed by the result in the first trial. Admission of evidence on this issue was erroneous.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Moreover, government counsel\u2019s reference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>such evidence in his opening and closing statements compounded the error. Nor, after reviewing all the evidence introduced at Phillips\u2019 second trial, can we say that the admission of evidence tending to show Phillips\u2019 presence at the bank and the use of physical coercion during the robbery constituted harmless error.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> For example, the trial court permitted at the second trial, over defense counsel\u2019s objections, testimony to the effect that there was a gunshot during the perpetration of the bank robbery.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Once the first jury had refused to convict Phillips of bank robbery, such evidence, under the foregoing analysis, was inadmissible. The prejudicial impact of this testimony was potentially great, especially when the prosecutor also attempted to link Phillips with the bank robbery, and may not be overlooked on review. Nowhere in the record or in the briefs appears a justification for admission at the second trial on possession of testimony relating to events during the bank robbery. Such testimony would have been apposite only for a charge under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d) but, at the second trial, no charge under this section was pending against Phillips.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of conviction will be reversed, and the case remanded to the district court for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-10\">. The term \u201ccollateral estoppel\u201d is itself of comparatively recent coinage. <em>See </em>Developments \u2014 Res Judicata, 65 Harv.D.Rev. 818, 840 (1952).

Thus, unlike this case, the same tribunal found both for and against the defendant on a particular issue. Refusal to apply collateral estoppel in <em>May-bury, </em>therefore, is not necessarily inconsistent with the application of the doctrine in this case.

It is unnecessary to speculate about the jury\u2019s actual decision because the doctrine of double jeopardy does not require an actual verdict. <em>See </em>United States v. Jorn, 400 U.S. 470, 91 S.Ct. 547, 27 L.Ed.2d 543 (1971). When the jury has been impaneled and discharged under these circumstances, the exposure to conviction on the greater charge is enough to bar reprosecution. Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 188, 78 S. Ct. 221, 2 L.Ed.2d 199 (1957). For collateral estoppel, however, an actual verdict is required, because the doctrine is premised on a factual determination in favor of the accused. The jury\u2019s silence on the primary charge, coupled with conviction on a lesser offense, may suggest the kind of factual determination on which collateral estoppel is premised, but there is always a substantial likelihood that the jury reached no agreement at all on the primary charge. <em>See </em>United States ex rel. Hetenyi v. Wilkins, 348 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>F.2d 844, 856-857 (2d Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 383 U.S. 913, 86 S.Ct. 896, 15 L.Ed.2d 667 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">If Phillips\u2019 first jury had returned a clear verdict of acquittal ten minutes after the trial judge delivered the supplemental instruction,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I would agree that the jurors had probably decided Phillips was not in the bank at the time of the robbery. But other aspects of this case cast substantial doubt on the jury\u2019s decision. The supplemental instruction on presence in the bank and the instruction on the lesser included offense were both given in response to the jury\u2019s question. The jury was not told that it had to find Phillips not guilty of bank robbery before it could find him guilty of possessing stolen money. As a result, the jury could have reached its verdict without ever deciding whether Phillips was in the bank. The jury\u2019s question does indicate that some jurors believed Phillips was not in the bank, but I do not think it proves unanimity where the verdict is silent. An aiding and abetting instruction had been given in the original charge, and the jury may have hoped the judge would give them an instruction that would relieve them of deciding whether he was in the bank.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">In summary, paraphrasing Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. at 444, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 25 L.Ed.2d 469, I am convinced that a rational jury could have reached its verdict without deciding the issue which the defendant seeks to foreclose from consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Second, even if I agreed that the implied acquittal could be set up as a collateral estoppel, I would not allow its use to restrict proof on retrial of the <em>lesser </em>charge. Retrial in cases like this one harbors none of the prosecutorial abuses that supplied the rationale of Ashe v. Swenson and its nonconstitutional forbears. <em>See </em>United States v. Kramer, 289 F.2d 909, 916 (2d Cir. 1961). The prosecutor cannot be accused of using the first trial as a practice run, of recasting the charge in slightly different form to get a second chance for conviction, or of harassing the defendant by repeatedly calling him to answer the same proof. <em>Cf. </em>Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. at 445-447 &amp; n. 10, 90 S.Ct. at 1195; United States v. Nash, 447 F.2d 1382, 1387 (4th Cir. 1971) (Winter, J., concurring); United States v. Davis, 369 F.2d 775, 780 (4th Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 909, 87 S.Ct. 858, 17 L.Ed.2d 783 (1967). With or without collateral estoppel, the second trial will not be a replay of the first, and the second jury cannot be invited to convict the accused because he is guilty of the first crime. Evidence that tends to prove the first crime may not be used unless it is relevant to the second, and even then it may be excluded if the trial judge believes it more prejudicial than probative. <em>See </em>United States v. Woods, 484 F.2d 127, 134 (4th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 415 U. S. 979, 94 S.Ct. 1566, 39 L.Ed.2d 875 (1974); United States v. Smith, 446 F.2d 200 (4th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">Applying collateral estoppel to retrials like this one will serve none of the purposes of the doctrine, and I believe it will unjustifiably tip the balance in favor of the defendant. The acquittal operates as a complete bar to reprosecution on the bank robbery. That is enough. That the trial judge belatedly charged on the lesser included offense cuts both ways: it was the basis for vacating the conviction <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but also may have saved the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>defendant from a conviction for bank robbery. <em>See </em>United States v. Maybury, 274 F.2d 899 (2d Cir. 1960); Mayers &amp; Yarbrough, Bis Vexari: New Trials and Successive Prosecutions, 74 Harv.L.Rev. 1, 16-28 (1960). If the defendant can also use the acquittal as collateral estoppel on retrial of the conviction, he may be able to keep the second jury from hearing evidence that helped persuade the first jury of his guilt. This result, in Judge Friendly\u2019s words, \u201cwould convert the guarantee of double jeopardy from a shield into a sword.\u201d United States v. Maybury, 274 F.2d at 905.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">Ashe v. Swenson did not pretend to define the outer limits of collateral es-. toppel, since the Court there found a clear case for applying the doctrine. In concluding that collateral estoppel is embodied in the concept of double jeopardy, the Court said: \u201cFor whatever else that constitutional guarantee may embrace, it surely protects a man who has been acquitted from having to \u2018run the gantlet\u2019 a second time.\u201d 397 U.S. at 445-446, 90 S.Ct. at 1195 (citations omitted). This principle should not be applied when its only effect is to help a person convicted of a lesser offense elude fair retrial on the charge. Collateral estoppel is a doctrine of fairness. It does not seem to me unfair to subject the appellant to retrial for a lesser offense of which he had been convicted. I think the defendant got more than he was entitled to when the first conviction was vacated. To set aside the second conviction is too much of a good thing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b297-24\">. The verdict is quoted on page 3 of the majority opinion. Like the majority, I find it unnecessary to decide whether possession of stolen bank money under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113 (c) is included in the offense of bank robbery under \u00a7 2113(a). I have merely assumed, for purposes of this case, that it is.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b298-7\">.

The record of the first trial does not show why the jury was not instructed that Phillips could have aided and abetted the bank robbery without being present at the bank. I would be surprised if the law were otherwise. <em>See </em>United States v. Waters, 461 F.2d 248 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 880, 93 S.Ct. 207, 34 L.Ed.2d 134 (1972); Asher v. United States, 394 F.2d 424 (9th Cir. 1968); Tarkington v. United States, 194 F.2d 63 (4th Cir. 1952).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b298-13\">.

The jury\u2019s question persuaded the judge that withholding the instruction was error.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b299-6\">. Only a few federal cases have applied collateral estoppel as between an acquittal and a conviction rendered at the same trial. United States v. Pappas (Appeal of Misclilicli), 445 F.2d 1194 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 984, 92 S.Ct. 449, 30 L.Ed.2d 368 (1971); Green v. United States, 426 F.2d 661 (D.C.Cir. 1970); Travers v. United States, 118 U.S.App.D.C. 276, 335 F.2d 698, 703 (1964) (dictum); Cosgrove v. United States, 224 F.2d 146 (9th Cir. 1954), modified on rehearing, 224 F.2d 157 (1955); United States v. Flowers, 255 F.Supp. 485 (E.D. N.C.1966). <em>Compare </em>United States v. Finnerty, 470 F.2d 78 (3d Cir. 1972); United State v. Carbone, 378 F.2d 420 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 914, 88 S.Ct. 242, 19 L.Ed. 2d 262 (1967). In United States v. May-bury, 274 F.2d 899 (2d Cir. 1960), a divided court reversed a conviction because it was inconsistent with an acquittal rendered at the same bench trial. Over Judge Lumbard\u2019s dissent, Judge Friendly and Judge Hand held that collateral estoppel would not bar retrial of the conviction. Judge Friendly also expressed his opinion that collateral estoppel should not be allowed to restrict the evidence on retrial. Judge Hand did not address this final point, apparently because it was unnecessary for disposition of the immediate appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
