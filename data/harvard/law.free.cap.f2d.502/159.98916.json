We must decide whether the district court exceeded its authority in appointing the equity receiver; whether the bankruptcy court erred in granting the claims priority as \u201cadministrative expenses;\u201d and whether the bankrupt corporation was deprived of due process of law in the determination of the precedence to be accorded the claims. We hold that the district court had authority to appoint the equity receiver and did not abuse its dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>cretion in so doing. We determine that because the claims for legal and accounting services were not incurred \u201csubsequent to filing the petition,\u201d they are not \u201cexpenses of administration\u201d within the meaning of Section 64(a)(1); but to the extent that the services benefited the estate, the claims were entitled to receive, through an equitable lien, a \u201cpreferential\u201d status, Randolph v. Scruggs, 190 U.S. 533, 23 S.Ct. 710, 47 L.Ed. 1165 (1933), at least equivalent to the priority given administrative expenses of the bankruptcy proceeding under Section 64(a)(1), 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 104(a)(1). We also hold that the bankrupt corporation was not denied due process of law in the determination of the status of appellees\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The significant facts as related in the referee\u2019s memorandum are not disputed. Armstrong Glass Company, Inc., now the bankrupt, and its shareholders sued TTC Industries, Inc. and certain individuals in the Tennessee Chancery Court to rescind an agreement to sell all the Armstrong stock to defendants. The defendants removed the suit to tfie United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, where jurisdiction was based on diversity of citizenship. Charges and countercharges in the pleadings indicated that the assets of Armstrong were in danger of becoming dissipated. To protect the interests of the parties and of the town of Erwin, Tennessee, which had issued almost one-half million dollars in bonds for the construction of a manufacturing plant for Armstrong, the district court, by Order on November 18, 1969, appointed an equity receiver to protect and preserve Armstrong\u2019s property. The receiver was specifically authorized to employ agents and employees \u201cnecessary or desirable for the continued operation of the business.\u201d In the same order, the district court dismissed Armstrong as a party in the action for rescission, determining that the corporation was not a \u201creal party in interest.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 17(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Subsequently, the receiver employed appellee Siegel to perform accounting services for the corporation and appellee Luedeka to represent the corporation in a pending civil action. The receiver was discharged on March 18, 1970. Thereafter, appellees attempted to intervene in the rescission action to assert their claims for services. Siegel claimed $5,404.87 and Luedeka claimed $4,073.97 for services rendered before the equity receiver\u2019s discharge. Also, Luedeka claimed another $1,528.08 for legal services performed for the corporation after the receiver\u2019s discharge. On December 9, 1970, the district court denied appel-lees intervention, but held that the claims were subject to the court\u2019s general equity powers and directed Siegel and Luedeka to file with the court their claims against the former receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">About one month earlier, on November 5, 1970, Armstrong had filed, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, a petition for an arrangement under Chapter XI, of the Bankruptcy Act. On motion of certain creditors, the case was transferred to the Eastern District of Tennessee, where the rescission action was pending. However, the plan of arrangement was not filed, and as the referee\u2019s memorandum recites, on March 9, 1971, the bankruptcy court entered an adjudication in bankruptcy. Thereafter, appellant trustee was appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">On September 14, 1971, the district court entered a memorandum opinion and order in the rescission action, determining that the claims of Siegel and Luedeka \u201care the ranking claims against the estate in receivership and that this Court has an obligation to see to it that the claimants are paid their just demands,\u201d and that \u201cthe services of these claimants to the receivership will be allowed as a preferred claim in the administration of the bankrupt property and the distribution of its proceeds to the extent that such services benefited the estate.\u201d He referred the claims \u201cspecially\u201d to the bankruptcy referee for further determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Appellant trustee urged before the referee the following fiv,\u00a7 objections to the claims of Luedeka and Siegel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\">(1) The bankrupt is not indebted to claimants in that the order entered in Civil Action No. 2459 insofar as it appointed Rex Marsh receiver of Armstrong Glass Company, Inc., and authorized him to-employ agents, employees and attorneys deemed by him necessary or desirable for the continued operation of the business of Armstrong Glass Company, Inc., was <em>coram, non judice </em>and void as against the bankrupt because by the same order entered appointing Rex Marsh receiver it was adjudged by the District Court that as to Armstrong Glass Company, Inc., the action was dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">(2) That the receiver Rex Marsh in Civil Action No. 2459 was without jurisdiction and authority to onerate the bankrupt for any costs and expenses arising out of or resulting from said action subsequent to the entry of the order entered November 18, 1969, because the bankrupt was not a party to said action, either plaintiff or defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">(3) The order entered on September 14, 1971, by the District Judge in Civil Action No. 2459 referring the Luedeka and Siegel claims to the referee for determinations is <em>coram, non judice </em>and void because neither the bankrupt nor trustee was party to the proceedings at the time of the making of said order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-12\">(4) The estate of the bankrupt was not benefitted by the services and disbursements claimed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-13\">(5) There is no warrant by the rules of law or principles of equity or any statute of the United States for priority of the claim as a cost of the bankruptcy proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">However, because of what the referee considered to be the limited \u201cscope of [the district court\u2019s] order of reference,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the referee considered only the issue of benefit to the estate and none of the other contentions. On this issue, he found that Siegel performed, at the receiver\u2019s request and during the receivership, accounting services including bookkeeping, special cash flow studies, and a year-end audit and prepared tax returns; fend he also found, specifically, \u201cthat such services benefited the estate and that the amount requested [$5,404.-87] is reasonable.\u201d He found that Lue-deka\u2019s legal services, including the preparation of an appeal and the defense against a cross-appeal in a pending ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>tion, before the termination of the receivership \u201cbenefitted the estate and that the amount requested [$4,073.97] is reasonable.\u201d However, he determined that the fees for legal services after termination of the receivership [$1,528.08] were not \u201cchargeable against the receivership\u201d and not entitled to any special priority. He concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">(1) Judge Neese has heretofore determined that the claims of Luedeka and Siegel are the ranking claims against the bankruptcy estate of Armstrong Glass Company, Inc., to the extent that they benefitted the estate. Sec. 64(a)(1), Bankruptcy Act (11 U. S.C. 104(a)(1)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">(2) I find and conclude that the services of Luedeka and Siegel, performed at the request of the receiver, Rex B. Marsh, in Civil Action No. 2459 (Armstrong Glass Company, Inc. v. TTC Industries, Inc.) were beneficial in said receivership in the following amounts: Mr. Luedeka, $4,073.97; Mr. Siegel, $5,404.87.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">(3) I find and conclude that the claim of Mr. Luedeka for services performed after the termination of the receivership is a general claim against the estate of the bankrupt in the amount of $1,528.08.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\">(4) Upon distribution of funds realized from liquidation of the bankrupt\u2019s assets, the claims of Luedeka and Siegel will be recognized as indicated herein as priority claims, Sec. 64(a)(1). The balance of Mr. Lue-deka\u2019s claim is allowed as a general claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-10\">ENTER: December 7, 1972.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">The trustee petitioned for review of this order and it was affirmed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-13\">Appellant does not contest the referee\u2019s findings of fact on the extent to which appellees\u2019 services benefited the bankruptcy estate. These findings, adopted by the district court, are not \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). Instead, appellant contends: (1) that appellees\u2019 claims are invalid because the district court had no authority to appoint a receiver in the rescission action while simultaneously dismissing the corporation from the suit; <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(2) that the claims, in any event, should not receive any priority under the bankruptcy laws; and (3) that the bankrupt corporation was denied due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-14\"> The first contention is based on appellant\u2019s argument that under Tennessee law a court may appoint a receiver only when the person in possession of the property is before the court, and for that reason, the district court could not appoint a receiver and simultaneously dismiss the corporation as a party. We are unconvinced by this argument and we have found nothing in Tennessee law suggesting that the appointment of the receiver was improper. In Tennessee, a receiver may be appointed in equity when necessary \u201cfor the purpose of preserving the property in controversy, pending the litigation, for the benefit of the successful party.\u201d Johnston v. Hanner, 70 Tenn. 8, 11 (1878); Roberson v. Roberson, 71 Tenn. 50, 52 (1879). This was the very reason why the district judge decided to appoint an equity receiver, to preserve the property of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Corporation pending the outcome of the action for rescission. And we are not persuaded otherwise by the fact that the district court dismissed the corporation as a party in the rescission action when it appointed the receiver. Before this order was entered the corporation was before the court as a party to the suit; after its entry, all the corporation\u2019s shareholders, including the contesting shareholders, remained parties in the pending action. Since the owners of all shares in the corporation were before the court, their property, the corporation, could be placed under a receiver. The Tennessee cases cited by appellant, Mays v. Wherry, 3 Tenn.Ch., Cooper, 34 (1875), and Crosby v. Morristown &amp; G. G. R. Co., 42 S.W. 507 (Tenn.Ch.App. 1897), are distinguishable from this one because here the district court had jurisdiction over the corporation and all of its property when the receiver was appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">We consider, next, appellant\u2019s contention that even if appellees\u2019 claims are valid against the bankrupt, they are not entitled to priority. We agree that the services appellees rendered the receivership are not \u201cexpenses of administration\u201d within the meaning of Section 64(a)(1), 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 104(a)(1), because the expenses were not incurred \u201csubsequent to\u201d formal commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings. <em>See, e. g., </em>Wheeling Electric Co. v. Mead, 177 F.2d 718 (4th Cir. 1949). <em>See generally </em>Collier On Bankruptcy, 14th Ed., Vol. 3A, f\u00ed 64.102[2]. Nevertheless, it has long been settled that services such as those rendered by appellees before bankruptcy may give rise to a \u201cpreferred\u201d claim in the administration of a superseding bankruptcy to the extent that the, services benefited the estate. Randolph v. Scruggs, 190 U.S. 533, 23 S.Ct. 710, 47 L.Ed. 1165 (1903). In Chase Bag Co. v. Schouman, 129 F.2d 247 (6th Cir. 1942), we stated the rule and its rationale in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">The rule stated in Randolph v. Scruggs, supra, to the effect that one contributing to the preservation or benefit of an estate in bankruptcy, by performing services or advancing credits, under certain conditions, in case of an assignment prior to bankruptcy, is to be preferred is well established. This is on the theory that the assignee has preserved the estate and by his action in so doing has incurred obligations which the subsequent trustee in bankruptcy would have had to incur. As pointed out in the Scruggs case, that is the rule in the state courts universally applied on the theory that \u201cbeneficial services are allowed for they are to be regarded as deductions from the property which the assignee is required to surrender, and in that way they gain a preference.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">And, although Randolph v. Scruggs, <em>supra, </em>concerned services rendered by a general assignee for the benefit of creditors, the rule applies, as well, to expenses incurred by a prior equity receiver and asserted against the estate in a superseding bankruptcy. <em>Chase Bag Co., supra, </em>at 248. <em>See generally </em>Collier On Bankruptcy, 14th Ed., Vol. 3A, fl 62.32 [3]. Accordingly, appellees\u2019 claims were entitled to a \u201cpreferred\u201d status not because of the priority granted by Section 64a(l) to administrative expenses of the bankruptcy but, instead, under the equitable \u201cbenefit\u201d doctrine of Randolph v. Scruggs, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">There remains to be considered the claimed due process violation. Appellant trustee argues that neither Armstrong, which had been dismissed from the rescission action when the receiver was appointed, nor the trustee had notice and an opportunity to be heard before the district court recited in its memorandum and order of September 14, 1971, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>that appellees\u2019 claims for services rendered the receivership were to be \u201cpreferred claims in the administration of the bankrupt property ... to the extent that such services benefited the estate.\u201d He also complains that, although the trustee had a hearing in the bankruptcy court, the referee determined only the factual issue of benefit to the estate and declined to consider appellant\u2019s other arguments contesting the validity of the claims and their priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Of course, due process requires that \u201cdeprivation of life, liberty or property by adjudication be preceded by notice and opportunity for a hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.\u201d Mullane v. Central Hanover Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 313, 70 S.Ct. 652, 656, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950) (Jackson, J.). <em>See also </em>Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 85 S.Ct. 1187, 14 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965). Here, the September 1971 order and memorandum entered without notice and a hearing for appellant, describes appellees\u2019 claims as the \u201cranking\u201d and \u201cpreferred\u201d claims. But, because that order issued from the rescission action, we believe the court was necessarily speaking only as the equity court that appointed the prior receiver and not as a court of bankruptcy, even though it observed that \u201cin this case the equity court and the bankruptcy court are one and the same.\u201d The rule is settled that a bankrupt\u2019s property rights can be affected only by an order issued from the bankruptcy court. As stated in Taylor v. Sternberg, 293 U.S. 470, 472, 55 S.Ct. 260, 261, 79 L.Ed. 599 (1934), by the Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">Upon adjudication in bankruptcy, all the property of the bankrupt vests in the trustee as of the date of the filing of the petition. Upon such filing, the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court becomes paramount and exclusive; and thereafter that court\u2019s possession and control of the estate cannot be affected by proceedings in other courts, whether state or federal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">Applying these principles, the Court in <em>Taylor </em>held that, after the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, a state equity court\u2019s \u201corder fixing the compensation of the receiver and his counsel was a nullity because made without jurisdiction, such jurisdiction then having passed to the bankruptcy court.\u201d <em>Taylor, supra </em>at 473, 55 S.Ct. at 262. Similarly, we do not believe that the district court in its September 1971 order, issued in the rescission action, could establish authoritatively the validity of appellees\u2019 claims or their right to a preferred treatment, even though conditional upon the referee\u2019s subsequent determination of the extent to which the services may have benefited the estate. Because the order entered in September 1971, had, in our view, no legal effect on the bankrupt\u2019s property, we conclude that the lack of notice and hearing for the bankrupt before this order issued was immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">However, there is more substance in appellant\u2019s argument that he did not receive a hearing on all the pertinent issues he presented to the referee before the order issued in the bankruptcy court. To be sure, appellant had notice and a hearing, and urged all his arguments before the referee. But, regarding himself bound by the September 1971 order, the referee considered only the issue of benefit. Yet, it does not follow necessarily that the bankrupt\u2019s due process rights were violated. Whether due process was afforded here depends on the scope and effect of subsequent proceedings. Here, apart from the factual determination of benefit that was made by the referee, appellant\u2019s other contentions required for determination no additional proofs or findings of fact and, on the contrary, raised only issues of law that were considered by the district court on review before it affirmed the order of the referee.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>record, moreover, does not demonstrate that the bankrupt corporation was prejudiced by the referee\u2019s failure to consider these issues in the first instance. Accordingly, we conclude that appellant, under the totality of circumstances, was not denied due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">The judgment is affirmed for the reasons stated herein, and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b226-7\">. The referee stated :</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">The trustee overlooks the scope of Judge Neese\u2019s order of reference dated September 14, 1971. The reference is not for the purpose of determining whether the order appointing Rex D. Marsh as receiver of Armstrong Glass Company, Inc., is void or for the purpose of determining whether the receiver had jurisdiction and authority to onerate Armstrong Glass Company, Inc., for costs and expenses arising out of or resulting from such appointment or for the purpose of determining the validity of the order of reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">\u201cCourt\u201d is defined in Sec, 1(9) of the Bankruptcy Act (11 USC \u00a7 1(9) to mean \u201cthe judge or the referee of the court of bankruptcy in which the proceedings are pending; . . . . \u201d It is thus clear that in general the function of the bankruptcy court may be fulfilled by either a judge or the referee and even after a general order of refer-enoe has invested the referee with jurisdiction to discharge the statutory duties of the court of bankruptcy in which the case is pending, the judge and the referee have \u201ccoordinate powers.\u201d Collier on Bankruptcy, 14th Ed., Vol. 1, Sec. 1.09.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-16\"><em>Judge Neese has heretofore determined that the claims of Luedeka and Siegel \u201care the ranking claims </em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> against the estate in receivership </em>[Armstrong Glass Company, Inc.] ; <em>and, that this Court </em>[the bankruptcy court] <em>has a duty to see to it that claimants are paid their just demands.\u201d Judge Neese\u2019s order of reference to this referee is for the sole purpose of determining \u201cthe extent that such services </em>[Luedka\u2019s and Siegel\u2019s] <em>bene-fitted the estate.\u201d </em>See Judge Neese\u2019s Order, Sei)tember 14, 1971. <em>lienee my determination will be limited to that issue only, </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-17\">1.

This contention rests on the unstated assumption that if the receivership was void, appellees\u2019 claims for services that benefited the estate in bankruptcy and that were rendered in good faith could not be asserted against the trustee. Appellant has ignored the possibility that even if the receivership were void, the appellees might nevertheless seek compensation from the estate on the basis of quasi-contractual principles. In fact, there appears to be a split of authority on the question whether services rendered a void equity receivership in good faith are, like services rendered a valid equity repeiversliip, entitled to preferential treatment in a superseding bankruptcy to the extent that the services benefited the estate. See <em>generally </em>Collier On Bankruptcy, 14th Ed., Vol. 3A, If 62.32 [3]. We find it unnecessary to decide this question because we conclude, <em>infra, </em>that the district court had authority to appoint the receiver and did not abuse its discretion in making the appointment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b228-5\">.
