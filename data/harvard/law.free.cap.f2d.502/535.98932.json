Originally financial go-between for a harried general contractor and a financially-troubled subcontractor, the Second National Bank of North Miami now finds itself caught between the relentless federal tax collector and a resourceful taxpayer. The hapless bank appeals an adverse judgment which has left it holding the bag of someone else\u2019s tax liability. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-20\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b601-21\">The skeletal framework of this controversy is undisputed although several important factual details remain bones of contention. In the fall of 1970 Medallion Electric Company, Inc. [Medallion], an electrical subcontractor working for The Hannon Company [Hannon] on the construction of the Midway Mall Shopping Center in Dade County, Florida, began having difficulties meeting its payroll and setting aside sufficient amounts to pay withholding taxes due the United States. After a series of payroll checks drawn on defendant-appellant Second National Bank [bank] were returned unpaid due to insufficient funds, the business agent of Medallion\u2019s employees\u2019 union, acting pursuant to the contract with Medallion, refused to accept further payroll payments except in the form of cash, cashiers\u2019 checks, or the equivalent. To meet the union\u2019s demand and to prevent fui'ther interruptions in the progress of the construction, Medallion and Hannon arranged a net payroll financing operation with appellant bank as financial intermediary.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Under the arrangement Hannon would draw a check in the amount of the net payroll on its account at City National Bank to the joint order of appellant bank and Medallion, and would deposit this check in Medallion\u2019s payroll account at appellant bank, where Medallion also maintained a general account.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> With these funds Medallion would purchase 190 individual money orders signed and issued by appellant. Working from a payroll schedule furnished by Medallion, appellant would prepare each money order with the payee blank but in the exact amount of an employee\u2019s net weekly wages. Medallion would then fill in the name of the employee-payee. No withholding tax was set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">The bank issued the first set of 190 money orders on or about October 5, 1970. Because an influential bank customer had guaranteed Hannon\u2019s check, appellant bank issued the money orders on uncollected funds, that is, before Hannon\u2019s check had cleared City National Bank. Medallion received the money orders, filled in the names of the employees, and met the payroll. Subsequently Hannon\u2019s check cleared and was paid by City National Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Sometime before appellant was to issue the second series of money orders, employees of the Internal Revenue Service met with Medallion representatives, including Leonard Gutkin, president of Medallion, and Alphonse Schwitalla, Medallion\u2019s attorney, regarding Medallion\u2019s withholding taxes for the third quarter of 1970.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although who said what to whom and in what tone of voice is a matter of some dispute, it is clear that Medallion agreed to turn the second set of money orders over to the IRS for application against existing tax liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">On October 14 Hannon\u2019s second check, in the amount of $83,000, was delivered to appellant and credited to Medallion\u2019s payroll account. Since no one had guaranteed payment of this check, appellant\u2019s president, Alfred Slobusky, did not, as he had done the first week, approve the issuance of the money orders on uncollected funds. Unfortunately, after telephoning City National Bank to verify that Hannon had sufficient funds on deposit to cover the check, appellant\u2019s assistant cashier followed the previous week\u2019s procedure and issued the 190 money orders in the total face amount of $92,355.86.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Medallion then delivered the money orders to the IRS, which inserted in each payee blank the words \u201cto the order of the Internal Revenue Service, Room 426, 51 S.W. 1st Avenue, Miami, Florida, 33130.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">On learning from Medallion\u2019s employees that they had not been paid, Hannon stopped payment on the $83,000 check, which had not yet cleared City National Bank. In its turn appellant stopped payment on the money orders, and immediately informed the Collection Division of the IRS of its reasons for the action. On October 27 the money orders were presented for payment and returned unpaid. In the meantime, Hannon paid the regular net wages to Medallion\u2019s employees, as well as an additional $10,000 in penalty payments due under Medallion\u2019s union contract for late payment of wages. Thereafter Hannon sued appellant in state court to recover the penalty payments, and won a $10,000 judgment, which appellant has paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">The United States filed suit in the United States District Court to reduce its claim on the money orders to judgment and to foreclose a statutory lien on appellant\u2019s assets, asserted pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6311(b)(2). The bank de-ied liability on the money orders, and in addition filed a counterclaim under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b), to recover the amount of the judgment paid by the bank in Hannon\u2019s state courts suit. Following a bench trial the district court held that the United States is a holder in due course of the money orders; that the bank is liable to the United States in the amount of $92,355.86, the face amount of the money orders, plus interest; that a lien exists in favor of the United States on all bank assets to secure payment of the judgment; and that the counterclaim is meritless. The bank raises four issues on appeal, which we treat <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">II. APPLICABILITY OF SECTION 6311</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Appellant\u2019s first line of attack focuses on the statutory underpinnings of the judgment below. Section 6311 in its entirety provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">\n<em>Payment by check or money order</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\"><em>(a) Authority to receive. </em>\u2014 It shall be lawful for the Secretary or his delegate to receive for internal revenue taxes, or in payment for internal revenue stamps, checks or money orders, to the extent and under the conditions provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary or his delegate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\"><em>(b) Check or money order </em>unpaid.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-9\"><em>(1) Ultimate liability. </em>\u2014 If a check or money order so received is not duly paid, the person by whom such check or money order has been tendered shall remain liable for the payment of the tax or for the stamps, and for all legal penalties and additions, to the same extent as if such check or money order had not been tendered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-10\"><em>(2) Liability of banks and others. </em>\u2014If any certified, treasurer\u2019s, or cashier\u2019s check or any money order so received is not duly paid, the United States shall, in addition to its right to exact payment from the party originally indebted therefor, have a lien for the amount of such check upon all the assets of the bank or trust company on which drawn or for the amount of such money order upon all the assets of the issuer thereof; and such amount shall be paid out of such assets in preference to any other claims whatsoever against such bank or issuer except the necessary costs and expenses of administration and the reimbursement of the United States for the amount expended in the redemption of the circulating notes of such bank.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">Appellant asseverates that the statutory lien provision applies only when (a) money orders or other negotiable instruments have been drawn explicitly in payment for taxes <em>and </em>(b) the bank has received sufficient funds to cover the instruments <em>and </em>(c) the bank has either failed or closed due to a bank holiday of the sort common during the 1930\u2019s. Since none of these conditions existed in the case at bar, bank argues, the district court should have refused to impose a lien on the bank\u2019s assets in favor of the United States. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-13\"> Our review of appellant\u2019s applicability argument must begin with the principle that our duty \u201cis to give effect to the intent of Congress, and in doing so our first reference is . to the literal meaning of the words employed.\u201d Flora v. United States, 1958, 357 U.S. 63, 65, 78 S.Ct. 1079, 1081, 2 L.Ed.2d 1165, 1167. \u201cOften these words are sufficient in and of themselves to determine the purpose of the legislation. In such cases we have followed their plain meaning.\u201d Perry v. Commerce Loan Co., 1966, 383 U.S. 392, 400, 86 S.Ct. 852, 857, 15 L.Ed.2d 827, 833, quoting United States v. American Trucking Associations, 1940, 310 U.S. 534, 543, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 84 L.Ed. 1345, 1350; Ray Bailie Trash Hauling, Inc. v. Kleppe, 5 Cir. 1973, 477 F.2d 696, 707. And we must be constantly mindful that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>there is no need to refer to the legislative history where the statutory language is clear. \u201cThe plain words and meaning of a statute cannot be overcome by a legislative history which, through strained processes of deduction from events of wholly ambiguous significance, may furnish dubious bases for inference in every direction.\u201d Gemsco, Inc. v. Walling, 324 U.S. 244, 260, 65 S.Ct. 605, 615, 89 L.Ed. 921, 933 (1945).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Ex parte Collett, 1949, 337 U.S. 55, 61, 69 S.Ct. 944, 947, 93 L.Ed. 1207, 1211; General Electric Co. v. Southern Construction Co., 5 Cir. 1967, 383 F.2d 135, 138 &amp; n. 2, cert. denied, 1968, 390 U.S. 955, 88 S.Ct. 1049, 19 L.Ed.2d 1148.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">We are convinced that on careful, reasonable examination, the text of section 6311 yields a plain, unambiguous meaning. The statute allows taxpayers to use certain types of negotiable instruments in paying their internal revenue taxes. In addition it supplies two means of protecting the interests of the United States in the event the particular negotiable instrument is not duly paid: the taxpayer remains liable for the taxes ; and the United States may also have a lien on the assets of the bank or trust company that issued or on which the instrument was drawn.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Bank complains of the harsh result from this plain, common-sense reading of the statute. Our answer must be that we cannot \u201cdiscard the plain substance of a statute because of theoretical and irrelevant ambiguities\u201d and that \u201c[hjarshness does not in itself constitute ambiguity.\u201d First National City Bank v. Compania de Aguaceros, S.A., 5 Cir. 1968, 398 F.2d 779, 784. We see nothing in the statutory language to suggest the limitations proposed by the bank; and giving the statute its obvious, apparent meaning, we can find no error in the decision of the trial court to apply it to the facts of the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Ordinarily, the determination that a statute has, on its face, a plain, unambiguous meaning obviates the necessity for extended statutory interpretation. Appellant insists, however, that we must accept its restrictive reading of the statute if we are to avoid colliding with clearly established legislative purpose. Pointing to the history, case law, and regulations pertaining to \u00a7 6311, appellant argues that \u201cthe purpose of this statute is to enable the United States to maintain a preferential position as against general creditors under circumstances . . . where checks, certified by the defendant bank and forwarded to the collector of Internal Revenue, were not paid by reason of a bank holiday proclaimed by the President of the United States.\u201d Reply Brief of Appellant at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">The courts of this country have long disfavored the rigid rule of our English brethren that \u201cIf Parliament does not mean what it says it must say so.\u201d C. I. R. v. Mercantile National Bank, 5 Cir. 1960, 276 F.2d 58; <em>see </em>C. Nutting, S. Elliott, &amp; R. Dickerson, Legislation \u2014 Cases and Materials 413-14 (1969). For example, in Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States, 1892, 143 U.S. 457, 459, 12 S.Ct. 511, 512, 36 L.Ed. 226, 228, the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-10\">It is a familiar rule that a thing may be within the letter of the statute and yet not within the statute, because not within its spirit, nor within the intention of its makers. . . . [F]or frequently words of general meaning are used in a statute, words broad enough to include an act in question, and yet a consideration of the whole legislation, or of the circumstances surrounding its enactment, or of the absurd results which follow from giving such broad meaning to the words, makes it unreasonable to believe that the legislator intended to include the particular act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>The Court has also noted that \u201ceven when the-plain meaning did-not produce absurd results but merely an unreasonable one \u2018plainly at variance with the policy of the legislation as a whole\u2019 this Court has [frequently] followed that purpose, rather than the literal words.\u201d United States v. American Trucking Associations, 1940, 310 U.S. 534, 543, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 1064, 84 L.Ed. 1345, 1350, quoted in Perry v. Commerce Loan Co., 1966, 383 U.S. 392, 400, 86 S.Ct. 852, 15 L.Ed.2d 827, 833-834; <em>accord, </em>United States v. Public Utilities Commission, 1953, 345 U.S. 295, 315, 73 S.Ct. 706, 97 L.Ed. 1020, 1037; Brennan v. Greene\u2019s Propane Gas Service, Inc., 5 Cir. 1973, 479 F.2d 1027, 1030 &amp; n. 10; <em>see </em>United States v. Louisiana, E.D.La.1963, 225 F.Supp. 353, 361 (Wisdom, Circuit Judge), aff\u2019d, 1965, 380 U.S. 145, 85 S.Ct. 817, 13 L.Ed.2d 709. When faced with an argument that the literal meaning of a statute is at variance with the legislative purpose, a court can follow no better guide than Sir Edward Coke\u2019s \u201cMischief Rule\u201d: \u201cThe Office of Judges is always to make such construction as to suppress the Mischief and advance the Remedy; and to suppress subtle Inventions and Evasions for Continuance of the Mischief.\u201d Hey don\u2019s Case, 3 Co. 7a, 7b, Mag*dalon College Case, 11 Co. 66b, 73b, quoted in Burstein v. United States Lines, Co., 2 Cir. 1943, 134 F.2d 89; <em>accord, </em>Miller v. Lykes Brothers Steamship Co., 5 Cir. 1972, 467 F.2d 464, 467; Richland Development Co. v. Staples, 5 Cir. 1961, 295 F.2d 122, 128; Stanga v. McCormick Shipping Corp., 5 Cir. 1959, 268 F.2d 544, 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">With the aid of the Historical Note following 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6311, the historical lineage of the statutory lien provision is not difficult to trace.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The genesis was apparently \u201cAn Act To Authorize the receipt of certified checks drawn on national and State banks for duties on imports and internal taxes, and for other purposes,\u201d Act of Mar. 2, 1911, ch. 191, \u00a7 1, 36 Stat. 965.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The abbreviated legislative history of this statute clearly indicates that the statute was intended to relieve taxpayers of the inconvenience, inefficiency, and danger concomitant with the then current requirement that all customs duties be paid in actual cash or gold. The first-lien provision was designed to protect against all possibility of loss the interests of both the United States and the revenue collectors, who at that time retained liability for taxes collected until payment was final.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nothing in either the House Committee Report or the debates accompanying passage of the statute suggests the restrictive interpretation proposed by appellant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In 1913 the statute was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>amended in order to allow certified checks to be acceptable payment for any and all federal taxes. Act of Mar. 3, 1913, ch. 119, 37 Stat. 733.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Both the Committee Reports and the brief floor remarks indicate that the change was intended only to broaden the use of certified checks in payment for taxes because of favorable experience under the 1911 statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> No mention was made of the lien provision, which was carried forward unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-13\">The 1911 act as amended became \u00a7 3656 of the 1939 Internal Revenue Code, Act of Feb. 10, 1939, ch. 2, 53 Stat. 1, 447.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although the new code formally arranged the provisions in a different fashion,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the legislative history indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>cates that the act \u2014 -\u201cTo Consolidate and codify the internal-revenue laws of the United States\u201d \u2014 wrought no changes in the substance of the existing tax laws.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In 1944 Congress amended \u00a7 3656 to broaden the types of negotiable instruments that could be received in payment of federal taxes, Act of Dec. 22, 1944, ch. 672, 58 Stat. 912. The change, designed entirely for the convenience of taxpayers, simply extended the payment and lien provisions relating to certified checks to include cashiers\u2019 and treasurers\u2019 checks and various types of money orders.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Again, nothing in the legislative history suggests any intention that the plain words of the statute be narrowly interpreted.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">Section 3656 of the 1939 Code as amended became \u00a7 6311 of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6311. Although the 1954 Code rearranged the provisions of \u00a7 3656, no significant substantive changes \u2014 and none at all relating to the proper interpretation of the lien provision \u2014 were made.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">As we read this legislative history, the statutory lien provision was designed as a counter-weight to the allowance of new methods of paying internal revenue taxes; at the same time that taxpayers were offered increased convenience, the government was to receive increased protection of its interest in receiving the taxes owing not only by retaining the right to pursue the taxpayer, but also by gaining the right to hold the respective bank or trust company for negotiable instruments not duly paid. Congress may have foreseen that the principal need for the lien protection would arise in the case of bank failures or holidays, but to assert that to be the only situation in which they desired to protect the government\u2019s interests would require the most extravagant legislative psychoanalysis. The legislature may not have predicted that a bank would someday issue negotiable money orders on funds it did not yet have in hand, but that is no justification for niggardly statutory construction. Appellant\u2019s proposed interpretation of the statute would not, in our view, suppress the mischief and advance the remedy encompassed by this law, and would on the contrary constitute a \u201csubtle invention and evasion for continuance of the mischief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Although we do not deny that in ascertaining the meaning and purpose of a statute \u201cconsideration must be given to . the operation and administration of the statute prior to litigation,\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> we can find no more support for the bank\u2019s legislative purpose argument in the case law and regulations relating to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>\u00a7 6311 and its predecessors than we could in the legislative history. No reported decisions treat \u00a7 6311, and the few that involve prior statutory configurations offer no persuasive basis for the bank\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Certainly the only case cited by appellant, American Tobacco Co. v. South Carolina National Bank, E.D.S.C.1936, 15 F.Supp. 215, offers no solace. To the extent that the decision retains vitality, a question about which we intimate no view, it stands for no more than that when because of a bank holiday a bank has refused to honor one of the particular negotiable instruments and the taxpayer has been forced to pay the taxes in another manner, the taxpayer may, with the government\u2019s cooperation, stand in the government\u2019s shoes regarding the statutory lien.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Nothing in the opinion suggests that the statute\u2019s utility be limited to such a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">Moreover, even recognizing that regulations under the Internal Revenue Code are entitled to considerable weight in construing the Code, <em>cf. </em>Weeks v. Southern Bell Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., 5 Cir. 1969, 408 F.2d 228, 235, we find nothing ineluctable, or even persuasive, in the fragment of the regulations cited by appellant that \u201cDistrict Directors may accept checks drawn in payment for Internal Revenue taxes .\u201d Brief for Appellant at 28, citing 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6311-1 (a).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>pellant interprets this language to' mean that a District Director may not accept a taxpayer\u2019s tender of cashiers\u2019, certified, or treasurers\u2019 checks or money orders for taxes if payment of the taxes was not the original motive for drawing the instruments. The most obvious defect in this interpretation is that it runs counter to the undisputed legislative purpose of making payment of taxes more convenient through use of negotiable instruments. We decline to affix such basically extraneous and irrelevant considerations as the taxpayer\u2019s motive in acquiring instruments onto a bank\u2019s normal obligations on the instruments.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Finally, the bank suggests that application of \u00a7 6311 to the facts of this case would constitute a taking of its property without due process in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We see no merit in this argument. It has long been recognized that liens to guarantee payment of taxes are an important element of the sovereign\u2019s taxing power. <em>See </em>International Harvester Corp. v. Goodrich, 1956, 350 U.S. 537, 544, 76 S.Ct. 621, 100 L.Ed. 681, 689; Barkley v. Board of Levee Commissioners, 1876, 93 U.S. (23 Wall.) 258, 265, 23 L.Ed. 893, 896. And \u201c[t]he establishment of a tax lien by Congress is an exercise of its constitutional power \u2018To lay and collect Taxes. Article 1, \u00a7 8 of the Constitution. United States v. Snyder, 149 U.S. 210, 13 S.Ct. 846, 37 L.Ed. 705.\u201d Michigan v. United States, 1943, 317 U.S. 338, 340, 63 S.Ct. 302, 303, 87 L.Ed. 312, 314. The tax lien is usually attached to the property of the taxpayer though it is not extinguished simply by the transfer of the property. United States v. Bess, 1958, 357 U.S. 51, 57, 78 S.Ct. 1054, 2 L.Ed.2d 1135, 1142. Where, however, a bank has issued a money order, a very particular type of negotiable instrument whose use is controlled by a specific body of law, which is subsequently tendered for taxes, we see nothing unusual or impermissible in a decision to attach the lien to the bank\u2019s assets in the event the money order is not duly honored. This is no more than a decision to trace the taxpayer\u2019s assets. If the bank does not receive the consideration promised for the money orders, it has all the protections supplied by the law relating to negotiable instruments. The bank can really expect no more when it chooses to deal in negotiable instruments. In short, as applied to the facts of this case, \u00a7 6311 is a constitutional exercise of Congress\u2019 authority, the wisdom of which as a matter of federal tax policy is beyond our authority to judge. Glass City Bank v. United States, 1945, 326 U.S. 265, 268, 66 S.Ct. 108, 110, 90 L.Ed. 56, 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>III. HOLDER IN DUE COURSE</p>\n<p id=\"AHOq\">Bank next argues that even granting a broad interpretation of \u00a7 6311 it had a legal right to refuse payment on these particular money orders. Since it is not, therefore, liable to the United States on the basis of the unpaid money orders, the bank continues, the United States should not be able to claim the existence of the statutory lien. This argument requires us to turn to Florida law and the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, which became effective in Florida on January 1, 1967, prior to the transactions here at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">The keystone of the bank\u2019s argument is that the United States possessed the money orders as a simple holder, rather than as a holder in due course. Section 3-305 of the UCC provides that a holder in due course takes an instrument free from:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">(1) All claims to it on the part of any person; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">(2) All defenses of any party to the instrument with whom the holder has not dealt except:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">(a) Infancy, to the extent that it is a defense to a simple contract; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-8\">(b) Such other incapacity, or duress, or illegality of the transaction, as renders the obligation of the party a nullity; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-9\">(c) Such misrepresentation as has induced the party to sign the instrument with neither knowledge nor reasonable opportunity to obtain knowledge of its character or its essential terms; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-10\">(d) Discharge in insolvency proceedings ; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-11\">(e) Any other discharge of which the holder has notice when he takes the instrument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-12\">Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 673.3-305. A simple holder, by contrast, takes an instrument subject to all defenses of any party which would be available in an action on a simple contract, as well as the defenses of want or failure of consideration, non-performance of any condition precedent, non-delivery, or delivery for a special purpose. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 673.3-306. Since the principal defense to .liability raised by the bank \u2014 failure of consideration resulting from Hannon\u2019s action in stopping payment on its check for the money orders\u2014 <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> is unavailable against the IRS if it is a holder in due course, the bank can prevail only if the United States enjoys the less exalted status of mere holder.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-15\">A substantial hurdle blocks the bank\u2019s path to success in this Court. The district court explicitly found that the United States is a holder in due course of the 190 money orders. The government insists that this holding is a finding of ultimate fact, resting on certain implicit subsidiary findings of fact, and that our review is limited by the clearly erroneous rule, Fed.R.Civ.Pro. 52(a). <em>See </em>Humphrey v. Southwestern Portland Cement Co., 5 Cir. 1974, 488 F.2d 691, 694. The bank, on the other hand, characterizes the court\u2019s conclusion as a mixed question of fact and law and urges us to re-examine it free from the insulation of Rule 52(a). See Galena Oaks Corp. v. Scofield, 5 Cir. 1954, 218 F.2d 217; 9 C. Wright <em>&amp; A. </em>Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2589.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-16\">Section 3-302(1) of the UCC supplies the definition of a holder in due course: a holder in due course is a holder who takes an instrument for value, in good faith, and without notice that it is overdue or has been dishonored or of any defense against it on the part of any person. Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 673.3-302(1). While the Code also provides statutory meaning for the terms \u201ctaking for value,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 673.3-303, and \u201cnotice to purchaser,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 673.3-304, it is apparent that the application of these subsidiary definitions in order to determine whether a party is a holder in due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>course will very often turn heavily on the facts of a particular case. This is not to deny that.a conclusion that a party is a holder in due course might depend largely or entirely on a question of law, which would of course come to us free of the \u201cbuckler and shield\u201d of Rule 52(a). When, as in the case at bar, however, the determination was essentially factual, it should not be reversed unless clearly erroneous. Bowling Green, Inc. v. State Street Bank and Trust Co., 1 Cir. 1970, 425 F.2d 81, 85; Blow v. Ammerman, 1965, 121 U.S.App. D.C. 351, 350 F.2d 729, 731; Walsh v.

Gaubert Industries, Inc., 5 Cir. 1968, 403 F.2d 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">The bank argues that the evidence in the case will not support the trial court\u2019s implicit finding that the United States received the money orders in good faith, as required of a holder in due course.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The bank also disputes the trial court\u2019s implicit finding that the United States did not have notice of a claim or defense to the money orders. While we concede that certain evidence supports the bank\u2019s defensive theories, two principles must guide our evaluation of appellant\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s findings. First, \u201cwhen district court findings of fact are challenged \u2018[t]he question is not simply whether the reviewing court would have found otherwise but whether the trial court could permissibly find as it did.\u2019 Movible Offshore, Inc. v. The M/V Wilken A. Falgout, 5 Cir. 1973, 471 F.2d 268, 271.\u201d Guardian Life Insurance Co. v. Eagle, 5 Cir. 1973, 484 F.2d 382, 384. Secondly, \u201c[i]n determining whether a finding is clearly .erroneous the rule requires that due regard be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d 9 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2585 at 732; <em>accord, </em>United States v. Reddoch, 5 Cir. 1972, 467 F.2d 897, 898.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">On the basis of our careful review of the record as a whole, we find more than ample evidence to support the trial court\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Because we are not \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed,\u201d United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 1948, 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746, we must reject appellant\u2019s argument that the United States was not a holder in due course.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">IV. EQUITABLE CONSIDERATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">As an alternative ground for relief, appellant notes the essentially equitable nature of an action to foreclose a lien and insists that dirt on the hands of the IRS agents should have made the United States an unwelcome supplicant in the equity courtroom. Conceding the absence of actionable fraud, bank nevertheless urges that <em>\u201cat the very least, </em>the conduct of [the United States\u2019] agents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>in procuring and seeking to enforce such alleged lien did . . . amount to \u2018overreaching,\u2019 was \u2018unconscionable,\u2019 \u2018oppressive,\u2019 and \u2018concealed important facts,\u2019 even if such actions by plaintiff\u2019s agents were \u2018strictly within the law.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Appellant at 21 (emphasis in the original).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Certainly when seeking an equitable remedy the United States is no more immune to the general principles of equity than any other litigant. Although these principles \u201cwill not be applied to frustrate the purpose of its laws or to thwart public policy,\u201d <em>see </em>Pan American Petroleum &amp; Transport Co. v. United States, 1927, 273 U.S. 456, 506, 47 S.Ct. 416, 424, 71 L.Ed. 734, 747; Deseret Apartments v. United States, 10 Cir. 1957, 250 F.2d 457, 458, in general \u201cthere is no authority by which equity can come to the aid of an illegal and fraudulent scheme, regardless of the beneficence of the ultimate purpose.\u201d In re Mutual Leasing Corp., 5 Cir. 1971, 449 F.2d 811, 815. On the other hand, \u201cunless the Government did something which in good conscience it should not have done, or failed to do something fair dealing required it to do, it comes into court with clean hands and is entitled to the equitable relief it obtained.\u201d <em>Deseret Apartments, supra, </em>250 F.2d at 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The conduct of the IRS agents obviously disturbed the trial judge: \u201cYou keep talking about a moral issue, and to be perfectly frank with you, I don\u2019t find it a very pleasing thing that the government did here, my government, frankly . . . .\u201d App. at 209. He nevertheless correctly perceived the real issue to be whether the government, through the IRS agents, had a lawful right to do what it did; that is, receive the money orders in payment for taxes and request that the bank honor them. Having determined that the United States acted with sufficient good faith and in ignorance of the bank\u2019s defenses to the money orders to attain the status of holder in due course, the court not surprisingly concluded that the United States was entitled to have its statutory lien enforced. On the basis of the evidence in this case we are unwilling to quarrel with the trial judge\u2019s belief that conduct insufficiently malignant to deprive a party of holder in due course status is likewise an inadequate reason for refusing to grant an equitable remedy. Whether the contamination of one seeking equity justifies the chancellor in turning a deaf ear is, in the first instance, for the chancellor to decide; we see nothing in the conduct of the IRS agents that should have compelled him to call the men pariahs.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-13\">V. COUNTER CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b612-14\">Finally, appellant protests the district court\u2019s rejection of its Federal Tort Claims Act counterclaim.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> According to bank\u2019s theory of liability, the IRS agents negligently omitted to notify the bank that the money orders would not be used to pay the electricians, but rather had been tendered in payment for Medallion\u2019s taxes. The bank suggests that had it been so notified, in timely fashion, it could have notified Hannon, which in turn could have paid the electricians in time to avoid the late payment penalty for which bank was subsequently assessed in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>The district court recognized that a private party would be liable for a failure to notify another only if an underlying duty to notify existed between the two parties. <em>E. g., </em>Modlin v. City of Miami Beach, Fla.1967, 201 So.2d 70, 75. Concluding that the IRS had no such duty to give notice to the bank of the delivery of the money orders, the court could find no basis for imposing liability on the United States. We detect no error in this reasoning. The fact of being a holder in due course of the money orders certainly created no legal duty on the part of the United States to notify the bank. Nor can we find the basis for such a duty in the statement from Hatahley v. United States, 1956, 351 U.S. 173, 181, 76 S.Ct. 745, 752, 100 L.Ed. 1065, 1074, relied on by appellant that \u201c \u2018[d]ue care\u2019 implies at least some minimal concern for the rights of others.\u201d The words \u201cdue care\u201d point to the issue of whether a party\u2019s conduct complies with or violates a duty owed to another; they provide no independent answer to the preliminary question whether a duty exists at all.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Having failed to supply an affirmative answer to that initial question, the bank was not entitled to procede with its claim.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">This case has required us to explore one of the lesser known chambers in a labyrinthine Internal Revenue Code honeycombed with obscure passageways. But if unfamiliar and infrequently visited, section 6311(b)(2) may be understood without the specialized tools of statutory speleology. Framed in relatively straightforward English, its meaning is readily apparent; and though the unwary may find it a trap, passage around the danger is marked by accepted commercial practices and established principles of the law of negotiable instruments. Our federal tax code may appear to operate with a rigidity that makes its collectors bereft of human pity, conscience, or compassion; its operation is also an illustration that ours is a government of laws, not men.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b602-6\">.

Although the quarter ended in September 1970, Medallion\u2019s tax return for the period was not due until the end of October.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b602-12\">. Hannon\u2019s October 14 check, for $83,000, was insufficient to cover Medallion\u2019s payroll for the ..week; on discovering the shortage from appellant\u2019s assistant cashier, however, Hannon wirpd the necessary additional funds, $9,434.61, to appellant, which then credited the funds to Medallion\u2019s account.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b604-6\">.

In <em>American Tobacco Co. </em>the taxpayer attempted to use three certified checks drawn on defendant bank to pay internal revenue taxes, but the checks were not paid due to a bank holiday. Subsequently the taxpayer paid the tax liability and received from the IRS both the unpaid certified checks and an assignment of the government\u2019s statutory lien against the bank\u2019s assets. When the bank refused to honor the certified checks, taxpayer brought suit. The bank argued that since the statutory lien was only for the benefit of the government, allowing the taxpayer to recover would be unjust to the other creditors of the bank. The court disagreed ; reasoning that the funds originally deposited for the checks and subject to immediate demand by the government never changed in nature simply because the government chose to pursue the taxpayer rather than the lien, the court concluded that to refuse to allow taxpayer to stand in the government\u2019s shoes in enforcing the lien would only unjustly enrich general creditors with money over which they had no legitimate claim. <em>Accord, </em>Cuesta, Ray &amp; Co. v.

In <em>Hataldey </em>government agents acting pursuant to the Federal Range Code had impounded Navajo livestock unlawfully grazing on federal lands, and the Indians had filed suit against the United States under the Tort Claims Act. Since the agents had failed to comply with notice provisions of the Federal Range Code, they were found to have been trespassers whose conduct entitled the plaintiffs to recover money damages. Whether the agents\u2019 acts were, in the operative words of 28 U.S.O. \u00a7 1346(b), \u201cnegligent\u201d or \u201cwrongful,\u201d the crucial measure of their conduct came from the statutory duty to give notice.
