Such participation by counsel may be allowed by the District Judge in his discretion, if he finds such participation necessary to his comprehension of the arguments and thus to a fair and correct resolution of this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1243-18\">On the Government\u2019s motion, the court ordered deletion of this paragraph over my dissent. Two reasons have been given for the deletion: (1) that the paragraph was incorrect as a matter of law; (2) that it was unnecessary. I join in the denial of appellee\u2019s present motion for rehearing solely on the second ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-20\">The court today agrees that the deleted passage was unnecessary to its decision. Accordingly, the court\u2019s action does not decide the question which the passage addressed.</p>\n<author id=\"b1243-21\">ROBB, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1243-22\">I voted to delete the paragraph referred to by Judge Bazelon on two grounds: (1) the paragraph was an incorrect statement of the law, and (2) it was unnecessary to the decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
