Citizens Casualty Company of New York.et al., 5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1033-27\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1033-28\">On January 23, 1973, appellant was injured while working as a \u201cfloor hand\u201d on a drilling barge owned and operated by appellee. The crew was \u201cworking over\u201d a pre-existing oil well, and was pulling pipe out of the hole when the accident occurred. The pipe is removed in sections, which are unscrewed from each other and then racked. On this occasion, when the particular length of pipe was separated from the rest of the pipe, instead of coming straight up it snapped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>away, swung across the rig and struck appellant above his right eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">Appellant brought suit for damages in the district court under the Jones Act and the general maritime law. At the close of all the evidence, the court granted appellee\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. We reverse and remand for a new trial because the court erred in directing a verdict on the issue of unseaworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">The question of a vessel\u2019s seaworthiness is ordinarily one of fact. <em>See, </em>Rivers v. Angf. A/B Tirfing, 450 F.2d 12 (5th Cir. 1971); United States Lines Company v. Williams, 365 F.2d 332 (5th Cir. 1966); Jefferson v. Taiyo Katun, 310 F.2d 582 (5th Cir. 1962). The question must be submitted to the jury if \u201c. . . fair-minded men, viewing all the facts and the inferences that may be drawn from the facts, can differ over whether the ship and its gear are reasonably fit for service. . . .\u201d Lundy v. Isthmian Lines, Inc., 423 F.2d 913, 915 (4th Cir. 1970). In order to meet this burden, a plaintiff need only show \u201c. that the device in question failed under conditions when it should have functioned properly.\u201d Oliveras v. American Export Isbrandtsen Lines, Inc., 431 F.2d 814, 816 (2nd Cir. 1970). Proof of precisely how or why the failure occurred is unnecessary. <em>See, </em>Gibbs v. Kiesel, 382 F.2d 917 (5th Cir. 1967); Vega v. The Malula, 291 F.2d 415 (5th Cir. 1961). In <em>Vega </em>a sheave fell on and injured a longshoreman when a pin unaccountably slipped out of a cargo block. Describing the accident as \u201c. . .a classic case of patent unseaworthiness . . . \u201d this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-10\">The event occurred. . . . The block failed while being used for a normal expected purpose. How the pin happened to slip out is of no real legal significance. No matter how much care was used either by the owner, the ship\u2019s crew, or the deceased crew member immediately responsible for its maintenance, the failure of the block under normal expected use visits on the vessel owner an .unremitting liability based on the breach of the absolute duty. (citations omitted) <em>Vega, supra, </em>pp. 419-420.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1034-14\">Here, appellant\u2019s proof clearly showed that the pipe failed to come out of the hole in the normal manner. This presents a question of fact as to the vessel\u2019s seaworthiness, a question which the jury should have been allowed to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-15\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
