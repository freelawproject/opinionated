Those decisions have issued, and supplementary legal memo-randa have been filed by the parties. We now reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-17\">Appellants were convicted on several counts of violating the local indecent publications statute, 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 2001 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (1970), by possessing obscene material, with the intent to disseminate it. The material consisted of several \u201cmagazines\u201d made up of collections of photographs of two nude or near-nude females shown undressing, caressing, fondling and embracing each other. The photographs were accompanied by brief written material, including a trilingual statement purportedly addressed to \u201cserious students of art.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Having ascertained that the jury was properly instructed under the standards of Roth v. United States <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Memoirs v. Massachusetts,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and having made our own independent determination that these determinations were not contrary to the First Amendment,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we upheld the convictions of both appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">We voluntarily stayed the issuance of our mandate to await guidance on the \u201cintractable obscenity problem.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We now review our decision in light of the principles enunciated in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973); Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 93 S.Ct. 2628, 37 L.Ed.2d 446 (1973); United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Film, 413 U.S. 123, 93 S.Ct. 2665, 37 L.Ed.2d 500 (1973); Heller v. New York, 413 U.S. 483, 93 S.Ct. 2789, 37 L.Ed.2d 745 (1973), and Roaden v. Kentucky, 413 U.S. 496, 93 S. Ct. 2796, 37 L.Ed.2d 757 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The Supreme Court decisions, particularly <em>Heller, </em>fully support our prior ruling upholding the use of <em>ex parte </em>hearings to grant warrants authorizing seizure of limited amounts of alleged obscene materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">As to the legal definition of obscenity and its application, we face a different situation. Our earlier opinion explicitly adopted the standard of <em>Roth </em>and <em>Memoirs. </em>At that time we rejected appellants\u2019 contention that to sustain a conviction under an obscenity statute, the material must be found to be either \u201chard-core\u201d pornography or be sold in an objectionable manner, <em>i. e., </em>sold to juveniles or pandered in an offensive manner. <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">The Supreme Court has recently undertaken \u201cto formulate standards more. concrete than those in the past.\u201d Miller v. California, <em>supra, </em>413 U.S. at 20, 93 S.Ct. at 2612. The new guidelines differ from the <em>Roth-Memoirs </em>test in several respects. First, the <em>Roth </em>test is retained insofar as the trier of fact must determine whether \u201c \u2018the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest (citations omitted).\u201d Miller v. California, <em>supra, </em>at 24, 93 S.Ct. at 2615. Second, the trier of fact is to determine \u201cwhether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual <em>conduct </em>specifically defined by the applicable state law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added.) Third, the trier of fact must determine \u201cwhether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although these standards generally resemble the earlier test, the new guidelines also represent a break from <em>Roth </em>and <em>Memoirs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-17\">The <em>Miller </em>opinion confirmed the state\u2019s ability to obtain obscenity prosecution, even in the absence of pandering or orientation to juveniles, but it confined that ability when, as, and if, limited to instances of \u201chard-core\u201d sexual conduct. The Court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b485-18\">Under the holdings announced today, no one will be spbject to prosecution for the sale or exposure of obscene materials <em>unless these materials depict or describe patently offensive \u201chard core\u2019\u2019 sexual conduct </em>specifically defined by the regulating state law, as written or construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-19\">Miller v. California, <em>supra, </em>at 27, 93 S.Ct. at 2616. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b485-20\">To give concrete meaning to its new definition of obscenity the Court gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>examples of areas of permissible regulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\">(a) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">(b) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Miller v. California, <em>supra, </em>at p. 25, 93 S.Ct. at 2615. While these examples are not an \u201cexhaustive catalog\u201d of what is patently offensive, they \u201cfix substantive constitutional limitations, deriving from the First Amendment, on the type of material subject to such a determination\u201d and other material must be \u201csufficiently similar to such material to justify similar treatment.\u201d Jenkins v. Georgia, 418 U.S. 153, at 160-161, 94 S.Ct. 2750, at 2755, 41 L.Ed.2d 640 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">This aspect of <em>Miller </em>confined the constitutional reach of obscenity statutes, although in other respects <em>Miller </em>expanded the state\u2019s regulatory area.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">The constitutional requirement that the state obscenity laws \u201cspecifically define\u201d the \u201chard core sexual conduct\u201d that may not be depicted does not necessitate specificity in the text of the statute if it is provided by authoritative judicial interpretation. In the various eases remanded by the Supreme Court to the state courts for further consideration in the light of <em>Miller </em>there has been a divergence of approach. Two decisions upheld convictions under state laws which could be considered vague in language because prior authoritative judicial interpretation had brought them within the degree of specificity required by the Supreme Court in <em>Miller. </em>Rhodes v. State, 283 So.2d 351 (S.Ct. Fla.1973); State v. J-R Distributors, 82 Wash.2d 584, 512 P.2d 1049 (1973). A third state case, however, on remand from the Supreme Court, overturned a conviction under the Indiana obscenity statute, finding that the statute was unconstitutionally vague in its failure to specify the sexual conduct, the depiction of which constituted obscenity. Stroud v. State, 300 N.E.2d 100 (S.Ct.Ind.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-13\">A question arises whether the statutory provision involved in the conviction before us, 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 2001, could be constitutionally salvaged by the court without \u201cconcrete legislative efforts\u201d (see <em>Miller, </em>413 U.S. at 25, 93 S.Ct. 2607).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If this were the only issue provided by the record, it might be appropriate to remand this case to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, which is now the tribunal to render authoritative interpretations of the D.C. Code,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-14\">Whatever the possibility that the D. C. Court of Appeals might, by specific limitations wrought through a doctrine of construction, or re-construction, salvage the constitutionality of 11 D.C. Code \u00a7 2001, for prospective application, appellants\u2019 convictions cannot be sustained on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-15\">Under the 1973 <em>Miller </em>opinion the trier of fact must determine whether the work as a whole \u201cdepicts or describes, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>a patently offensive way, sexual conduct [as] specifically defined . . . What is required under this opinion, and what is lacking from the charge in the case at bar, is an instruction to the jury to use a standard focusing on the depiction of specifically defined sexual conduct. Rather, the \u201cpatently offensive\u201d test to be applied to the evidence was stated by the judge in general and subjective terms,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> fairly reflected in this passage from the instructions to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">You must decide whether the predominant appeal of the publications is to the prurient interest, a- shameful or morbid interest in sex, and if they go substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description of such matters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">In our opinion granting the petition for rehearing, we specifically stated that although the materials were obscene under the <em>Roth-Memoirs </em>test, they were not \u201chard-core\u201d pornography.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">We have grave doubt whether these \u201cLesbian\u201d pictures are violative of the narrow and specific prohibitions that now mark the limit of constitutionality. The materials are described in our earlier opinion, and reiteration is not necessary. It suffices to say that the materials do not show \u201cultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated.\u201d (See <em>Miller, supra, </em>418 U.S. at 25, 93 S.Ct. at 2615). There is no vaginal, anal or oral penetration. Our earlier opinion stressed that \u201cimminent\u201d Lesbian activity might suffice to show material \u201cpatently offensive because it goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor.\u201d (152 U.S.App.D.C. at 245, 254, 470 F.2d 393, 402) But <em>Miller </em>requires \u201chard core sexual conduct\u201d \u2014 exemplified by \u201cultimate sexual acts\u201d or the kind of conduct covered by a \u201clewd exhibition of the genitals.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This requirement was reiterated in Jenkins v. Georgia, <em>supra, </em>where the Supreme Court said: \u201cAppellant\u2019s showing of the film \u2018Carnal Knowledge\u2019 is simply not the \u2018public portrayal of hard core sexual conduct for its own sake, and for ensuing commercial gain' which we said was punishable in <em>Miller.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-16\">The appellants protested throughout that they could not validly be convicted on the vague standards used by the prosecutor and the trial judge. Although their particular remedy was not accepted by the Supreme Court, that Court did acknowledge the need for specific confinement of the obscenity statutes to arrive at valid contours. Since the judgment in appellants\u2019 case has not become final \u201cany constitutional principle enunciated in <em>Miller </em>which would serve to benefit [appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>lants] must be applied in their case.\u201d Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, at 102, 94 S.Ct. 2887, at 2900, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">In the context of this case, featured by doubt as to whether the materials violate the specific <em>Miller </em>standards, elementary constitutional considerations preclude affirmance of a conviction where the jury was not instructed that it was its task, as surrogate for the community, to determine whether there was depiction of \u201csexual conduct\u201d to a point of patent offensiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The case is reversed and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b484-9\">. Both opinions are printed at Huffman v. United States, 152 U.S.App.D.C. 238, 470 F.2d 386 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b484-10\">. Our opinion referred specifically to Alexander v. Virginia, in which the Supreme Court had requested the parties to brief the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-11\">Whether the display of any sexually oriented pictorial magazines for commercial sale, when surrounded by notice to the public of their nature and by reasonable protection against exposure of the magazines to juveniles is constitutionally permissible?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">The Supreme Court vacated the judgment of the Supreme Court of Virginia and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with' the decisions in the most recent obscenity cases.

There is a question of the \u201cjudicial role\u201d in such a salvaging.
