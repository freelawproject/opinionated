This testimony was received without objection and was not the ground of the motion for a mistrial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b495-4\">ROBB, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b495-16\">The appellants Margaret Maekin and Erana Mae Gibson were convicted by a jury of first degree premeditated murder (22 D.C.Code \u00a7 2401), first degree felony murder (22 D.C.Code \u00a7 2401), and robbery (22 D.C.Code \u00a7 2901). The District Court sentenced each appellant to life imprisonment on each murder count and a term of three to fifteen years on the robbery count, all sentences to be served concurrently. We affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-18\">The crimes charged in the three counts of the indictment were the murder and robbery of Mrs. Blanche Porter. Mrs. Porter, a 74-year old widow, suffered from generalized arthritis, partial deafness, partial blindness, obesity, and loss of bladder and bowel control. She had great difficulty in moving about, getting out of bed, or standing up, and even with the aid of a walker was unable to walk more than a short distance, such as the distance from her room to the bathroom. From 1967 until her death on October 8, 1971, she lived at the Nelson Nursing Home in northwest Washington. At the time of her death Mrs. Porter was the only patient in the home, which was managed by the appellant Maekin.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-19\">Mrs. Porter\u2019s sister-in-law, Mrs. Eva Curtis of Forestville, Maryland, was the only relative of Mrs. Porter who saw her regularly. On October 7, 1971 around 7:00 P.M. Mrs. Curtis telephoned Mrs. Maekin and told her that Mrs. Porter\u2019s seventy-fifth birthday was approaching and that the next day, October 8, Mrs. Curtis was going to come in a cab and take Mrs. Porter out for a birthday luncheon. Mrs. Curtis asked Mrs. Mack-in to have the old lady dressed and ready and tell her Mrs. Curtis was coming for her. Mrs. Maekin said she would do this.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-20\">About half-past seven on the morning of October 8 Mrs. Maekin called Mrs. Curtis and told her \u201cMrs. Porter doesn\u2019t want you to come up today. She is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>going out with a friend.\u201d Mrs. Curtis responded \u201cI didn\u2019t know she had any friends. Where is she going?\u201d Mrs. Mackin replied \u201cI don\u2019t know. She told me to call, and she is going out with friends.\u201d When Mrs. Curtis asked if Mrs. Porter had been told of the plan to take her out to lunch Mrs. Mackin said \u201cYes,\u201d but \u201c[d]on\u2019t come up. She will not be home.\u201d Mrs. Curtis called Mrs. Mackin again at four o\u2019clock that afternoon and asked if Mrs. Porter was home yet. Mrs. Mackin replied \u201cShe has not come in yet.\u201d At nine o\u2019clock that evening Mrs. Curtis called again to ask Mrs. Mackin if she had heard anything from Mrs. Porter. Mrs. Mackin replied \u201cYes, I heard from her, and she will be home in a couple of days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">On the morning of October 8, 1971 the police found the body of a white female floating in the Anacostia River near the Sousa Bridge in southeast Washington. The body was clothed in a black robe, a green gown, blue underclothing and black slippers, and there was one ring on the right ring finger and a Timex watch on the left wrist. The police estimated the age of the dead woman as between forty to fifty years, and this' estimate was recorded in the description of the body when it was received at the morgue. From an autopsy the medical examiner concluded that the cause of death was drowning and that the body had been in the water less than twenty-four hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The corpse that floated in the Anacos-tia River on the morning of October 8 was the corpse of Mrs. Blanche Porter, but as will be seen it was not identified until November 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">On the afternoon of October 8 Mrs. Porter\u2019s son, James D. Haveron, who lived in California, telephoned to wish his mother a happy birthday. Mrs. Mackin answered the telephone. She told Mr. Haveron \u201cYour mother has gone out . . . with a lady friend\u201d. She added that the birthday cards Mr. Haveron and his family had sent had arrived and Mrs. Porter would get them when she came home.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Since it was unusual for Mrs. Porter to go anywhere, and indeed Mrs. Curtis had not seen her outside without her walker for three years, Mrs. Curtis continued to call Mrs. Mackin every two or three days. Each time when Mrs. Curtis asked if there was any news from her sister-in-law Mrs. Mackin responded that she had not heard anything. On one occasion Mrs. Mackin seemed annoyed and said \u201cI told you I would let you know the minute I hear anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">Mrs. Curtis knew that Mrs. Porter\u2019s Civil Service retirement check arrived on the first of each month, and her Social Security check on the third of each month. On November 3 when Mrs. Curtis called and was told by Mrs. Mackin that both checks had arrived but Mrs. Porter had not returned, Mrs. Curtis started crying and said \u201cWell, I am going to call her children and have the Missing Persons Bureau notified, because I know something has happened to her now.\u201d Mrs. Mackin said she was going to hold the checks \u201cto see if she heard from Mrs. Porter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">LeRoy Haveron, a son of James Hav-eron, lived in Bethesda, Maryland. On November 3, after talking with his father and his aunt, Mrs. Curtis, he reported to the District of Columbia Police that Mrs. Porter was missing. He also called the Nelson Nursing Home and asked Mrs. Mackin if she had any news of his grandmother. Mrs. Mackin said she had no news but she had heard from Mrs. Porter, and she was all right.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">As a result of LeRoy Haveron\u2019s report the Washington Police interviewed Mrs. Mackin on several occasions, beginning November 4. She told the police Mrs. Porter had driven off in a dark colored automobile with a woman who was unknown to Mrs. Mackin, and a day or two later Mrs. Porter had called and said \u201cshe would come back when she felt like it.\u201d Mrs. Mackin said-she did not know where Mrs. Porter had gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">On November 10, in response to a call from Mrs. Curtis, James Haveron came to Washington to search for his mother. He went to the Nelson Nursing Home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>where Mrs. Mackin- took him to Mrs. Porter\u2019s room. He noticed that Mrs. Porter\u2019s wheel chair and walker were still in the room, but there was no clue to her whereabouts. Mrs. Mackin told him Mrs. Porter\u2019s checks for the month of November had come and that she, Mrs. Mackin, had returned them to the senders with a notation \u201cnot here\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">Before returning to California on November 13 James Haveron inquired at the morgue, describing his mother as a woman seventy-four years old. He was told there was no one answering that description at the morgue.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">On the evening of November 30 Victor J. Haveron, another of Mrs. Porter\u2019s sons, and his wife Paula, went to the morgue and identified Mrs. Porter\u2019s body. On December 1 the Haverons went to the Nelson Nursing Home to pick up Mrs. Porter\u2019s insurance policy. They were met by Mrs. Mackin who found the policy for them. Without letting Mrs. Mackin know that Mrs. Porter\u2019s body had been found they asked if she was sure it was Mrs. Porter who had called her on October 8. Raising her voice Mrs. Mackin replied \u201cYes, don\u2019t you think I know your mother. She lived with me for four years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The circumstances of Mrs. Porter\u2019s disappearance and death did not become known to the police until January 1972, when Antonia Johnson and her husband George made statements to investigating officers. We summarize their story, as recounted in their statements and repeated in testimony at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The Johnsons were narcotics addicts who, as Antonia Johnson testified, supported their habit by \u201cstealing, robbing, selling dope, just everything.\u201d They were acquainted with the appellant Er-ana Gibson who occupied an apartment near theirs. Early in October 1971 Mrs. Gibson told the Johnsons that \u201cmy godmother has this nursing home, and there is this old bitch that knows too much that we got to get rid of.\u201d To carry out this project she wanted to rent the John-sons\u2019 car for $50.00. The Johnsons did not accept Mrs. Gibson\u2019s proposal at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"A51\">On the night of October 7 Mrs. Gibson renewed her proposition, asking \u201cWhat about tonight, can I use the car tonight?\u201d She explained that she \u201cwanted to go get the old broad\u201d and \u201cdrive her into the woods somewhere, and leave her, because she couldn\u2019t walk very well.\u201d She offered to pay the Johnsons $100, which she said she would obtain from her godmother. The Johnsons accepted this proposal and the three went to the Nelson Nursing Home, George Johnson driving and Mrs. Gibson directing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">The Johnsons and Mrs. Gibson arrived at the nursing home shortly before midnight. Mrs. Gibson went into the house, saying \u201cI\u2019m going to get the old broad\u201d. A few minutes later she and Mrs. Mack-in came out with Mrs. Porter between them. They held her arms, helping her to walk, and put her in the back seat of the car, Mrs. Porter sitting in the middle with Mrs. Mackin and Mrs. Gibson on either side. Mrs. Porter said she \u201cfelt bad\u201d, asked when she was going to \u201cget to the hospital\u201d and complained that her \u201carthritis was bothering her\u201d. Mrs. Gibson told her \u201cNow don\u2019t worry; we will get there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"auq-dedup-0\">After Mrs. Porter had been placed in the car Mrs. Gibson said \u201cLet\u2019s go to Maryland somewhere, where it is dark\u201d. George Johnson then drove aimlessly fo\u00ed-an hour or so and finally stopped the car on a dirt road under the Sousa Bridge in Washington. Mrs. Porter kept saying \u201cWhen are we going to get to the hospital? This is a long time to get to the hospital.\u201d Mrs. Gibson reassured her, calling her \u201cdear\u201d, but told her to get out of the car because \u201cthe man got a flat.\u201d Mrs. Mackin and Mrs. Gibson helped the old lady out of the car and walked her toward the Anacostia River. Then there was a gasp and a splash and Mrs. Mackin and Mrs. Gibson returned to the car, without Mrs. Porter. Mrs. Gibson showed the Johnsons two rings which she said she had got from the old <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>lady and was going to keep; and she gave the Johnsons a \u201cbrand new\u201d one-hundred dollar bill which she got \u201cfrom her godmother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">After the murder the Johnsons took Mrs. Mackin back to her nursing home and then went to the Johnsons\u2019 apartment in the Mt. Pleasant area of Washington. Just as they arrived there Mrs. Gibson, noticing that Mrs. Porter\u2019s purse was still in the car, went through the purse, took some small change, said \u201cLet me get rid of it\u201d and threw it into a nearby sewer.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">On November 11, 1971 Antonia and George Johnson were arrested for armed robbery. While in the Detention Center Antonia received drug therapy and she brooded about the drowning of Mrs. Porter. As she testified at trial \u201cI thought about it often, especially when I started to admit to myself I wanted to be for real and stop pretending and face myself . . . Stop living in a fantasy world of drugs ... it didn\u2019t matter what it took out of my life, it didn\u2019t matter. If it took me the next twenty years to get together, I was going to start, for real, you know, stop being phony.\u201d This thinking led her to make a full confession to the police. She took them to the nursing home, to the bridge where Mrs. Porter had been murdered, to Mrs. Gibson\u2019s home, and to the sewer where Mrs. Gibson had thrown Mrs. Porter\u2019s pocketbook. The police recovered the pocketbook from this sewer. Without disclosing to George Johnson what his wife had told them, the police interviewed him, and he corroborated Antonia\u2019s statement in every detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Acting on the information given them by the Johnsons the police obtained arrest warrants for Mrs. Mackin and Mrs. Gibson, and they were arrested on January 17, 1972. When placed under arrest Mrs. Gibson was wearing two of Mrs. Porter\u2019s rings.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">At trial it was stipulated that Mrs. Mackin endorsed the name of Blanche Porter on five checks that had been mailed to Mrs. Porter at the Nelson Nursing Home, as follows: a Civil Service retirement check dated October 1, 1971 for $163.00; a Social Security check dated October 2, 1971 for $119.50; a Civil Service check dated November 1, 1971 for $163.00; a Social Security check dated November 3, 1971 for $119.-50; and a Civil Service retirement check dated December 1, 1971 for $163.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">Mrs. Mackin testified in her defense that she wanted Mrs. Porter to leave the nursing home because she \u201cwas an extremely difficult person to get along with,\u201d sometimes she \u201cwould be nice and the next time she couldn\u2019t be meaner.\u201d She was incontinent \u201cbut I believe she could have controlled herself much better\u201d and sometimes Mrs. Mackin\u201c\u2018would have to scrub her room there three times a day\u201d. According to Mrs. Mack-in she asked Mrs. Curtis \u201cover a dozen times\u201d to remove Mrs. Porter but each time Mrs. Curtis \u201cwould promise to do so and then back out.\u201d Mrs. Curtis said she could not take Mrs. Porter in to live with her. So, said Mrs. Mackin, \u201cI decided, or thought about asking someone with a car to take her to Maryland, if possible, and then leave her there so that she could be taken to her sister-in-law. I had thought of Forestville, Maryland, where her sister-in-law lived. In that area.\u201d \u201cI asked Mrs. Gibson if she could obtain a car so that she [Mrs. Porter] could be taken in that general area and I knew her sister-in-law would have to take her in.\u201d The plan was to have Mrs. Porter \u201cdropped off ... in the Forestville area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">On the 7th of October, the appellant testified, Mrs. Gibson told her she had found someone who would pick Mrs. Porter up and take her out to Maryland, she had a man with a car and they would come and pick up Mrs. Porter. They did come around midnight. Mrs. Gibson and Mrs. Mackin went upstairs and Mrs. Mackin \u201ctold Mrs. Porter that she was going to leave. She came down the steps and we went out the front door.\u201d George Johnson was the man with Mrs. Gibson, who introduced Mrs. Mackin to him, saying \u201cGeorge, this is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Margaret.\u201d He and Mrs. Gibson helped Mrs. Porter down the steps and into the ear. Then they drove off and left Mrs. Mackin standing on her porch.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Continuing her testimony, Mrs. Mack-in said that sometime in the next two days after Mrs. Porter left, probably on the 8th of October, Mrs. Gibson had called her and said \u201cthey had driven around and around\u201d and that finally \u201cthey got out\u201d and Mr. Johnson and Mrs. Gibson and Mrs. Porter had \u201cwalked near a river\u201d where \u201cGeorge told Mrs. Gibson to move and she . kind of turned and she saw his hands come up and give Mrs. Porter a push and Mrs. Porter went into the water.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Still on direct examination, Mrs. Mackin admitted lying to the police and to Mrs. Porter\u2019s relatives, because \u201cI certainly was not going to be in a big hurry to tell them that their mother had been disposed of like that. I covered up and said that for as long a time that I could that she was away. I know it was a lie.\u201d Although she claimed she had signed Mrs. Porter\u2019s October checks at Mrs. Porter\u2019s request she admitted she had no authority to endorse the November and December checks. She endorsed them, and \u201cstole the money\u201d, she said, because the license of the Nelson Nursing Home \u201chad been lifted\u201d in April of 1971 and she \u201cneeded the money\u201d to make repairs so she could \u201creopen as a rooming house.\u201d Concluding her direct testimony she testified that in an earlier case she had been convicted of forging a check and placed on probation for a term of three years. Her probation expired in December 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">On cross examination Mrs. Mackin testified that she planned to have Mrs. Porter taken to \u201cthe Forestville area\u201d. She did not know where Mrs. Curtis lived but \u201choped that [Mrs. Porter] would be taken near there.\u201d She had Mrs. Porter taken away at midnight because she \u201chad to depend on someone to get a car.\u201d Asked why she did not call Mrs. Curtis to tell her Mrs. Porter was being taken to Forestville she replied \u201cYou are asking me something I can\u2019t answer.\u201d She responded \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know\u201d when asked how she expected Mrs. Curtis to know that her sister-in-law was in the Forestville area. She said \u201cthere is no answer\u201d when asked why she sent Mrs. Porter away without her clothes, her wheel chair or her walker. She admitted that as soon as Mrs. Porter left at midnight on October 8 she, Mrs. Mackin, noted on the nursing home records that \u201cMrs. Porter left with a friend on the 8th for a few days\u2019 visit.\u201d She knew this notation was untrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">Mrs. Mackin testified she had known Mrs. Gibson \u201cthree or four years. Maybe five\u201d and they were close friends. She denied that Mrs. Gibson referred to her as her godmother but conceded that she was the godmother of one of Mrs. Gibson\u2019s children.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">Taking the stand in her own behalf Mrs. Gibson testified that she had known Mrs. Mackin for four or five years. Her mother had been a patient at the nursing home and her husband had done plastering and other work there. She said Mrs. Mackin had called her and told her \u201cShe wanted a woman to be taken to Maryland, that her people had refused her and she was tired\u201d and if the woman were taken \u201cto Maryland close to where she lived at\u201d they would find the woman and take her back. According to Mrs. Gibson she asked George Johnson in the presence of his wife Antonia, if he would take the lady to Maryland and he said he would, but not for nothing. Mrs. Gibson said she would give him $75.00 or $100.00. She claimed that she spoke to the Johnsons only once about the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">Mrs. Gibson said she and George and Antonia Johnson went to the Nelson Nursing Home in the Johnson car. Mrs. Gibson \u201ctold him how to get there\u201d. When they got there Mrs. Gibson and Mrs. Mackin went upstairs, \u201cbrought the lady down the steps\u201d and then with the help of George Johnson put her in the car. Mrs. Gibson and the Johnsons drove off with Mrs. Porter, leaving Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Mackin at the home. Mrs. Gibson told George Johnson they were supposed to take Mrs. Porter to Forestville, that was somewhere in Maryland, and he said he knew where that was. They drove around a long time and finally stopped on a dirt road by a bridge. Johnson said \u201cYou all are going to have to get out because I have a flat tire.\u201d He and Mrs. Gibson helped Mrs. Porter out and walked with her over \u201cby the seawall.\u201d They \u201cwalked over there . because she could not stand up, like standing, you know, in the center without some sort of support. So she had placed her hand up against this wall and this is where she was standing.\u201d George Johnson then told Mrs. Gibson to move, pushed Mrs. Porter into the river, ran back to the car, started it and began to move off while Mrs. Gibson was still climbing in. Then he said \u201cHand me the poeketbook\u201d and when she reached for it she \u201cheard the rings drop at that time, and they hit me on the foot. So I handed him the poeketbook, and I picked up the rings.\u201d Antonia Johnson told her to keep them because she had a ring and later Mrs. Mackin told her to keep them.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Mrs. Gibson denied that she searched through Mrs. Porter\u2019s purse and threw it in the sewer. She admitted that when arrested she was wearing Mrs. Porter\u2019s rings, and that she had lied when she told the police Mrs. Mackin had given her the rings \u201cabout six months before that.\u201d She also admitted she had lied when she told the police she knew nothing about Mrs Porter\u2019s death. She said she lied because she was \u201cscared\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">On cross examination Mrs. Gibson testified that the plan was to drop Mrs. Porter off close \u201cto where the woman\u2019s people lived at\u201d; but she did not know where these people lived, or even who they were. She was \u201cjust going to let this lady [out] in the park and leave her there on her own.\u201d She thought it not unusual that the woman was being taken at midnight, without any clothes, to some unidentified place in Maryland. Finally she swore that Mrs Mackin gave her the one-hundred dollar bill with which to pay the Johnsons.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">We have related this sordid and horrible story so the contentions of the appellants may be understood and weighed in the context of the proof at trial. We turn now to those contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">II..</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">The appellant Gibson claims that the warrant on which she was arrested was not supported by probable cause. Accordingly, she says, evidence that she was wearing Mrs. Porter\u2019s rings at the time of the arrest, and that she had lied about how she got them, should have been suppressed. We think her argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">The appellant argues that the affidavit in support of the arrest warrant was deficient because it was \u201cbased on double hearsay\u201d, there was no statement as to how the informant received the information set out in the affidavit, and there was no showing that the informant was reliable. Having examined the affidavit, which is in the record, we find it quite sufficient to establish probable cause. Briefly the affidavit sets out an informant\u2019s account of the murder of Mrs. Porter, substantially as that story was developed in the testimony of the Johnsons at trial. Although the affidavit refers to the informant as the \u201csource\u201d or \u201cit\u201d, and is phrased in the awkward prose frequently employed in such documents, it is apparent that the informant was an eyewitness to the events described. The affidavit recites that the informant has \u201cproven reliable . . . on numerous occasions that have led to arrests\u201d, and that the police recovered Mrs. Porter\u2019s purse in the sewer where the informant said it had been thrown. In addition, the statements of the informant are plainly declarations against interest, a sign of their reliability. Finally, as the affidavit indicates, the informant\u2019s statements are consistent in many respects with what the police had already learned in their investigation of the disappearance of Mrs. Porter. We think the affidavit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>on its face was plainly sufficient. United States v. Harris, 403 U.S. 573, 91 S. Ct. 2075, 29 L.Ed.2d 723 (1971); Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The appellant Gibson also contends that the District Court should have granted her motion for a mistrial because Mrs. Johnson, asked on direct examination \u201cDuring this period of time, what was your relationship to Mrs. Gibson?\u201d, responded that Mrs. Gibson had sold heroin to her. The question referred to the time when Mrs. Gibson retained the services of the Johnsons and their automobile to transport Mrs. Porter. Overruling the motion for a mistrial the district judge immediately instructed the jury \u201cYou will ignore the question and the answer. The court strikes it from the record.\u201d Assuming that the reference to Mrs. Gibson\u2019s sale of narcotics was error we think it was cured by the prompt and decisive action of the district judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Whether to declare a mistrial or to deal with the error by an instruction to the jury was a matter within the court\u2019s discretion. United States v. Carter, 144 U.S.App.D.C. 193, 445 F.2d 669 (1971); Hardy v. United States, 119 U.S.App.D.C. 364, 343 F.2d 233 (1964), cert. denied, 380 U.S. 984, 85 S.Ct. 1353, 14 L.Ed.2d 276 (1965); Brown v. United States, 380 F.2d 477 (10th Cir. 1967); United States v. Giallo, 206 F.2d 207 (2d Cir. 1953), aff\u2019d, 346 U.S. 929, 74 S.Ct. 319, 98 L.Ed. 421 (1954). In reviewing the proceedings this court must decide whether it was \u201chighly probable that the error had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 776, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1253, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946). \u201cThe decisive factors are the closeness of the case, the centrality of the issue affected by the error, and the steps taken to mitigate the effects of the error.\u201d Gaither v. United States, 134 U.S.App.D.C. 154, 172, 413 F.2d 1061, 1079 (1969) [footnotes omitted].</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">We cannot say that this case was a close one, that the narcotics issue was central to the case or that inadequate steps were taken to mitigate the error. We believe and hold that in view of the overwhelming evidence of guilt any prejudice suffered by the appellant could have had no substantial effect or influence on the verdict.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">The evidence disclosed that while interviewing Antonia Johnson on January 13, 1971 the police showed her a single photograph of Mrs. Mackin \u201cto make sure we were all talking about the same person.\u201d A single photograph of Mrs. Mackin was also shown to George Johnson. The appellant Mackin now argues that the exhibition of her photograph in these cicumstances irreparably tainted the identifications made by the Johnsons in the courtroom. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">The District Court held hearings on the appellant\u2019s motion to suppress her identification by the Johnsons. In these hearings the Johnsons testified at length about their observations of Mrs. Mackin during their activities on the night of the murder, beginning when Mrs. Mack-in helped Mrs. Porter down the steps of the nursing - home, and including the long automobile ride, a stop at a filling station for gasoline, the stop at the river, and the drive back to the home. The court determined and found that there was -an independent source for each identification. With respect to Antonia Johnson the court said: \u201cHere, over a period of approximately an hour and a half, according to the testimony of Mrs. Johnson, there were a number of different occasions on which Mrs. Johnson looked up at the defendant, perhaps five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>in number, periods of the observation was [sic] varied from one to.two minutes to a somewhat longer period. During none of these times was the Defendant Mackin wearing a mask or any other covering\u201d. As for George Johnson\u2019s identification the court noted that he had an even \u201cbetter opportunity to observe Mrs. Mackin . than his wife.\u201d We think the court\u2019s finding of an independent source is supported if not compelled by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The question is whether showing the photograph of Mrs. Mackin to the two witnesses resulted in \u201ca very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification\u201d. Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 384, 88 S.Ct. 967, 971, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968). The answer is that it did not but that under \u201cthe totality of the circumstances\u201d, and notwithstanding the showing of the photograph, the identifications were reliable. Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 199, 200, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972). We agree with the district judge that the circumstances of the present case are significantly different from those of United States v. Gambrill, 146 U.S.App.D.C. 72, 449 F.2d 1148 (1971) relied upon by the appellant. In that case the victim of a rape had only a brief opportunity to observe her assailants, in a poor light, when they were wearing masks, and the victim, who made a courtroom identification, had been completely unable to identify one of the defendants at a lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Although the District Court with commendable' care explored the circumstances of the identifications we note that there was never any contention that someone other than Mrs. Mackin assisted George Johnson and Mrs. Gibson in putting Mrs. Porter in the John-sons\u2019 car. As we have said Mrs. Mackin testified that she was introduced to George Johnson at this time. Any suggestion of mistaken identification therefore has a hollow ring, for in fact the issue was one of veracity between the Johnsons and the appellants, rather than one of identification. See United States v. Garner, 162 U.S.App.D.C.-, 499 F. 2d 536 (1974).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">The appellant Mackin says she was prejudiced because her chief counsel had a conflict of interest, in that he had represented one Williams, a co-defendant of the Johnsons in an armed robbery case in which all had pleaded guilty to a charge of robbery. Mrs. Mackin says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-11\">[I]t is conceivable that inasmuch as the robbery took place at a date close <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>to that of the drowning, since Williams was a confessed confederate in the robbery, he [counsel] might have had some knowledge as to the John-sons\u2019 participation in the drowning or might have heard some statement that the Johnsons had made to Williams. If so, he could not ethically disclose this to Mrs. Mackin or to the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9G\">The appellant\u2019s contention must be rejected. The charge of prejudice is speculative, without even gossamer support in the record. Moreover, the record discloses that the appellant\u2019s chief counsel and his co-counsel vigorously and ably defended the appellant. Campbell v. United States, 122 U.S.App.D.C. 143, 352 F.2d 359 (1965), cited by the appellant, is not in point. In that case the record plainly showed that a defendant was prejudiced because he and a co-defendant were represented by the same lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Both appellants argue that the District Court \u201cerred in curtailing cross-examination of the informants on their claim that they did not turn state\u2019s evidence to escape a murder charge or to obtain more favorable treatment on other charges.\u201d In support of this argument the appellants cite only a ruling of the District Court which curtailed cross-examination of Mrs. Johnson about her hope of receiving a sentence under the Youth Corrections Act. The record establishes that the appellants\u2019 contention has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">George Johnson testified that in November 1971 he was indicted for armed robbery, robbery, assault with a dangerous weapon, and carrying a dangerous weapon. He entered a plea of guilty to robbery and the court record reflected that the other charges would be dismissed. In another case in November 1971 he was indicted for burglary in the first degree while armed, armed robbery, robbery and assault with a dangerous weapon. He entered a plea of guilty to petty larceny and again the court records indicated that the other charges would be dismissed. He testified that he knew he could get a life sentence on the charges alleged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">Mrs. Antonia Johnson testified that she had been indicted along with her husband and also had entered pleas of guilty to robbery and petty larceny in the two cases. She knew the charges in the indictment exposed her to a possible life sentence. In addition, she had been charged with a violation of the Harrison Narcotic Act but was permitted to plead guilty to a misdemeanor under the Uniform Narcotic Act. The Johnsons had not been sentenced in any of the pending eases nor had they been charged with anything in connection with the murder of Mrs. Porter.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">Mrs. Johnson testified that she knew her pleas of guilty subjected her to a possible sentence of \u201c17 years in prison\u201d. She also had been informed that since she was twenty-one years old she \u201ccould get the Youth Corrections Act\u201d which meant to her that she could get \u201c[s]ix months to six years.\u201d She was then asked \u201cisn\u2019t it a fact that you know, Mrs. Johnson, that you can get out on the street earlier if you are sentenced under the Youth Corrections Act?\u201d She responded \u201cIf I were to get out today, I wouldn\u2019t go out on the street, sir.\u201d The District Court thereupon curtailed further questioning concerning Mrs. Johnson\u2019s hope to receive Youth Corrections Act treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">From what has been said it is apparent that the appellants were able to put before the jury all the relevant facts tending to show that in talking to the police the Johnsons were motivated by the hope of reward. Further questioning of Mrs. Johnson could not have strengthened the inference of-bias thus created \u2014 an inference that counsel for the appellants forcefully drew in their closing arguments to the jury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>short, the appellants had every reasonable opportunity to prove bias - and the trial judge then had the discretion to control the extent of the proof. Blair v. United States, 130 U.S.App.D.C. 322, 324-325, 401 F.2d 387, 389-390 (1968); Austin v. United States, 135 U.S.App.D.C. 240, 243, 418 F.2d 456, 459 (1969); Tinker v. United States, 135 U.S.App.D. C. 125, 127, 417 F.2d 542, 544, cert. denied, 396 U.S. 864, 90 S.Ct. 141, 24 L.Ed.2d 118 (1969). The trial judge did not abuse that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">The appellants argue that \u201ctestimony as to the religious motivation of the witness Mrs. Johnson was improper and prejudicial\u201d. Specifically the appellants refer to (a) Mrs. Johnson\u2019s testimony that her conscience impelled her to talk to the police after she went to confession and told a priest that she had been involved in a murder; (b) the prosecutor\u2019s reference to this proof in his opening statement to the jury; (c) the \u201cfailure to disclose the evidence regarding Mrs. Johnson\u2019s renewed Catholic fervor ... to defense counsel prior to the jury <em>voir dire </em>so that appropriate challenges to the array or to the veniremen could have been made\u201d; and (d) the \u201cfailure of the Government to produce the priest who received the confession.\u201d The appellants say the matter of Mrs. Johnson\u2019s religious motivation \u201cwas sprung upon the defense in the Government\u2019s opening statement.\u201d Again we turn to the record to bring the appellants\u2019 contentions into focus.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">On the <em>voir dire </em>of the prospective jurors the prosecutor identified as a possible witness \u201cFather Raymond Maloney, who is sometimes known as Father Ray, a Catholic priest. . . .\u201d Before-he made his opening statement the prosecutor informed the court and counsel that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-11\">During the course of Mrs. Johnson\u2019s testimony, she is going to testify that she went to see a priest on Christmas Eve to a confessional; and this is when this thing first came out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-12\">Now, I have put Father Malonson, [sic] the priest that she went to, on the capital list, [sic] However, I\u2019ve talked with him and he feels very strongly that notwithstanding the fact that she is willing to waive her privilege, he feels that it would be a violation of his religious beliefs to testify under any circumstances regardless of the legal issue whether he could or could not testify. * * *X* -X- -X* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-14\">I will not bring a priest over his</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-15\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-16\">. . . conscientious beliefs, but I just bring that to the attention of the defense if they want to argue a missing witness. He is available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-18\">In response to this disclosure by the prosecutor counsel for the appellants stated \u201cFor the record, we will not ask for missing witness instruction on this priest.\u201d Thereafter in his opening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>statement the prosecutor referred to Mrs. Johnson\u2019s confession to the priest. No objection was made to this reference, nor was any motion made to strike that portion of the opening statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">On direct examination Mrs. Johnson testified without objection that she was a Catholic. The District Court however refused to allow her to testify that her confession to the priest prompted her to go to the police. The court ruled that the prosecutor might introduce this evidence on redirect, if the defendants sought to impeach Mrs. Johnson\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">After the defendants had attacked Mrs. Johnson\u2019s credibility by suggesting that an expectation of leniency inspired her statement to the police the court permitted her to testify on redirect examination that her decision to talk was influenced by what happened at her confessional.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">On this record the appellants claim that in some way the prosecutor violated their rights as established by Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). We cannot agree. In the <em>Brady </em>case the Supreme Court held \u201cthat the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d 373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. at 1196. As the Court explained in Moore v. Illinois, 408 U.S. 786, 794, 92 S.Ct. 2562, 33 L.Ed.2d 706 (1972) the \u201cheart of the holding in <em>Brady </em>is the prosecution\u2019s suppression of evidence, in the face of a defense production request\u201d. Assuming that the evidence here fell within the scope of the <em>Brady </em>rule, there was no suppression; on the contrary the defendants were told before trial, by way of the capital list, that a Catholic priest might be a witness, and this statement was repeated on the <em>voir dire </em>of the prospective jurors. Before the opening statement was made the appellants knew what Mrs. Johnson\u2019s testimony about her confessional would be. There is no showing that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was in any way unfair. Moreover, there is no showing, but only speculation, that the defense might have benefited if \u201cevidence regarding Mrs. Johnson\u2019s renewed Catholic fervor\u201d had been disclosed prior to the <em>voir dire </em>of the prospective jurors. Certainly we cannot say that earlier disclosure of this item of evidence would have been of critical or even substantial value to the defense. <em>See </em>Xydas v. United States, 144 U.S. App.D.C. 184, 191, 445 F.2d 660, 667, cert. denied, 404 U.S. 826, 92 S.Ct. 57, 30 L.Ed.2d 54 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">The complaint that the government failed to produce Father Maloney as a witness is likewise without merit. His testimony would have been hearsay and in any event the appellants acquiesced in the prosecutor\u2019s decision not to call him. If the appellants had wanted him, he was available to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">The appellants say the evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict on the count charging felony-murder. In evaluating this claim we \u201cmust assume the truth of the Government\u2019s evidence and give the Government the benefit of all legitimate inferences to be drawn therefrom,\u201d Curley v. United States, 81 U.S.App.D.C. 389, 392, 160 F.2d 229, 232, cert. denied, 331 U.S. 837, 67 S.Ct. 1511, 91 L.Ed. 1850 (1947), and must view that evidence and inferential proof \u201cin the light most favorable to the government\u2019s position.\u201d Crawford v. United States, 126 U.S.App.D.C. 156, 158, 375 F.2d 332, 334 (1967). \u201cMoreover, when applying this standard, no legal distinction is made between circumstantial evidence and direct evidence.\u201d United States v. Fench, 152 U.S.App.D.C. 325, 333, 470 F.2d 1234, 1242 (1972), cert. denied sub nom., 410 U.S. 909, 93 S.Ct. 964, 35 L.Ed.2d 271 (1973). \u201cIt is only when there is no evidence upon which a reasonable mind might fairly conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt that the judge may properly take the case from the jury.\u201d United States v. Lumpkin, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>145 U.S.App.D.C. 162, 168, 448 F.2d 1085, 1091 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Mrs. Johnson testified that she first noticed Mrs. Porter\u2019s rings when both appellants returned to the car after pushing Mrs. Porter into the Anacostia River, that Mrs. Gibson showed her the rings and said, \u201cMy husband never gave me anything this good,\u201d adding that she \u201cwas going to keep them\u201d. George Johnson also testified that Mrs. Gibson displayed the rings in the car, and said she \u201cgot them from the elderly lady\u201d and \u201c [s]he was going to keep them\u201d. As we have seen, when Mrs. Gibson was arrested she was wearing the rings.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">From this evidence the jury could reasonably have concluded that the appellant Gibson took the rings from Mrs. Porter just before she and Mrs. Maekin pushed Mrs. Porter into the river, and that Mrs. Maekin, as an aider and abettor, was also guilty of murder in the perpetration of robbery. Mrs. Maekin was culpable, even though she did not share in the proceeds of the robbery. As the district judge rightly observed in denying a motion for judgment of acquittal \u201c [I] f the jury feels there was aiding and abetting, that is enough to hold Mrs. Maekin on the robbery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">As their final argument the appellants claim that the District Court committed \u201cplain error\u201d in denying the jury\u2019s request to have certain testimony read to it. The request, set out in a note received from the jury during its deliberations, was this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\">We cannot reach unanimous agreement on Robbery charge; however, it is the opinion of a few they would like Tony Johnson\u2019s testimoney [sic] after Mrs. Porter was thrown into the river with reference to the rings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">(We would like to know when the rings were discovered by the testimo-ney.) [sic]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">Informed of the jury\u2019s request, counsel for the appellant Gibson stated: \u201cI would strongly object to any rereading of the testimony. I would ask for the instruction that it is their recollection that .counts.\u201d Counsel for Mrs. Maekin voiced no disagreement with this position. Accordingly, the court told the jury \u201cYou will have to trust to your recollection as to what Tony Johnson said. I am sure that if you think back over her testimony, you will be able to resolve that particular problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">Whether to grant the jury\u2019s request was a matter within the sound discretion of the District Court. Salzman v. United States, 131 U.S.App.D.C. 393, 405 F.2d 358 (1968). Taking precisely the action urged upon it by counsel for the appellants, the court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">The appellants had a fair trial, and the judgments must be and they are Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-13\">On Appellants\u2019 Motion For Rehearing</p>\n<p id=\"b506-14\">ORDER</p>\n<author id=\"AS_\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b506-15\">On consideration of appellants\u2019 motion for rehearing, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b506-16\">Ordered by the Court that appellants\u2019 aforesaid motion is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b502-5\">. Counsel for the appellant also suggests that George Johnson\u2019s in-eourt identification was tainted by an in-court lineup in which \u201cMrs. Mackin was the only gray-haired white woman present.\u201d Before George Johnson began his testimony at the hearing on the motion to suppress the court offered to conduct a lineup in the courtroom, and to allow Mrs. Mackin\u2019s counsel to choose the participants. After some sparring the appellant\u2019s counsel rejected the offer. The appellant was then removed from the courtroom while George Johnson testified on the motion. When the court ruled that there was an independent source for Johnson\u2019s identification counsel reconsidered and asked for a lineup. Rejecting this belated request for a formal lineup the court directed that counsel might \u201cplace Mrs. Mackin any place you wish to in the court\u201d and Mrs. Mackin took off her glasses and sat in the spectator gallery beside two white women of approximately the same age. Johnson was then brought into the courtroom. and according to the transcript the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-13\">THE COURT: Mr. Johnson, will you stand and walk around the courtroom and see if you recognize anybody that you saw on the night of this occasion concerning which you have given testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-14\">(The witness Johnson slowly walked first to the left-hand side spectator gallery and then to the right-hand side spectator gallery.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-15\">WITNESS JOHNSON: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-16\">THE COURT: All right, will you point to that person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-17\">(Witness Johnson pointed to Defendant Mackin seated in the spectator gallery.) Although photographs indicate that the women sitting beside Mrs. Mackin did not have gray hair this circumstance did not undercut the court\u2019s previous finding of an independent source for the identification testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b503-12\">. In Ms argument counsel for Mrs. Mackin said: As you will recall, the drug addicts have pending charges against them. These people <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>have had charges of armed robbery, drug charges. You heard the government say they had armed robbery charges and this has been reduced so Mrs. Johnson can plead guilty to a robbery. You heard Mrs. Johnson who was charged with the Harrison Narcotic Act and plead guilty to a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">These' parties have a self-serving interest. Counsel for Mrs. Gibson argued that the furnishing of information by the Johnsons was part of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">a devious, intentional plan, a methodical conception that I do something to cooperate, I will get some consideration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-8\">Continuing, he said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-19\">Do you really believe that all of the things you heard about what happened to the cases in which Mr. and Mrs. Johnson were charged had nothing to do with their testimony today? * \u00ed\u00a1! * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-21\">What does she get to plead guilty? Petty larceny; petty larceny.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-22\">They are also at gunpoint, armed robbery, life you can get for armed robbery. What did she plead guilty to? Robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-23\">Don\u2019t think for a moment, for one scintilla of a moment that Mrs. Johnson and Mr. Johnson aren\u2019t aware. Don\u2019t think they are not aware that they were going to get something out of it, and indeed they have.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b506-17\">.
