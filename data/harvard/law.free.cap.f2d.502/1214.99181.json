Our examination of these transcripts indicates that their probative value at trial was minimal. We agree with Judge Weinfeld\u2019s memorandum opinion filed May 10, 1972, denying appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial, to the effect that the transcripts contained \u201cno matter inconsistent with- the substance of [the agent\u2019s] testimony.\u201d Even if the transcripts did contain statements bearing upon the appellant\u2019s state of mind, as appellant contends, the exclusion of this evidence was certainly no abuse of Judge Weinfeld\u2019s discretion. The transcript does not purport to be complete; appellant had failed in the ample time afforded to him by Judge Weinfeld to make the tapes themselves available to the Government; the appellant offered the transcripts only after both sides had rested. Accordingly, Judge Weinfeld\u2019s exclusionary ruling was clearly within his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-19\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
