BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1102-11\">Bettye Twitty appeals from the judgment entered on a directed verdict granted by the District Court Judge in favor of Insurer, State Farm Life Insur-anee Company, in her suit to collect the benefits of a policy on the life of Assured, her husband James E. Twitty. At the close of her evidence, the trial judge ruled that there was insufficient evidence that the lapsed policy had been reinstated to permit the case to go to the jury. We affirm this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-14\">Bettye Twitty was the business manager of the trucking company owned by her and her husband. More educated than her husband, she had been responsible for maintaining their personal and business insurance for a number of years. On May 27, 1970 she applied for a $100,000.00 insurance policy #2088313 on her husband\u2019s life from W. F. Cock-rell, agent for Insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-15\">The premiums were paid until early 1971 when the policy lapsed for the first time. In May of that year she asked agent Cockrell to reinstate the policy, paid the full delinquent premium, $625.-00, and signed the Insurer\u2019s reinstatement application form that included questions relating to Assured\u2019s health. These materials were forwarded by Agent Cockrell to Insurer and the policy was reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-16\">Business in the Twitty trucking operation was seasonal and the policy lapsed again on January 17, 1972. Five months later when Mrs. Twitty went to see Cockrell to make other insurance payments, she spoke to him concerning the life insurance. The conversation as recounted by Agent Cockrell in his deposition (readopted in his trial testimony) is the heart of the case. He said: \u201c \u2018Mrs. Twitty, while you\u2019re here, we need to get this life insurance back in force.\u2019 And she said, \u2018Okay,\u2019 she said, \u2018How much money do you need?\u2019 And I said, \u201cTwo hundred dollars ($200.00),\u2019 and she wrote me a check for two hundred dollars.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>During this \u201csecond reinstatement\u201d Bettye Twitty signed only the $200.00 check and a blank application,' one similar in physical appearance, color and content to the application for reinstatement she had signed before in May<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 1970. But, instead of a form described as a Reinstatement Application, this was described on its face as a Life Application. Cockrell again, however, appears to have completed by hand himself the part of the application pertaining to the health of the insured. Cockrell contends that at this time she was given a binding receipt and forms to be completed by the family physician, the sort that usually accompany the issuance of a new policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">James E. Twitty died two weeks later on June 29, 1972. The following morning Cockrell sent the application and check to the company. The binding receipt on the second life insurance policy did not authorize recovery for the type of occurrence that caused Twitty\u2019s death.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The parties are now before this Court disputing whether me \u201csecond reinstatement\u201d transaction reactivated the $100,000.00 life insurance policy # 2088313.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-16\">\u201cIn view of the fact that she paid only $200.00, $1,400.00 less than needed under the reinstatement clause of the policy,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the question is whether the Agent had the power to waive or alter that premium in the face of the policy provision that forebade anyone other than special officials of the insurer to change, make or waive any rights of the company.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition to these waiver limitations in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>the contract, plaintiff must surmount the statutory limitation in the Texas Insurance Code \u00a7 21.04, V.A.T.S. denying to soliciting life insurance agents the authority to waive policy conditions. These statutory and contractual limitations on the powers of the agent were clearly the substance of Insurer\u2019s case. In order to reverse the judgment, we must find that agent Cockrell had the authority, despite these provisions, to waive the rights of the company to the full back premium\u2014 whether he intended to do so or not\u2014 and to revive the original insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">Appellant argues that Cockrell had this legal capability because he was a local recording agent rather than an insurance solicitor. This difference is important in Texas insurance law because it distinguishes agents with more plenary powers to write, execute and bind the companies to a risk \u2014 -local recording agents \u2014 from agents who are only empowered to forward proposed risks to the company for acceptance \u2014 soliciting agents.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These broad statutory powers of the recording agent have led the Texas courts to impute to such agents the additional power to waive policy terms despite express policy provisions denying such apparent authority.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellant builds her case directly on these Texas decisions,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and without a doubt, were those cases applicable, they would compel a reversal of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-11\">But the trouble with her reliance on these cases is that by their reasoning, they are confined under the Texas Insurance Code only to casualty and fire insurance underwriting and not to the life insurance business.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Texas Insurance Code clearly demarks the scope of authorized activities of the individual insurance specialties permitted by the state legislature. Texas law distinguishes carefully between life insurance and casualty and fire underwriters. It has an elaborate system for the licensing of those people engaged in each of the two activities but these licensing provisions are separate. Under that for fire and casualty \u2014 and these may be written by companies that may be affiliated with life insurance companies but remain separate underwriters \u2014 the two previously noted classes of agents exist for casualty underwriting.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>the life insurance business is expressly excluded from this provision.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The provisions of the Texas Insurance Code relating to life insurance agents make no such distinctions in the scope of the individual agent\u2019s powers.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A class of soliciters is the only one mentioned and, in addition, their authority to waive policy provisions<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> is circumscribed by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>This difference in statutory treatment appears to reflect a real-life distinction in the operations of the casualty and life insurance industries in Texas. Thus, a general life insurance agent does indeed act in a more restricted capacity than a local recording agent underwriting casualty insurance, although they both apparently have the power to initially bind the company to insurance risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\"> In the absence of such broad recording agent powers, it remains to appellant to prove that Agent Cockrell had the apparent or implied agency authority to waive the full-premium reinstatement requirement. Alternatively, she could show some direct action by the Insurer itself indicating such a waiver. But looking at the total circumstances of the periodic ins\u00faranee transactions between appellant, Agent and Insurer, we find nothing to indicate that Agent had any such waiver authority.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Nor do we discern that the company itself directly waived the requirement. In the first reinstatement, Agent required appellant to pay the full arrearage due under policy # 2088313. The proper form was completed and the Insurer responded subsequently in accordance with contract provisions. The transaction at issue here was different \u2014 a far less substantial sum than the total arrearage was paid and a different form used.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-5\">It may well be that Mrs. Twitty reasonably relied on the statements of the agent that he \u201ccould get this policy back in force for her for $200.00,\u201d but we find no basis for her theory of promissory estoppel as against the Insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1102-12\">. This sum was substantially less than the approximately $1,601.56 back premium owed on the policy. This sum, not supplied by either counsel, was computed by multiplying the monthly premium $312.50 by the five months between the lapse date, January 17, and the date of her attempted reinstatement, June 15, plus a pro rata portion of the interest (6% per annum) as represented by the lapse. We have computed this sum to illustrate the substantial difference in the amount actually paid by Mrs. Twitty and the amount actually owed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">. The questions concerning the health of the insured contained in both forms are almost identically worded, comprising questions 2-e to 7 (Reinstatement Application) and 8(a-j)-10 (Life Application).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1103-7\">.

Reinstatement is subject to (1) the payment of all overdue premiums with compound interest at the rate of six per cent per annum on such overdue premiums; (2) the payment or re-establishment of any indebtedness existing at the date of lapse together with compound interest at the rate of six per cent per annum on such indebtedness; and (3) receipt of evidence of insurability of the Insured satisfactory to the company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1103-11\">.

No material circumstance or information has been withheld or omitted concerning the past and present state of health, habits of life and occupation of the Proposed Insured or any other person insured under this policy. On behalf of the Proposed Insured, the Applicant, if other than the Proposed Insured, and any person who shall have any interest in a policy which may be reinstated pursuant hereto, it is agreed: (1) That this reinstatement application, any action hereon, or any lapse of time, shall not be considered to effect a reinstatement by waiver or estoppel, and that the company shall not be deemed to have approved reinstatement unless an official company Notice of Reinstatement is issued; and (2) that no one except the president, a vice-president, the secretary, or an assistant secretary has the power on behalf of the company to make, modify, or discharge contracts or to waive any of the company\u2019s rights or requirements (and in writing only), and these powers will not be delegated.

This issue \u2014 whether Texas life insurance agents have recording agent characteristics and powers \u2014 was not closely argued in the original briefs or on oral argument. Not wanting to trust solely to our own research on an unargued point, we requested supplemental briefs from counsel on the issue. While appellant was not able to cite statutory waiver powers for life agents, she suggested several Texas cases as support for her argument. We disagree. Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Flowers, 91 S.W.2d 847 (Tex.Civ.App. El Paso, 1936, writ dism\u2019d) and Adams v. LaSalle Life Ins. Co., 99 S.W.2d 386 (Tex.Civ.App. Waco, 1936, no writ) both involve the imputation of a life agent\u2019s knowledge to the Insurer, not a waiver. Similarly inapplicable is Security Ben. Ass\u2019n v. Woods, 45 S.W.2d 409 (Tex. Civ.App. El Paso, 1932, no writ). There the Court found waiver from actions of the Insurer itself, not the Agent alone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1104-13\">.
