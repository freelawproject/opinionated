Plaintiff, Wine Hobby USA, Inc. (Wine Hobby), a Pennsylvania corporation, brought suit to obtain the names and addresses of all persons who have registered with the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to produce wine for family use in the Mid-Atlantic region.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court ordered that the names and addresses be disclosed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Government appeals, contending</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">(1) that the material sought is exempt from compulsory disclosure under Exemption (6) to the Act, \u00a7 552(b) (6), which excludes from the Act\u2019s coverage \u201cpersonnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,\u201d and</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">(2) alternatively, that the district court possesses equitable jurisdiction to decline to order disclosure in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-16\">Under the Internal Revenue Code and the Federal Alcohol Administration Act, persons who produce wine are subject to certain permit, bonding, and tax requirements.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Criminal penalties are provided for noncompliance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> An exception to these requirements is provided by statute in the case of a \u201cduly registered head of any family\u201d who produces \u201cfor family use and not for sale an amount of wine not exceeding 200 gallons per annum.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-17\">Pursuant to regulations,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> registration under the statutory exception is effected by filing Form 1541 with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Upon determination that the person is qualified, Form 1541 is stamped, one copy is returned to the registrant and the remaining copy is placed in the Bureau\u2019s files. Records of the Bureau indicate that in fiscal year 1973, 64,756 Forms 1541 were filed, including 2,846 in the Mid-Atlantic region. In fiscal year 1974, as of February 1974, 41,585 Forms 1541 were on file, including 4,000 in the Mid-Atlantic region.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-18\">Wine Hobby is engaged in the business. of selling and distributing amateur winemaking equipment and supplies to amateur winemakers through franchises, wholly owned retail stores, and by mail order. Wine Hobby has stipulated in the district court that its purpose in obtaining the names and addresses of the Form 1541 registrants is \u201cto enable plaintiff to forward catalogues and other announcements to these persons regarding equipment and supplies that the plaintiff offers for sale.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>We begin with the recognition that the Freedom of Information Act, enacted to remedy the inadequacies of its predecessor, section 3 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002 (1964):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-4\">is broadly conceived. It seeks to permit access to official information long shielded unnecessarily from public view and attempts to create a judicially enforceable public right to secure such information from possibly unwilling official hands.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Environmental Protection Agency v. Mink, 410 U.S. 73, 80, 93 S.Ct. 827, 35 L.Ed.2d 119 (1973). The Act was intended to provide \u201cthe necessary machinery to assure the availability of Government information necessary to an informed electorate.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> An integral part of the Act, however, is the nine enumerated exceptions. As the Senate Committee pointed out in its report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">At the same time that a broad philosophy of \u201cfreedom of information\u201d is enacted into law, it is necessary to protect certain equally important rights of privacy with respect to certain information in Government files, such as medical and personnel records. It is also necessary for the very operation of our Government to allow it to keep confidential certain material, such as the investigatory files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Senate Report No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1965) (hereinafter \"S.Rep.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">The Government relies on Exemption (6) as the basis for refusing to supply the information requested by Wine Hobby. The district court reluctantly concluded that despite the potential for abuse, the names and addresses sought here were not subject to this exemption as an invasion of privacy. The court also held that it had no power to exercise its equitable discretion to withhold and no alternative but to grant the request. We hold that the names and addresses sought are within the exemption and we therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-13\">To qualify under Exemption (6), the requested information must consist of \u201cpersonnel, medical or similar files,\u201d and the disclosure of the material must constitute a \u201cclearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-14\">We believe that the list of names and addresses is a \u201cfile\u201d within the meaning of Exemption (6). A broad interpretation of the statutory term to include names and addresses is necessary to avoid a denial of statutory protection in a case where release of requested materials would result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Since the thrust of the exemption is to avoid unwarranted invasions of privacy, the term \u201cfiles\u201d should not be given an interpretation that would often preclude inquiry into this more crucial question.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-15\">Furthermore, we believe the list of names and addresses is a file \u201csimilar\u201d to the personnel and medical files specifically referred to in the exemption. The common denominator in \u201cpersonnel and medical and similar files\u201d is the personal quality of information in the file, the disclosure of which may constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. We do not believe that the use of the term \u201csimilar\u201d was intended to narrow the exemption from disclosure and permit the release of files which would otherwise be exempt because of the resultant invasion of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-16\">We now turn to the Government\u2019s contention that disclosure of the names and addresses to Wine Hobby would result in a \u201cclearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d Because of an apparent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>conflict in the circuits,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we must first consider whether the statutory language, which clearly demands an examination of the invasion of privacy, also requires inquiry into the interest in disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Our examination of the statute and its legislative history leads us .to conclude, in the language of the District of Columbia Circuit, that \u201cExemption (6) necessarily requires the court to balance a public interest purpose for disclosure of personal information against the potential invasion of individual privacy.\u201d Getman v. N.L.R.B., 450 F.2d at 677 n. 24 (1971).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On its face, the statute, by the use of term \u201cunwarranted,\u201d compels a balancing of interests. The interpretation, moreover, is supported by the legislative history.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">We disagree with the view of the Fourth Circuit that the language of \u00a7 552(a)(3) precludes a balancing of interests to determine the application of Exemption (6).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> That paragraph which amended a provision of section 3 of the Administrative Procedure Act which required that the plaintiff be \u201cproperly and directly concerned,\u201d authorizes release of information to \u201cany person.\u201d The Fourth Circuit apparently construed the amendment to prevent an inquiry into the purpose asserted by an individual plaintiff. Significantly, however, the paragraph applies only to matters not within any of the exemptions enumerated in \u00a7 552(b). Thus it is only <em>non-exempt </em>material that must be made available to \u201cany person.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We see nothing in \u00a7 552(a)(3) therefore that precludes balancing to determine whether particular information is within a statutory <em>exemption.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-13\">To apply the balancing test to the facts of this case we must determine whether release of the names and addresses would constitute an invasion of personal privacy and, if so, balance the seriousness of that invasion with the purpose asserted for release. Getman v. N.L.R.B., <em>supra. </em>Turning to the first consideration, we conclude that disclosure would involve an invasion of privacy. As the Government points out in its brief, there are few things which per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>tain to an individual in which his privacy has traditionally been more respected than his own home. Mr. Chief Justice Burger recently stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-4\">The ancient concept that \u201ca man\u2019s home is his castle\u201d into which \u201cnot even the king may enter\u201d has lost none of its vitality. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Rowan v. United States Post Office Dept., 397 U.S. 728, 737, 90 S.Ct. 1484, 1491, 25 L.Ed.2d 736 (1970). Disclosure of the requested lists would involve a release of each registrant\u2019s home address, information that the individual may fervently wish to remain confidential or only selectively released.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> One consequence of this disclosure is that a registrant will be subjected to unsolicited and possibly unwanted mail from Wine Hobby and perhaps offensive mail from others.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Moreover, information concerning personal activities within the home, namely wine-making, is revealed by disclosure. Similarly, disclosure reveals information concerning the family status of the registrant, including the fact that he is not living alone and that he exercises family control or responsibility in the household. Disclosure of these facts concerning the home and private activities within it constitutes an \u201cinvasion of personal privacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">We must now balance the seriousness of this invasion of privacy against the</p>\n<p id=\"b201-11\">public interest purpose asserted by the plaintiff. As noted, the sole purpose for which Wine Hobby has stipulated that it seeks the information is for private commercial exploitation. Wine Hobby advanced no direct or indirect public interest purpose in disclosure of these lists and indeed, we can conceive of none.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The disclosure of names of potential customers for commercial business is wholly unrelated to the purposes behind the Freedom of Information Act and was never contemplated by Congress in enacting the Act. In light of this failure by Wine Hobby to assert a public interest purpose for disclosure, we conclude that the invasion of privacy caused by disclosure would be \u201cclearly unwarranted,\u201d even though the invasion of privacy in this case is not as serious as that considered by the court in other cases, <em>see, e. g., </em>Rose v. Dept. of the Air Force, 495 F.2d 261 (2d Cir. 1974).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> On balance, therefore, we believe that the list of names and addresses of the Form 1541 registrants is exempted from disclosure under \u00a7 552(b)(6) in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-12\">Because we believe that the information requested by Wine Hobby is exempted from disclosure under a specific statutory exemption, we need not reach the question of whether, were the mate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>rial not specifically exempted, the district court possesses equitable jurisdiction to decline to order disclosure.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The judgment of the district court will be reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b198-11\">.
