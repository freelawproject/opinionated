Within the Social Security Administration the Bureau of Health Insurance has the primary responsibility for administering the Act. The statutory scheme \u201cprovides basic protection against- the costs of hospital and related post-hospital services . .\u2019 . for individuals who are age 65 or over\u201d and are entitled to benefits under the Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395c. Beneficiaries are entitled to receive services covered by the Act from hospitals, extended care facilities or home health agencies which are qualified to participate in the program. These institutions are called \u201cproviders of services\u201d or providers. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(u); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395cc. They are entitled to be reinburs-ed for the reasonable cost of the services they provide to beneficiaries. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395f. Under the Act providers may elect to have payments to them made through a private organization and the Secretary is authorized to make contractual arrangements with such an organization to act as the fiscal intermediary between the providers and the government. When this is done, the intermediary determines the amount and reasonableness of the payments to be made to providers. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395h.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-19\">The appellant association, plaintiff in the District Court, is an association of physical therapists who are licensed to practice physical therapy in the State of New Jersey. Many of the association\u2019s members are private practitioners of physical therapy who have contracted to supply services to providers under the Act. Prudential Insurance Company, a defendant in the District Court, was selected by many of the qualified extended care facilities in New Jersey to serve as their fiscal intermediary, and Prudential has been acting in that capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>In August 1969 the Bureau of Health Insurance issued Intermediary Letter No. 393 (IL-393). This letter, captioned \u201cSUBJECT: Identifying unreasonable costs \u2014 application of the \u2018prudent buyer\u2019 concept\u201d stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-4\">Several cases have come to our attention that suggest that it may be helpful to provide some reminders on a number of areas that involve identifying reasonable costs. This letter outlines some of the steps which intermediaries should be taking to protect the program against making reimbursement for amounts which are in excess of what a prudent and cost-conscious buyer would pay for a given item or service. * * * fl- * fl-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">it is not expected, for example, that reimbursement will be based on costs arising from a provider paying at individual rates for physical therapy which is provided by a single therapist to groups of patients simultaneously.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">In October 1971 the Bureau sent to all intermediaries a draft of a proposed intermediary letter (IL-71). This letter stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">This letter establishes guidelines for intermediaries to follow in determining the reasonableness of the costs a provider incurs in furnishing physical, occupational, inhalation or speech therapy to program beneficiaries under arrangements with self-employed therapists. The basic measure of reasonable cost for the service of non-employee therapists is the amount of salary or wages that is paid to employee therapists in the area performing similar functions and is intended to protect the program against reimbursing for costs in excess of what a prudent and cost-conscious buyer would pay for the services. This amount is adjusted to take into account the normal fringe benefits of full-time employees of the provider, as well as reasonable expenses incurred by a part-time nonemployee therapist. Where applicable, these rules apply to other health specialists providing services under arrangements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-10\">I. <em>Prudent Buyer Concept</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay1\">Providers are expected to be prudent and cost-conscious purchasers of arranged-for therapy services. In applying this concept, the following situations are presumptively indicative of unreasonable costs: (1) costs incurred for the services of an independent contractor are in excess of what would have been the provider\u2019s costs of furnishing the same services had it employed a therapist</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">A copy of the proposed IL-71 was sent to the American Physical Therapy Association on. October 27, 1971 with a request that the association submit its written comments or recommendations no later than November 15, 1971. Proposed Intermediary Letter No. 71 has never been made final.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-12\">On November 23, 1971 Prudential sent to \u201cMEDICARE PARTICIPATING EXTENDED CARE FACILITIES\u201d a letter on the subject of \u201cREIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES OF NON-SALARIED THERAPISTS.\u201d The letter stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-13\">Public Law 89-97 provides that reimbursement to providers for covered services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries shall be on the basis of reasonable cost. In fulfilling our responsibility as an intermediary, we must identify unreasonable costs and take steps to protect the program from reimbursing for costs in excess of those which a prudent and cost-conscious buyer would incur.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-14\">The implementation of this policy for physical, speech, occupational, and inhalation therapy services rendered by non-salaried therapists in an institutional setting involves two major considerations. They are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-15\">1. Payment for the cost of these services shall not exceed an amount equal to the salary which would have been payable if the services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>had been performed by an employee, plus the cost of such other reasonable expenses as may be incurred by independently contracting therapists (e. g., travel time, salaries of aides).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-4\">2. Payment for the cost of these services will be based upon the reasonable time spent in performing them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">In order that this policy can be effectively carried out, it will be necessary that accurate records of the therapists\u2019 activities be maintained and made available to the intermediary. Accordingly, effective January 1, 1972, the provider will be responsible for the maintenance of a daily log showing the names of all patients treated and the total daily time spent by the therapist including time spent in the supervision of aides and/or non-qualified therapists). In the absence of a properly maintained log, no Medicare reimbursement for these therapy services will be allowed. *\u2022\u00bb\u2022\u00bb***</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Because allowable reimbursement for the services of, therapists is to be based on a salary equivalent, we should know the details of your arrangements with contracting therapists. <em>Our measurement </em>of the reasonableness of the cost of these services will be based on hourly rates of pay for both the therapists and their, aides, if any. .</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">In order to avoid the possibility of having a portion of your therapy costs disallowed as excessive, we strongly recommend that you negotiate arrangements with your non-salaried therapists to provide for their compensation on a time basis and that the results of such negotiations be submitted to us for review well in advance of the effective date of January 1, 1972. [emphasis in original.]</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">In a letter to providers dated April 12, 1972 Prudential clarified the intent of its letter of November 23. The letter of April 12,1972 stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-12\">As you know, Intermediary Letter 393 issued on August 1969 [sic], and Provider Reimbursement Manual section 2103, set out the concept of the prudent buyer; that is, a provider is a prudent buyer if it not only refuses to pay more than the going price for an item or service, but also seeks to economize by minimizing costs. The purpose of these program statements is to assist all parties in identifying reasonable costs and to help prevent incurring unreasonable costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-13\">It should be noted that our previous letter indicated the establishment of guideline criteria for evaluating the reasonableness of the cost of therapy services and was not intended as a maximum for payment. Providers incurring costs in excess of our guidelines will be given an opportunity to show that they were acting as prudent buyers when incurring the cost. However, the burden of proof of the reasonableness of the costs does lie with the provider.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-14\">In March 1972 the plaintiff association commenced this action against Prudential, the Secretary of HEW, and various HEW officials. The action sought: (1) a preliminary injunction, enjoining the defendants from effectuating the standards and guidelines for reimbursement of non-salaried physical therapists as expressed in the Prudential letter and IL-71; (2) a declaratory judgment that the Prudential letter and IL-71 \u201care null and void\u201d; (3) that Prudential be required retroactively to adjust any reimbursements made pursuant to its salary equivalent standard so that physical therapists who were paid in accordance with that standard would be paid in accordance with the standard prevailing prior to January 1, 1972; and (4) that Prudential be required to retract its letter because of non-compliance with the rule-making procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Citing Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970), the District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the interests of the plaintiff were not \u201carguably within the zone of interests to be protected\u201d by the Health Insurance for the Aged Act. The court considered that although some of the plaintiff\u2019s members might be economically affected by the Prudential letter, the plaintiff\u2019s interest was \u201ctoo remote to the interests protected under the Act\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">On this appeal the government argues (1) plaintiff\u2019s complaint does not state a meritorious claim for relief; (2) the District Court correctly held that plaintiff did not have standing to sue; and (3) determination of the amounts payable to providers of services is not subject to judicial review. We turn first to the government\u2019s second and third arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The government says correctly that the Act was expressly designed for the protection of elderly citizens who require medical care, and those persons of course have standing to vindicate their rights under the Act. Furthermore, since the Act assures a provider of reimbursement for the reasonable costs incurred by him, a provider would seem to have an interest within the zone protected by the statute. Plaintiff\u2019s members on the other hand are not subject to regulation under the Act and their rights are derived from their contractual arrangements with providers. There is nothing in the Medicare Act or its legislative history, says the government, which indicates any concern by Congress to protect the interests of persons such as plaintiff\u2019s members who are only indirectly affected by the operation of the Medicare program. From all this the government concludes that the plaintiff and its members have no standing to sue.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">In support of its argument that the plaintiff\u2019s claims are not subject to judicial review, the government directs our attention to the provisions of the Medicare Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff, which provide for judicial review of (1) a determination of whether an individual is entitled to benefits and a determination of the amount of benefits,\u2019 and (2) a determination that an institution is not a provider of services or that its agreement to provide services should be terminated. The government finds it significant that no provision is made for judicial review of the award of compensation to providers of services; and the government reasons that since decisions on this matter are not subject to judicial review it follows <em>a fortiori </em>that decisions on the amounts due to contractors, who are indirectly affected by the Medicare program, are also not subject to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">There is much force in the government\u2019s arguments. As this court has said however recent decisions of the Supreme Court \u201chave made the standing obstacle to judicial review a shadow of its former self, and have for all practical purposes deprived it of meaningful vitality.\u201d National Automatic Laundry &amp; Cleaning Council v. Shultz, 143 U.S.App.D.C. 274, 278, 443 F.2d 689, 693 (1971). Standing need not be founded on a rock; a pebble or even a cobweb may do. Moreover, only a showing of clear and convincing evidence of legislative intent will justify a court in precluding access to judicial review. Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967); Barlow v. Collins, 397 U.S. 159, 90 S.Ct. 832, 25 L.Ed.2d 192 (1970). Here, we think plaintiff\u2019s standing and the reviewability of plaintiff\u2019s claims at least present close and difficult questions ; but we shall not pause to wrestle with these problems, since we conclude that in any event the defendants must prevail on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\"> The Act explicitly limits the reimbursement of \u201cproviders\u201d to the \u201creasonable cost\u201d of the services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries. 42 U. S.C. \u00a7 1395f(b). As a fiscal intermediary making reimbursement to providers, therefore, Prudential is bound to apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>the reasonable cost standard to claims submitted by providers. In fulfillment of its obligation, and in accord with HEW\u2019s \u201cprudent buyer\u201d concept, Prudential issued its letter of November 23, 1971. We think this letter was a reasonable and proper attempt to outline a rational method for determining \u201creasonable costs\u201d. We think also that Prudential\u2019s use of guidelines of this type is within the authority conferred by the Act and HEW\u2019s regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">Although the plaintiff contends that the Prudential letter sets a \u201cceiling\u201d on costs and thereby permits Prudential to disallow \u201creasonable costs\u201d, it is plain to us that Prudential will continue to allow all costs that are reasonable. Prudential\u2019s letter of April 12, 1972 explicitly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">Providers incurring costs in excess of our guidelines will be given an opportunity to show that they were acting as prudent buyers when incurring the cost. However, the burden of proof of the reasonableness of the costs does lie with the provider.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Thus, the effect of the guidelines is to provide for automatic payment of physical therapy costs when they do not exceed the adjusted rate charged by salaried therapists; for the provider incurring such costs has clearly acted as a \u201cprudent buyer\u201d. If the costs exceed these amounts, however, Prudential requires the provider to demonstrate that the additional costs are reasonable. In other words the guidelines establish a level of costs which Prudential will pay without additional proof of their reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">The plaintiff contends that Prudential promulgated a \u201cregulation\u201d without the notice and opportunity for comment required by the Administrative Procedure Act. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553. We think the argument has no merit. Without intimating that Prudential is an \u201cagency\u201d within the meaning of the Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(1), we hold that Prudential\u2019s letter was not a regulation but was merely an explanation or interpretation of the reasonable cost limitation found in the Medicare Act. <em>Cf. </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b) (A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-12\">The judgment is Affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b569-13\">BAZELON, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b569-14\">I concur in the court\u2019s opinion. I cannot agree, however, with the suggestion that the current law on standing and reviewability has gone too far or that the law, as applied in this case, presents \u201cclose and difficult questions.\u201d <em>See </em>Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970); Barlow v. Collins, 397 U.S. 159, 90 S.Ct. 832, 25 L.Ed.2d 192 (1969).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b569-7\">. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint was filed March 22, 1972. On October 30, 1972, by amendment to the Social Security Act, Congress provided that the salary equivalent standard should apply to payments for physical therapy services. P.L. No. 92-603, 86 Stat. 1445; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(v) (5). The plaintiff suggests that this action demonstrates that Prudential\u2019s guidelines were previously unauthorized by the Act.
