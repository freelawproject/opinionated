He declined to answer certain questions on the ground his answers might incriminate him. He was granted immunity pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6002 and 6003 and ordered to testify. He appeared before the grand jury, but again refused to answer certain questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-27\">The government moved that appellant be held in civil contempt pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826(a). Appellant offered the defense that he believed the questions were based upon unlawful electronic surveillance and his answers would be inadmissible under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2515, citing Gelbard v. United States, 408 U.S. 41, 92 S.Ct. 2357, 33 L.Ed.2d 179 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-28\">Appellant submitted two affidavits. The second and more detailed stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApXO\">I believe that the evidence which forms the basis of the questions pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>pounded to me by the grand jury, and the evidence which I would be required to give in answer to those questions, is inadmissible because it is the primary product of an unlawful act and/or was obtained by the exploitation of an unlawful act, namely illegal electronic surveillance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1322-4\">My belief as stated above is based upon an analysis of the questions put to me by the grand jury at my previous appearances on January 31 and April 18, 1974. My analysis of these questions shows that they are based either directly or indirectly on materials which could only have been obtained by illegal electronic surveillance of my conversations or of my premises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1322-5\">The affidavit then identified the telephone numbers, the premises,' and the periods of time appellant believed were involved in the alleged electronic surveillance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-6\">In response the government filed two affidavits, one of the attorney and the other of the investigating agent responsible for the grand jury investigations. Each affidavit stated, \u201cTo my knowledge, Mr. Vielguth has not been the subject of any illegal electronic surveillance nor were the questions asked him in the Grand Jury based on any illegal electronic surveillance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"aog-dedup-0\">The district court rejected appellant\u2019s defense on the ground that under this court\u2019s holding in United States v. Alter, 482 F.2d 1016 (1973), appellant\u2019s affidavits were not sufficient to constitute a \u201cclaim\u201d of unlawful electronic surveillance, and therefore the government was \u25a0 not required to \u201caffirm or deny the occurrence\u201d of such surveillance under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3504(a)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court did not reach the question of whether, if a sufficient \u201cclaim\u201d had been made, the affidavits submitted by the government would have satisfied its obligation to \u201caffirm or deny.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-16\">The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has concluded that the government\u2019s obligation to affirm or deny the occurrence of electronic surveillance under section 3504(a)(1) \u201cis triggered ... by the mere assertion that unlawful wiretapping has been used against a party.\u201d In re Evans, 146 U.S. App.D.C. 310, 452 F.2d 1239, 1247 (1971). The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has agreed. United States v. Tosca-nino, 500 F.2d 267 (1974).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This construction adopts the ordinary meaning of the language of the statute predicating the government\u2019s obligation to affirm or deny upon a simple \u201cclaim\u201d of inadmissibility. It is supported by the legislative history, which suggests that subsection (a)(1) was added to give to persons under interrogation the legal right to require on mere motion that which the Department of Justice informed Congress it had been affording voluntarily without demand \u2014 namely, an examination by the government of its files to determine whether any wiretaps or eavesdropping had occurred.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Final<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number>ly, as Judge Bazelon pointed out in In re Evans, <em>supra, </em>there are a number of compelling reasons why Congress would think it wise to require the prosecution to affirm or deny electronic surveillance on no more than a demand by persons who would be aggrieved by such surveillance if it had occurred.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1323-4\">However, the government argues, and the district court held, that this construction of section 3504(a)(1) is precluded by our decision in United States v. Alter, <em>supra. </em>The contention is a substantial one. Language in the <em>Alter </em>opinion suggests that the government is required to affirm or deny the existence of electronic surveillance only when the aggrieved person has made out a prima facie case that such surveillance has occurred, and that a mere claim of such surveillance is not enough. We conclude, however, that this holding in <em>Alter </em>applies only to a claim by the person under interrogation that questions put to him are tainted by unlawful surveillance of. conversations in which he did not participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-5\">Alter claimed unlawful surveillance both of his own conversations and of conversations between his attorney and third persons. The adequacy of Alter\u2019s \u201cclaim\u201d as to surveillance of his own conversations was not challenged \u2014 the government responded with a denial. The adequacy of Alter\u2019s \u201cclaim\u201d as to conversations, between his attorney and third persons <em>was </em>challenged. As to this \u201cclaim,\u201d the <em>Alter </em>court held that a mere assertion of unlawful surveillance of counsel was insufficient; and set out in some detail the prima facie showing required to compel a government response. 482 F.2d at 1026.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-7\">The <em>Alter </em>court noted that the government objected to Alter\u2019s standing with respect to statutory or Fourth Amendment grounds, but conceded Alter\u2019s standing to assert interference with Alter\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. 482 F.2d at 1026 n. 16. The government argued, however, that section 3504(a) applied only to Fourth Amendment rights, and that \u201cclaims upon Sixth Amendment grounds, not controlled by statute or by previous court decisions, are in the same posture as were Fourth Amendment claims prior to the change by case law and the statutory provisions. Thus, under <em>Nardone </em>[308 U.S. 338, 60 S.Ct. 266, 84 L.Ed. 307] the aggrieved person must have asserted specific facts which if established would have required suppression of the evidence in question. Cohen v. United States, 378 F.2d 751, 760 (C. A. 9), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 897 [88 S.Ct. 217, 19 L.Ed.2d 215].\u201d Brief for the Appellee, Alter v. United States, No. 73-1121, pp. 20-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-8\">While the <em>Alter </em>court did not adopt the government\u2019s suggestion that Sixth Amendment \u201cclaims\u201d were not governed by section 3504(a), it did accept the argument that a different and more exten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>sive showing must be made before the government can be required to search its files for possible electronic surveillance or eavesdropping of the attorney\u2019s conversations with third persons.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1324-4\">There are obvious reasons for such a distinction. The possibility that surveillance of conversations of the witness\u2019 attorney with third persons may impinge upon the witness\u2019 Sixth Amendment rights is of an entirely different order than the possibility that such surveillance of the witness\u2019 <em>own </em>conversations may have violated the witness\u2019 statutory and constitutional rights of privacy. The witness\u2019 Sixth Amendment rights can be implicated only if the attorney\u2019s conversations are relevant to his representation of the particular client in the matter at hand, in which case the witness has standing to require an affirmance or denial. The additional showing required by <em>Alter </em>is directed at establishing the possibility that electronic surveillance of an attorney\u2019s conversations with third persons might fall into this category.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These additional requirements may be justified not only because there is a much greater possibility that the claim of electronic surveillance of relevant third-party conversations will prove to be ill-founded, but also because disclosure of such third-party conversations would invade the privacy of additional persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-10\">One sentence in the <em>Alter </em>opinion suggests that the court may have intended to apply the same standard of particularity to a \u201cclaim\u201d of violation of the witness\u2019 right to privacy. Referring to Alter\u2019s affidavits regarding electronic surveillance of his own conversations, the court said, \u201cAlter\u2019s affidavits were sufficiently concrete and specific to make a prima facie showing that on the occasions described someone was interfering with his telephone calls and that the F.B.I. was involved.\u201d 482 F.2d at 1027. The court continued, \u201cThe burden was then on the Government squarely to affirm or to deny <em>those </em>charges. <em>(Cf. </em>United States v. Fannon (7th Cir. 1970) 435 F.2d 364.) The [Government] affidavit did neither\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-11\">As the context indicates, the issue under discussion was not the adequacy of Alter\u2019s \u201cclaim,\u201d but rather the sufficiency of the government\u2019s response. The holding was that when a \u201cclaim\u201d is made that particularizes incidents of alleged surveillance, it is incumbent upon the government to affirm or deny the specific charges made. In such circumstances, a general, conclusory denial will not do. The <em>Alter </em>court did not hold, however, that a more general \u201cclaim\u201d would not have been sufficient to require the government to file a response appropriate to such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>We therefore hold that appellant\u2019s affidavits were sufficient to require the government to affirm or deny the occurrence of the alleged surveillance. Since the district court did not reach the question of the adequacy of the government\u2019s response, that issue is not before us and we do not consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1322-8\">. 18 U.S.G. \u00a7 3504(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1322-9\">In any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in or before any . . . grand jury . . of the United States\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"a2g-dedup-0\">(1) upon a claim by a party aggrieved that evidence is inadmissible because it is the primary product of an unlawful act or because it was obtained by the exploitation of an unlawful act, the opponent of the claim shall affirm or deny the occurrence of the alleged unlawful act.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1322-13\">. United States v. Doe (Popkin), 460 F.2d 328, 335-336 (1st Cir. 1972), a <em>pre-Gelbard </em>decision, appears to take the government\u2019s view. However, appellant\u2019s counsel states, \u201cSubsequent to <em>Gelbard, </em>the First Circuit revised its earlier opinion in an unpublished order requiring the government to affirm or deny. No. 72-1090 (1st Cir., July 12, 1972).\u201d Appellant\u2019s Opening Brief at 14.

The Department advised the Senate Judiciary Committee that while it had been \u201cconduct [ing| such examinations as a matter of policy even in cases where no motion ha[d] been filed defendants should be assured such an examination by a specific requirement of law rather than hav[ingj to rely upon the continued viability of a current policy.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 553. The Senate report on \u00a7 3504 explained that \u201csince [subsection (a) (1) 1 requires a pending claim as a predicate to disclosure, it sets aside the present wasteful i&gt;raetice of the Department of Justice in searching files without a motion from a defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1323-10\">. Requiring the government to affirm or deny the existence of illegal surveillance of witnesses imposes only a minimal additional burden upon the government, but requiring a witness to establish the existence of such surveillance may impose a burden on the witness that he can rarely meet, since, to be effective, electronic surveillance must be concealed from its victim. Requiring more than a claim may encourage the development of more secretive means of illegal surveillance, rather than encourage elimination of such unlawful intrusions. Moreover, requiring a witness to disclose details regarding specific conversations that may have been subjected to surveillance would in itself be an invasion of privacy. <em>See </em>In re Evans, 146 U.S.App. D.C. 310, 452 F.2d 1239, 1247-1250 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1324-5\">.

Alter, 482 F.2d 1016 (9 Cir. 1973), rather than telling the district court that it didn\u2019t read Alter right. Further, the record shows that defendant says he must have been subjected to electronics surveillance because (his opinion) the grand jury questions \u201ccould not have been asked without wire tapping.\u201d I would guess that there are 10,000 cases of an informer for every one of electronic surveillance. I would not put the government to its proof on the basis of the legal opinion of Yielguth, which does not exclude the more probable source. Whatever Vielguth did, it has not been suggested that he lived alone in a windowless room and stayed there alone year in and year out.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-8\">As to the government\u2019s response, if one was required as the majority holds, I would hold now that the response was insufficient.
