Subsequent to the district court\u2019s decision a fair parole revocation hearing was held, at which Blassingame admitted five of the charged parole violations, and asserted no claim of prejudice resulting from the delay. The clear law of the Circuit is that such a hearing renders Blassingame\u2019s custody lawful. United States ex rel. Buono v. Kenton, 287 F.2d 534 (2d Cir. 1961). Consequently, we grant the motion to withdraw and affirm the order of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
