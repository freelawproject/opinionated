For reasons other than those articulated by the district court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we conclude that it was proper for the court to refuse the relief sought against Mayor Rizzo.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-14\">Melvin Hardy (a former Executive Director of PAAC), Isaiah Crippins (a former General Counsel of PAAC), and PAAC commenced this action in the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on April 27, 1973. Their complaint includes a variety of claims concerning the alleged interference of Mayor Rizzo with the functioning of the anti-poverty agency. By far the most prominent of these claims is the charge that the Mayor violated federal law by removing Melvin Hardy as the Executive Director of PAAC and by refusing to renew Mr. Crippins\u2019 contract as General Counsel. Less precise, but still present in the complaint, are charges that: (1) the Mayor illegally blocked appointments to PAAC made by its Executive Director; (2) the Mayor appointed persons to the PAAC Board illegally; (3) the Mayor convened PAAC meetings illegally; and (4) the Mayor defamed each of the plaintiffs. The complaint seeks declaratory and injunc-tive relief, as well as compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-19\">Four days after the above action was commenced, the City of Philadelphia instituted an action in state court against Hardy and Crippins, seeking to restrain the defendants from exercising their duties as Executive Director and General Counsel of PAAC.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On May 3, 1973, Melvin Hardy and Isaiah Crippins removed the City\u2019s action to the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441. Perceiving a close similarity between the two actions, the district court then consolidated the original action brought by PAAC, Hardy and Crippins (District Court No. 73-957) with the City\u2019s removed action (District Court No. 73-990). On May 10, 1973, the court conducted a one day hearing on the merits of the consolidated case.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-20\">After the hearing, the City moved for dismissal of No. 73-957 and for remand of No. 73-990 on the grounds of lack of subject matter juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>diction. These motions were denied <em>sub silentio </em>by the district court. In a memorandum opinion, the district court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">(1) subject matter jurisdiction exists (pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831) for the district court to consider all matters raised in the consolidated actions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">(2) federal law permits the Mayor to remove PAAC\u2019s Executive Director and to refuse to renew the contract of PAAC\u2019s General Counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">With regard to the peripheral matters raised in PAAC\u2019s original complaint, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">We have not considered the myriad of other allegations and issues raised in the pleadings for the following reasons: (a) no evidence was presented at the hearing in connection therewith; (b) these matters were not briefed by the parties; and (e) in view of the issues decided herein, the other allegations and issues raised in the pleadings now appear moot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Judgment was thereupon entered in favor of the defendants in No. 73-957 and in favor of the plaintiff in No. 73-990. PAAC and Hardy appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">To understand the district court\u2019s primary conclusions, it is necessary to trace briefly the history of relevant anti-poverty legislation. As part of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, Congress established a Community Action Program. This Program encouraged the development of local agencies to provide multiple services to impoverished communities. Originally, the Program envisioned as a goal the \u201cmaximum feasible\u201d participation of the poor in the development of Community Action Programs. By 1967, however, Congress recognized that the Community Action Program could not succeed without the support of locally elected officials. <em>See </em>1967 U.S. Code, Congressional &amp; Administrative News at 2448-49 (excerpted from House Report No. 866, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-15\">On December 23, 1967, Congress enacted the Green Amendments to the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. These Amendments gave flexibility to the Community Action Program, permitting localities a choice in the type of \u201ccommunity action agency\u201d that would qualify for federal funding. Under the Green Amendments, the agency may either be a \u201cState or political subdivision of a State (having elected or duly appointed governing officials), or a combination of such political subdivisions\u201d or it may be a \u201cpublic or private non-profit agency or organization which has been designated by a State or such a political subdivision or combination of such subdivisions.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2790(a). The former administers its program through a <em>community action board,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>while the latter administers its program through a <em>governing board. </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2791(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>The Economic Opportunity Act is somewhat imprecise with regard to the distinctions between the two types of boards. A <em>governing board </em>has the power to \u201cappoint persons to senior staff positions, to determine major personnel, fiscal, and program policies, to approve overall program plans and priorities, and to assure compliance with conditions of and approve proposals for financial assistance under this subchapter.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2791(e). The parallel powers of a <em>community action board, </em>on the other hand, are not made explicit by the statute. The Office of Economic Opportunity, however, has explained that in jurisdictions with community action boards, the \u201cgoverning officials\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> will exercise the same powers that governing boards exercise, unless the officials delegate these powers to the community action boards. OEO Community Action Program Memorandum No. 81 at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">In determining whether PAAC or Mayor Rizzo had the authority to remove Hardy, the district court focused upon the fact that the appointive powers of community action agencies differ, depending upon whether the agency is administered by a governing board (lodging the appointive powers in the board itself) or by a community action board (lodging the appointive powers in governing officials). The court thus posed as determinative the issue as to whether PAAC \u201cis a political subdivision of the City of Philadelphia administered by a \u2018community action board\u2019 or whether it is a public or private non-private agency administered by a \u2018governing board.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">To resolve this issue, the district court examined the history of the Philadelphia Anti-Poverty Action Commission. As the court found, PAAC was created on February 22, 1965 by the Executive Order of former Mayor James H. Tate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> According to the uncontra-dicted testimony of appellant\u2019s witnesses, PAAC was (from 1965 to 1967) the only community action institution in the country that existed solely by virtue of an Executive Order. To mollify demands from Washington, a blue ribbon panel was formed to develop permanent legislation. As a result of the panel\u2019s efforts, the Philadelphia City Council adopted Bill No. 2846 on December 27, 1967. This Ordinance, appearing as Title 21-800 of the Philadelphia Code, provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-11\">(1) Creation of Commission. The Philadelphia Anti-Poverty Action Commission is hereby created. It shall be composed of an uneven number of members, not less than 31 nor more than 45 in number. All of the members of the Commission shall serve without compensation. The initial number of members of the Commission shall be 38 members and there shall be no change in the number of members of the Commission at any time unless two-thirds of the members appointed to the Board approve the change in membership. The members of the Commission shall select a chairman from among themselves. The term for which any member of the Commission shall serve shall be for a period of one year and until their successors are appointed, and qualify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-12\">(2) Appointment of Members. The Members of the Commission shall be appointed by the Mayor. [The ordinance then recommends that the May- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>or appoint specific officials as members.] * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">(3) The Mayor shall select an Executive Director from among a panel of 3 persons whose names are submitted to the Mayor by the Commission. The Mayor shall be at liberty to request the Commission to present to the Mayor additional panels of 3 persons from which he may select an Executive Director. The request of the Mayor for additional panels shall not preclude him from selecting a name from among the prior panels. * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">(5) Powers and Duties. The Commission shall have the following powers and duties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-10\">(a) To conduct, administer and coordinate Federal anti-poverty programs in Philadelphia;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-11\">(b) To mobilize the resources of the City of Philadelphia and its residents to combat poverty through a community action program;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-12\">(c) To mobilize and utilize resources, public and private, in an attack on poverty;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-13\">(d) To provide services, assistance and other activities of sufficient scope and size to give promise of progress through elimination of poverty or a cause or causes of poverty through developing employment opportunities, improving human performance, motivation, productivity or bettering conditions under which people live, learn and work;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-14\">(e) To carry out a community action program which is developed, conducted and administered with the maximum feasible participation of residents of the areas and members of the groups served;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-15\">(f) To cooperate with federal, state and local governments and their agencies and representatives in every way possible in the conduct, administration and coordination of a community action program ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-19\">(g) To act as an agency of the City of Philadelphia for any and all of the purposes set forth herein; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-20\">(h) To receive, expend and account for funds, property and services supplied by federal, state or local governments, or by others, and in every way possible to further the purposes of the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-21\">The district court concluded from the Executive Order and City Ordinance that \u201cPAAC is an agency of the City, administered by a \u2018community action board,\u2019 rather than a non-profit organization administered by a \u2018governing board.\u2019 \u201d Having found that PAAC is an agency of the City, the court considered itself bound by federal law to hold that the <em>appointive power </em>lies with the governing official, Mayor Rizzo. Looking to state law, the court noted that the <em>removal power </em>tracks the appointive power.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, the court held that it was proper for the Mayor to remove Melvin Hardy from office.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-22\">II. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b375-23\">Before evaluating the reasoning of the district court (as outlined above), we find it necessary to discuss, as a threshold issue, the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court. We shall analyze the court\u2019s conclusion that jurisdiction vested (to consider <em>all </em>claims raised herein) by treating separately (1) the claim that Mayor Rizzo could not remove Hardy, (2) the peripheral claims raised by PAAC in 73-957, and (3) the removed claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-24\">A. <em>No. 73-957: The Primary Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-25\">We agree with the district court that jurisdiction exists under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 to consider Hardy\u2019s claim that he was illegally discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>To confer original jurisdiction upon a district court pursuant to 28 U. S.C. \u00a7 1331, the complainant must assert a claim founded directly upon federal law. Gully v. First National Bank, 299 U.S. 109, 112, 57 S.Ct. 96, 97, 81 L.Ed. 70 (1936); Cabana Management, Inc. v. Hyatt Corp., 441 F.2d 862, 864 (5th Cir. 1971). The federal right asserted \u201cmust be such that it will be supported if the Constitution or laws of the United States are given one construction or effect, and defeated if they receive another.\u201d Gully v. First National Bank, <em>supra, </em>299 U.S. at 112. Furthermore, the claim must be essential to plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, Warrington Sewer Co. v. Tracy, 463 F.2d 771, 772 (3d Cir. 1972) <em>(per curiam), </em>and must raise a substantial federal question, Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U.S. 528, 534-542, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 39 L.Ed.2d 577, (1974). For the claim to be substantial, it need not be one that will ultimately succeed on the merits. <em>See, e. g. </em>Lewis v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO, 407 F.2d 1185, 1188, n.3 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 866, 90 S.Ct. 145, 24 L.Ed.2d 120 (1969). Provided that the federal claim is material (and not raised solely for the purposes of obtaining jurisdiction) and is not rendered frivolous by prior case law, a federal question will exist for purposes of 28 U. S.C. \u00a7 1331. <em>See </em>Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 682-683, 66 S.Ct. 773, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In the action filed as No. 73-957, PAAC and Hardy argue that the Economic Opportunity Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2701 et seq.) and regulations promulgated in furtherance thereof preclude May- or Rizzo from removing PAAC\u2019s Executive Director. Specifically, they contend: (1) that as a condition to recognition of PAAC as a grantee agency, the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) required that the removal power remain within PAAC, and (2) that local law cannot supersede terms imposed by the OEO pursuant to federal law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In essence, they claim that Mayor Rizzo\u2019s removal of Hardy contravened the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution by subordinating a Congressional mandate to local law.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">We find that such a claim satisfies all the requisites of a substantial federal question. Essential to plaintiff-appellants\u2019 ease is the claim that federal law (namely, the Economic Opportunity Act) precludes Mayor Rizzo from removing Hardy from office. If we read the Act as PAAC and Hardy would have us read it, we might well be compelled to conclude that the Mayor is without authority to remove Hardy; if, on the other hand, we interpret the Act as irrelevant to the issue of Hardy\u2019s removal, we could reach the opposite result. We have been cited to no case law that renders the claim frivolous. Since there is no doubt but that the $10,000 amount in controversy requirement is satisfied, we conclude (as did the district court) that jurisdiction vests pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 to consider the legitimacy of Hardy\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">B. <em>No. 73-957: The Peripheral Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">As discussed above, the complaint in No. 73-957 charges that the Mayor: (1) illegally blocked appointments to PAAC, (2) illegally appointed persons to PAAC, (3) convened PAAC meetings, and (4) defamed the plaintiffs. With regard to the first three peripheral claims, the theory of illegality is based upon the argument that federal law (namely the Economic Opportunity Act and regulations promulgated in response thereto) prohibits the actions taken by the Mayor. For the reasons discussed above, we find that these claims too raise a substantial federal question.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-14\">We cannot, however, find an independent jurisdictional basis for plaintiffs\u2019 defamation claim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>court was correct in exercising jurisdiction of this claim, it could only be so as a result of the court\u2019s power to exercise <em>pendent jurisdiction </em>over state claims related to legitimate federal claims. In United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the Supreme Court analyzed this power as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-5\">Pendent jurisdiction, in the sense of judicial power, exists whenever there is a claim \u2018arising under [the] Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority .,\u2019 U.S.Const., Art. Ill, \u00a7 2, and the relationship between that claim and the state claim permits the conclusion that the entire action before the court comprises but one constitutional \u2018case.\u2019 The federal claim must have substance sufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction on the court. Levering &amp; Garrigues Co. v. Morrin, 289 U.S. 103 [, 53 S.Ct. 549, 77 L.Ed. 1062]. The state and federal claims must derive from a common nucleus of operative fact. But if, considered without regard to their federal or state character, a plaintiff\u2019s claims are such that he would ordinarily be expected to try them all in one judicial proceeding, then, assuming substantiality of the federal issues, there is power in federal courts to hear the whole, (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Agi\">See also Deaktor v. Fox Grocery Co., 475 F.2d 1112, 1115-1116, n.2 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 867, 94 S.Ct. 65, 38 L.Ed.2d 86 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">We find that the defamation claim is factually distinct from the claims involving Mayor Rizzo\u2019s interference with the operation of PAAC. The defamation claim does not derive from a \u201cnucleus of operative fact\u201d common with the federal claims. Nor is the defamation claim one which we would \u201cordinarily expect\u201d to be tried with the federal claims. Accordingly, we find that the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction is unavailable to justify the district court\u2019s consideration of the defamation claim. We hold that the court erred in exercising jurisdiction over same.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">C. No. <em>73-990: The Claim Removed from State Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-15\"> The removal statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441, generally keys removal jurisdiction to original jurisdiction. A case which originally may be brought in federal district court is generally removable upon defendant\u2019s petition. Where, as here, removal is predicated upon the assertion of a federal question, the principles discussed above with regard to \u00a7 1331 jurisdiction are applicable to removal from state courts. <em>See </em>Wright, Law of Federal Courts (2d ed. 1970) at 1304. Most importantly, the federal question must appear as an essential element of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint in state court. If the federal question arises only as a defense, or in anticipation of a defense, removal jurisdiction will not exist. <em>See, e. g., </em>Tennessee v. Union and Planters\u2019 Bank, 152 U.S. 454, 14 S.Ct. 654, 38 L.Ed. 511 (1894); Crow v. Wyoming Timber Products Co., 424 F.2d 93, 95 (10th Cir. 1970); Romick v. Bekins Van &amp; Storage Co., 197 F.2d 369, 370 (5th Cir. 1952); <em>see also </em>Wright, Law of Federal Courts (2d ed. 1970) at 131 (\u201cDefendant can remove a case where the plaintiff relies on federal law for his claim, though the plaintiff is perfectly willing to entrust his federal claim to a state court, but neither party can take the case to federal court where defendant sets up federal law as a defense to a non-federal claim by plaintiff.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-16\">In the action commenced by the City of Philadelphia to restrain Hardy and Crippins from serving as PAAC\u2019s Executive Director and General Counsel, plaintiff\u2019s complaint is based entirely on state law. According to the complaint, the Mayor\u2019s authority to discharge the defendants is predicated solely upon the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter. The federal question in No. 73-990 thus arises only as a defense, Hardy and Crippens asserting that federal law su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>persedes the Charter and precludes their discharge. Since the federal question does not appear as part of the complaint well-pleaded, the state action is not properly removable, regardless of its similarity with No. 73-957. We find that the district court erred in denying the City\u2019s motion to remand No. 73-990.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Our analysis discloses that the district court was incorrect in concluding that subject matter jurisdiction exists to consider <em>all </em>claims raised in the consolidated actions. We need discuss the merits of only two sets of claims, the primary assertion that federal law precludes Hardy\u2019s discharge and the three peripheral allegations raised in PAAC\u2019s complaint (without the defamation claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">III. The Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">A. <em>No. 73-957: The Primary Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Appellants assert that it was improper for the district court to focus upon the issue of whether PAAC is administered as a \u201cgoverning board\u201d or a \u201ccommunity action board.\u201d They maintain that the essential structure of PAAC was developed before the adoption of the Green Amendments and has not been altered since. It is appellants\u2019 position that early negotiations between PAAC, OEO, and the City of Philadelphia led to the creation of an independent entity whose federally-imposed autonomy cannot be undermined by local law. They assert that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">In view of the fact that the Green Amendments did not change the functioning of PAAC, resolution of such questions as who possesses the power to discharge the Executive Director of PAAC must depend on the nature of the arrangements, agreements and understandings reached through negotiations conducted by OEO, PAAC and the City of Philadelphia. A community action agency must be operated in accordance with the terms and conditions attached to the grant of federal funds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">Appellants\u2019 Brief at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-13\">Both the district court and the appellants construe the Federal Community Action Program as being mandatory in form. The court predicated its entire opinion upon the assumption that 42 U. S.C. \u00a7 2790 <em>requires </em>local governments to establish agencies which are administered either by governing boards or community action boards. Appellants, likewise, assume that it is <em>mandatory </em>that PAAC be operated \u201cin accordance with the terms and conditions attached to the grant of federal funds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-14\">Were we concerned herein with the eligibility of PAAC for federal funding, we, like the district court and appellants, would regard federal law as mandatory. The instant case, however, does not center around federal funding. Rather, we are concerned with identifying the basic structure of PAAC. While the Economic Opportunity Act may strongly influence the structure ultimately developed, it is a matter for local governments to decide whether they will create poverty agencies that satisfy federal guidelines. Contrary to the assumptions made by the district court and by the appellants, there is nothing in the Economic Opportunity Act (or in the regulations promulgated in furtherance thereof) which requires localities to establish community action agencies.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>An agency which fails to comport with the Act\u2019s guidelines is neither illegal nor in contravention of the Supremacy Clause. Rather, it is merely an agency that may be forced to forego federal funding. In short, the Act does not establish powers in local agencies, but rather merely describes the .powers that are prerequisites to federal funding.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">To determine whether the Mayor or PAAC has the authority to remove Melvin Hardy, it is necessary to examine the documents which created PAAC rather than the federal guidelines which may or may not have been followed.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Section 3 of the Ordinance creating PAAC gives the Mayor the power to appoint the Executive Director.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Under Pennsylvania law, the power to remove an appointed officer is lodged in the same entity that has the power to appoint.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We thus agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Mayor Rizzo has the authority to remove Melvin Hardy from' office.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">B. <em>No. </em>73-957: <em>The Peripheral Claims </em>(other than the defamation claim)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">We agree with the district court that plaintiffs failed to satisfy their burden of proving the Mayor\u2019s alleged interferences with PAAC. On the basis of the record herein, regardless of the effect of federal law, plaintiff-appellants cannot succeed on their peripheral claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">The judgment entered in favor of the defendants in District Court No. 73-957 will be affirmed with respect to all claims but the defamation claim. The judgment entered in District Court No. 73-957 with respect to the defamation claim and the judgment entered in District Court No. 73-990 will be reversed for want of subject matter jurisdiction. To effect the above dispositions, the entire case will be remanded to the district court for entry of a judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-15\">. It is proper for an appellate court to affirm a <em>correct </em>decision of a lower court even when that decision is based on an inappropriate ground. <em>See </em>Helvering v. Gowran, 302 U.S. 238, 245, 58 S.Ct. 154, 82 L.Ed. 224 (1937).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b372-21\">.

Although Isaiah Crippins joined PAAC and Hardy in the filing of a notice of appeal, Crippins has not submitted a brief to this Court. We limit our remarks in this opinion to the appellants before us, PAAC and Hardy. As to Crippins, we dismiss his appeal for failure to prosecute. <em>See </em>Fed.R. App.P. 3(a) ; 9 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice IT 203.12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b373-19\">.
