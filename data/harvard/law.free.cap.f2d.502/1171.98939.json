East, Senior United States District Judge, Eugene, Oregon, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b1235-22\">OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b1235-24\">ELY, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1235-25\">This appeal arises from the District Court\u2019s judgment denying the claim of appellant Tagaropulos, S.A., a corporation, (hereinafter Tagaropulos) against appellee Santa Margarita Tankers, Inc. (hereinafter Santa Margarita). The action was brought under 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 971, entitling to persons furnishing necessaries to vessels the right to a maritime lien, and under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-26\">The District Court found that Tagaro-pulos\u2019s alleged lien was barred by laches. The sole issue here is whether that finding was clearly erroneous. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-27\">There is no significant dispute as to the facts. Tagaropulos, which operated a ship chandlering business in the Panama Canal Zone, delivered provisions to the ship from November, 1968, to June, 1970. During that time, the vessel was owned by Allied Tankers, Inc., a subsidiary of the Isbrandtsen Line. Although the terms of credit called for payment in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>thirty days, Tagaropulos allowed over two years to expire before the shipowner made any payment whatsoever. Allied\u2019s purchasing agent, Central Purchasing &amp; Service, Inc., did pay Tagaro-pulos $1,463.78 on February 17, 1970, and $11,431.32 on June 6, 1970. With a balance of over seven thousand dollars still owing, Tagaropulos allowed the ship\u2019s purchasing agent to charge additional supplies to the ship on June 18, 1970. The amount of this purchase was $24,261.44. No further payments were ever made, and the ship never returned to the Canal Zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-4\">It is apparent, we think, that Tagaro-pulos was inexcusably dilatory in attempting to collect the amounts owed to it by the ship. Despite the fact that Ta-garopulos could have arrested the ship on any of the dates when it traversed the Canal between November, 1968, and June, 1970, Tagaropulos took no action other than attempting to contact the ship\u2019s purchasing agent. Furthermore, Tagaropulos could have ascertained the location of the ship after June, 1970, by either contacting Isbrandtsen\u2019s local agent or by requesting information from the Military Sea Transport Service. Ta-garopulos knew that the ship was being operated under military contract. Ta-garopulos did not file suit against either Allied Tankers or Central Purchasing &amp; Services, Inc., nor did it seek to file a lien against the ship in its home port pursuant to 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 925(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-5\">The ship, which was advertised for sale for over a year, was eventually purchased from Allied Tankers by Santa Margarita on December 6, 1970. Prior to the purchase, Santa Margarita had checked both the home port and the ship\u2019s log for liens outstanding against the ship. Although no liens were entered in the log, Santa Margarita did discover therein entries for repairs. Santa Margarita contacted the shipyards that had made these repairs and learned that there were unpaid bills outstanding. In addition, various shipyards had recorded liens against the ship in its home port, and Santa Margarita duly noted these liens. The record clearly reveals that Santa Margarita made every effort to unearth all claims against the ship. Obviously, any such liens or unpaid bills would affect the vessel\u2019s purchase price. Furthermore, Allied Tankers assured Santa Margarita, both orally and in writing, that no claims other than those discovered by Santa Margarita existed against the ship.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-7\">The standard of diligence required by the holder of an unrecorded lien against a bona fide purchase of a vessel is \u201ca high degree of diligence.\u201d <em>See </em>Merchants &amp; Marine Bank v. The Fishing Vessel T. E. Welles, 289 F.2d 188, 190 (5th Cir. 1961) and cases collected therein; The Everosa, 93 F.2d 732, 735 (1st Cir. 1937); Waterways Marine, Inc. v. Brooks Liquid Transport, Inc., 291 F.Supp. 703 (N. D. Ill. 1968). In <em>Waterways Marine, supra, </em>the District Court considered a number of factors relevant to a determination that the lienholder had not exercised the high degree of diligence required. These factors were (1) a failure to file a claim in the ship\u2019s home port; (2) a failure to arrest the ship on occasions when it could have been arrested; (3) a failure to assert a claim against the ship\u2019s purchaser until nearly a year had elapsed from the last date of a sale to the ship; and (4) a failure to respond to a request from a credit association \u201cfor advice of\u201d or to \u201cfile notice of\u201d any claims or liens against the ship.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-8\">In our case, Tagaropulos did not file a home port lien, nor did it attempt to arrest the vessel when it sailed through the Canal Zone. Moreover, Tagaropulos never attempted to ascertain the ship\u2019s location and arrest it in another port. It waited for over two years before taking any action whatsoever in attempting to recover even a partial payment of Allied\u2019s bill. And at a time when Allied still owed over seven thousand dollars to Tagaropulos, the latter supplied the ship with over twenty-four thousand dollars worth of supplies. When the ship was ultimately purchased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>by Santa Margarita, Tagaropulos delayed filing suit for an additional sixteen months thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-4\">From the foregoing, the conclusion is inescapable that Tagaropulos \u201cslept on its rights.\u201d It failed to exercise even a minimum degree of diligence, and the District Court properly held, in effect, that to penalize the ship\u2019s innocent purchaser would work a gross inequity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
