Johnson, Jr. was found guilty by a jury of robbing a United States post office and of placing the life of a mail custodian in jeopardy by use of a dangerous weapon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2114.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Johnson was given the statutorily mandated sentence of 25 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-20\">The evidence indicated that on July 10, 1973, the Brunswick Postal Service in Gary, Indiana, was robbed of four money orders. During the robbery, Susan Hudak, the postal clerk from whom the money orders were taken, was shot in the hand by the robber.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-21\">Johnson raises three issues on appeal: (1) whether the district court erred in permitting certain evidence to be introduced by the Government; (2) whether the evidence was sufficient to prove that Johnson had placed Susan Hudak\u2019s life in jeopardy; (3) whether the jury should have been informed that the defendant, if convicted, would receive a sentence of 25 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-22\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-23\">Prior to Johnson's arrest, Susan Hu-dak and another postal clerk present during the robbery, Shellena Evans, made photographic identifications of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1375\">*1375</page-number>defendant. A lineup was conducted, with the same witnesses present, after Johnson was ai-rested. The police records did not indicate that a positive identification had been made by either witness at the lineup.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1439-5\">The district court, in a pretrial order, granted the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the photographic identifications.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defense made no motion to suppress the lineup confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-6\">At the trial, the district judge permitted the Government, on rebuttal, to inquire, to a limited extent, into the suppressed photographic identifications. Johnson contends that this amounted to revei\u2019sible error. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-7\">In direct examination, the prosecutor did not raise, at any time, the matter of eyewitness identification of Johnson. This issue was first brought up by the defense in cross-examination. In cross-examining Susan Hudak, the defense counsel limited his questions to the lineup confrontation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In cross-examining Shellena Evans, the defense again asked about the lineup <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but then proceeded to ask the broad question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1439-19\">\u201cQ. And it is your testimony now that you were unable to identify Joseph Russell Johnson, Jr. as the assailant or the perpetrator of that robbery, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0L\">A. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1439-20\">On redirect, the prosecutor was permitted to ask Shellena Evans:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1439-21\">\u201cQ. Did you ever on any other occasion make an identification of the person who committed the robbery at the Brunswick Postal Station ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1439-22\">-***#\u25a0**</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1439-23\">A. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1439-24\">Later, on redirect rebuttal, the prosecutor asked Gerald Phillips, a postal inspector who was present during the lineup, the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1439-25\">\u201cQ. Did you also on August 1, 1973, talk to the witness Shellena Ev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1376\">*1376</page-number>ans concerning a possible identification ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1440-4\">A. Yes, sir, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1440-5\">Q. And in your presence did she make an identification?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1440-6\">A. In effect, she did, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"alj-dedup-0\">Q. Would you explain your answer, \u2018in effect.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1440-8\">A. Well, she identified Joseph Russell Johnson, Jr., here, the defendant here, as the same person as she had subsequently picked out of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1440-9\">MR. KELLY: Your Honor, I\u2019m going to object to this question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1440-10\">THE COURT: I\u2019ll sustain your objection. I\u2019ll strike the evidence. And I\u2019ll admonish the jury not to consider it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1440-11\">As the district court noted, the defense counsel, in cross-examining Shel-lena Evans, opened the door on the issue of <em>all </em>pretrial identifications made by that witness. The last question and answer in the defense\u2019s cross-examination of Ms. Evans was not limited to the lineup confrontation; rather, the implication was that Shellena Evans had <em>never </em>made an eyewitness identification of Johnson.\u00ae This inference was unfair to the Government since Ms. Evans had, in fact, identified Johnson in a photo-spread even though the circumstances of the identification were such as to activate the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-12\"> In this situation, it was permissible to allow the Government to explore, in rebuttal, testimony which was not admissible on direct in order to prevent prejudice. United States v. Winston, 145 U.S.App.D.C. 67, 447 F.2d 1236, 1240 (1971); J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 15 (3d ed. 1940). The doctrine of curative admissibility has been specifically held to permit rebuttal use of pretrial identifications that are otherwise inadmissible because of constitutional violations. United States v. Winston, <em>supra </em>at 1240; United States v. Clark, 294 F.Supp. 44 (D.D.C.1968), aff\u2019d sub nom. Clemons v. United States, 133 U.S.App.D.C. 27, 408 F.2d 1230 (1968), cert. denied 394 U.S. 964, 89 S.Ct. 1318, 22 L.Ed.2d 567 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-16\">The doctrine of curative admissibility can, of course, only be used to prevent prejudice; it cannot be \u201csubverted into a rule for injection of prejudice.\u201d United States v. Winston, <em>supra, </em>447 F.2d at 1240. In the present ease, however, the district court was very careful to limit the Government\u2019s use of the suppressed evidence. Shellena Evans only testified, on redirect, that on some occasion she made an identification of the person who robbed the Brunswick Postal Station. The prosecutor did not ask about the details of this identification or even whom Ms. Evans had identified. Gerald Phillips\u2019 testimony was even more limited. Phillips was only permitted to testify as to whether Ms. Evans had made an identification at the lineup, an issue clearly opened by the defense. That part of Phillips\u2019 answer which went beyond this matter was stricken by the district judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-17\">In any event, the proof of Johnson\u2019s guilt, even though in part circumstantial in nature, was so conclusive that if there had been error it would have been harmless. Johnson\u2019s fingerprints were found on the counter where the robbery occurred.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s fingerprints were also found on the stubs from the stolen money orders and on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>stolen money orders themselves.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The money orders, furthermore, were cashed on July 20, 1973, in Johnson\u2019s hometown, Warren, Ohio. When arrested, on July 24, 1973, Johnson told a police officer that he had just returned from Warren, Ohio. Finally, Susan Hudak indicated that she had identified Johnson at the lineup. In light of this overwhelming evidence and the Government\u2019s limited inquiry into the photograph identifications, if there had been error it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1969); Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-6\">The defendant next contends that the evidence was insufficient to prove that Johnson wounded Susan Hudak or put her life in jeopardy. This argument rests on two facts: (1) a firearm introduced into evidence by the Government did not have Johnson\u2019s fingerprints on it, and no ballistic test was performed to connect the weapon to the robbery;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (2) Susan Hudak testified that the firearm used in the robbery had a long barrel while the weapon introduced into evidence was a snub-nosed pistol. Aside from the fact that a victim looking at the business end of a gun may err in gauging the length of the barrel, the proof at trial negates these contentions of Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-7\"> Susan Hudak was shot in the hand by the person who robbed the Brunswick Postal Station. As previously explained, the fingerprint and identification evidence overwhelmingly indicated that Johnson committed the robbery. Johnson\u2019s reliance on Newsom v. United States, 335 F.2d 237 (5th Cir. 1964), is misplaced. The present case is not the situation adverted to in that case (at 239) of \u201cmere presence at the scene of a criminal offense,\u201d because the individual, <em>i. e.. </em>Johnson, identified as being present, was also identified as the individual who fired the injurious shot. Further, the Government was not required to prove that a particular weapon was used in the robbery but only' that, in effecting the robbery, Johnson placed Susan Hudak\u2019s life in jeopardy by use of a dangerous weapon. The evidence was clearly sufficient to prove the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-12\">The defendant\u2019s final contention is that the defense should have been permitted, in closing argument or in a jury instruction, to inform the jury that if they convicted Johnson, he would receive a mandatory sentence of 25 years\u2019 imprisonment. This contention is also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-13\">The statute in question does not provide the jury with any role with regard to punishment. The jury\u2019s only function in this case was to determine guilt or innocence. The issue of sentencing was wholly irrelevant to this determination. \u201cTo inform the jury that the court may impose minimum or maximum sentence or other matters relating to disposition of the defendant, tend to draw the attention of the jury away from their chief function as sole judges of the facts, open the door to compromise verdicts and to confuse the issue or issues to be decided.\u201d Pope v. United States, 298 F.2d 507, 508 (5th Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 381 U.S. 941, 85 S.Ct. 1776, 14 L.Ed.2d 704 (1965). See also Chapman v. United States, 443 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1378\">*1378</page-number>917, 920 (10th Cir. 1971); United States v. Del Toro, 426 F.2d 181, 184 (5th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 829, 91 S.Ct. 58, 27 L.Ed.2d 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-4\">The defense may wish to inform the jury of the mandatory sentence in the hope that the jury might \u201chang\u201d or acquit simply because some or all of the jurors thought that the penalty was too severe. Congress, however, has already made the policy determination as to the severity of the sentence where a person is found guilty under this statute. It is not for the courts or the juries to make a new policy determination in such a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1438-13\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2114 provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1438-14\">\u201cWhoever assaults any person having lawful charge, control, or custody of any mail matter or of any money or other property of the United States, with intent to rob, steal, or purloin such mail matter, money, or other property of the United States, or robs any such person of mail matter, or of any money, or other property of the United States, shall, for the first offense, be imprisoned not more than ten years; and if in effecting or attempting to effect such robbery he wounds the person having custody of such mail, money, or other property of the United States, or puts his life in jeopardy by the use of a dangerous weapon, or for a subsequent offense, shall be imprisoned twenty-five years.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1439-8\">. At the trial, however, Susan Hudak testified, on cross-examination, that she <em>had </em>identified Johnson at the line-up. See note 4 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1439-9\">. The district 3'udge did not explain, in his order, why he suppressed the photograph identifications. The defense, in seeking the suppression, had argued that the photo-spread was suggestive since Ms. Hudak had described the robber as having an \u201cAfro\u201d hair style and only Johnson\u2019s picture (of the 12 pictures used) showed a black male wearing an \u201cAfro\u201d hair style.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1439-10\">. \u201cQ.

No, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1440-13\">. Shellena Evans apparently interpreted the defense\u2019s last question as referring only to the lineup confrontation since she answered it affirmatively. Ms. Evans\u2019 interpretation of the question, however, is irrelevant with respect to the impression made on the jury by the question, <em>i. e., </em>that she at no time had ever identified Johnson as the robber.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1440-18\">. This counter had been dusted before 7:30 A.M. on the day of the robbery with a treated cloth which would have removed any earlier fingerprints. The robbery occurred at approximately 10:30 A.M. and the post office was immediately closed thereafter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1441-8\">. Ms. Hudak testified that the robber took tlie money orders before she could remove the stubs. The stubs were later found in a mail box located approximately seven blocks from the Brunswick Postal Station. The money orders themselves were recovered after they had been cashed in Warren, Ohio.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1441-14\">. The weapon was found at the defendant\u2019s home. When the gun was offered into evidence, counsel for Johnson stated there was no objection to its admission. The gun had five cartridges and one empty Remington .22 caliber cartridge casing. The bullet shot in the post office was recovered only in fragments but these were sufficient to be indicative of a .22 caliber Remington cartridge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
