Dept, of Justice, St. Louis, Mo., for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1166-23\">Before MATTHES, Senior Circuit Judge, and HEANEY and STEPHENSON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1166-24\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b1166-25\">Appellant, DeLancy Scott, was convicted by a jury for the distribution of heroin. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>conviction was affirmed by this court in an unpublished opinion filed September 25, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-4\">The trial court\u2019s oral sentence given in open court was six years\u2019 imprisonment. The written \u201cJudgment and Commitment\u201d was for six years\u2019 imprisonment to be followed by the mandatory special parole required by 21 TJ.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-5\">On February'7, 1974 appellant filed a Fed.R.Crim.P. 35 motion for correction of sentence seeking resolution of the discrepancy between the oral and written sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-6\">The trial court and the government agreed with appellant that the sentence was erroneous and therefore illegal because it was in violation of the applicable statute. We agree that the sentence as given in defendant\u2019s presence was erroneous since it omitted a term required to be imposed by law. Bozza v. United States, 330 U.S. 160, 166, 67 S. Ct. 645, 91 L.Ed. 818 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-7\">The original sentence was set aside and appellant was brought before the court and resentenced to six years\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 special parole in accordance with 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Credit was given for the time already served and any accumulated good time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-8\">In this appeal appellant contends that the imposition of the increased sentence constituted double jeopardy and that the six year sentence should have been reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-9\">This court has recently faced an identical problem and resolved the issue contrary to appellant\u2019s position. In United States v. Richardson, 498 F.2d 9 (8th Cir. 1974), this court relied on Bozza v. United States, 330 U.S. 160, 165-167, 67 S.Ct. 645, 91 L.Ed. 818 (1947), and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1167-10\">Where the original sentence is invalid, vacation of that sentence and imposition of another sentence, even though more severe, does not constitute double jeopardy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1167-11\"><em>Accord </em>Orrie v. United States, 302 F.2d 695 (8th Cir. 1962); United States v. Mack, 494 F.2d 1204 (9th Cir. 1974); Caille v. United States, 487 F.2d 614 (5th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-12\">The <em>Bozza </em>opinion is controlling in this instance as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
