Respondents have indicated that they do not intend to respond to the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-13\">Petitioner is the defendant in Civil Action No. 73-2312 captioned American Honda Motor Co., Inc. v. Vickers Motors, Inc., pending before respondent Harry W. Wellford, U.S. District Judge, in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee. On May 24, 1974 the judge entered an \u201cORDER ON DISCOVERY MOTIONS,\u201d referring discovery motions, objections thereto, motions to compel production, and motions for protective orders to respondent Aaron C. Brown, Jr., U. S. Magistrate, \u201c . . . for a hearing and recommendation as to appropriate orders and relief under the circumstances.\u201d Petitioner seeks an order directing the judge to decide the discovery motions without any reference, and prohibiting the magistrate from proceeding further under the order of reference. Petitioner also seeks to stay the order of reference pending determination of his petition for mandamus and prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-16\">At the outset, we consider whether mandamus and prohibition may be employed to test the power of a district judge to refer for \u201chearing and recommendation\u201d motions relating to discovery. Our authority, if it exists, must be found in the \u201cAll Writs\u201d Statute 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 1651(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-17\">The Supreme Court and all courts established by Act of Congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1032-18\">Although the extraordinary remedy of mandamus is proper when a court has clearly exceeded or refused to exercise its jurisdiction, it should not issue as a substitute for appeal to review interlocutory orders that do not deprive \u201cthe parties of a trial before the court on the basic issues involved in the litigation.\u201d Compare La Buy v. Howes Leather Co., 352 U.S. 249, 77 S.Ct. 309, 1 L.Ed.2d 290 (1957) where a reference to a master was made on the merits, with Will v. United States, 389 U.S. 90, 88 S.Ct. 269, 19 L.Ed.2d 305 (1967), where mandamus was held not to lie to test a pretrial discovery order in a criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>Accordingly, the challenged order of reference, even if erroneous \u2014 a question we do not decide \u2014 involved no clear abuse of judicial power because 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(2) authorizes rules to permit magistrates to furnish \u201cassistance to a district judge in the conduct of pretrial or discovery proceedings in civil actions.\u201d Whether the local rule, or its application here, is \u201c . . . inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(2) is reviewable on appeal appropriately taken from a final judgment or other order. <em>See </em>Wingo, Warden v. Wedding, 418 U.S. 461, 94 S.Ct. 2842, 41 L.Ed.2d 879 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">The Petition for Writs of Mandamus and Prohibition is hereby denied and no stay will issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
