ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">On this appeal, we are summoned to review appellant\u2019s conviction of interstate transportation of obscene matter <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and possession of such matter with intent to disseminate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following indictment and a nonjury trial culminating in the findings of guilt, the trial judge imposed but suspended a one- to three-year sentence of imprisonment on the transportation count and levied a general $1,000 fine on the two counts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Our study of appellant\u2019s several contentions in light of the record and the evolving</p>\n<p id=\"b458-13\">judicial precedents<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> reveals no error. We accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b458-15\">The events foreshadowing this prosecution began at San Francisco International Airport one evening when a man identifying himself as Tom Moore<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> sought to ship a paper-wrapped box via United Airlines to appellant in Washington, D. C.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When an air freight clerk, Rex Feight, inquired as to the contents of the box, Moore first claimed he did not know;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> when Feight explained why the airline needed the information,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Moore paced about for \u201ca couple of minutes\u201d and suggested reluctantly that the box contained \u201csomething personal.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After further discussion, it was decided that the shipment would be described as \u201cpersonal effects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">His suspicion aroused by Moore\u2019s curious behavior,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Feight later turned the box over to his supervisor, Robert G. Miller, who opened it<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and found 30 unpackaged reels of 8-millimeter color movie film bearing titles unsubtly suggesting sex.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Miller held portions of two films up to the light and on one saw nude males, and on the other nude males and females, engaging in sexual acts. Miller then notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and an agent was sent to Miller\u2019s office with a projector. After viewing two more films, which depicted both heterosexual and homosexual activity, Miller repacked the films in the box and placed the box back in transit.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">On the next morning the box was shipped to Washington on a United Airlines flight, and on the day thereafter was delivered at the Potomac News Company in Southeast Washington, the address listed on the wrapping with appellant\u2019s name as consignee. Meanwhile, on the basis of information relayed by the FBI office in San Francisco,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> agents in Washington obtained a warrant authorizing a search at the Potomac News Company for the films.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The warrant was executed immediately, and the box of films was seized when an employee of the Potomac News Company removed it from above the ceiling tiles in appellant\u2019s office, where it had been concealed. Inside the box were 30 reels exhibiting 15 separate titles,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and the paper wrapping and material used for interior packing were recovered from a trash can in appellant\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">Five days later, the parties were convened, at the Government\u2019s request, for an adversary hearing in the District Court to determine whether the films <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>were obscene.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s counsel stood on his position that a judicial determination on obscenity should have preceded the seizure of the films; he offered no opposition to the Government\u2019s claim of obscenity, but merely \u201cacquiesced\u201d in the proceeding. Two of the films were viewed by District Judge Gasch, who adjourned the hearing upon conviction that a specific ruling was unnecessary.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> An indictment followed, charging appellant and others<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> with the violations in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Before trial, appellant moved to suppress the films on the grounds that the examination of the box by the United Airlines\u2019 freight supervisor violated the Fourth Amendment;<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> that the affidavit in support of the search warrant was insufficient to establish probable cause;<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and that seizure of the films without prior judicial ascertainment of their obscenity at an adversary hearing was unlawful.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The motion was heard by District Judge Pratt,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> who by written opinion denied it.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The charges against appellant\u2019s codefendants were dropped, appellant waived a jury trial, and the case proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-15\">At the trial, before Judge Pratt, the Government\u2019s evidence traced appellant\u2019s arrangements to obtain the films from a party in California,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> their delivery to United Airlines by Tom Moore, the investigation at the San Francisco airport and the seizure of the films at the Potomac News Company. Two of the films were shown to Judge Pratt; the parties stipulated, and an FBI agent who had viewed all of the films testified, that those two were typical of the others.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-16\">Appellant' introduced no evidence, but rested upon a motion for a judgment of acquittal for alleged insufficiency of the evidence to legally sustain conviction on either of the two counts of the indictment.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Judge Pratt rejected these contentions and, satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt as to the films\u2019 obscenity and appellant\u2019s offensive relationship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>to them,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> found him guilty on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">Appellant\u2019s bid for reversal of his conviction is four-fold. He argues that United Airlines\u2019 examination of the box in San Francisco and the FBI\u2019s seizure of the films in Washington were unlawful invasions of Fourth Amendment rights.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> He also asserts that the seizure was invalid for the additional reason that there was no prior adversary hearing culminating in a judicial deter-: mination that the films were in fact obscene.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Additionally, he claims that the statute underlying the charge of interstate transportation of obscene matter <footnotemark>30</footnotemark> is unconstitutional as applied to an adult receiving such matter for his own private use or for non-commercial exhibition.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> And he further contends that the statute outlawing possession of obscene matter with intent to disseminate<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> is unconstitutional as applied to possession by an adult with a view to non-commercial distribution to another consenting adult without obtrusive advertising or pandering.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> We consider, in that order, each of these arguments<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and, for reasons to be stated, we find none of them persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b461-14\">We first address appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment claims \u2014 challenges both to United Airlines\u2019 inspection of the box at the San Francisco airport and the search of Potomac News Company\u2019s premises in Washington. Appellant contends that the airline\u2019s freight supervisor was constitutionally forbidden to open the box or to examine the films enclosed therein.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Appellant further contends that the affidavit supporting the subsequently-issued search warrant was constitutionally deficient because it alleged facts communicated to and not personally known by the affiant.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-15\">A. <em>The San Francisco Search</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-16\">The Fourth Amendment lays its proscriptions<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> upon exertions of federal authority.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> By the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the same restraints are imposed upon exercises of state power.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> But, the Supreme Court holds, individual conduct devoid of governmental sanction is beyond the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>view of either Amendment.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Courts honor the distinction between governmental and individual action, as they must, in their dealings with searches by air carriers for contraband.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Where the search is made at the behest of or with the assistance of law enforcement officers, there must be probable cause, and in appropriate instances an authorizing warrant, if the search is to pass constitutional muster.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> But where the search is made on the carrier\u2019s own initiative for its own purposes, Fourth Amendment protections do not obtain for the reason that only the activities of individuals or nongovernmental entities are involved.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> So frequently and so emphatically have the courts enunciated and applied these principles<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> that, at least for the time being, they must be regarded as settled law.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">This body of doctrine would, of course, immunize United Airlines\u2019 inspection of the box from appellant\u2019s attack. Appellant points, however, to Rule 24 of Civil Aeronautics Board Regulation 96, which provides in part that \u201c[a] 11 shipments are subject to inspection by the carrier.\u201d <footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Appellant then asserts that Rule 24 was the assumed source of the airline\u2019s authority to open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>and examine the box,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> and that the rule purports to authorize warrantless searches without probable cause, in contravention of the Fourth Amendment. This argument might have force \u2014 by itself and without more \u2014 if Rule 24 had played the role which appellant ascribes to it,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> but it is evident to us that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\"> Rather, the airline\u2019s inspection privilege exists independently of Rule 24. It is rooted in the rule of the common law that common carriers have the right to decline shipment of packages proffered in circumstances indicating contents of a suspicious, indeed of a possibly dangerous, nature.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Justification for the carrier\u2019s refusal is to be found in the exigencies of safeguarding life and property,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> and undeniably the frustration of criminality is likewise a worthy carrier endeavor.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The imperatives of either objective may warrant inquiry by the carrier as to the contents of a parcel tendered for shipment; <footnotemark>51</footnotemark> they may suffice, too, to justify a reasonable inspection of the parcel to fulfill that purpose.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> And the carrier\u2019s interest in ascertaining the character of suspicious parcels intensifies when, as here, the carrier conceivably could find itself faced with a criminal prosecution \u2014 albeit one perhaps ill-founded \u2014 for unlawfully transporting obscene matter.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>In the case at bar, United Airlines unquestionably had an important interest in learning the contents of the box, which in the circumstances prevailing only an inspection could safeguard. It all began when the man self-styled \u201cTom Moore\u201d <footnotemark><em>54</em></footnotemark><em> </em>tendered the box for shipment, and equivocated on revealing its contents for purposes of the air bill which Rex Feight was trying to prepare. Outwardly reluctant to respond, the shipper first disclaimed any knowledge and, told by Feight that dangerous or illegal parcels could not be accepted and after \u201ca couple of minutes\u201d of nervous hesitation,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> he finally suggested that it was \u201csomething personal.\u201d It was Feight\u2019s understandable suspicion that the box contained contraband that prompted Supervisor Miller\u2019s decision to inspect it.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> When Miller opened the box, he saw 30 reels of unpackaged film bearing labels suggesting that they depicted explicit sexual activity, and eye-viewing two of the reels, it seemed that they did. That discovery urged fuller confirmation of their obscene character by projection, which Miller proceeded to obtain.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">So, a theme of reasonableness pervaded all that occurred at the San Francisco airport. The suspicious behavior of \u201cTom Moore\u201d and his refusal to identify the contents of the box with any degree of specificity warranted an inspection of the box before putting it aboard a plane. Once the box was opened, the unpackaged reels of film bearing sex-suggesting titles justified closer examination, ultimately by use of the projector, to see whether they were in fact contraband.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> In sum, each event in this succession prompted naturally the next \u2014 in the interest of protecting against the distinct probability of hazardous or illicit cargo. Neither the law nor common sense dictated a different course.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Indubitably, air freight carriers share the qualified right of package-inspection with other common carriers of goods.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Rule 24 of CAB Regulation 96 merely recognizes that air carriers possess that right.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> That bare recognition cannot be equated with a grant of governmental authority to search,<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> nor could it transform an inspection initiated and conducted solely by the carrier for its own protection into a search under the aegis of the Federal Government.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> We hold that the activities of the airline freight supervisor in this case- remained beyond the reach of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">It will be recalled, however, that United Airlines brought the FBI into the picture before the box departed the San Francisco airport. When Supervisor Miller discovered the presence and character of the films in the box, he notified the FBI. Shortly thereafter, an FBI agent appeared with a projector, with which Miller viewed two more films, and apparently the agent was still there when Miller repackaged the films for shipment to Washington. The remaining question is whether this sort of cooperation by the FBI converted the airlines\u2019 permissible inspection into an impermissible search of the box.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">We have held that the inspection which Miller conducted prior to notifying the FBI did not implicate the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> And we are unable to perceive in the subsequent events any new or different search after the FBI agent arrived. There is respectable authority holding that not even a reopening and reinspection of a package by federal officers, after the initial opening and inspection by airline personnel entirely on their own, constitutes a separate or additional search subject to Fourth Amendment requirements.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> We need not venture nearly so far, for much less than reopening and reinspection of the box and its contents was the activity of the FBI in the instant case.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">The record discloses that the FBI responded to Miller\u2019s call by sending an agent with whose projector and in whose presence Miller resumed his examination of the films. There is not the slightest hint in the record that the FBI or the agent did anything more. The situation thus falls well within the range of governmental collaboration in airline inspections which many decisions have held the Fourth Amendment tolerates.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> In our view, the FBI\u2019s limited role in the airport inspection of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>box in question did not activate the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">B. <em>The Washington Search</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Appellant\u2019s assault on the search of the premises of the Potomac News Company in Washington dwells exclusively on the affidavit underlying the warrant purportedly authorizing that search. The affidavit<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> was made by Special Agent James W. Garten of the FBI, in part on information and belief. It states unequivocally that the sought-after \u201cfilms depict a man and a female engaged in sexual intercourse, and various other sexual activities by males and males and males and females,\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> but without an averment that the affiant ever personally saw an exhibition of the films or ever personally talked with anyone who did. Asserting that so much of the affidavit was based upon hearsay allegations of obscenity, appellant argues ' that the affidavit was insufficient to furnish probable cause for issuance of the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">A finding of probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant is not foreclosed merely by the circumstance that the information upon which it issues is hearsay as to the affiant rather than facts personally known by him.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> What is required is \u201ca substantial basis for crediting the hearsay\u201d <footnotemark>71</footnotemark> \u2014a crediting by the magistrate to whom the application for the warrant is made.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> The affidavit must divulge \u201csome of the underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded\u201d that a crime had been committed \u201cand some of the underlying circumstances from which the [affiant] concluded that the informant . . . was \u2018credible\u2019 or his information \u2018reliable.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> It must support an \u201cinference that the informer was generally trustworthy and that he made his charge against [the suspect] on the basis of information obtained in a reliable way.\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> When these demands are met and a magistrate finds probable cause for a warrant, his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>determination is entitled to great deference by the courts.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">We do not doubt the applicability of these principles when the warrant sought would authorize a search for and a seizure of allegedly obscene material as evidence.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> Nor do we doubt that the preconditions which these principles impose were satisfied here. The affidavit acknowledged the affiant\u2019s receipt of the information encouched in the affidavit from the San Francisco office of the FBI.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> It chronicles the events at the-San Francisco airport culminating in Supervisor Miller\u2019s discovery of the films in the box;<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> it describes the films in terms plainly connoting obscenity;<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> it then traces the box\u2019 journey from the airport to the premises occupied by the Potomac News Company.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> Clearly then, the affidavit supplied circumstances which might underpin a reasonable belief that federal and District of Columbia obscenity laws had been violated. We think, too, as did the District Court, that the magistrate \u2014here a United States Commissioner\u2014 could reasonably conclude that Supervisor Miller, by virtue of his responsible position with United Airlines, coupled with the complete absence of any apparent motive to falsify, was a reliable informant who came by his information in a thoroughly reliable way.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> We hold, upon a reading of the affidavit \u201cin a commonsense and realistic fashion,\u201d<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> that the fact that some of the affidavit\u2019s allegations were hearsay is unobjectionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Appellant also contends that the affidavit was deficient as a means of conveying to the Commissioner enough information to enable a suitable determination respecting the alleged obscenity of the films. The general principles measuring claims of this character are quite clear. \u201cA seizure reasonable as to one type of material in one setting may be unreasonable in a different setting or with respect to another kind of material.\u201d <footnotemark>83</footnotemark> Where the material to be seized lies within the ambit of the First Amendment, the procedure must retain a \u201cnecessary sensitivity to freedom of expression; \u201d <footnotemark>84</footnotemark> it must \u201cassure nonobscene material the protection to which it is entitled\u201d;<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> and so the affidavit must afford the magistrate an opportunity to \u201cfocus searchingly on the question of obscenity.\u201d <footnotemark>86</footnotemark> In our view, these standards were met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>The question before the Commissioner was whether, on the allegations of the affidavit, there was probable cause for believing that a violation of obscenity laws had occurred. And \u201c[i]n dealing with probable cause, . we deal with probabilities\u201d ; <footnotemark>87</footnotemark> \u201cthe term \u2018probable cause\u2019 means less than evidence which would justify condemnation.\u201d <footnotemark>88</footnotemark> The affidavit stated that the \u201cfilms depict\u201d not only \u201ca man and a female engaged in sexual intercourse\u201d but also \u201cvarious other sexual activities by males and males\u201d as well as by \u201cmales and females.\u201d <footnotemark>89</footnotemark> We have no difficulty whatever in accepting that information as an adequate foundation for a belief by the Commissioner, if persuaded to so believe, that the films might well be adjudged obscene.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The allegations made by the affidavit satisfied the Commissioner that there was probable cause to believe that the films were being concealed at the Potomac News Company.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> The District Court upheld that finding,<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> and we feel obliged to do the same. According the Commissioner\u2019s determination of probable cause the \u201cgreat deference\u201d it is due,<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> and perceiving a \u201csubstantial basis for him to conclude\u201d as he did,<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> we hold that the search of the Potomac News Company was completely authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b468-13\">We now turn our attention to appellant\u2019s argument that use of the films as evidence at his trial was impermissible because no adversary hearing leading to an affirmative determination of obscenity was held before they were seized at the Potomac News Company. Heller v. New York,<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> in which the Supreme Court considered the need for adversary hearings preceding seizures of allegedly obscene materials, furnishes welcome guidance in the resolution of that contention.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> Recognizing fully that in some situations a pre-seizure adversary hearing is required, we reject the claim that such a proceeding became necessary in this case.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>At the core of the question is the interest in minimizing any interference with access to matter potentially protected by the First Amendment unless and until its obscenity has been judicially established.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> A seizure of such matter may operate as a prior restraint, and \u201c[a]ny system of prior restraints of expression comes [into court] bearing a heavy presumption against its'constitutional validity.\u201d <footnotemark>99</footnotemark> And \u201cbecause only a judicial determination in an adversary proceeding ensures the necessary sensitivity to freedom of expression, only a procedure requiring a judicial determination suffices to impose a valid final restraint.\u201d <footnotemark>100</footnotemark> So, where a large quantity of expressive matter is seized solely for the purpose of destruction, a prior judicial determination of obscenity in an adversary proceeding is essential.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> So also, where the matter is seized with a view to absolute suppression \u2014 a final restraint \u2014 a judicial determination must be made \u201cpromptly so that administrative delay does not in itself become a form of censorship.\u201d <footnotemark>102</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">It is now clear, too, that where allegedly obscene matter is seized pursuant to a search warrant for evidentiary use in a criminal prosecution, there is no absolute right to a prior adversary hearing.<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> In <em>Heller, </em>the Court pointed out that \u201cseizing films to destroy them or to block their distribution or exhibition is a very different matter from seizing a single copy of a film for the <em>bona fide </em>purpose of preserving it as evidence in a criminal proceeding. . \u201d<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> Such a temporary restraint does not itself \u201cbecome a form of censorship,\u201d <footnotemark>105</footnotemark> and the Fourth Amendment warrant procedure serves in large part to protect the First Amendment concerns which underlie the adversary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>hearing sometimes required.<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> Said the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-4\">If such a seizure is pursuant to a warrant, issued after a determination of probable cause by a neutral magistrate, and, following the seizure, a prompt judicial determination of the obscenity issue in an adversary proceeding is available at the request of any interested party the seizure is constitutionally permissible. In addition, on a showing to the trial court that other copies of the film are not available to the exhibitor, the court should permit the seized film to be copied so that showing can be continued pending a judicial determination of the obscenity issue in an adversary proceeding. Otherwise, the film must be returned.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">In the case at bar, a United States Commissioner found probable cause to believe that the suspect films were obscene, and issued a search warrant prior to their seizure.<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> Promptly after execution of the warrant, the Government arranged a hearing before a district judge, at which appellant was afforded the opportunity to oppose the Government\u2019s obscenity claim.<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> That appellant made no effort to resist the claim, but instead disdained the proceeding,<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> in no way impaired its constitutional sufficiency.<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> We hold that the films were not barred from evidentiary use at appellant\u2019s trial merely because the proceeding did not occur sooner.<footnotemark>112</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-13\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b470-14\">We now reach appellant\u2019s contention that the statute upon which the charge of interstate transportation of obscene rtiatter is based is unconstitutional as applied to a shipment of such matter to an adult solely for private, noncommercial exhibition. The statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1462, in relevant part proscribes the knowing use of a common carrier for carriage of any obscene motion-picture films in interstate commerce, and the knowing receipt from a common carrier of any obscene films so transported.<footnotemark>113</footnotemark> The uncontradicted evidence at appellant\u2019s trial disclosed that he ordered two copies of each of 15 clearly obscene films, intending to keep one set of copies for his own personal use and to give the other set to his attorney.<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> The germinal force in appellant\u2019s argument is the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Stanley v. Georgia<footnotemark>115</footnotemark> that the First Amendment protects from governmental interference the mere possession of obscene material in the privacy of one\u2019s own home. From that premise appellant reasons that the right to possess such material includes the right to obtain and receive it from a third party, and that transportation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>materials to enable personal possession and private use enjoys the same constitutional protection. Judge Pratt disagreed, and we are satisfied that appellant\u2019s thesis cannot be validated by reliance on <em>Stanley, </em>but indeed is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s more recent decision in United States v. Orito,<footnotemark>116</footnotemark> which upholds the constitutionality of Section 1462 in a similar application.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Like appellant, Orito was indicted for a violation of Section 1462 stemming from the shipment of obscene films via air common carrier from San Francisco to Milwaukee. A district court had granted Orito\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that Section 1462 was unconstitutionally overbroad because it reached \u201cnonpublic\u201d as well as \u201cpublic\u201d transportation of obscene matter,<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> but the Supreme Court reversed. Uncertain as to whether the district court deemed the shipment constitutionally protected because the transportation was solely for private use, or rather because, irrespective of intended use, \u201cprivate\u201d or \u201cnonpublic\u201d transportation in itself involves no risk of exposure to children or unwilling adults, the Supreme Court found that neither rationale would support the district court\u2019s action.<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> Since <em>Orito </em>bears importantly on the constitutional position appellant advances elsewhere as well as here,<footnotemark>119</footnotemark> we may profitably pursue a somewhat deeper analysis of the Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The Court began by pointing out that it has not accepted the view that the right to possess obscene matter in the privacy of one\u2019s own home encompasses correlatively a right to receive, transport or distribute it.<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> The principle underlying <em>Stanley, </em>the Court said, is that the Constitution extends special safeguards to the privacy \u00f3f the home, in common with a few other special societal institutions.<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> On the other hand, shipment of obscene material by common carrier in interstate commerce does not enjoy the same solicitude accorded possession of such material in the home<footnotemark>122</footnotemark> and, the Court added, it has consistently declined to accord constitutional protection to obscene materials outside the home.<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> Summarizing the relevant considerations, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-13\">Given (a) that obscene material is not protected under the First Amendment, . . . (b) that the government has a legitimate interest in protecting the public commercial environment by preventing such materials from entering the stream of commerce, . . . and (c) that no constitutionally protected privacy is involved, ... we cannot say that the Constitution forbids comprehensive federal regulation of interstate transportation of obscene material merely because such transport may be by private carriage, or because material is intended for the private use of the transporter.<footnotemark>124</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-16\">That conclusion follows, the Court held, because even if the carriage is \u201cnonpublic,\u201d Congress could \u201cregulate on the basis of the natural tendency of material in the home being kept private and the contrary tendency once material leaves that area, regardless of a transporter\u2019s professed intent.\u201d<footnotemark>125</footnotemark> And \u201cCongress could reasonably determine such regulation to be necessary to effect permissible federal control of interstate commerce in obscene materials, based as that regulation is on a legislatively determined'risk of exposure to juveniles or to the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>and the harm that exposure would cause.\u201d <footnotemark>126</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Thus, in <em>Orito, </em>the Supreme Court has unequivocally refused to invalidate Section 1462 on the basis urged here by appellant. With <em>Orito </em>controlling, we reject his claim that criminal penalties may not be imposed on an adult who knowingly receives, though for personal use, obscene films from an interstate shipment by a common carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">As in his challenge to his conviction for violating Section 1462, appellant relies. on Stanley v. Georgia<footnotemark>127</footnotemark> to argue that the prohibition in D.C.Code \u00a7 22-2001 against possession of obscene material with the intent to distribute<footnotemark>128</footnotemark> could not constitutionally be extended to the films in question. Judge Pratt concluded that the undisputed evidence that appellant intended to give a copy of each of the 15 different films to his attorney<footnotemark>129</footnotemark> brought appellant into fatal collision with the statute. Contending that that transaction \u2014 a noncommercial private transfer between consenting adults \u2014 would derive First Amendment protection from <em>Stanley, </em>appellant urges us to reverse his conviction under Section 22-2001 on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">The Supreme Court has not had occasion to evaluate the constitutionality of any possession statute similar to the one now under scrutiny.<footnotemark>130</footnotemark> We think, however, the Court\u2019s rejection of the <em>Stanley </em>argument when made in opposition to statutory prohibitions on importation,<footnotemark>131</footnotemark> mailing,<footnotemark>132</footnotemark> and interstate transportation of obscene material<footnotemark>133</footnotemark> has set the boundaries beyond which <em>Stanley </em>will not be extended. In United States v. Orito,<footnotemark>134</footnotemark> discussed in the preceding section, the Court explicitly held that the right to privately possess obscene material in the home does not embrace a \u201ccorrelative right to receive it, transport it or <em>distribute </em>it.\u201d<footnotemark>135</footnotemark> On the same day the Court, in United States v. Twelve 200-Ft. Reels,<footnotemark>136</footnotemark> held that a federal statute forbidding the importation of obscene material into the United States<footnotemark>137</footnotemark> was constitutionally applicable to an individual who brought such matter in for private personal use only.<footnotemark>138</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he protected right to possess obscene material in the privacy of one\u2019s home,\u201d said the Court, \u201cdoes not give rise to a correlative right to have someone sell or <em>give </em>it to others.\u201d<footnotemark>139</footnotemark> And two years earlier in United States v. Reidel,<footnotemark>140</footnotemark> the Court held that a statute prohibiting the knowing use of the mails for the delivery of obscene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>matter<footnotemark>141</footnotemark> was validly applicable to the distribution of such matter to willing adult recipients.<footnotemark>142</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Appellant\u2019s approach to the problem at hand attributes to <em>Stanley </em>a sweep far beyond its precise holding. The pervasive theme of <em>Stanley </em>is constitutional protection of a mere private possession and use of obscene material which the possessor undertakes to maintain within the confines of his home. As explained at one point by the Court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">These are the rights that appellant is asserting in the case before us. He is asserting the right to read or observe what he pleases \u2014 the right to satisfy his intellectual and emotional needs in the privacy of his own home. He is asserting the right to be free from state inquiry into the contents of his library .... Whatever may be the justifications for other statutes regulating obscenity, we do not think they reach into the privacy of one\u2019s own home. If the First Amendment means anything, it means that a State has no business telling a man, sitting alone in his own house, what books he may read or what films he may watch. Our whole constitutional heritage rebels at the thought of giving government the power to control men\u2019s minds.<footnotemark>143</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">As, two years after <em>Stanley, </em>the Court was to point out, \u201c[t]he focus of this language was on freedom of mind and thought and on the privacy of one\u2019s home. . . . The personal constitutional rights of those like Stanley to possess and read obscenity in their homes and their freedom of mind and thought do not depend on whether the materials are obscene or whether obscenity is constitutionally protected. Their rights to have and view that material in private are independently saved by the Constitution.\u201d <footnotemark>144</footnotemark> And as, still later, the Court was to observe, \u201c[i]t is hardly necessary to catalog the myriad activities that may lawfully be conducted within the privacy and confines of the home, but may be prohibited in public.\u201d <footnotemark>145</footnotemark> Personal use of communicative material strictly within the privacy of the home is one thing; possession of the material with intent to disseminate to another is something else. It is clear that possession of obscene matter with a view to commercial dissemination may be outlawed.<footnotemark>146</footnotemark> We think a fair reading of the cases since the <em>Stanley </em>decision makes it equally clear that that decision does not immunize the possession simply because the intent to disseminate is not commercially oriented or motivated.<footnotemark>147</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-18\">These considerations appear to settle the matter insofar as appellant\u2019s attack on Section 22-2001 is concerned. The conduct which the statute forbids is not the mere possession of obscene material, but possession with an intent to disseminate it.<footnotemark>148</footnotemark> We perceive nothing unreasonable or uncommon in a congressional endeavor to deter the distribution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>of obscene items by punishing possession with an intent to distribute.<footnotemark>149</footnotemark> And if, as the Supreme Court has unequivocally declared, the dissemination of obscene matter \u2014 whether public or private, or commercial or noncommercial \u2014is not entitled to constitutional protection,<footnotemark>150</footnotemark> there is no reason to expect a different fate for possession with intent to disseminate. We conclude that appellant enjoyed no immunity from prosecution for a violation of Section 22-2001 by virtue of the fact that the only dissemination planned was a gift of copies of the films to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">The judgment of conviction is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT OF SEARCH WARRA\u00d1T</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">The undersigned affiant, being duly sworn on oath, states that the following facts are true to the best of his knowledge and belief:</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">(1) The affiant is a Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). That in said capacity he received information from the San Francisco Office of the FBI on May 21, 1969 regarding the shipment of 30 rolls of obscene film from San Francisco, California via United Airlines for delivery to Denis Pryba, Potomac News, 506 8th Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. (WDC).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">(2) Robert Miller, Supervisor, United Airlines (UAL), San Francisco International Airport, San Francisco, California, advised Special Agents of the FBI that on May 20, 1969 an individual identifying himself as Tom Moore, 5783 Oak Street, San Francisco, California, delivered a package to UAL for delivery to Denis Pryba, Potomac News, 506 8th Street, S.E., WDC.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-14\">(3) The above package is wrapped in brown paper and measures 4 inches by 10 inches by 13 inches and is traveling under Air Number 016-SF 5087250. It weighs 7 pounds and terms of delivery are collect. This description was furnished by Robert Miller, Supervisor of UAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-15\">The individual delivering this package to UAL was extremely nervous and upon questioning as to the contents attempted to avoid answering and finally stated it contained personal items. The return address is fictitious.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-16\">(4) Based upon the peculiar circumstances surrounding receipt of the shipment, Robert Miller, UAL, caused the shipment to be opened and personally observed 30 rolls of hard core pornography. The opening of the package by UAL is permitted by CAB Tariff regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-17\">(5) The above films depict a man and a female engaged in sexual intercourse, and various other sexual activities by males and males and males and females.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-18\">(6) The above package traveled via United Airlines flight 50 on May 21, 1969 and arrived at Dulles Airport during p. m. of May 21, 1969. It was turned over by UAL at Dulles Airport to Pollard Delivery Service on May 22, 1969 for delivery to Denis Pryba, at Potomac News Company, 506 8th Street, S.E.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>(7) Fred Murphy, a driver for Pollard Delivery Service, Washington National Airport, was given the above package to deliver on May 22, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">(8) Special Agents of the FBI, observed the above package being delivered by Fred Murphy to the Potomac News Company, 507 8th Street, S.E., WDC, at 3:30 p. m. Investigation determined that the Potomac News Company is located at 507 8th Street, S.E., WDC, rather than at 506 8th Street, S.E.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">(9) Fred Murphy, who made the delivery was interviewed by FBI Agents after he was observed leaving the premises of 506 8th Street, S.E. on May 22, 1969 and he admitted that he had delivered the package described above to the above place of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">(10) The premises of 507 8th Street, S.E., WDC, is a two-story creme color brick building having one door on street level at the front of the building on 8th Street, S.E. and one door and a loading platform at the rear of the building. The building is approximately 100 feet by 50 feet. It is an attached building with the building on the north side of it being numbered 505 and the building on the south of it being numbered 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Wherefore, the affiant states that he has probable cause to believe, and does believe, that the above described package is presently on the premises of 507 8th Street, S.E. in violation of Title 18 U.S. Code, Section 1462. The affiant therefore requests the issuance of a search warrant for the entire premises which is numbered 507 8th Street, S.E. and which occupies the numbers between 505 and 515 8th Street, S.E. in attempt to locate the above described package and also to search for any company records, documents relative to this shipment and the receipt of it at that company.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">/s/ James W.

Previously, on a trip to California, appellant had viewed three films in the seller\u2019s private collection, but had declined to take any of the films. Three weeks later in Washington, expressing the feeling that \u201cit would be all right to have\u201d the films, appellant ordered two copies of each of 15 titles, one copy for himself and the other for his attorney. It seems clear that, through error of the seller,\" three copies of one reel but only one copy of another reel were shipped. Appellant declined the seller\u2019s offer to supply additional copies, informing the seller that he wanted the films for his private collection and not for resale. There was un-contradicted testimony that the Potomac News Company does not deal in hard-core pornography.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b460-18\">. Neither in the District Court nor here has appellant disputed the Government\u2019s claim that the films are obscene. The two films shown Judge Pratt at trial, and earlier shown Judge Gasch, were described for the record, and the description puts their obscenity beyond peradventure of a doubt. See Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 24-26, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973). Counsel for the adversaries concurred in the record description, as did Judge Pratt, and it was established both by stipulation and testimony that the two films shown were typical of the others. Judge Pratt expressly found that \u201cthe two films stipulated to be typical of the group are something more than mere obscenity, they are hard-core pornography,\u201d and the description fully sustains that conclusion. With obscenity proven so solidly and not at all in issue, we can spare our readers further descriptive details.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b460-19\">.

We are mindful of appellant\u2019s contention that even if United Airlines\u2019 inspection of the box was proper, FBI agents in San Francisco should have applied there for a warrant as soon as the character of the films became known. The argument, as we understand it, is that that course of action would have enabled the agents to exhibit the films to a magistrate for a determination on the propriety of seizure, and might thereby have aborted their interstate shipment in violation of law. Like Judge Pratt, we believe a warrantless seizure of the films for a judicial showing to suxtport the issuance of a warrant for their seizure is a procedure fraught with constitutional difficulties. See United States v. Pryba, <em>supra </em>note 23, 312 F.Supp. at 370-371. Moreover, the FBI I&gt;rojeeted its investigation beyond tbe events transpiring at the San Francisco airport, and only after the box had been returned to transit did the FBI learn that the sender\u2019s address was fictitious. \u201cLaw enforcement officers are under no constitutional duty to call a halt to a criminal investigation the moment they have the minimum evidence to establish probable cause, a quantum of evidence which may fall far short of the amount necessary to sui&gt;port a criminal conviction.\u201d Hoffa v.
