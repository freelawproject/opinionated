Nodland, seek review of an order of the Atomic Energy Commission denying their petition to intervene in a proceeding before the Commission. The proceeding grew out of the application of Northern States Power Company for a Facility Operating License for its Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant, located in Minnesota. Pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2011 et seq.), facility construction permits had been issued by the Commission to Northern States in June, 1968. Unit 1 of the facility has been constructed and is ready for commercial operation, and Unit 2 is expected to be ready for such operation this year.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b489-15\">The presently involved license proceeding commenced with the Commission\u2019s publication of October 11, 1972, giving notice that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-16\">any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding may file a petition for leave to intervene with respect to the issuance of the facility operating licenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-17\">The Commission required that the petition conform with the provisions of its procedural rule, 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.714(a), which, in pertinent part, read as follows when the petition was filed in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE1\">(a) Any person whose interest may be affected by a proceeding and who desires to participate as a party shall file a written petition under oath or affirmation for leave to intervene. Any such petition shall be accompanied by a supporting affidavit identifying the specific aspect or aspects of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which he wishes to intervene and setting forth with particularity both the facts pertaining to his interest and the basis for his contentions with regard to each aspect on which he desires to intervene. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-18\">The petition, filed November 10, 1972, represents that it is on behalf of BPI-, Nodland individually, the Citizens of Minneapolis-St. Paul and Northfield, Minnesota, and the public generally. It asserts that the specifically named members of BPI and Nodland reside in the zone that would be gravely contaminated by a major accident at the nuclear power plant. The right to intervene is claimed under the following terms of section 189(a) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-19\">In any proceeding under this chapter, for the granting ... of any li<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>cense . . . the Commission shall grant a hearing upon the request of any person whose interest may be affected by the proceeding, and shall admit any such person as a party to such proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">An Atomic Safety and Licensing Board of the Commission denied the petition, stating that it failed in important respects to comply with 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.-714(a), <em>supra,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">in that it does not identify any contentions, or the basis therefor, related to the facility . . . and it is not accompanied by the required supporting affidavits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Leave was granted, however, to petitioners to file within 10 days,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-9\">supporting affidavits identifying the specific aspect or aspects of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which intervention is desired and setting forth with particularity the basis for their contentions with regard to each aspect on which intervention is desired, as required by Section 2.714.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">On appeal to the Atomic Energy Safety and Licensing Appeal Board the denial was affirmed. The Board held, however, that petitioners did set forth a sufficient foundation to bring them within the category of persons \u201cwhose interest may be affected\u201d by grant of the operating license.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Board also discussed the absence of verification of this interest by affidavits. It deemed it unnecessary to consider remanding to enable this defect to be cured, for it held the petition in any event inadequate under 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.714(a) for failure to identify the specific aspect or aspects of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which intervention was sought and to set forth with particularity the basis of petitioners\u2019 contentions with regard thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-14\">Thereafter the Commission, <em>sua sponte, </em>issued a memorandum agreeing with the Appeals Board. It held that the requirements of 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.714(a) were valid, notwithstanding the provisions of section 189(a) of the Act. The Commission relied upon its broad rule-making authority conferred by section 161 (p) of the Act, (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(p)), authorizing the Commission to,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-15\">make, promulgate, issue, rescind, and amend such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-16\">Petitioners\u2019 appeal is from this final decision of the Commission. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-17\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b490-18\">In this court petitioners state that the Appeals Board, whose position was upheld by the Commission, correctly recognized that the principal issue is whether,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-19\">the Commission exceeded its statutory authority in requiring in Section 2.-714(a) that [petitioners] both identify the specific aspect or aspects of the subject matter of the proceedings as to which intervention is sought and set forth with particularity the basis for their contentions with regard thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-20\">Relying upon the terms of section 189(a) of the Act, petitioners contend that the requirements of 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.-714(a) of more than a showing of interest which may be affected are illegal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Our decision in Easton Utilities Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>mission v. AEC, 137 U.S.App.D.C. 359, 424 F.2d 847 (1970) (en banc), illustrates that this reading of section\u2019 189(a) gives way to some degree to the rule-making authority of the Commission. There we said that \u201cnothing whatsoever in the record ... in any way challenges the reasonableness, the necessity for, or the propriety of [10 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.714].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 851. The question decided, however, was limited to the validity of that portion of 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.714 which governs the time within which a petition to intervene should be filed. Accordingly, we do not rely heavily upon <em>Easton </em>in the present case. Of greater significance is Cities of Statesville v. AEC, 142 U.S.App.D.C. 272, 441 F.2d 962 (1969) (en banc), where intervention was denied on the ground in part that the Commission failed to see \u201chow [petitioner] was prejudiced in any way\u201d by such denial, since identical jurisdictional contentions had been asserted by others. This court agreed. We wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">This court has held that when a petitioner can show that it possesses a substantial interest in the outcome of the proceedings it has a right to intervene. However, an agency \u201cshould be accorded broad discretion in establishing and applying rules for * * <em>* </em>public participation, including * * * how many are reasonably required to give the [agency] the assistance it needs in vindicating the public interest.\u201d Office of Communication of United Church of Christ v. FCC, 123 U.S.App.D.C. 328, 339-340, 359 F.2d 994, 1005-1006 (1966).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">441 F.2d at 977. This decision, more clearly than <em>Easton, </em>supports Commission authority to depart from petitioners\u2019 reading of the language of section 189(a) of the Act. <em>Easton </em>and <em>Cities of Statesville </em>demonstrate that this court has not deemed section 189(a) to be the last word on the subject of intervention. Other factors are indeed relevant to Commission control of proceedings necessary to carry out the purposes of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">We turn also to the legislative history of the Act for possible help. During its consideration by the Senate, Senator Hickenlooper, when proposing an amendment which eventuated in section 189(a) as it now reads, stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-11\">The purpose of this revision is to specify clearly the circumstances in which hearings are to be held.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">100 Cohg.Rec. 10,686 (1954). During the further progress of the floor discussion, however, Senator Humphrey, apparently unaware of the Hickenlooper amendment, offered an amendment which read in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-13\">In any proceeding before it, the Commission, in accordance with such rules and regulations as it may prescribe, may admit as a party any interested State, State commission, municipality, public or co-operative electric system, or any competitor of a party to such proceeding, or any other person whose participation may be in the public interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-14\">100 Cong.Rec. 11,391 (1954). On the same day Senator Humphrey withdrew his amendment. In doing so he referred to Senator Hickenlooper\u2019s amendment as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-15\">. the part I have stricken appears to be already covered in the amendment, that was previously adopted and in the body of the bill under the chapter known as \u201cJudicial Review and Administrative Procedure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-16\">100 Cong.Rec. 11,404 (1954). Arguably Senator Humphrey was of the view that section 189(a), as enacted after the Hickenlooper amendment, did not prevent the Commission from exercising authority to adopt regulations governing the intervention of interested parties in any Commission proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-17\">Perhaps of more importance in arriving at the legislative intention is information supplied by the Commission to the congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy after the original text of 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.714, without the support<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>ing affidavit requirement, was adopted in 1962. See 27 Fed.Reg. 377, 384 (1962).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Joint Committee is composed of members of both Senate and House of Representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The report of the Second Regulatory Review Panel, appointed by the Commission in 1965 to study and recommend improved procedures for the handling of nuclear reactor licensing cases, was of the opinion that the Commission\u2019s rules should be amended</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">to make it clear that the statement of contentions required of petitioners for leave to intervene must be reasonably specific. * * -X- * * -X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">While the term \u201ccontentions\u201d is not defined in the Commission\u2019s Rules of Practice, . . . the statement of contentions is analogous to good, pleadings in civil cases, i. e., the allegations must be reasonably specific.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-9\">The requirement of reasonable specificity should be strictly enforced to avoid nuisance interventions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aqp-dedup-0\">Licensing and Regulation of Nuclear Reactors, Hearings before the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, 90th Cong. 1st Sess., pt. 1, at 471 (1967). As a result of these recommendations the Commission amended 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.714(a) to require that a petitioner\u2019s contentions be set forth in \u201creasonably specific detail.\u201d See 33 Fed.Reg. 8588 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">In 1971 Commissioner James T. Ra-mey stated during testimony before a subcommittee of the Joint Committee, considering new atomic energy legislation, that the Commission\u2019s \u201crules of practice already provide that a petition to intervene must set forth the petitioner\u2019s contentions in reasonably specific detail.\u201d AEC Licensing Procedure and Related Legislation, Hearings before the Subeom. on Legis. of the Joint Comm. on Atomic Energy, 92d Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1 at 49 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-13\">Again in 1973 while reviewing the Commission\u2019s reorganized regulatory program, Commissioner William O. Doub informed the Joint Committee that, \u201c[t]he individual [who wishes to intervene] has to state his specific contentions, what he is concerned about, why he wants to appear in the proceeding as a party.\u201d AEC Authorizing Legislation Fiscal Year 1974, Hearings before the Joint Comm. on Atomic Energy, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 2 at 780 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-14\">We think these statements support the view that the requirement of specification-of contentions contained in 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.714(a) of the Commission\u2019s regulations is not inconsistent with the intention of Congress gathered from section 189(a), when read with the authority of the Commission with respect to regulations granted by section 161 (p) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-15\">IY</p>\n<p id=\"b492-16\"> Section 189(a) does not in literal terms state that any person whose interest is affected may intervene; it states that such a party shall be granted a hearing upon request and the Commission shall admit any such person as a party to the proceeding. The statute does not confer the automatic right of intervention upon anyone. Under its procedural regulations it is not unreasonable for the Commission to require that the prospective intervenor first specify the basis for his request for a hearing. Senator Hickenlooper\u2019s description of the purpose of his amendment, to which we have referred, is not inconsistent with such a requirement. Petitioners themselves quite appropriately disclaim contending that \u201can intervenor need never assert the issues he be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>lieves should be resolved by the Commission, or that there should be a hearing without notice of what the issues will be.\u201d They contend rather that the interested person need not articulate the issues until after having been admitted as a party to the proceeding, with consequent access to discovery. Section 189(a) does not seem to the court so to provide. The court considers it amenable to a construction which, when considered with section 161 (p) of the Act and the nature of intervention, permits the Commission to require the party to inform it of the issues on which he wishes to be heard, or, as held by the Commission, the contentions to be advanced and the basis therefor. Section 189(a) does not necessarily preclude a regulation that the application therefor give content to the subject matter of the hearing sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Section 2.714(a) of 10 Q,F.R. also provides that a supporting affidavit accompany the petition. To require the person \u201cwhose interest may be affected\u201d to support the factual basis for such interest with an affidavit is clearly reasonable. A problem might arise, however, with the requirement of a supporting affidavit \u201cidentifying the specific aspect or aspects\u201d as to which intervention is sought and \u201cthe basis for [the party\u2019s] contentions with regard to each aspect. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These may be matters of a contentious or argumentative character which are not ordinarily required to be under oath in legal proceedings. The problem thus referred to need not now be resolved, however, for it does not affect our judgment that intervention was properly denied to petitioners. The actual basis for the denial was failure on their part to comply with those substantive provisions of 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.714(a), which call for identification of the specific aspect or aspects of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which intervention is sought and the particularization of the basis for the contentions with regard thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">In conclusion, it seems clear that the congressional classification of parties \u201cwhose interest may be affected\u201d is not narrowly interpreted by the Commission. Those who, like petitioners, come within this interpretation are in the class entitled to seek a hearing and to become a party to the proceeding. The Commission\u2019s regulations, however, prescribe that they must be specific as to the focus of the desired hearing. In this manner the Commission narrows those within the larger class to those entitled to participate as intervenors, and thus to assist the Commission in the resolution of the issues to be decided. In doing so we do not think the agency transgresses its legislative charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-11\">. Tlie Board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-12\">Without attempting to lay down any inflexible standard, we deem distances of 30 to 40 miles from this reactor site as not being so great as to require the conclusion that residents of Minneapolis and North-field are geographically outside the zone of interests protected by the Atomic Energy Act. <em>Cf. </em>Association of Data Processing Service Organization v.
