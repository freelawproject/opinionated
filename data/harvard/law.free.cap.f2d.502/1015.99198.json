BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"aym-dedup-0\">Proving that the odds are not always in favor of the track, this and the companion case<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> involved not one, but two, Chapter X bankruptcy reorganization proceedings of Seminole Downs Race Track. In pedestrian, not equestrian, terms the question is whether the 1955 lease contained, as the 1967 Florida UCC requires a written \u201cconsent\u201d or \u201cdisclaimer\u201d by the landlord to the fixtures security reserved for the 1970 installation by Westinghouse of the people-moving facilities of an escalator and elevator in the race track clubhouse-grandstand. Since our negative answer means <em>that </em>vis-a-vis landlord, Westinghouse cannot remove the facilities, the question then comes down further to the value, if any, which the supplier-Westinghouse has in the conceded perfected security interest. The Referee in Bankruptcy, as special master, found the value of a non-removable people-moving apparatus to be zero largely since the debt- or\u2019s leasehold of the whole track enterprise had been, to everyone\u2019s chagrin but acquiescence, a like zero.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-16\">On principle the Master and the District Judge were right. On principal we hold a remand is in order to establish the \u201cpositive\u201d dollar value of a \u201cnegative\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-17\">It all came about this way. On the Trustee\u2019s concession that Westinghouse had a perfected security interest,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the special master set the case down to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>determine the value of the admitted secured interest. See Bankruptcy Act \u00a7 197; 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">\n<em>Consent Thee Not To Desecration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">Florida\u2019s UCC differs from that of most states with respect to security interests in fixtures.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By the 1967 amendments to \u00a7 679.313(2) (a) <footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, Florida requires as the price for perfection of a fixtures security interest against a person with an interest in the real estate that such person in writing consent (or disclaim) to a security interest in any fixtures to be affixed to the realty \u2014whether the security ' interest \u201cattaches\u201d to the fixture before or after installation. The official 1962 UCC \u00a7 9-313 does not require such consent if the interest \u201cattaches\u201d <em>before </em>installation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>Westinghouse never obtained direct, express consent to the security interest from the Debtor\u2019s landlord and, apparently upon the Trustee\u2019s urging or otherwise, the landlord now expressly refuses to consent to it \u2014 or to permit the removal of either fixture.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">Thus to satisfy \u00a7 679.313(2) (a) Westinghouse has to go back to the 1955 lease with the Debtor\u2019s assignor. The argument starts with the fact that the lease contemplated that the premises would be used for a race track for which lessors would have a net profit percentage rental and which expressly permitted virtually unlimited alterations and additions to the premises.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Additionally the lease on termination permitted the removal of fixtures and personal property.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">To all of this the Trustee counters with other provisions which, requiring lessee to indemnify against liens, impliedly negatived any consensual agreement to permit creation by lessee of security interests superior to the landlord <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and very carefully restricted the fixture removal privilege (see If 3D, note 9, <em>supra).</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">Stressing heavily the 1955 lease-recognized privilege of extensive alterations and additions to the premises (see f[ 3A, note 8, <em>supra) </em>and the right of fixture removal (see f[ 3D, note 9, <em>supra) </em>Westinghouse pressed what the parties describe as \u201cold\u201d mechanics lien cases from which to derive the 1967 \u201cconsent\u201d to a 1970 security interest. See, e. g., Taylor v. Ferroman Properties, Inc., 1931, 103 Fla. 960, 139 So. 149, 150. We agree with both the Referee in Bankruptcy as special master and the District Judge in rejecting this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-14\">The 1967 amendments (see note 5, <em>supra) </em>imported into Florida security practice the requirement of a written consent or a written disclaimer. In the light especially of the immediate response to the official \u00a7 9-313(2) (see note 5, <em>supra) </em>Florida could not have meant to throw the whole thing back on mechanics lien practices including \u00a7 713.10 and cases both before and after it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-15\"> A reading of the Florida addition to UCC \u00a7 9-313 makes it apparent the drafters contemplated an express agreement between the holder of a real estate interest and the potential fixture-secured party. We hold a general consent to improvement and remodeling can hardly be construed to constitute either a landlord\u2019s consent to security interests or a disclaimer of an interest in fixtures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-16\">And that is especially so when these provisions are read in the context of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>provisions brought to light by the Trustee. If anything can be deemed a \u201cpermanent improvement\u201d, certainly a second story on a building is one. Similarly, if follows, ways and means of reaching that second story must fairly be deemed \u201cpermanent improvements\u201d\u2014 even though they are physically removable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">We conclude the District Court was correct in holding that Westinghouse had no right of removal vis-avis the landlord.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-6\">\n<em>Accentuate The Positive-Negative</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-7\">But that does not dispose of the case, for Florida UCC \u00a7 679.313 does not <em>void </em>the security interest. Indeed, as discussed (see note 3, <em>supra), </em>the Trustee conceded it is a perfected security interest. On oral argument the Trustee further conceded there is enough money in the estate to satisfy not only the landlord\u2019s claims, but the full amount of Westinghouse\u2019s up to the Bankruptcy Act \u00a7 197 value of the fixture security interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-8\">In fixing the zero value the special master considered only the two factors of (i) no right of removal and (ii) the zero value of the leasehold. Westinghouse urges that this is too narrow as it excludes the possible negative value which the facilities might have were Westinghouse to exercise the \u00a7 679.503 right to render them unusable.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Whether any such non-usable value can, or may under Florida law, be constructed, who the experts in support thereof will be or the values to be fixed are not matters on which we should make a speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-9\">But there should be a remand for an evidentiary hearing on this single aspect. If it produces an economically acceptable value it will be time enough for the District Court in the first instance to then determine whether that value is legally cognizable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-11\">Affirmed in part, remanded in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1080-10\">.

State, 1927, 31 Ariz. 427, 254 P. 467, the trial court admitted evidence that a witness could find no liair on a blood spot. The defendant appealed, claiming that this evidence was wholly \u201cnegative\u201d and that its admission was error. In disposing of this contention, the court said: \u201c . . . positive testimony is entitled to more weight than negative testimony, but by the latter term is meant negative testimony in its true sense and not positive evidence of a negative, because testimony in support of a negative may be as positive as that in support of an affirmative.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1080-19\">.

However, effective July 1, 1967, Section 679.313, was modified by the Florida legislature. The legislative journals show no source for the language in the current statute; however, the language is identical with a similar portion of the amended Ohio statute (Ohio Rev.Code, Tit. 13, Sec. 1309.32 (1963)). The differences, though, are not considered as controlling in construing the term \u201cin writing consented\u201d, since the identical term appears in both versions although in somewhat different contexts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-25\">Under the Official Text provisions initially adopted in Florida, a party, whose lien \u201cattached\u201d <em>prior </em>to physical affixation of the goods to the premises, could acquire priority over existing interests in the realty without requirement of consent. See note, Fixture Liens under Chapter 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code in Florida, Vol. XXI, U. of Fla. L.R., pp. 229, 234-237 (1968). It was only when attachment of the lien occurred <em>after </em>affixation, that consent of existing realty interests was required to establish priority over those interests. Under the present amendment, <em>both </em>perfecting the lien and affixation must have preceded existence of the realty interest to avoid the requirement for \u201cconsent\u201d to prevent subordination. But in both versions, the identical words \u201cin writing consented\u201d appear wherever the requirement for consent exists.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1081-26\">Brief for appellant at 7-8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1081-27\">.
