Jurisdiction was predicated upon the Hill-Burton Act itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-6\">The court dismissed for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-7\">Plaintiff alleged that the Authority operates a hospital, that she was sent by her doctor to the hospital for X-rays which were refused because she could not make an immediate payment, that she was refused medical and hospital treatment to which she was entitled under the provisions of the Hill-Burton Act, and that there is not made available in the hospital facility a reasonable volume of services to persons unable to pay therefor. She alleged also that the Department of Health, Education and Welfare is responsible for enforcing obligations and commitments under the Hill-Burton Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-8\">These allegations are sketchy, but they were sufficient to bring the plaintiff within the class of persons entitled to seek free services and to confer standing upon her. Euresti v. Stenner, 458 F.2d 1115 (CA10, 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-9\">I. The existence of a private remedy</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-10\">The District Court held that the Act did not provide expressly or by implication for a private civil remedy as a means of enforcing the Act\u2019s provisions. There is no express authorization but we hold there is implied authorization. The District Judge noted two lines of authority concerning implying a private remedy under the Hill-Burton Act, and elected to follow Stanturf v. Sipes, 224 F.Supp. 883 (W.D.Mo.1963), aff\u2019d 335 F.2d 224 (CA8, 1964) cert. denied, 379 U.S. 977, 85 S.Ct. 676, 13 L.Ed.2d 567 (1965), and Don v. Okmulgee Memorial Hospital, 443 F.2d 234 (CA10, 1971), while declining to follow <em>Euresti, supra, </em>and two District Court decisions from this circuit, Organized Migrants in Community Action v. James Archer Smith Hospital, 325 F.Supp. 268 (S.D.Fla.1971), and Cook v. Ochsner Foundation Hospital, 319 F.Supp. 603 (E.D.La.1970). In <em>Cook </em>the District Court concluded without resort to the legislative history that the provisions of the Hill-Burton Act evidenced a design, \u201cat least in part, to benefit persons unable to pay for medical services,\u201d just as this court had concluded in Gomez v. Florida State Employment Service, 417 F.2d 569 (CA5, 1969), that the Wagner-Peyser Act was intended to benefit migratory farm workers. Noting that the \u201cmechanisms by which the two acts are administered are similar,\u201d the District Court decided that the analysis supporting the implication of a private cause of action in <em>Gomez </em>was applicable in <em>Cook </em>as well. 319 F.Supp. at 605-606. <em>Organized Migrants </em>adopts the reasoning of <em>Cook. </em>Independent of <em>Gomez, Cook, </em>and <em>Organized Migrants, </em>Justice Clark\u2019s opinion in <em>Euresti </em>examines both the Act and its legislative history and concludes that the Act was clearly intended to provide indigents with hospital services and that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1098-12\">[w]ith this clear intent, it is not decisive that the language of the Act included no explicit indication that indigents were to have a right to enforce the Act\u2019s provisions. A civil remedy may be implied for those clearly within the protective realm of legislation or regulations in the public interest. Texas &amp; Pacific Ry. Co. v. Rigsby, 241 U.S. 33, 40, 36 S.Ct. 482, 60 L.Ed. 874 (1916).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1098-13\">458 F.2d at 1118. Stanturf v. Sipes, <em>supra, </em>provides only weak support for the District Court\u2019s conclusion. There the plaintiff apparently did not argue for implication of a private cause of action, but asserted the somewhat different theory that he was a third-party benefi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>ciary of a contract between the hospital and the United States. Stating simply that \u201c[n]o authority has been cited to sustain this position nor have I been able to find any,\u201d the District Judge rejected the argument. 224 F.Supp. at 890. The relevance of Don v. Okmulgee Memorial Hospital, <em>supra, </em>is still more attenuated. There an osteopathic physician and some of his patients claimed that a hospital\u2019s action in denying him admission to the hospital staff violated, inter alia, the Hill-Burton Act. It was in this context, one different from that of the present action, that the Tenth Circuit stated that \u201cthe Act itself creates no personal rights or causes of action. . . .\u201d A year later the same court, with the judge who wrote <em>Don </em>sitting as a member of the panel, decided <em>Euresti. </em>We believe that <em>Euresti, Cook </em>and <em>Organized Migrants </em>are persuasive on the issue here and should have been followed by the District Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-6\">II. The sovereign immunity of the Secretary</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-7\">The decision of the District Judge was predicated on a determination that plaintiff had no cause of action under the Hill-Burton Act, a conclusion which we reject. The Secretary of HEW, however, urged both below and on appeal that insofar as the suit sought injunc-tive relief compelling him to enforce the requirements of the Hill-Burton Act against the Hospital Authority it was barred as an unconsented to suit against the United States. Taking into account the limited extent to which the parties have addressed themselves to sovereign immunity, the fact that the District Judge did not address the issue in his opinion, and the complexity of the doctrine, we decline to determine at this time whether the Secretary is correct in his contention. We do, however, attempt to provide some guidance for the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-8\">The Secretary\u2019s brief raises by one perfunctory reference, the issue of sovereign immunity, relying upon the following statement from Dugan v. Rank, 372 U.S. 609, 620, 83 S.Ct. 999, 1006, 10 L.Ed.2d 15, 23 (1963) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1099-10\">[The suit is against the United States] if \u201cthe judgment sought would expend itself on the public treasury or domain, or interfere with the public administration,\u201d Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. 731, 738, 67 S.Ct. 1009, 1012, 91 L.Ed. 1209 (1947), or if the effect of the judgment would be \u201cto restrain the Government from acting, or to compel it to act.\u201d Larson v. Domestic and \u25a0 Foreign Commerce Corp., supra (337 U.S. at 704, 69 S.Ct. 1457 at 1468, 93 L.Ed. 1628) ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1099-11\">In Zapata v. Smith, 437 F.2d 1024, 1025 (CA5, 1971) we recognized the rule, but we also noted the traditional exceptions to it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1099-12\">[A] line of cases, usually spoken of as an exception to this rule, hold[s] that a suit against an official is not one against the United States if it is alleged either that the official acted beyond the statutory limitations of his power or, even though within the scope of his authority, the powers themselves are constitutionally void. See Dugan v. Rank, <em>supra; </em>Malone v. Bowdoin, 1962, 369 U.S. 643, 82 S.Ct. 980, 8 L.Ed.2d 168; Larson v. Domestic and Foreign Commerce Corp., 1949, 337 U.S. 682, 69 S.Ct. 1457, 93 L.Ed. 1628, 1631. Suit is justified on the theory that the official\u2019s conduct cannot be attributed to the sovereign because the official had no power in fact to do the challenged act. Larson v. Domestic and Foreign Commerce Corp., <em>supra.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1099-13\">But analysis can no more be frozen at the exception than at the rule, for as <em>Zapata </em>explains \u201cthere is a well recognized exception to the exception,\u201d the modern formulation of which stems from footnote 11 in Larson v. Domestic and Foreign Commerce Corp., <em>supra, </em>337 U.S. at 691, 69 S.Ct. at 1462, 93 L.Ed. at 1636, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1099-14\">Of course, a suit may fail, as one against the sovereign, even if it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>claimed that the officer being sued has acted unconstitutionally or beyond his statutory powers, if the relief requested cannot be granted by merely ordering the cessation of the conduct complained of but will require affirmative action by the sovereign or the disposition of unquestionably sovereign property. North Carolina v. Temple, (1890) 134 U.S. 22, 10 S.Ct. 509, 33 L.Ed. 849.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">In <em>Zapata, </em>we held that the nature of the suit brought it within the \u201cexception to the exception\u201d because the relief sought, back pay, could only be satisfied out of the public treasury and would thus affect the \u201cdisposition of unquestionably sovereign property\u201d in the form of public monies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Granting the relief requested against the Secretary in the present case would not effect a raid on the treasury, but the question remains whether it would \u201crequire affirmative action by the sovereign\u201d of such a nature that it too must fail under footnote 11 of <em>Larson. </em>While we have not previously . addressed this question, the Courts of Appeals for the Ninth and District' of Columbia Circuits have done so, and both have concluded that footnote 11 of <em>Larson </em>does not bar all actions seeking affirmative action by governmental officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-5\">In Knox Hill Tenant Council v. Washington, 145 U.S.App.D.C. 122, 448 F.2d 1045 (1971), plaintiffs sued officials of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the National Capital Housing Authority (NCHA), and the District of Columbia Government seeking enforcement of housing regulations. At least with respect to the HUD defendants, whose responsibility was described in the opinion as \u201cto police the performance of\u201d contracts with local housing authorities, <em>Knox Hill </em>seems analogous to this case. The District Court had concluded that to the extent that the suit was one against officers and employees of HUD and NCHA sovereign immunity precluded jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals, in an opinion by Judge McGowan, examined <em>Larson\u2019s </em>footnote 11 and our decision in Gardner v. Harris, 391 F.2d 885 (CA5, 1968), concluded that both were inapposite, and reversed. The court stated, \u201cThere is nothing new about judicial entertainment of suits which charge that federal officials are acting outside of, or in conflict with, the responsibilities laid upon them by the Congress or the Constitution,\u201d citing in a footnote Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908), and noting that long before <em>Young </em>\u201cjudicial authority was exercised through the writ of mandamus to compel public officials to adhere to the duties imposed upon them in their official capacities.\u201d 448 F.2d at 1052.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-10\">In State of Washington v. Udall, 417 F.2d 1310 (CA9, 1969),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Ninth Circuit in an opinion by Judge Ely explored the doctrine of sovereign immunity in a suit whereby Washington sought relief from an administrative determination by the Secretary of the Interior that certain state-owned land was not entitled to delivery of irrigation water from the Columbia Basin Project. Noting Professor Jaffe\u2019s observation that <em>Larson\u2019s </em>footnote 11 says that the suits therein discussed \u201cmay fail\u201d and not that they \u201cmust fail\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the Supreme Court\u2019s approving citation in Arizona v. California, 373 U.S. 546, 584-585, 83 S.Ct. 1468, 1489-1490, 10 L.Ed.2d 542, 569 (1963), of Ickes v. Fox, 300 U.S. 82, 57 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>S.Ct. 412, 81 L.Ed. 525 (1937), a decision compelling the Secretary of the Interior to deliver irrigation water, the court concluded that <em>Larson\u2019s </em>footnote \u201cwas not intended to preclude, in the name of sovereign immunity, <em>all </em>suits for affirmative relief. . . .\u201d 417 F.2d at 1318. Rather the footnote was held to mean that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-6\">the purposes for the doctrine of sovereign immunity may be controlling in some suits against officers so that the suits must be dismissed as suits against the Government, even though the officers were not acting pursuant to valid statutory authority, because the relief sought would work an intolerable burden on governmental functions, outweighing any consideration of private harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1101-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-8\">We believe the approach outlined in <em>Udall </em>is a sound and workable one. On remand the District Court should determine whether refusing to enforce compliance by the Hospital Authority with the provisions of the Hill-Burton Act involved here is within the scope of authority given by statute to the Secretary,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and if not, \u201cwhether the relief sought would work an intolerable burden on governmental functions, outweighing any consideration of private harm.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-9\">III. Primary jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-10\">The Hospital Authority asserts that the doctrine of primary jurisdiction requires that plaintiff first submit her claim to the state Hill-Burton agency before presenting it to the District Court. Plaintiff, however, asserts that no administrative procedure for reviewing individual complaints presently exists or has ever existed. On the record before us, we are unable to determine whether this is in fact so, and consequently we leave the matter for further exploration by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-14\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1100-6\">. Similarly in Simons v. Vinson, 394 F.2d 732 (CA 5, 1968), and Gardner v. Harris, 391 F.2d 885 (GA 5, 1968), the suits involved the rights of the United States in certain property. In denying equitable relief in those cases we noted that the plaintiffs could have a remedy by means of suits for just compensation in the District Court or the Court of Claims, depending on the dollar amounts involved.
