The case, presented upon a stipulation of facts, resulted in a finding of guilt. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Viewing the facts and opinions stipulated in the light most favorable to the Government, and in more detail <em>infra </em>as required, it appears that the defendants, together with Aaron Singer and Harry Safren were engaged in the business of accepting bets on various horse races and athletic contests. Singer was the center of the enterprise. He telephoned the \u201clines\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on particular sporting events to Safren and the defendants who, in turn, disseminated the lines to their various betting customers. Safren, and defendants Brick, Samuelson, and Weinberg then relayed to Singer the bets from their customers. It was agreed that each would receive 50 per cent of any profits generated by the bets he relayed, and, in addition, each was guaranteed the payment of any losses sustained in receiving the wagers. Weinberg, additionally, was paid an extra $50 per week by Singer whether or not any profits were made from his relayed bets. Defendants McCutcheon and Weidlich, having received bets from their customers, would \u201clay off\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> wagers with Singer. The telephone conversations between Singer and defendants pertained to the discussion of lines, to the arranging of receipts of bets and lay offs, and to their accounts with Singer and with various customers. The conversations frequently involved mention of the activities of various of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">Much of the evidence relied upon by the Government was obtained from the defendants\u2019 telephone conversations with Singer, intercepted pursuant to court order of January 8, 1971. Defendants challenge the order for non-compliance with the requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(1)(a)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; specifically, the deficiencies charged are that the application for the order \u201cstated therein that Will Wilson was the authorizing official,\u201d such authorization resting upon a letter purportedly from Wilson granting such authority, actually, however, having been signed by Henry Petersen, then Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division. The Court\u2019s order of interception, however, stated that the Attorney General was the authorizing authority and thus, argue defendants, the application and the order \u201cwere in direct conflict\u201d and in violation of \u00a7 2518(1)(a) which requires that the application shall contain the identity of the officer so authorizing.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">There is no doubt that we are confronted with contradictory facial representations. Unless we are to elevate form over substance, however, our inquiry focuses upon whether or not there has been a subversion of the congressional scheme. The intent of the statute, in view of its manifest intrusion upon the privacy of the individual which results from the approval of a wiretap, was to provide a safeguard in order to prevent abuse. To this end Congress \u201cintentionally restricted the category of federal officials who could give such approval to only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Attorney General himself or any Assistant Attorney General he might specially designate for that purpose.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">The record before us discloses that the Attorney General himself (according to the affidavit of his Executive Assistant, Mr. Sol Lindenbaum)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> approved the request for the interception order, and personally initialed the memorandum dated January 8, 1971 to Will Wilson designating him to authorize Attorney Vock-rodt to apply for the interception order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Such a memorandum, in substantially identical terms, was construed in United States v. Chavez, <em>supra </em>note 5, 94 S.Ct. at 1852, as \u201cintended to reflect notice of approval by the Attorney General, though on its face it suggested that the decision whether to authorize the particular wiretap application would be made by Assistant Attorney General Wilson.\u201d It is clear also that the signing of Wilson\u2019s name by his Deputy Assistant, here Henry Petersen, was regarded as simply a \u201cministerial act\u201d in view of Wilson\u2019s authorization to his Deputies to execute letters of authorization in every case in which he had been specially designated to authorize the applicant to make the application.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-14\">Upon the record before us, then, we have no more than a cosmetic blemish. The application recited that Will Wilson was the authorizing official, whereas in truth (and as recited in the District Court\u2019s order) it was the Attorney General. Such misidentification, regrettable though it is, does not render intercep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>tions conducted under the order unlawful in any respect. As the Supreme Court held in <em>Chavez, supra </em>note 5, 94 S.Ct. at 1853, \u201cWe agree with those other courts of appeal [citing, among others, United States v. Cox, 462 F.2d 1293, 1300 (8th Cir. 1972)] that misidentifying the Assistant Attorney General as the official authorizing the wiretap application to be made does not require suppression of wiretap evidence when the Attorney General himself has actually given the approval ; * * There were no grounds upon the facts presented justifying the granting of a motion to suppress the wiretap evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">With respect to the pen register<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> employed, the defendants argue that its installation was unauthorized by Title III.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Actually, as the legislative history of the act shows,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the use of pen registers was not prohibited by Title III. Nor is such use controlled by 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 605, as amended.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In this situation it has been held that a pen register order based upon a showing of probable cause, even if considered to be a \u201csearch \u2019 is not constitutionally offensive. Mr. Justice Powell\u2019s statement in concurrence and dissent in United States v. Giordano, 416 U.S. 505, 94 S.Ct. 1820, 1845, 40 L.Ed.2d 341 (1974) to the effect that \u201c[b]ecause a register device is not subject to the provisions of Title III, the permissibility of its use by law enforcement authorities depends entirely on compliance with the constitutional requirements of the Fourth Amendment\u201d [footnote omitted], had earlier expression in United States v. Focarile, 340 F.Supp. 1033, 1038-1040 (D.Md.1972) <em>(Giordano, supra, </em>in the District Court); United States v. Escandar, 319 F.Supp. 295, 303-304 (S.D. Fla.1970), remanded on other grounds sub nom. United States v. Robinson, 472 F.2d 973 (5th Cir. 1973) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-13\">The affidavit submitted to the Court in the application of the Government for an order authorizing the interception of wire communications bears upon two issues before us, namely, probable cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>under the Fourth Amendment for the wire interception and the use of the pen register as well as the \u201cneed\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> for the order prayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">The affidavit presented, that of Robert J. Wilkinson, Special Agent of the F.B.I., set forth in detail his personal observations concerning the investigations conducted, as well as those of two unnamed informants, one of whom had provided reliable information for several years to Special Agents \u201con a continuous basis concerning gambling matters.\u201d The affidavit described in detail the operations of the gamblers, and named certain of the persons involved, together with their places of meetings, movements and conversations. In addition it was stated that the informants, noted above, would not testify, nor, as evidenced by past experience, would the gambler\u2019s customers; that gambling raids had in the past proved ineffective, as had the telephone toll records.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The above representations in the affidavit, in conjunction with others more detailed contained therein, furnished ample probable cause for the order entered and were sufficient to demonstrate on a factual basis, as distinguished from a mere conclusion, that \u201cother procedures reasonably appear unlikely to succeed.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The statute does not require more.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The Act before us, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955(b) (1)(ii), violation of which is charged, defines an \u201cillegal gambling business\u201d as one \u201cinvolv[ing] five or more persons who conduct, finance, manage, supervise, direct or own all or part of such business.\u201d It is the position of the defendants in this respect that the proofs must establish that \u201cthe alleged violator knew that the activity engaged in was composed of five or more.\u201d There is no merit to such contention. The Congress, in enacting the legislation under consideration, sought to differentiate between \u201cillicit gambling business [es] of major proportions\u201d and \u201cthose whose operations are relatively small.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The line was drawn as defined in \u00a7 1955 of the Act, those operations being deemed to be of a magnitude sufficient to furnish the required nexus for the application of the commerce clause.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The accused\u2019s knowledge, or lack of knowledge, of the congressional determination of the required nexus does not comprise an essential element of the crime' charged. United States v. Smaldone, 485 F.2d 1333, 1348 (10th Cir. 1973) cert. denied, 416 U.S. 936, 94 S.Ct. 1934, 40 L.Ed.2d 286 (1974); United States v. Ianelli, 477 F.2d 999, 1002 (3rd Cir. 1973), cert. granted, 417 U.S. 907, 94 S.Ct. 2602, 41 L.Ed.2d 211 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-14\">We reject defendants\u2019 further contention, in effect, that they conducted five separate bookmaking businesses each involving less than five persons. The record shows that each defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>through his transactions with Singer, became involved in a network of gambling activity of substantial proportions. Although defendants argue that they are independent businessmen, it is evident that the success of their individual operations was dependent upon the success of its various related components, <em>e.g., </em>on their ability to pool their bets with Singer (either through lay-offs or profit sharing agreements) and to share line information through him. The degree of interdependence and interrelation thus shown negates the concept of independence urged upon us. United States v. Sacco, 491 F.2d 995, 1003 (9th Cir. 1974) (en banc). As well put in United States v. Hunter, 478 F.2d 1019, 1022 (7th Cir. 1972) cert. denied, 414 U.S. 857, 94 S.Ct. 162, 38 L.Ed.2d 107 (1973): \u201cwe are satisfied that the three entrepreneurs had a sufficient common interest in the development of sales, the maintenance of security, the efficient performance of services, and the solvency of all three ventures, to make it proper to regard them as a single criminal enterprise for the purposes of the statute here involved.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Defendants Weinberg, Brick and Weidlich also urge, relying on Woosley v. United States, 478 F.2d 139 (8th Cir. 1973) (en banc),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> that the sentences imposed on them for a variety of reasons (relative sizes of fines ihiposed,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> health considerations, since a condition of probation was gainful employment, as well as others) all \u201cconstitute an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">It was Woosley holding that \u201cwe possess the power to review the severity of a criminal sentence within narrow limits where the court has manifestly or grossly abused its discretion,\u201d 478 F.2d at 147. It was pointed out in the <em>Woosley </em>opinion that the trial court had followed a given \u201cpolicy\u201d in the type of case there involved (selective service) and thus there had been no exercise of discretion in any realistic sense, 478 F.2d at 143-144. The present case offers no parallel, nor does it fall within any other ground fairly comprehended within the term \u201cabuse\u201d of discretion. The court obviously apportioned the sentences with care, employing varying degrees of severity. The fact that such apportionment does not coincide with that urged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>by the defendants will not be taken as an abuse of discretion. We find no abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u00ab</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b284-9\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-10\">(a) Whoever conducts, finances, manages, supervises, directs, or owns all or part of an illegal gambling business shall be fined not more than $20,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-11\">(b) As used in this section\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-12\">(1) \u201cillegal gambling business\u201d means a gambling business which\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-13\">(i) is a violation of the law of a State or political subdivision in which it is conducted ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-25\">(ii) involves five or more persons who conduct, finance,' manage, supervise, direct, or own all or part of such business; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-26\">(iii) has been or remains in substantially continuous operation for a period in excess of thirty days or has a gross revenue of $2,000 in any single day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-27\">(2) \u201cgambling\u201d includes but is not limited to pool-selling, bookmaking, maintaining slot machines, roulette wheels or dice tables, and conducting lotteries, policy, bolita or numbers games, or selling chances therein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-28\">(3) \u201cState\u201d ,means any State of the \u2022 United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>any territory or possession of the United States.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\">.

The courts have held that \u201call levels of personnel involved in operating an illegal gambling business and not merely the management level are to be included in determining whether five or more persons conduct such business * * *.\u201d United States v. Meese, 479 F.2d 41, 43 (8th Cir. 1973); United States v. Manson, 494 F.2d 804 (7th Cir. 1974); United States v. Palmer, 465 F.2d 697 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 874, 93 S.Ct. 119, 34 L.Ed.2d 126 (1972); United States v. Becker, 461 F.2d 230 (2nd Cir. 1972), vacated on other grounds, 417 U.S. 903, 94 S.Ct. 2597, 41 L.Ed.2d 208 (1974); United States v. Harris, 460 F.2d 1041 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 877, 93 S.Ct. 128, 34 L.Ed.2d 130 (1972). In this connection it has been held that a bookmaker who makes \u201clay off\u201d bets conducts the business of the gambling operation with which he places his bets, United States v. McHale, 495 F.2d 15, 18 (7th Cir. 1974); and that one who receives lay off bets from and gives line information to other bookmakers may be counted as conducting part of their business, United States v. Ceraso, 467 F.2d 653, 656 (3rd Cir. 1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b289-10\">. See also United States v.

Defendants Brick, Samelson, and Weidlich were each fined $1,000 and sentenced to three years, Brick and Weidlich to serve six months of their sentences, Samelson one year, with the balance probation in each case. Defendant McCutcheon was fined $2,500 and sentenced to three years, one year to be served, the balance on probation. Defendant Weinberg was sentenced to three years, one year to be served, the balance on probation, and fined $10,000. Second Count sentences were identical with those on the first count, with the exception of the fines imposed. Probation for all defendants involved, among other conditions, a requirement of \u201cgainful employment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b290-6\">BRIGHT, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AXq\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">I concur in Judge Smith\u2019s excellent opinion but add an additional comment relating to the legal status of the \u201capproval\u201d of this wiretap by the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">This record discloses that Attorney General Mitchell placed his initials on a memorandum directed to Assistant Attorney General Will Wilson designating him to authorize the prosecuting attorney to apply for an order authorizing the wiretap. Mitchell has not filed any affidavit in this action explaining the significance of these initials but his executive assistant, Sol Lindenbaum, filed an <em>ex post facto </em>affidavit stating that \u201cthe Attorney General approved\u201d the request for authority for the wiretap with his \u201cpersonally initialed memorandum.\u201d Further, an affidavit of Assistant Attorney General Henry Petersen states that he signed Will Wilson\u2019s name to the wiretap authorization letters in accordance with \u201cstandard procedures of the Criminal Division.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">I retain great doubt as to who, if anyone, actually considered the merits of the wiretap authorization. The Attorney General initialed a memorandum authorizing Will Wilson to act on the application. Will Wilson did not do so but Assistant Attorney General Henry Petersen signed Wilson\u2019s initials signifying an approval of the request, a procedure not sanctioned by the wiretap statute. United States v. Giordano, 416 U.S. 505, 94 S.Ct. 1820, 40 L.Ed.2d 341 (1974). Were I free to exercise my own judgment, I would remand this case to the district court to require an explanation of this \u201cstandard procedure\u201d by the Department. I think it highly questionable whether the <em>ex post facto </em>conclusionary statement of Executive Assistant Sol Lindenbaum that Mitchell had \u201capproved\u201d the wiretap is sufficient to show Mitchell\u2019s actual approval when that same affidavit recites that Mitchell had assigned this task of approval to Will Wilson. Yet, notwithstanding this reservation, I vote for affirmance because I believe the question has been effectively foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the <em>Chavez </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">In <em>Chavez, </em>the majority stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">While the Attorney General had apparently refrained from designating any Assistant Attorney General to exercise the authorization power under \u00a7 2516(1), form memoranda were routinely sent from his office, over his initials, to Assistant Attorney General Wilson, stating that \u201cwith regard to your recommendation that authorization be given\u201d to make application for a court order permitting wire interception, \u201cyou are hereby specially designated\u201d to exercise the power conferred on the Attorney General by \u00a7 2516 \u201cfor the purpose of authorizing\u201d the applicant attorney to apply for a wiretap order. [94 S.Ct. at 1852.]</p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">The Court further commented:</p>\n<p id=\"b290-14\">Evidently this form was intended to reflect notice of approval by the Attorney General, though on its face it suggested that the decision whether to authorize the particular wiretap application would be made by Assistant Attorney General Wilson. In fact, as revealed by the affidavits of Wilson\u2019s then Deputy Assistants filed in opposition to respondents\u2019 suppression motions, \u201cWilson did not examine the files or expressly authorize the applications\u201d for either the February 18 or February 25 interception orders, and they signed his name \u201cin accordance with [his] authorization . . . and the standard procedures of the Criminal Division\u201d to the respective letters of authorization to the applicant attorney, which were made exhibits to the applications. The signing of Wilson\u2019s name was regarded as a \u201cministerial act\u201d because of Wilson\u2019s authorization to his Deputies \u201cto sign his name to and dispatch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>such a letter of authorization in every instance in which the request had been favorably acted upon in the Office of the Attorney General.\u201d [94 S.Ct. at 1852.]</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">I read <em>Chavez </em>as construing the existence of the Attorney General\u2019s initials on form memoranda to Will Wilson and the subsequent affidavits of Sol Lind-enbaum or Mitchell himself stating that those initials signified approval for the authorization to be sufficient to establish the wiretap authority, without more. The existence of these initials is not a matter of dispute and the conclusion of approval follows from the affidavit. The procedure followed here was substantially identical to that in <em>Chavez. </em>I take it that the Supreme Court has placed its imprimatur of legal validity to that standard procedure. Thus, under <em>Chavez, </em>I believe we must affirm. If the question of actual authorization by the Attorney General were still open, I would remand this case to the district court for an evidentiary hearing by way of further affidavits on whether the Attorney General\u2019s initials signified an actual approval of the wiretap.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
