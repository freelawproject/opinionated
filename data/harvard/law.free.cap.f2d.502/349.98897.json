The remands in <em>Tiidee I </em>and <em>II </em>were based upon the contention of the International Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers, AFL-CIO (the Union) that extraordinary affirmative relief was required to undo the effects of what the court termed Tiidee Products, Inc.\u2019s (the Company) flagrant refusals to bargain, and its subsequently frivolous litigation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Board\u2019s orders here under review provide eertain additional relief requested by the Union, but do not go as far as the Union would have them. As modified by this opinion, the Board\u2019s orders will be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b414-18\">In <em>Tiidee I </em>this court held that the Company violated section 8(a)(5) of the National Labor Relations Act (the Act), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(5) (1970), by what the majority opinion variously characterized as a \u201cbrazen refusal to bargain,\u201d a \u201cmanifestly unjustifiable refusal to bargain\u201d and a \u201cclear and flagrant violation of the law.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It then attempted to defend its action before the trial examiner and the Board <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on the basis of what the <em>Tiidee I </em>court found to be a violation of the express terms of the Agreement for Consent Election and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>\u201cpatently frivolous\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> objections to the election by which the Union had obtained certification as the exclusive bargaining representative of the unit employees.</p>\n<p id=\"AxGv\">The relief ordered in the original Board proceedings in light of the section 8(a)(5) and other unfair labor practices included a broad cease and desist order, and required the Company to post appropriate notices, bargain collectively with the Union upon request, furnish the Union with certain requested information on current wages and fringe benefits, and reinstate with back pay employees laid off and discharged because of their union activities. These conventional remedies were found by the <em>Tii-dee I </em>court to be an inadequate means of insuring meaningful bargaining and to reward <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> unjustly the Company for its illegal actions during the delay of litigation and enforcement of the Board\u2019s orders. The case was thus remanded to the Board for further consideration of the Union\u2019s make-whole claim and other additional or alternative forms of relief. <em>Tiidee II </em>involved further section 8(a)(5) violations, as well as other<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> unfair labor practices, and again the case was remanded for further consideration of more appropriate remedies in light of the <em>Tiidee I </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">In the supplemental decisions and orders here under review, entered under the compulsion of our prior decisions, the Board finally ordered some additional affirmative remedies for the section 8(a)(5) violations in both <em>Tiidee I </em>and <em>II </em>but again declined to order any broad make-whole relief. The Board thus denied payment to employees for the difference between wages and benefits actually received and what the Union contended they would have received had the Company bargained in good faith to agreement on a contract with the Union. Similarly, the Board denied the Union\u2019s request that it be reimbursed for allegedly \u201clost\u201d dues and fees, and organizational expenses. The Board did, however, order the Company to reimburse the Board and the Union for all litigation expenses, including attorney fees, in connection with the section 8(a)(5) issues in both <em>Tiidee I </em>and II.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">Additionally, the Company was ordered to mail copies of the Board\u2019s posted notices to the home of each employee in the bargaining unit, permit Union ac- \u25a0 cess to the Company\u2019s bulletin boards and other places where notices to employees are posted so it could post Union notices and other literature during the ensuing period of contract negotiations, and furnish the Union with a list of names and addresses of its employees and keep the list current for a period of one year. As to. these latter affirmative actions required of the Company, we fully agree with the Board\u2019s finding that they are necessary and appropriate to guarantee that rights conferred by section 7 will not be denied.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">In the supplemental proceedings in both <em>Tiidee 1 </em>and <em>II, </em>the Board ordered the Company to \u201c[p]ay to the Board and the Union the costs and expenses incurred by them in the investigation, preparation, presentation, and conduct of these cases before the Na<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>tional Labor Relations Board and the courts . . . . \u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Apparently the Board ordered this remedy in response to the <em>Tiidee I </em>court\u2019s suggestion that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">[t]he scope of the Board\u2019s consideration on remand, if it is deemed that the Union\u2019s proposal goes too far, would include consideration of such lesser, alternative .remedies as an award to the Union . . . for the costs of having to litigate a frivolous case . . . .<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">The Company vigorously contests the power of the NLRB to order the award of attorney fees and other litigation expenses to the Board and the Union, but that issue was recently settled in this circuit in Food Store Employees Union, Local No. 347 Amalgamated Meat Cutters v. NLRB, 155 U.S.App.D.C. 101, 476 F.2d 546, cert. granted, 414 U.S. 1062, 94 S.Ct. 567, 38 L.Ed.2d 467 (1973), which held that the Board does have the power in appropriate cases to order such a remedy.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Thus <em>Food Store </em>in large <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>measure controls our disposition of that issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\"><em>Food Store </em>involved \u201c \u2018clearly aggravated and pervasive\u2019 misconduct [by the employer, and the Board] questioned [the employer\u2019s] good faith because of its \u2018flagrant repetition of conduct previously found unlawful\u2019 at other [of its] stores.\u201d <footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The premise for sustaining the award of litigation expenses in <em>Food Store </em>was that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">employers who follow a pattern of resisting union organization, and who to that end unduly burden the processes of the Board and the courts, should be obliged, at the very least, to respond in terms of making good the legal expenses to which they have put the charging parties and the Board.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">As stated above we do not write today on a clean slate but are bound as to the law by <em>Food Store. </em>That being so, we are led inexorably to the conclusion that if the facts of <em>Food Store </em>presented an appropriate case for the award of attorney fees, then, <em>a fortiori, </em>the instant ease does also.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The element of frivolous litigation, as the <em>Tiidee I </em>court decided exists in this case, presents a different and even stronger situation for awarding litigation expenses if the payment of attorney fees can be ordered paid for flagrant repetition of conduct violative of the National Labor Relations Act. The court\u2019s finding in <em>Tiidee I </em>that, on the facts presented, the Company had engaged in frivolous litigation constitutes the law of this case.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>court\u2019s articulation of that finding is a harsh litany: the Company\u2019s conduct \u201cwas a clear and flagrant violation of the law\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark>; \u201cits objections to the election were patently frivolous\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>; the Company\u2019s action was \u201ca brazen refusal to bargain, in violation of solemn obligations\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark>; its position was \u201cpalpably without merit\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark>; and the case involved \u201ca manifestly unjustifiable refusal to bargain.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In light of the precedent established by <em>Food Store </em>and of the court\u2019s decision in <em>Tiidee I </em>as to the law and the facts, stare decisis and the law of the case leave us no recourse but to enforce at least in part the Board\u2019s award to the Union of attorney fees and litigation expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">Difficulties remain, however, as to the manner in which the <em>Food Store </em>and <em>Tiidee </em>decisions may be accommodated with our view of the Board\u2019s or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>ders in this case. Two significant issues, therefore, must be confronted. First, whether the Board itself should be reimbursed for its expenditures in litigating this case, and second, whether legal expenses during the full course of this litigation should be allowed. We answer both in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">A. <em>Reimbursement to the Board</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Any remedy ordered - by the Board under section 10(c) must satisfy the ultimate standard that it is designed both in intent and operation to effectuate the policies of the National Labor Relations Act. Three rationalizations may be advanced to support the proposition that the imposition of attorney fees and other legal expenses in cases of frivolous litigation effectuates the policies of the Act: (1) the policies underlying the traditional American rule against awarding attorney fees are unpersuasive in such cases<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>; (2) the remedy would effectively prevent the diversion of administrative resources from meritorious cases<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>; and (3) the award of such costs might help restore the Union to the status quo ante.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">In <em>Food Store, </em>the court enlarged the Board\u2019s order to include the award of litigation expenses to the Board as well as the union. The court found it unnecessary on the facts and legal theory there involved to consider explicitly whether an award of legal expenses to the Board involved considerations distinct from granting such reimbursement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>to a union. The significantly distinguishing feature of <em>Food Store </em>was the employer\u2019s comprehensive pattern of illegal resistance to any form of unionism. The court succinctly summarized the employer\u2019s predilection for unlawful conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-4\">The employing company is not a stranger to the processes of the Board. Operating a chain of discount stores in the Southeast, this is the eleventh time that its resistence of union organization has embroiled it in Board proceedings. In none has it prevailed at the Board level, and its fortunes in the Courts of Appeals have been only marginally better.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The <em>Food Store </em>court thus held that an employer who egregiously continues to violate the Act must reimburse both the Board and the union for their legal expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">By contrast, in the instant case we are confronted with an employer who actually is a \u201cstranger to the processes of the Board,\u201d however wilful his violation and frivolous his defenses. Confronting this situation, the <em>Tiidee I </em>court demonstrably was concerned principally with assuring adequate remedial relief to the Union rather than to the Board. The entire thrust of the <em>Tiidee I </em>decision, as evidenced by the discussion on make-whole relief, focused on remedying the harm suffered by the Union because of the Company\u2019s conduct. Indeed, in suggesting the alternative relief of reimbursement of litigation expenses, the <em>Tiidee I </em>court specifically contemplated that only the Union would receive such an award.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Moreover, although reimbursement to the Board arguably might be consistent with the incidental rationale in <em>Tiidee I </em>of preventing the diversion of administrative resources from meritorious cases, any such advancement of that policy would only be cumulative to that produced by reimbursement to the Union. Thus, while <em>Food Store </em>established the power of the Board to award legal expenses to itself,<footnotemark>***</footnotemark> the present case does not present an appropriate situation for its exercise. Accordingly, the orders here under review shall be modified by deletion of any re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>quirement of payment by the Company to the Board for attorney fees and other legal expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">B. <em>Limitation on Reimbursement to the Union</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The Company also contends that litigation expenses should not be allowed beyond the date of the Board\u2019s initial <em>Tiidee I </em>decision because as of that date it assertedly was ready and willing to bargain in good faith and the litigation subsequent to that date was related only to the determination of remedies appropriate to already conceded section 28(a)(5) violations.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> We find this argument persuasive. We sustain in principle the award of litigation expenses in this case because the <em>Tiidee I </em>court found that the Company raised frivolous defenses before the Board. All litigation subsequent to that date, however, certainly did not involve frivolous litigation by the Company \u2014 indeed, the opposite is true. After the Board\u2019s decision in <em>Tiidee I, </em>the Company only sought to sustain the <em>Board\u2019s position </em>that traditional relief was adequate, and to resist an attempt by the Union to have the Board impose the exceptionally- novel remedy of make-whole relief, a remedy that has never been ordered in the 39-year history of the Act.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The Board agreed with the Company at the outset of this litigation, before this court in <em>Tiidee I </em>indicated that such relief might be possible. Moreover, the Board continues to hold firmly the belief that it is without the power under section 10(c) to award the make-whole relief demanded by the Union.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">It is arguable, of course, that the section 8(a)(5) violations and the ensuing frivolous litigation before the Board cannot realistically be separated from attempts by the Union legally to cure the harm that they caused. Moreover, the limitation we delineate today might permit an employer to decimate a union, or vice versa, and escape imposition of remedial orders that comprehend the totality of his actions simply by vowing a change of heart. Thus we do not rely on the Company\u2019s assertion that after the Board\u2019s <em>Tiidee I </em>decision it was ready and willing to bargain. Nevertheless, we recognize that these protracted proceedings clearly constitute what is, in effect, a test case by the Union to establish the viability of a new concept of make-whole relief that amounts to an unprecedented remedy. We therefore think the Company should not, because of its misconduct at the start of the case, be forced fully to subsidize the Union\u2019s legal efforts in such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">In the <em>Tiidee II </em>supplemental decision the Board examined the Company\u2019s conduct \u201cin the total context of [its] entire course of unfair labor practices\u201d and found that, in view of its finding \u201cin <em>Tiidee I </em>that frivolous issues were raised and litigated to postpone or avoid a lawful obligation to bargain, [the Company\u2019s] conduct in the instant case is so inextricably intertwined with [its] refusal on frivolous grounds to bargain with the Union as to require the conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>sion that it was part of the same pattern of patently frivolous litigation for the same unlawful object. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Although we believe that the Company\u2019s legal position in <em>Tiidee II </em>cannot fairly be characterized as frivolous, there is ample support in the record for the finding that its conduct in <em>Tiidee II </em>was also designed to \u201cpostpone or avoid a lawful obligation to bargain\u201d so that an award of litigation expenses properly is sustainable under <em>Food Store, supra. </em>As noted above, however, the award must be limited to expenses incurred in litigating the initial case before the Board and therefore does not extend to any subsequent legal proceedings involving the question of appropriate remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">In summary, the orders relating to the award of attorney fees and other litigation expenses are modified to delete any requirement that the Company reimburse the Board for its legal expenses, and to limit reimbursement to the Union to expenses it incurred only for litigation before the Board in the initial <em>Tii-dee 1 </em>and <em>II </em>decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The Board refused to grant the broad make-whole remedy requested by the Union and the Union now strenuously argues that in so doing the Board failed to comply with this court\u2019s directives on remand. The Union\u2019s argument rests principally upon two grounds. First, that our decision in <em>Tiidee I </em>mandated a make-whole remedy, and second, that the Board improperly relied upon the difficulty of ascertaining the contract terms that would have been agreed to had the Company bargained in good faith. The first argument has little merit. The <em>Tii-dee I </em>court quite clearly did not- require imposition of a broad make-whole remedy; indeed, it indicated that the Board could select remedies other than make-whole relief if they would adequately effectuate the policies of the Act and were supported by reasoned analysis.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">The second contention of the Union has more substance but on full consideration it too must fail. The court in <em>Tiidee I </em>drew a distinction between contract terms that \u201cwould\u201d and \u201cshould\u201d have been agreed to by the parties had they bargained together in good faith to agreement. Although the Board does not have the power to impose \u201cshould\u201d contract terms or to grant make-whole relief where no agreement would have been reached, the <em>Tiidee I </em>court clearly stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-13\">A tribunal given the function <em>of </em>implementing national policy through compensatory remedies may not soundly refer to the difficulty in quantifying appropriate compensation as a justification for withdrawal and frustration of the policy, particularly where such an approach would operate only to reward the wrongdoer and to give him an advantage over a law-abiding competitor.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-14\">It is necessary, therefore, to examine and determine the sufficiency of the record evidence that would form the basis for awarding make-whole relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-15\">At the unfair labor practice hearing in <em>Tiidee I, the </em>trial examiner freely allowed the Union to introduce evidence in support of its make-whole request. And, in its Statement of Position <em>of </em>Charging Party on Remand,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> the Union proffered certain evidence to establish the compensation and fringe benefits earned by employees prior to certification and what they could be expected to have received had the Company bargained in good faith. This evidence is of limited relevance, however, because it, for example, refers to bargaining units of much greater size than the Union\u2019s, lumps all manufacturing industries to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>gether, and generally consists of national, rather than local, statistics.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">The precise issue, then, is whether this evidence validly could be translated into specific contract terms that would have been agreed to by both the Union and the Company had they bargained together in good faith to an agreement. The Board specifically found that it could not \u201cascertain with even approximate accuracy . . . what the parties <em>\u2018would </em>have agreed to.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Moreover, the Board also seemed to suggest that the parties might not have reached any agreement at all.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> We have closely examined the record evidence and cannot conclude that the Board\u2019s finding on this issue was without substantial support in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">There is yet another basis for affirming this aspect of the Board\u2019s decision, however, for it appears that the Board permissibly balanced the difficulty in this particular case of ascertaining the contract terms that would have been agreed to against the relative ease and certainty of awarding litigation expenses to the Union and ordering other affirmative remedies. The Board found that make-whole relief was \u201cnot practicable\u201d <footnotemark>37</footnotemark> in this case, and that it \u201cwould effectuate the policies of the Act to grant some but not all of the requested relief.\u201d <footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Thus the Board found that its selection of affirmative remedies was an adequate alternative means of effectuating the Act\u2019s policies and satisfying the directives of the <em>Tiidee I </em>and <em>II </em>remands.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The <em>Tiidee I </em>court was \u201cparticularly\u201d concerned that reliance on \u201cthe difficulty in quantifying appropriate compensation . . . would operate only to reward the wrongdoer\u201d; this concern is largely vitiated by the additional remedies ordered in this case, including limited litigation expenses.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> On these facts, given our limited scope of review, we are not disposed to overturn this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-15\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b424-16\">The Union also requested compensation from the Company for Union members\u2019 dues and fees allegedly lost to it because of the Company\u2019s flagrant refusal to bargain. The Board premised its denial of this relief on two grounds. First, it argued that such relief is part and parcel of the broad make-whole remedy denied in this case since such items would come from \u201clost\u201d wages.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Second, it felt that since it was the Union\u2019s policy to waive such dues and fees until after a contract had been signed, the risk of losing such monies when no contract is signed should not be shifted from the Union to the Company.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> <em>Food Store, supra, </em>considered this same issue and sustained the Board\u2019s denial of such relief in that case. <em>Food Store </em>premised its holding, <em>inter alia, </em>on the fact that \u201c[i]t is undoubtedly true that union security clauses have attained a wide degree of use, but it also remains true that an employer may bargain to impasse with respect to such a demand, and that the Board may not impose that obligation upon the employer, H. K. Porter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Co. v. NLRB, 397 U.S. 99 [90 S.Ct. 821, 25 L.Ed.2d 146] (1970).\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> We reaffirm that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">The Board also denied the Union\u2019s request for reimbursement of organizational expenses supposedly lost because of the Company\u2019s refusal to bargain. The Union argues that this remedy should be ordered because the money it spent in pre-election organization efforts was \u201crendered a complete waste\u201d due to the unlawful refusal to bargain.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> It points out that the delay in bargaining caused loss of interest in the Union and loss of membership.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> We agree with the Board, however,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">that the Union incurred no extraordinary organizational expenses Despite certain already remedied preelection unlawful [Company] conduct, the Union was selected by the employees after a 2-month campaign at the first election held. We find, therefore, no nexus between [the Company\u2019s] unlawful conduct here under examination and the Union\u2019s preelection organizational expenses . <footnotemark>46</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Thus the Union incurred only normal organizational expenses in its campaign for election. In <em>Food. Store, </em>by contrast, organizational expenses were allowed because there the employer\u2019s pervasively unlawful conduct required the expenditure of extraordinary amounts of .money.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Moreover, it should be noted that the purpose of an organizational drive such as that conducted by the Union is to gain majority status among the unit employees, win the representation election and obtain certification. A principal benefit gained by this process is certification as the exclusive bargaining agent for the unit. The Union here achieved this status and the one year protective period guaranteed by such certification will not begin to run until the Company begins to bargain in good faith with the Union.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The denial of organizational expenses to the Union must be affirmed since it was not forced to make extraordinary expenditures and those normal expenses it did incur were not rendered a complete waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-11\">As modified herein, the amended orders under review shall be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-12\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b414-11\">.

In this third stage of the <em>Tiidee </em>proceedings, the opportunity to consider as a matter of first impression the adequacy and legal soundness of the Board\u2019s supplemental decisions and amended orders has been circumscribed by the intervening <em>Food Store </em>decision, decided by another panel of this court. In these circumstances, and because of my prior participation in <em>Tiidee I </em>and <em>II, </em>it is peculiarly appropriate to set forth my individual views on three basic issues. These personal views are set forth in this footnote *, and in footnotes ** and ***, <em>infra. </em>As to footnote **, we all recognize that we are bound by the law of the case but my prior familiarity with the record in <em>Tiidee I </em>and <em>II </em>compels me to reaffirm my individual dissent in those cases with additional detail. As to footnotes * and ***, Judges Tamm and Robb feel that debate in this circuit has been foreclosed by Food Store Employees Union, Local No. 347 Amalgamated Meat Cutters v. NLRB, 155 U.S.App.D.C. 101, 476 F.2d 546, cert. granted, 414 U.S. 1062, 94 S.Ct. 567, 38 L.Ed.2d 467 (1973). As my authorship of the opinion for the court demonstrates, I agree that <em>Food Store </em>is controlling; nonetheless, I feel it necessary to express my personal opinion on what I perceive as relatively clearcut and as yet not fully illuminated issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">It is my individual opinion that section 10(c) does not authorize the Board to award attorney fees. Traditional American jurisprudence circumscribes even the power of the courts to award attorney fees. There are, of course, several well established exceptions to the American rule prohibiting their award by the courts. Hall v. Cole, 412 U.S. 1, 93 S.Ct. 1943, 36 L.Ed.2d 702 (1973). The award of attorney fees by a statutory board in this case is predicated upon a congressional grant of authority pursuant to section 10(c) of the Act. The broad language of that section, however, does not compare favorably with the explicit, unambiguous and specific language consciously selected by Congress in other statutes. For,, example, the Interstate Commerce Act provides that \u201c[i]f the plaintiff shall finally prevail [in court] he shall be allowed a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee, to be taxed and collected as part of the costs of the suit.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(2) (1970). Similarly, the Clayton Act specifically requires that a person injured by a violation of the antitrust laws \u201cshall recover [in court] the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15 (1970). Thus the, unvarying rule is that when Congress intends to permit the courts to award attorney fees to the prevailing party in statutory causes of action, it does so with precision and unmistakable clarity. <em>B. g., </em>Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, \u00a7 309(f), 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 210(f) (1970) ; Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, \u00a7 7(b), 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 499g(b) (1970); Trust Indenture Act of 1939, \u00a7 323(a), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77www(a) (1970) ; Securities Act of 1933, \u00a7 11(e), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(e) (1970) ; Securities Exchange Act of 1934, \u00a7\u00a7 9(e), 18(a), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78i(e), 78r(a) (1970) ; Copyright Act, \u00a7 116, 17 U.

Cole, <em>supra, </em>at 4-5. An administrative agency possesses no such inherent equitable power, however, for it is a creature of the statute that brought it into existence; it has no powers except those specifically conferred upon it by statute. The Board\u2019s power to award attorney fees, then, depends exclusively upon section 10(c). That section admittedly constitutes a broad grant of authority, Phelps-Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, 313 U.S. 177, 61 S.Ct. 845, 85 L.Ed. 1271 (1941), but in that very broadness, as contrasted to the statutes cited above, lies the fatal flaw to any argument that the Board has the power to order reimbursement for attorney fees and other litigation expenses. Section 10(c) grants the Board the authority to order an employer or union to \u201ctake such affirmative action including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, as will effectuate the policies of\u201d the Act. The words \u201caffirmative <em>action\u201d </em>are calculated more to connote that type of action ordinarily ordered by the Board in unfair labor practice cases, such as ordering the parties to engage in collective bargaining, to cease and desist from unfair labor practices, refrain from secondary boycotts, cease unlawful picketing, and so forth. Moreover, where monetary compensation is involved, the Congress thought it necessary to state explicitly that employees could be \u201creinstated with or without <em>hack pay.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">There is yet another significant weakness in the argument that section 10(c) authorizes the Board to award attorney fees. The Labor Act, especially after the 1947 amendments, was intended carefully to adjust and balance the rights and interests of labor, management and the government; the Act manifestly was designed to provide fair and even-handed treatment. The award of attorney fees pursuant to section 10(c) demonstrably does violence to these fundamental precepts, however, for no comparable remedy is available against a <em>charging </em>party even though in filing a charge and causing a complaint to issue he may be motivated by the same illegal reasons (a pattern of illegal resistance to unionization) and be engaged in the same conduct (frivolous litigation) on which such award is premised in <em>Food Store </em>and the instant case. The \u201caffirmative action\u201d clause in section 10(c) applies only against the <em>charged </em>party. By contrast, a charging party, who is a party of right (29 O.E.R. \u00a7 102.8 (1973)) permitted fully to litigate the case at the hearing (29 C.E.R. \u00a7 102.38 (1973)) and before the Board, may file a charge based on totally false facts or raise totally frivolous issues for the purpose of infringing . an employer\u2019s protected rights and yet, if the Board determines that the complaint based on such a charge is totally without merit, section 10(c)\u2019s second proviso provides <em>only </em>that \u201cthe Board shall state its findings of fact and shall issue an order dismissing the said complaint.\u201d And, although it may be hoped that the regional directors or the General Counsel would weed out such charges and not issue a complaint, it is clear that such frivolous cases may occur, especially since neither the Act (section 10(b)) nor the regulations (29 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.4 (1973)) requires any investigation of the charges prior to the issuance of a complaint. Thus, although perfect symmetry is not required or even expected, the fact that a charging party who engages in frivolous litigation escapes completely unscathed while his counterpart, for example the Company in this case, is liable for large litigation expenses strongly suggests that the Congress never intended the Board to possess the power to impose attorney fees and other litigation expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">It is also of critical importance in construing so broad a grant of authority, one thought by Congress best to reside in \u201cthe empiric process of administration,\u201d <em>Phelps-Dodge, supra, </em>at 194, that in the entire 39-year history of the Act section 10(c) lias never before been interpreted to support the exaction of attorney \u2022 fees in cases such as this. This consistent administrative interpretation and practice for so many years argues persuasively against change by the Judiciary. After more than a decade of operation without such a remedy, section 10(c)\u2019s precise language survived intact the 1947 Taft-Hartley Amendments. Moreover, in all the 39 years of legislative history surrounding section 10(c), none of it gives any support for the interpretation that Congress intended to allow the Board to award attorney fees and litigation expenses to prevailing parties. Therefore, if the complaint be made that the powers of the Board are inadequate, let it be made to the Congress and not the Judiciary \u2014 any proper conception of, and respect for, the relative domains of each demands no less.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">It would, moreover, be unsound policy to invest the Board with the power to grant attorney fees, for theory rarely is congruent with reality. It may well be a reassuring proposition to state that attorney fees will only be awarded in frivolous or flagrant cases, but the predicates of the adversary system augurs intense litigation over the very premise of such an award, that is, whether a case is frivolous or flagrant. Such synergistic circumstances would greatly increase the number and complexity of cases before the Board, and what began as a means of ridding the Board and the courts of frivolous cases (which are relatively few in number) would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>finally produce quite the opposite result and add greatly to the Board\u2019s burdens.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">I would require a more clearly expressed statutory mandate to authorize the Board to order a remedy in which even the courts seldom indulge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b418-9\">. 155 U.S.App.D.C. at 106, 476 F.2d at 551.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b418-10\">. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b418-11\">. We are, of course, cognizant of the somewhat disturbing circularity of this approach \u2014the Board reacted to the strong remand in <em>Tiidee I </em>by imposing attorney fees, <em>Food Store </em>then relied on the Board\u2019s supplemental decision in <em>Tiidee I </em>after our remand, and now we, in <em>Tiidee III, </em>rely in large part on the precedent established by <em>Food Store to </em>sustain the imposition of attorney fees and other litigation expenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b418-12\"> Although it is the law of this case, it is my individual opinion <em>(see </em>note *, <em>supra) </em>that the Company\u2019s conduct of this litigation is not as frivolous as the adjectival characterizations of the <em>Tiidee I </em>majority would suggest. The Company had a legitimate complaint against the Union\u2019s circulation of a misrepresentative handbill to the employees on the very day of the election, just eight hours prior to the balloting. The handbill misrepresented the issues in the election by holding out the alluring promise that \u201cgreater benefits\u201d were \u201cexactly\u201d what a \u201cYes vote\u201d would produce. Report on Election, Exhibit A, Jt.App. at 220. Board decisions, however, generally allow unions some latitude in this area, to the extent that they may promise benefits they may be unable to procure. <em>See, e. g., </em>Burson Plant of the Kendall Co., 115 NLRB 1401 (1956); Olson Rug Co., 118 NLRB 1274 (1957). The interjection of such misrepresentative matter at the last minute so that the employer cannot respond, however, must be viewed in a different light. In this context, the Company justifiably could feel unfairly treated on the significant question of whether it would be unionized. But for the late hour at which the handbill was distributed, the Company could and probably would have responded with a handbill of its own to inform the employees of the precise implications of a \u201cYes vote\u201d in the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-15\">The obvious strategical move, calling a meeting of the employees to answer the Union\u2019s misleading literature in a speech, was prohibited by the <em>Peerless Plywood </em>rule. Peerless Plywood Co., 107 NLRB 427 (1953). Under <em>Peerless, </em>while \u201cunions or employers [may] circulate campaign literature on or off the premises at any time prior to an election,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 430, they are \u201cprohibited from making election speeches on company time to massed assemblies of employees within 24 hours before the scheduled time for conducting an election.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 429. Thus the Company was effectively precluded from answering what it considered to be unfair and misleading campaign propaganda and tactics, the obvious purpose and intent of which was to influence the election against the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-16\">When the election resulted in a union victory, the Company naturally and justifiably inferred that the misleading campaign propaganda had influenced the result to some degree. The Company undoubtedly thought that in logic and reality such last minute handbilling is indistinguishable from last minute speeches, which the Board has recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>nized \u201ctends to create a mass psychology [and is] the last most telling word.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mousetrapped between the 24 hour no-speech rule and the rule permitting unions to propagandize up to the time of balloting, the Company felt it imperative to make legal objections to the election. The Regional Director investigated, but did not hold any hearing on the Company\u2019s objections and ruled against the Company. He found that the Union\u2019s handbill\u2019s did not influence the election result, <em>a conclusion contrary to the obvious effect intended by the Union. </em>It may be cogently argued that a hearing was necessary in order to determine the psychological and practical effect of the Union\u2019s handbilling immediately prior to the election. Employees could have been called to determine whether they thought that as a result of a union victory they would be guaranteed greater benefits as the literature promised. The Trial Examiner almost casually termed as \u201cfrivolous\u201d the Company\u2019s failure to acquiesce to the Regional Director\u2019s decision, even though <em>the Company\u2019s refusal to bargain was the only method under the Act by which it could seeh review of that decision. </em>The trial examiner would have to have been prescient to realize he was opening a Pandora\u2019s box of complex and protracted litigation by this casual reference, when subsequently the <em>Tiidee I </em>majority greatly expended his factual finding to make the Company\u2019s position \u201cpalpably\u201d and \u201cpatently\u201d frivolous. <em>See </em>text following this note. Viewed in total context, one could not fairly characterize as frivolous the actions taken by the Company; the Company\u2019s conduct, moreover, could hardly be termed any more frivolous than the Union\u2019s demand for a remedy never previously ordered in the entire 39-year history of the Act and still thought by the Board not to be within its power under section 10(c) to grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The analysis of Chairman Miller of the NLRB in his dissent in <em>Tiidee II </em>supports his conclusion that the Company\u2019s defenses in that case had not been \u201casserted frivolously.\u201d His dissenting opinion stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-11\">As the majority opinion points out, our decision in <em>Tiidee I </em>to award costs and attorneys\u2019 fees was based on the court\u2019s finding that the litigation there had been frivolously engaged in by Respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-12\">In reviewing the record in the instant case, I am unable to find that the defense here was asserted frivolously. <em>The majority opinion here seems to me to evade this issue and to rely on the extent of Respondent\u2019s unfair labor practices (which, however reprehensible, are no more extensive than those committed by both unions and employers in a considerable percentage of the 800 or so cases we review each year) and on the degree of Respondent\u2019s union animus and hostility. </em>But the degree of Respondent\u2019s hostility has little or nothing to do with the frivolity of its defenses to the allegations of the complaint in this proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-13\">For these reasons I dissent from that portion of this Decision which awards costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-14\">196 NLRB at 157 (emphasis added).

In <em>Republic Steel </em>the Board ordered an employer to deduct from payments to employees reinstated with back pay amounts they had earned on public work relief projects and to pay such deducted amounts to the appropriate government agencies. The Court characterized such payments as \u201cexactions\u201d and stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-10\">it is not enough to justify the Board\u2019s requirements to say that they would have the effect of deterring persons from violating the Act. That argument proves too much, for if such a deterrent effect is sufficient to sustain an order of the Board, it would be free to set up any system of penalties which it would deem adequate to that end.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 12. Since the NLRB was created and exists for the purpose of determining unfair labor practice cases and otherwise discharging its duties under the Act, reimbursement to the Board of legal expenses incurred in the discharge of its statutory duties under section 10(c) could only be justified on the impermissible rationale of deterrence. By contrast, this court has held that the Board may be reimbursed for attorney fees and other litigation expenses by a United States Court of Appeals in an action in which the Board has successfully petitioned such court to hold in civil contempt a party who has violated that court\u2019s final order granting enforcement to a Board order.
