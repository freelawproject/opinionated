After a careful examination of adequate briefs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>filed in this case, and a close scrutiny of the relatively small record, we concluded that the district court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous under Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a), and affirmed with a <em>per curiam </em>opinion. 498 F.2d 328. Appellant\u2019s counsel has now petitioned for an en banc rehearing, or, in the alternative, rehearing by the assigned panel. This, too, is not uncommon, but counsel\u2019s petition is remarkable for its intemperate and excessive averments that (1) our af-firmance is \u201cinconceivable\u201d because the record \u201cfirmly and unequivocally establishes the correctness of Norton Lilly\u2019s position\u201d;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) our denial of oral argument impaired \u201cfull and fair determination\u201d of this matter; <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (3) our decision necessarily indicates a \u201cpatent\u201d lack of careful consideration and scrutiny of this cause by the <em>judges </em>on the panel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>We </em>are reluctant to dignify these assertions with a response, but we do so to reassure litigants of the solicitude with which we handle summary cases under Local Rule 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-4\">I. THE MERITS OF THE APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"A_KX\">Prior to January 27, 1972, plaintiff Bryson had acted as an out-port agent for Sea Way Lines, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Trans-Caribbean Shipping, Ltd. Trans-Caribbean was also the sole stockholder of Sea Hawk, Inc., Sea Saga, Inc., and Sea Challenge, Inc., three Liberian corporations each owning a single vessel; Sea Way had operated the 'three vessels pursuant to an unwritten charter agreement. On January 27, 1972, Norton Lilly acquired all of the capital stock in Sea Way Lines, Inc., and the three Liberian corporations, thus gaining sole possession of Sea Way Lines and the ships it operated. On February 28, 1972, representatives of Norton Lilly met with representatives of Bryson in St. John\u2019s, Antigua, \u201cfor the purpose of reviewing the present status of our business and establishing future procedures.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After the conversations between the representatives but still on February 28, the discussions were \u201cconfirmed\u201d by a letter dated February 28, 1972, from Norton Lilly to Bryson.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1111-14\">Norton Lilly has contended throughout that it acted only as agent for a disclosed principal (Sea Way Lines, Inc.), and as such is not directly liable for Bryson\u2019s costs and expenditures for Sea Way\u2019s ships (which were actually ships owned by three Liberian corporations, each of whose stock was wholly owned by Norton Lilly). Norton Lilly\u2019s argument is that Sea Way is responsible for the debt in question, notwithstanding that Sea Way Lines, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiary, is inoperative and, presumably, financially embarrassed. The district court found as fact, however, that pursuant to the meeting held February 28, 1972, at plaintiff Bryson\u2019s office in St. John\u2019s, Antigua, Norton Lilly\u2019s representatives agreed to place Bryson \u201cin funds\u201d if Bryson\u2019s disbursements on behalf of the vessels exceeded freight collections.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On Norton Lilly\u2019s request, Bryson began to defray such costs, and billed Norton Lilly directly. It is undisputed that Bryson financed the vessels\u2019 costs out of its own funds at Norton Lilly\u2019s request, that invoices for such expenses were billed directly to Norton Lilly,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that Norton Lilly accepted both the disbursements and the statements of account for services rendered without objection or comment of any kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number> Under Florida law, which we are Erie-bound to apply, Norton Lilly\u2019s acceptance of Bryson\u2019s services together with its failure to object to the form or content of the statements billed directly to it, created a prima facie case against Norton Lilly itself, a presumption that it had acquiesced in the debt.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-4\">An account stated is prima facie evidence of the correctness of the items and the liability of a party therefor. This presumed correctness may be overcome by proof of fraud, mistake or error. However, the burden of establishing fraud, mistake or error is upon the party asserting it and unless he disposes of this burden, the presumptive correctness of the stated account becomes conclusive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">Gendzier v. Bielecki, Fla., 97 So.2d 604, 608 (citations omitted).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The district court properly recognized that the facts and circumstances in the case created a prima facie case for plaintiff Bryson, a case which defendant-appellant was obligated to overcome.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1112-6\">Thus, Norton Lilly entered the courtroom disadvantaged. How did it purport to meet this problem? By calling one \u2014 and only one \u2014 witness, Mr. Franco, Treasurer of Norton Lilly &amp; Company. Franco stated that in the February 28, 1972 meeting, the Norton Lilly representatives explained \u201cvery carefully\u201d that Norton Lilly had acquired all of the stock of Sea Way Lines, Inc. and was acting as managing agent for the line.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He testified that \u201cvery clear\u201d instrue-tions were given that Norton Lilly was to be billed as agent for Sea Way.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1112-13\">Plaintiff Bryson, however, called three witnesses whose understanding of the meeting and the business relationship was quite different from that related by Mr. Franco of Norton Lilly. Mr. Roth-stein, Managing Director of Bryson, was in attendance at the February 28 meeting. He testified, \u201c[T]he clear understanding was that we were dealing with Norton Lilly . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This impression was apparently bolstered by the fact that only representatives of Norton Lilly met with Bryson\u2019s people; no Sea Way officers or employees were in attendance at the meeting.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Mr. Hill, Manager of Bryson\u2019s Shipping Department, also attended the February 28 meeting. He stated that Mr. Carl, Norton Lilly\u2019s Miami Manager and Vice President of Sea Way, who was present at the February 28 meeting, indicated that Bryson would be dealing with Norton Lilly now that it had purchased Sea Way Lines.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Hill also testified that, according to the directions of Norton Lilly employees, the old account in Sea Way\u2019s name was closed out and a new account in the name of Norton Lilly was opened.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The final witness for plaintiff was Mr. Duarte, the President of Sea Way Lines, Inc., who testified that Sea Way\u2019s policies were made directly by Norton Lilly, that he had nothing to do with any funds of Sea Way Lines, and \u2022 that he was Sea Way\u2019s sole employee.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number> In view of the initial assumption that Norton Lilly was directly liable, together with the foregoing testimony, was the district court clearly erroneous in concluding that Norton Lilly was itself liable? It must be remembered that a trial court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous only when \u201cthe reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a'mistake has been committed.\u201d United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As Judge Morgan, writing for the Court, recently stated in United States v. State of Florida, 5 Cir., 1973, 482 F.2d 205:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1113-4\">Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that the findings of fact by a district court in actions tried without a jury shall not be set aside unless \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d. . . . Under this rule the determination of the factual content of ambiguous testimony is for a trial court, and such determination can be set aside on review if \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d .... The rule is also applicable insofar as the district court\u2019s conclusion is based on inference drawn from documents or undisputed facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1113-6\">Furthermore, since the jurisdiction of this court is appellate, we have no right to re-try the issues of fact <em>de novo </em>or substitute our judgment with respect to such issues. . . . The function of this court is to determine whether, as a matter of law, the findings sustained the judgment. If, however, the findings of the district court are unsupported by substantial evidence, then the lower court\u2019s decision may be set aside.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1113-11\"><em>Id. </em>482 F.2d at 207-208 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-12\">Moreover, the version of the February 28 meeting most credible and reasonable under the circumstances was for the district judge to decide. Cf. Dillon v. M. S. Oriental Inventor, 5 Cir., 1970, 426 F.2d 977, 978; Chaney v. City of Galveston, 5 Cir., 1966, 368 F.2d 774, 776. Given our limited scope of review, we could not say we had a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction\u201d that the district court erred in deciding the case as it did. Reasonable minds could possibly differ with the court\u2019s conclusion, but the district court was <em>not </em>clearly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-13\"> Norton Lilly makes much of the fact it addressed its mail and signed the February 28 letter \u201cas agents\u201d for Sea Way. This of course ignores the Florida account stated presumption, but the argument is in any case superfluous. Even if Norton Lilly was Sea Way\u2019s agent, and only that, this does not of itself preclude a finding of direct liability. It is hornbook law that an agent can become personally liable for his principal\u2019s debt by express promise or agreement. It is also Florida law. Blount v. Tomlinson, 1909, 57 Fla. 35, 48 So. 751, 754. As stated by the Restatement of Agency 2d, \u00a7 302, comment c: \u201cThe inference that the agent is not a party to a contract may be overcome by proving other facts connected with the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-14\">In such cases, it is for the triers of fact to determine what the parties intended.\u201d The prima facie case for direct liability, combined with the testimony above, is certainly sufficient to prove that, even if Norton Lilly was Sea Way\u2019s managing agent only and signed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>the contract as such, it was nonetheless obligated directly by its express promises to Bryson.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1114-4\">With one fully satisfactory reason for affirming the district court\u2019s finding of liability, we need not search for another. But we would note that there is no equitable reason whatever for Norton Lilly\u2019s denial of liability. Norton Lilly owned all of the stock in the three Liberian corporations holding legal title to the \u201cSea Way vessels.\u201d Norton Lilly was formally empowered to man, operate and supply the vessels. All employees associated with Sea Way Lines, Inc. became employees of Norton Lilly except the President of Sea Way, Mr. Duarte \u2014 but Norton Lilly\u2019s Treasurer, Mr. Carl, supervised even Duarte\u2019s activities.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> All members of Sea Way\u2019s board of directors were Norton Lilly employees. All-cash receipts from Sea Way activities were ordered to be sent directly to Norton Lilly. Norton Lilly requested Bry-son to make disbursements for the vessels out of Bryson\u2019s own funds. Notwithstanding all this, Norton Lilly continues to assert that Sea Way Lines, Inc., and not itself, is the party liable for these expenses, apparently oblivious to the fact that Sea Way, its wholly-owned subsidiary, is in financial straits. We need not and do not decide whether Florida law would find such a unity of interest as to justify ignoring the separation of corporate entities. But surely we may properly look askance at Norton Lilly\u2019s claim that we are dealing here with a standard principal-agent relationship, and that it was acting in accordance with customary business procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-5\">II. THE DENIAL OF ORAL ARGUMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-6\">As the foregoing points out, this case turned almost entirely on factual matters and inferences therefrom. We were given the benefit of good briefs, and appellant, in its Reply brief, was given the opportunity to reiterate its contentions and to challenge appel-lee\u2019s analysis of the case. This was not a case turning on unique or largely legal issues. No voluminous records prevented us from reading the entire trial transcript and exhibits. This case did not involve issues of broad social policy, new questions of governmental prerogatives and personal freedoms, or matters of important precedential value. Rather, this controversy was determined by factual issues which we were not entitled to assess anew.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-9\">For these reasons and others, the three judges on the panel unanimously agreed that oral argument was not necessary for a full and fair resolution. It should be emphasized that this decision was reached only <em>after </em>all three panel members had closely scrutinized the briefs and appendix. Moreover, as the Supreme Court has stated, \u201c[D]ue process of law has never been a term of fixed and invariable content. This is as true with reference to oral argument as with respect to other elements of procedural due process.\u201d F.C.C. v. WJR, The Goodwill Station, Inc., 337 U.S. 265, 275, 69 S.Ct. 1097, 1103, 93 L.Ed. 1353 (1949) (citations omitted). <em>See also </em>Huth v. Southern Pacific Co., 5 Cir., 1969, 417 F.2d 526, 529-530. Indeed, the Third Circuit, in a recent en banc decision, rejected a contention that denial of oral argument and disposition by summary decision pursuant to Third Circuit Local Rule 12(6) constitute a violation of due process as guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment. N.L.R.B. v. Local No. 42, Int. Ass\u2019n of Heat &amp; F.I. &amp; A. Workers, 3 Cir., 1973, 476 F.2d 275. We agree with the Third Circuit on the constitutional issue. Oral argument is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>not always helpful, nor is it the <em>sine qua, non </em>of fair dispositions. In many cases, oral argument is merited and may be essential, but this certainly is not one of those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-5\">III. THE PROCEDURE OF THE PANEL</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-6\">Part I of this opinion illustrates not only that the record supports the decision of the panel, but also that we did indeed carefully consider and scrutinize the record in making our determination. Full and meticulous consideration is given to all cases, whether summarily decided or orally argued. In Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir., 1969, 409 F.2d 804, Chief Judge Brown, as spokesman for this Court, outlined our screening procedures and emphasized the precautions taken to assure fairness and full scrutiny.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1115-7\">The important thing is that this screening is a judicial one performed by Judges, not the Clerk or other non-judicial staff. It is done through a series of standing panels of three Judges, made up of Active Fifth Circuit Judges only. Cases are not submitted to a screening panel until all briefs are in or the allowable FRAP time has expired. When eases are ripe for screening they are submitted to the screening panels at random, without reference to subject matter, state of origin, or any other criteria.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1115-8\">As an added safeguard against even the remote possibility of oral argument being denied by a single Judge, the procedure calls for unanimous panel action to put the case on the Summary Calendar. Carrying it a step further, if after placing it on the Summary Calendar, any member of the panel has doubts or unresolved differences with the proposed opinion, the ease is automatically removed and reclassified for full or limited argument. In other words, the classification of the case and its disposition must be unanimous. This demands informed, individual action by each panel member which will always equal, if it does not exceed, that required for an orally argued case. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1115-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 806. The system thus requires double unanimity \u2014 three active judges must agree both to the decision on the merits of the case and to the lack of warrant for oral argument, otherwise oral argument is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-12\">The reasons assigned by appellant to justify a rehearing are meritless, and are dismissed as such. The Petition for Rehearing is denied, and no member of this panel nor judge in regular active service on the Court having requested that the Court be polled on rehearing en banc (Rule 35, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; Local Fifth Circuit Rule 12), the Petition for Rehearing En Banc is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1111-5\">.

Appellant concedes, however, that it was engaged in a regular course of business with Bryson \u2014 it merely contends such business was transacted only as an agent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1112-8\">.

Appellant takes issue with the district court\u2019s adoption of plaintiff\u2019s proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. The clearly erroneous test is to be applied whether the lower court personally prepares such findings and conclusions or adopts those submitted by counsel. Railex Corp. v. Speed Check Co., 5 Cir. 1972, 457 F.2d 1040, 1042, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 876, 93 S.Ct. 125, 34 L.Ed.2d 128 (1972); United States v.

Cameron Iron Works, 5 Cir., 1961, 289 F.2d 355, 356. We nonetheless reiterate our disfavor of the occasional use of this practice by district judges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1114-7\">. As to the issue of whether any direct representations were made by Norton Lilly to Bryson, we note that the February 28 letter contained the following provision: \u201cIt is understood that if disbursements exceed freight collections, Norton Lilly then will replace Agents [Bryson] in funds.\u201d App. 203. This statement, in its context, is ambiguous, but it could, and probably did, reinforce Bry-son\u2019s understanding that it might look directly to Norton Lilly if Bryson were forced to defray costs out of its own funds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1114-11\">.
