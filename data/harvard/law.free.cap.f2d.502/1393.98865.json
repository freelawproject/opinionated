S.C. \u00a7 2182). The board held that the AEC was entitled to direct the Commissioner of Patents to issue the patent to it. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-24\">Section 152 provides, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1457-25\">Any invention or discovery, useful in the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy, made or conceived in the course of or under any contract, subcontract, or arrangement entered into with or for the benefit of the Commission, regardless of whether the contract, subcontract, or arrangement involved the expenditure of funds by the Commission, shall be vested in, and be the property of, the Commission, except that the Commission may waive its claim to any such invention or discov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1394\">*1394</page-number>ery under such circumstances as the Commission may deem appropriate, consistent with the policy of this section. No patent for any invention if on discovery, useful in the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy, shall be issued unless the applicant files with the application ... a statement under oath setting forth the full facts surrounding the making or conception of the invention or discovery . ... The Commissioner of Patents shall as soon as the application is otherwise in condition for allowance forward copies of the application and the statement to the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1458-5\">The Commissioner of Patents may proceed with the application and issue the patent to the applicant (if the invention or discovery is otherwise patentable) unless the Commission, within 90 days after receipt of copies of the application and statement, directs the Commissioner of Patents to issue the patent to the Commission</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1458-6\">\u2022x- * * * # *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1458-7\">In our view, the decisive question is whether the language in section 152, \u201cuseful in the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy,\u201d reaches appellants\u2019 invention, which is described below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-8\">\n<em>The Invention</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-9\">Involved here is the patent application of Piper et al., serial No. 784,231, filed December 16, 1968, for \u201cAntiradiation Agents.\u201d The application claims certain chemical compounds stated to be useful as antiradiation agents, the disclosure of utility being as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1458-10\">Such compounds are potentially useful in several different areas. Thus, for example, in X-ray therapy it is desirable to provide a drug which can be administered to a subject and which will then provide protection against the harmful effects of X-ray radiation. Antiradiation agents may also be useful in providing protection against other sources of harmful radiation such as may be encountered by personnel in the fringe areas of a nuclear explosion or by space travelers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1458-12\">The application discloses that the claimed compounds were tested on mice by peritoneal injection of solutions or suspensions of the drugs and then exposing the mice so treated to \u201clethal radiation, i. e., 825 roentgens of X-rays or 950 to 1050 roentgens of gamma rays.\u201d It is stated that no uninjected control mice survived for 30 days, whereas various percentages of the treated mice survived for 30 days according to the drugs administered and the size of the doses. It is assumed that the disclosure of utility of the claimed compounds as antira-diation agents was found sufficient inasmuch as that is the only utility disclosed and the application was allowed. The invention was developed in the course of a contract between appellants\u2019 employer and the U. S. Army Medical Research and Development Command. That the contract was for the benefit of the AEC for purposes of section 152 is not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-13\">\n<em>Proceedings Below</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-14\">Subsequent events were in accordance with procedures under section 152. The Patent Office first called on the applicants to file a statement under oath or a declaration disclosing the circumstances under which the invention was made, because it appeared to be \u201cuseful in the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy.\u201d Applicants filed such a declaration, which showed that the invention was made by them as employees of Southern Research Institute under a contract it had with the U. S. Army Medical Research and Development Command, No. DA-49-193-MD-2028, for the synthesis of potential antiradiation drugs. At the same time, applicants\u2019 attorneys argued that the compounds claimed in the application are not \u201cuseful in the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy\u201d within the meaning of section 152 and that the AEC should, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1395\">*1395</page-number>therefore, have no interest in the patent application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-5\">Pursuant to section 152, the AEC thereafter directed the Commissioner of Patents to issue a patent on the invention to it as the agent of the United States of America; applicants then requested a hearing before the Board of Patent Interferences, which docketed the proceeding, Case No. 245/71, on May 20, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-6\">On May 28, 1971, applicants filed with the board a motion for summary judgment, supported by argument, reciting the following (emphasis supplied);</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-7\">This proceeding has been instituted under Section 152 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2182) to determine whether the Atomic Energy Commission is entitled to the title to the Piper at [sic] al application involved in this proceeding and to the patent which will issue thereon. It is believed that there is no question as to the facts involved in this proceeding and that <em>the sole issue involved relates to statutory interpretation.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-8\">* -X- -x- *\u25a0 -\u00bb -X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-9\">It is believed that a proper interpretation of the language used in Section 152 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1952 [sic, 1954] (42 U.S.C. 2182) will be dispositive of this proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-10\">Section 152 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 applies only to an \u201cinvention or discovery, useful in the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy.\u201d Therefore, if the invention disclosed in the Piper et al application is not \u201cuseful in the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy,\u201d then the Atomic Energy Commission has no rights in the application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-11\">\u2022X* \u201cX<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> -Jf \u25a0Jr if -X*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-12\">For the foregoing reasons, it is respectfully submitted that there is no genuine issue in this proceeding as to any material fact and that upon the facts before the Board of Patent Interferences, a summary judgment should be granted as a matter of law in favor of petitioners, James R. Piper et al.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1459-14\">The AEC filed an opposition to this motion and itself moved for summary judgment. Both its motion and its opposition were predicated, inter alia, on the proposition that the applicants\u2019 compounds <em>are </em>\u201cuseful in the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy,\u201d within the meaning of section 152. Thus the issue was joined on the single question of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-15\">\n<em>The Board Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AzWZ\">The board\u2019s statements and holdings of significance to this appeal were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-16\">The parties having raised no issue of fact, these motions, plus other papers relating to the matter, raise before us a single dispositive issue as to which oral arguments were presented on behalf of both parties at a hearing on September 16, 1971.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-17\">The issue is whether the new compounds (antiradiation drugs) claimed in this application are or are not useful in the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy, within the purview of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-18\">-X- * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-19\">. Whether the contract was for the benefit of the Atomic Energy Commission is not an issue here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-20\">\u2666X- * * * * \u2022*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-21\">It is apparent in view of the arguments presented by the parties that the breadth of the language of 42 USC 2182 under consideration is anything but clearly delimited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-22\">-X- * * * * -X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-23\">[W]e hold that under the facts of this case, where the efficacy of the drugs is so proximately related to the actual production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy as a protective agent for those involved in such activity, the invention is useful in the produc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1396\">*1396</page-number>tion or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy within the purview of 42 USC 2182. Therefore, petitioners\u2019 motion for summary judgment is denied and respondent\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-4\">Accordingly, we hold in this case the Atomic Energy Commission is entitled to the direction [to the Commissioner of Patents to issue the patent to it] here in issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1460-5\">\n<em>Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-6\">The words in section 152 of the Act, \u201cuseful in the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy,\u201d are by no means clear. Obviously, they could be so broadly construed as to include inventions relating to nuts and bolts on <em>general purpose </em>machinery used in the production of atomic energy \u2014an absurd result which is not to be attributed to the Congress. See United States v. American Trucking Associations, Inc., 310 U.S. 534, 543, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 84 L.Ed. 1345 (1940); United States v. Ryan, 284 U.S. 167, 175, 52 S.Ct. 65, 76 L.Ed. 224 (1931). They could be interpreted to encompass inventions which, like that of appellants, appear to have a use predominantly in the nongovernmental sector.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And they could be interpreted to exclude such inventions. As the board well said, the breadth of the statutory language \u201cis anything but clearly delimited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-7\">A statute must be construed to achieve its clear objective, and if two constructions are possible, one achieving and the other defeating that objective, the former prevails. See Shapiro v. United States, 335 U.S.. 1, 31, 68 S.Ct. 1375, 92 L.Ed. 1787 (1048). The objective of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 was recommended by the President in his message to the Congress on February 17, 1954,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-12\">5. <em>Liberalize </em>the patent provisions of the Atomic Energy Act, principally by expanding the area in which <em>private </em>patents can be obtained to include the production as well as utilization of fissionable material . [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1460-13\">That Congress adopted this recommendation is shown by the statement in the reports of both the Senate and House of Representatives that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-14\">It [The Atomic Energy Act of 1954] accomplishes the purposes, set forth in the President\u2019s February 17 message to the Congress.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"am6-dedup-0\">The board\u2019s approach, giving \u201cuseful in\u201d a broad meaning in favor of the government, would narrow rather than expand the area in which private patents can be obtained \u2014 contrary to the objective of the Act. In contrast, that objective is achieved by giving \u201cuseful in\u201d a narrower meaning to expand the area for private patents to include appellants\u2019 invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-15\">Our conclusion is reinforced by the apparent lack of an essential or fundamental relationship which appellants\u2019 invention bears to the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy. Nowhere in appellants\u2019 application is there any suggestion that the compounds, per se, are essential or fundamental to such production or utilization. At most, the application merely states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-16\">Antiradiation agents <em>may </em>also <em>be useful </em>in providing protection against other sources of harmful radiation such as may be encountered by person<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1397\">*1397</page-number>nel in the fringe areas of a nuclear explosion or by space travelers. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1461-5\">Indeed, counsel for appellee candidly admitted during oral argument that production of atomic energy is exactly the same, whether people in the area have the compound in them or not. And ap-pellee\u2019s brief states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1461-6\">Thus, if the invention of this application will provide protection against the harmful effects of radiation as the application states, . . . personnel engaged in the acts of making, refining or separating plutonium <em>could </em>use this drug as a radioprotective agent against the harmful effects of the radiation from the plutonium. It <em>might conceivably be used </em>in lieu of, or supplemental to, radiation shielding in carrying out these acts of plutonium production. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1461-8\">Section 153 of the Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2183)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> relating to \u201cnonmilitary utilization\u201d and compulsory licensing, effectively limits the \u201cpublic interest\u201d in patents, issued pursuant to section 152, to inventions or discoveries of <em>primary importance </em>in the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> thus :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1461-9\">(a) The Commission may, after giving the patent owner an opportunity for a hearing, declare any patent to be affected with the public interest if (1) the invention or discovery covered by the patent is <em>of primary importance in the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy; </em>and (2) the licensing of such invention or discovery under this section is of primary importance to effectuate the policies and purposes of this chapter. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1461-14\">\u2022X- -X- <em>* </em>* * -X-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1461-15\">Similarly, section 158 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2188), another \u201cpublic interest\u201d section, limits special relief in antitrust law violations to patents or discoveries \u201cof primary use\u201d in the utilization or production of special nuclear material or atomic energy. See Helvering v. N. Y. Trust Co., 292 U.S. 455, 464-465, 54 S.Ct. 806, 78 L.Ed. 1361 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-16\">The board held that appellants\u2019 invention is \u201cuseful in the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy,\u201d because it is \u201cproximately related\u201d thereto as a protective agent for personnel engaged in such activities. However, we can find no basis in the legislative history or in the statute itself for such an interpretation, and no presumption of correctness attaches to such interpretation. See Fitch v. Atomic Energy Commission, 491 F.2d 1392 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-17\">Appellee argues that the board was correct in holding that there is nothing in the statute that limits its application to. inventions which are <em>solely </em>useful in the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy, and we would agree. It then cites the board\u2019s reference to the authority .vested in the Atomic Energy Commission by section 31 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2051) to conduct research and development activities relating to the protection of health and the promotion of safety during research and production activities; also the board\u2019s conclusion that inventions or discoveries falling within the areas of health and safety would fall within the authorized activities of the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1398\">*1398</page-number>and thus were intended to be covered by section 152 as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-4\">The fatal defect in this conclusion is that the 1954 Act struck out section 11(b) of the 1946 Act, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq8\">No patent hereafter granted shall confer any rights with respect to any invention or discovery to the extent that such invention or discovery is used in the conduct of research or development activities in the fields specified in section 3. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1462-5\">Section 3 of the 1946 Act was the predecessor of section 31 of the 1954 Act. No replacement provision for section 11(b) was included in the 1954 Act to exclude the private sector from patents involving research and development in the protection of health and the promotion of safety during research and production activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-6\">In view of the foregoing, we hold that appellants\u2019 invention is not \u201cuseful in the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy,\u201d within the meaning of section 152 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-7\">The decision of the board is reversed. Reversed.</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1460-8\">.

Vesting in the AEC of title <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to the patent in this case, in my view, is not mandated by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-18\">Because we are presented with a contractor-developed invention and a statutory provision, \u00a7 152, concerned with the right of the AEC to take title to patents on certain of such inventions, I would begin with at least the premise that the AEC may have such right in this case. The case is here because the invention before us has a use not totally oblivious to the existence of nuclear material or atomic energy. The burden of persuasion that the board erred rests upon appellant, the decision below being entitled as always to great weight. Nonetheless, the appeal is from a summary judgment and the sole question before us, i. e. whether <em>this </em>invention is within or without the statute, is one of law. That question turns on the relationship of the invention to the \u201cproduction or utilization * * * atomic energy.\u201d Each invention, and its use, must be independently analyzed, requiring that each case involving that phrase in \u00a7 152, of which this is the first, be determined on its own facts. The establishment of guidelines, or pigeon-holes into which future inventions may fall, must await delineation in future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-20\">In the present case, I am convinced that the board erred in interpreting the statutory phrase \u201cuseful in\u201d as though it read \u201cuseful in proximate relation to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1399\">*1399</page-number>The board\u2019s sole duty in this case, and ours, is to determine a single issue, i. e. to decide whether the statutory phrase \u201cuseful in the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy\u201d is of sufficient breadth to encompass the particular chemical compounds before us. In accomplishing that duty, it would appear unnecessary, and unwise, to substitute a new phrase for that employed in the statute by the Congress. Mindful of the dangers attending the exercise of such judicial powers, I find in the present case no requirement therefor. Neither the fact that we approach our duty in a precedential void, nor the fact that we are presented by the parties with conflicting interpretations, would justify the approach undertaken by the board in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1463-5\">Moreover, I regard the new language substituted by the board as productive of less certainty, not more, in the future application of \u00a7 152. Future cases, as indicated above, will involve different inventions, the nature of which is necessarily unpredictable. It would be at least as difficult, if not more difficult, to apply to such future inventions the phrase \u201cuseful in <em>proximate </em>relation to\u201d as it is to apply \u201cuseful in\u201d to the invention now before us. In such future cases we would then be interpreting our own word, \u201cproximate,\u201d rather than the statute itself. Hence, I would limit our decision to the facts before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-6\">In all events, I believe a consideration of the facts of the case provides sufficient basis for our decision. The primary fact is the invention itself. The surrounding facts are those related to the environment in which the invention is used.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-7\">\n<em>The Invention</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-8\">The invention relates only to <em>chemical compounds. </em>The claims are totally devoid of any reference whatever to any use. .No relationship appears in any claim to the \u201cproduction or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy.\u201d No claim refers in any manner to \u201cradiation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-11\">Of course the chemical compound must have utility. Though tested only on mice, we must assume, for the purposes of this case, that the compound is useful in protecting humans against the effects of radiation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-12\">Although the parties employ the handy label \u201cantiradiation drug,\u201d the invention does not prevent the occurrence of radiation. It neither produces nor uses radiation. It has nothing whatever to do with radiation <em>per se. </em>The invention necessarily works only on the effects of radiation, which effects can occur only in or upon a living organism. The invention necessarily works the same, regardless of the source of radiation, the \u201cproduction or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy\u201d being only one such source.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-13\">\n<em>Environment of Use</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"aux-dedup-1\">Thus, as above indicated, the use of the invention occurs at a special place. The invention is useful \u201cin\u201d the bodies of mice or men. It is useful \u201cin\u201d nothing else.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-14\">The use of the invention also occurs at a different time. Clearly, the invention before us, by its very definition, has no use at all until after special nuclear material or atomic energy has been produced and utilized. Regardless of when they may be injected or ingested, and regardless of how they work, internally or externally of the body, the compounds of the invention cannot perform their intended protective function until after radiation occurs and reaches or approaches the body to be protected. Then, and only then, can the compounds act to blunt or assumedly defeat, the ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1400\">*1400</page-number>fects of radiation in or upon the body. That the body may be bombarded by a continuing series of gamma rays does not conflict with the fact that the invention can act against the effects of each ray only after that ray is generated. Until there is radiation there is nothing to be protected against. If the compounds did not require the presence of radiation (from some source) for their utility, the case would not have arisen. In sum, use of the compounds requires the presence of radiation, not the other way round.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-4\">The use of this particular invention, against the effects (on humans) of radiation is simply too remote, in my view, to bring the invention within the purview of \u00a7 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-5\">\n<em>\u201cProduction and Utilization\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-6\">The statute speaks of \u201cproduction or utilization.\u201d The actual production and utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy are totally unaffected by the invention. As agreed at oral argument, special nuclear material and atomic energy are producible and utilizible in exactly the same way, for the same purposes, and with the same devices, as they have been for years, whether the invention is present or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-7\">\u201cProduction\u201d and \u201cutilization\u201d are action words.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The present invention takes no part whatever in the <em>act </em>of producing or in the <em>act </em>of utilizing special nuclear material or atomic energy. The invention is totally passive in relation to such production or utilization. It never \u201cgets into the act.\u201d It is just <em>there, </em>in the bodies of mice or men. A contractor-developed invention which has no effect whatever on \u201cproduction or utilization or special nuclear material or atomic energy\u201d cannot be said to be useful <em>in </em>such production or utilization, so as to require the AEC to take title to the patent thereon under \u00a7 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-10\">The only things anyone can do with atomic energy are to produce it and use it. It is clear that the Congress was and remains concerned with the producing of atomic energy and the using of it. Hence its language \u201cuseful in the production or utilization * * *.\u201d The chemical compounds before us neither produce nor utilize special nuclear material or atomic energy. Title to a patent thereon may therefore be safely left in the hands of appellant in full compliance with the overall intent of Congress to encourage private industry. For the AEC to take title to this particular invention is contrary to that intent. At the same time, such taking would do nothing to further Congress\u2019 concern for control over production and use of atomic energy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-12\">\n<em>The \u201cAbsence of the Invention\u201d Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-13\">All of appellee\u2019s arguments resolve into a single hypothetical. Fairly summarized, the argument runs, \u201cIn the absence of the invention, there may be some situations in which special nuclear material or atomic energy could not be pi'oduced or utilized by unprotected workers.\u201d No evidence of any such situation is of record. From that sole hypothetical, counsel urges the conclusion that the invention must be \u201cuseful in\u201d such production or utilization.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1464-14\">The difficulty with employing a hypothetical absence of the invention (rather than what it is and what it does to what) as the sole decision making device lies in its breadth of application. It is difficult, if not impossible, to conceive of an invention which might escape the designation of \u201cuseful in the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy\u201d if one need only imagine circumstances under which such production or utilization would- be impeded by the absence of the invention from those circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1401\">*1401</page-number>The most that can be said for appel-lee\u2019s hypothesis is that use of these chemical compounds might, under some circumstances, be <em>ancillary </em>to the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy. The difficulty is that that is not what the statute says.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-5\">Similarly, certain items within the hypothesis are clearly exempt. Appellee\u2019s counsel admitted, with admirable candor at oral argument, that a tranquilizer invention in the bodies of nervous workers, though it enabled use of atomic ene-gy where it couldn\u2019t otherwise be used, would <em>not </em>be \u201cuseful in\u201d such production or utilization under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-6\">It is clear, nonetheless, that appellee\u2019s hypothesis formed the fundamental basis for the board\u2019s decision, which was that the \u201cefficacy of the drugs is so proximately related to the actual production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy as a protective agent for those involved in such activity\u201d as to bring the invention under \u00a7 152. But that holding redrafts the statute to add \u201cproximate relation to\u201d after \u201cuseful in.\u201d As indicated above, I find no warrant for such redrafting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-7\">Contrary to the board\u2019s statement, the \u201cefficacy\u201d of the compounds is necessarily upon or within the person whose body contains them, not on the \u201cactual production\u201d of atomic energy. As ap-pellee admits, the compounds themselves have no efficacy whatever vis-a-vis the actual production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy. Only the imagined circumstances of ap-pellee\u2019s argument, hypothesizing some production or utilization circumstances occurring in the absence of the invention, could have led the board to the view that the compounds somehow had an efficacy related, even proximately, to \u201cactual production\u201d of atomic energy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-8\">The board supplies no compelling reason for interpreting \u201cuseful in the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy\u201d as encompassing inventions only \u201cproximately\u201d related to such production or utilization. For the reasons stated, I regard the invention as \u201crelated\u201d only to the effects of radiation on the bodies of mice or men, which effects occur after such production or utilization. But even if the board\u2019s \u201cproximately related\u201d characterization, based on counsel\u2019s hypothetical, be given full credence, I find erroneous the notion that the present chemical compounds, the use of which is only \u201cproximately\u201d related to production or utilization of atomic energy, are also used sufficiently \u201cin\u201d such production or utilization as to bring them within the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-11\">The future may well disclose a class of inventions which are not directly employed in the actual production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy but which are so closely related to, or so directly affect, such production or utilization as to fall within the provisions of \u00a7 152. In my view, the chemical compounds before us are not of that class.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-12\">Hence I would find that chemical compounds which are used only in the bodies of persons exposed to radiation, and only to counteract or preclude the effects of such radiation, are not so \u201cuseful in the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy\u201d as to bring such' compounds within the purview of \u00a7 152. Accordingly, and on that basis, I would reverse the decision of the board.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1462-9\">. I disagree witli major portions of the approaches to statutory interpretation in the majority and dissenting opinions. The result reached by the majority accords with Congress\u2019 overall liberalizing intent. I find no compelling evidence that Congress had an opposite intent when it came to \u00a7 152. Congress could hardly make \u201cmore strict\u201d what had not previously existed. Contrast, the liberal provision, in \u00a7 152 as originally enacted, for waiver of title by the AEC to patents on inventions unquestionably within \u00a7 152. The 1961 amendment of \u00a7 152 totally deleted all inventions made by those engaged in \u201cother relationships\u201d with the AEC. H. R.Res.8599, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., 107 Cong.Res. 16953 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"ANf\">We should not interpret a new provision, enacted with and as part of a new, liberalizing Act, in such manner as to achieve the intent of the old Act. Certainly we should not do so without strong guidance in that direction from the Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-22\">Moreover, I find no valid distinction, in this context, between the opportunity to \u201cget\u201d patents and the opportunity to \u201cget title\u201d to patents, or between government employees and government contractors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1462-23\">. Only title is at issue. The AEC\u2019s existing royalty-free license to make, have made, and use the invention for all governmental purposes is not material to the question before us. Whether the AEC should or should not control the use of the invention for non-governmental purposes, in private hospitals, clinics, X-ray laboratories, and power plants, is equally irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1463-9\">. For example, having rejected the addition of a certain modifier (\u201cdirectly\u201d) on the \u201cground\u201d that Congress could have inserted that modifier if it had wanted to, a view applicable to any interpretation, the board then proceeded to insert its own modifier (\u201cproximate relation to\u201d) after \u201cuseful in\u201d in the statute. Obviously Congress could have inserted \u201cproximate relation to\u201d if it had \u201cwanted to.\u201d It didn\u2019t.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1464-8\">.

I agree with the reports that the AEC Act accomplishes the purpose set forth in the President\u2019s message. That purpose was accomplished, however, not by \u00a7 152, but by the changes Congress made in \u00a7 11 of the 1946 Act by enacting \u00a7 151 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1402\">*1402</page-number>1954 Act. Section 152 was an <em>entirely new </em>section which deals with something entirely different from the \u201carea in which private patents can be obtained,\u201d of which the President spoke. If there is in the statute an intent to \u201cliberalize,\u201d the question to ask is \u201cliberalize what?\u201d I answer by saying \u201cto liberalize \u00a7 11\u201d by enacting \u00a7 151, and I will now show why.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-4\">The majority, like appellants, confuses the sections of the patent provisions of the 1954 Act which deal, first, with the <em>rights of all inventors, whether they are employed by the Government or anyone else, to get private patents </em>in the field of atomic energy, which was the subject of \u00a7 11 of the 1946 Act and is the subject of \u00a7 151 of the 1954 Act, and, second, with the <em>disposition of title to inventions made under contracts with the AEC, </em>the subject of \u00a7 152 and \u00a7 159 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2189) of the 1954 Act, which have no counterparts in the 1946 Act. The former is what Congress liberalized; the latter was made, if anything, more strict by the 1954 Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-5\">As the majority notes, the President called upon Congress to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1466-6\">Liberalize the patent provisions of the Atomic Energy Act, <em>principally by expanding the area in which private patents can be obtained to include the production as well as utilization of fissionable material </em>* * *. [Additional emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1466-7\">Congress responded by deleting \u00a7 11(b) in the 1946 Act and replacing \u00a7 11(a)(1) and (2) with new sections 151(a) and (b) where, among other things, the recitation of \u201cproduction of fissionable material\u201d was <em>dropped </em>in order that, under the revised section, private patents could be granted and confer rights in inventions useful in the production of fissionable material. If \u00a7 152 is to be considered in the same light as \u00a7 151, it would indeed be strange that Congress put into \u00a7 152 essentially the same wording, \u201cproduction of special nuclear material,\u201d which it deleted from \u00a7 151 to liberalize the patent provisions according to the President\u2019s request. The answer, of course, is that Congress did not take away in \u00a7 152 that which it gave in revised \u00a7 151 because the two sections relate to different matters. Section 151 deals with the fields in which the Patent Office may <em>grant </em>patents, or in which the patents granted confer rights (i. e., the area in which private patents can be obtained), while \u00a7 152, as shown by its title, deals only with the <em>disposition of title </em>to patents where the invention is made or conceived while the inventor is <em>under a contract with or for the benefit of the AEC. </em>Accordingly, the legislative history supporting liberalization of the patent provisions does not apply to \u00a7 152, and thus the majority is in error in saying that the board\u2019s, or this court\u2019s, construction of the language of \u00a7 152 has anything to do with expanding \u201cthe area in which private patents can be obtained \u2014[and is therefore] contrary to the objective of the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-9\">\n<em>Substitution of Language</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-10\">The concurring opinion chides the board and the dissent for indulging in the substitution of its own language for that of the statute. I do not believe that the board\u2019s use of the term \u201cproximately related to,\u201d in the portion of the board\u2019s opinion quoted by the majority, is properly characterized as a substitution of the language \u201cuseful in proximate relation to\u201d for the \u201cuseful in\u201d of the statute. I believe the board was properly characterizing what it believed was the <em>relationship of this invention to </em>the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy, and the board was no more engaging in the substitution of language than does the concurring opinion when it makes the following four statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1466-11\">The use of this particular invention, against the effects (oh humans) of radiation is simply too remote, in my view, to bring the invention within the purview of \u00a7 152.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1466-12\">\u2022X- -X- * -X- * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1403\">*1403</page-number>A contractor-developed invention which has no effect whatever on \u201cproduction or utilization of special nuclear vfhaterial or atomic energy\u201d cannot be said to be useful in such production or utilization * * *. * * * The chemical compounds before us neither produce nor utilize special nuclear material or atomic energy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1467-7\">\u25a03fr \u2022X\u2019 if \u2022X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1467-8\">The future may well disclose a class of inventions which are not directly employed in the actual production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy but which are so closely related to, or so directly affect, such production or utilization as to fall within the provisions of \u00a7 152.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1467-9\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1467-10\">If the board\u2019s statement is to be looked upon as a substitution of language, then a much more serious substitution of language occurs, I believe, in the statement of the majority that notes \u201cthe apparent lack of an <em>essential or fundamental relationship </em>which appellants\u2019 invention bears to the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy.\u201d (Emphasis mine.) I ask what is an \u201cessential or fundamental relationship\u201d to atomic energy, and how is it to be determined? It seems to me that if Congress wanted the Commissioner to issue patents on contractor-made inventions to the AEC which bore an \u201cessential or fundamental relationship\u201d to atomic energy, it would have said so, and would probably have used words very much like those it did use in <em>other </em>sections of the Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> namely, \u00a7 153 and \u00a7 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-12\">If \u00a7 152 is to be interpreted as requiring \u201can essential or fundamental relationship * * * to the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy,\u201d where Congress stated that the invention need only be \u201cuseful in\u201d such production or utilization, then must not other provisions of the Act containing the same language be given the same restrictive meaning? The same phrase, \u201cinvention . . . useful in the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy,\u201d appears throughout the patent provisions of the Act. Some of these sections, like \u00a7 157(b)(3), benefit the public. Does not the holding of the majority mean that one making an invention which lacks \u201can essential or fundamental relationship\u201d to atomic energy, etc., <em>cannot now get an award </em>under the above section? Similarly, does not the majority\u2019s reliance on the assumed fact that \u201cproduction of atomic energy is exactly the same\u201d whether the invention is used or not to show that the invention has no \u201cfundamental or essential relationship\u201d mean that the AEC can now deny claims for awards under \u00a7 157 for such things as the shielding mentioned by the majority\u2019s quotation from the AEC\u2019s brief because plutonium can be produced without it? This seems to be a short-sighted approach to statutory language which only requires the invention to be \u201cuseful in\u201d atomic energy, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-17\">\n<em>Section SI of the Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-18\">The majority\u2019s reliance upon section 31, and its predecessor, section 3, seems misplaced. The majority treats its discovery that \u00a7 11(b) was amended in 1954 to remove a reference to \u00a7 3 as an easy answer to \u201cthe board\u2019s conclusion that inventions or discoveries falling within the areas of health and safety would fall within the authorized activities of the Commission and thus were <em>intended to be covered by section 152 as well.\u201d </em>(Emphasis mine.) In fact, the board\u2019s reference to \u00a7 31 was not to show that \u00a7 152 would cover health and safety inventions, but only to show that present \u00a7 31 would give the AEC the right to contract for such health and safety inventions and thus, in the words of the board, the AEC \u201cin issuing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1404\">*1404</page-number>direction under consideration here * * * did not reach beyond the limits of what it was in fact authorized and directed to do by direct arrangement with such a contractor.\u201d <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The reference to \u00a7 3 in the 1946 Act, which was omitted in 1954, was <em>in section 11(b), </em>as noted by the majority, and, as previously noted, like section 1.1\u2019s replacement, section 151, it deals only with the right of inventors to get patents and not the disposition of title to inventions made under AEC contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-5\">\n<em>Other Sections of the Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-6\">The majority considers the language of \u00a7 153 and \u00a7 158 to control in some way the meaning of \u00a7 152. It is not clear to me how the <em>different </em>words Congress used in these sections has any bearing on the meaning of the words in the section which we must here construe. There is no basis for the majority\u2019s statement that \u00a7 153 \u201ceffectively limits the \u2018public interest\u2019 in patents, issued pursuant to section 152 * * Section 153 has no connection at all with \u00a7 152; it is only a provision for compulsory licensing of patents and gives the AEC the right to declare a patent \u201cto be affected with the public interest.\u201d The patents are not \u201cpursuant to section 152.\u201d As noted earlier, \u00a7 152 is not a patent-granting or patent-issuing statute; it deals only with the disposition of rights in inventions made in the course of or under AEC contracts. Reliance upon the language of \u00a7 153 here shows again that the majority has not appreciated the fact that \u00a7 152 has nothing whatsoever to do with the <em>issuance </em>of patents. I fail to see how the use by Congress of different language in \u00a7 153, and \u00a7 158, has a bearing on the meaning of \u00a7 152. If anything, the fact that Congress chose to use <em>different </em>language in these sections suggests that Congress meant the sections to have <em>different </em>meanings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-9\">\n<em>The Concurring Opinion .</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-10\">The concurring opinion, under the heading \u201cEnvironment of Use,\u201d states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1468-11\">Clearly, the invention before us, by its very definition, has no use at all until after special nuclear material or atomic energy has been produced and utilized. Regardless of when they may be injected or ingested, and regardless of how they work, internally or externally of the body, the compounds of the invention cannot perform their intended protective function until after radiation occurs and reaches or approaches the body to be protected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1468-12\">I know of no support in the record for the proposition that \u201cthe invention before us, by its very definition, has no use at all until after special nuclear material or atomic energy has been produced and utilized.\u201d Lethal radiation is not only released after special nuclear material and atomic energy are produced and utilized, but <em>during </em>the production and utilization process as well. For example, in the process of producing the \u201cspecial nuclear material,\u201d plutonium, radiation is emitted during the production process as well as from the final product. Even, however, if the statement of the concurring opinion were true, utility <em>after </em>production or utilization would not mean a lack of utility <em>in </em>production and utilization, which' is all the statute requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-13\">Secondly, I fail to see the relationship <em>to utility </em>(\u201cuseful in\u201d) of the admitted fact that \u201cthe compounds of the invention cannot perform their intended protective function until after radiation occurs and reaches or approaches the body to be protected.\u201d Raincoats and umbrellas cannot perform their intended protective function until after rain occurs and reaches or approaches the body of the user either, but this does not make them any less <em>useful in </em>fulfilling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1405\">*1405</page-number>that function. As noted in the portion of the AEC brief quoted by the majority, the compounds of the invention are considered to be an alternative to, or supplement to, radiation shielding. The parties have not controverted the utility of conventional shielding in the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy, but the test established by the concurring opinion would read conventional shielding out of the statute as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-5\">The second reason why the concurring opinion finds the invention to be without the statutory language is that \u201cspecial nuclear material and atomic energy are producible and utilizable in exactly the same way, for the same purposes, and with the same devices, * * *, whether the invention is present or not.\u201d If the concurring opinion means by this statement and by the assertion that the \u201cinvention is totally passive * <em>* * </em>[and] never \u2018gets into the act\u2019 \u201d that the invention serves only <em>as an emergency backup safety system, </em>then such a rationale would read out of the statute all such backup system inventions. If what the statement means is that regardless of the presence of the drugs in an operator or another who is near a reactor or plutonium production apparatus which is <em>releasing radiation at lethal levels, </em>the reactor or apparatus will function just the same, then the concurring opinion takes a myopic view of utility. A requirement that in order to be <em>\u201cuseful\u201d </em>an invention affect the production or utilization so as to modify it seems to me to be asking for the very standard which the concurring opinion vehemently rejects, the \u201cabsence of the invention\u201d test. If one must ask whether \u201cspecial nuclear material and atomic energy are producible and utilizable in exactly the same way, for the same purposes, and with the same devices * * *, whether the invention is present or not,\u201d is not this a requirement that the AEC prove that in the \u201cabsence of the invention,\u201d the utilization and production \u201cin exactly the same way * * * with the same devices\u201d would not be possible? Further, such a requirement would mean that such things as a reactor containment vessel and all of its concomitant radiation shielding apparatus would also not be \u201cuseful in\u201d atomic energy, etc., because the reactor would run the same way without such shielding. To require that the production or utilization of atomic energy or special nuclear material somehow be affected by the presence of the invention appears, therefore, to be a much too stringent requirement where the language used by Congress only requires that the invention be \u201cuseful.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1469-9\">Finally, it is the view of the concurring opinion that \u201cAll of appellee\u2019s arguments resolve into\u201d the single argument that \u201cIn the absence of the invention, there may be some situations in which special nuclear material or atomic energy could not be produced or utilized by unprotected workers.\u201d I cannot agree that this is a correct summary of appel-lee\u2019s arguments, which deal primarily with the meaning of the words of the statute. In fact, I have studied in detail all of the briefs of appellee before the board and this court, and the only evidence of such an argument appears in the single statement appellee\u2019s counsel made in response to a question from the bench at oral argument, which statement is as follows: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1469-10\">In the- case of a nuclear reactor or in the case of a laboratory where gamma radiation is produced and utilized, the persons in the area could be injected before they begin the reactions which produce the gamma radiation, and if they were very effective, perhaps certain reactions which take place would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1406\">*1406</page-number>be rendered possible, whereas in the absence of radio-protective drugs it would be impossible to run the experiments. In any event, if the drugs have the utility that the application alleges they do, there is still the foreseeable use of injecting, for example, an operator around a nuclear reactor who is apt to be exposed to gamma radiation from the reaction, and thereby he could conduct certain work in that area which in the absence of the drugs he could not conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1470-4\">In my view, the AEC did not ask that the ease be decided on the basis of the \u201cabsence of the invention\u201d argument but only on the wording of the statute. Further I do not find in the opinion of the board reliance upon an \u201cabsence of the invention\u201d test as a standard for determining whether an invention is \u201cuseful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-5\">I do not know the mental processes of the board any better than the author of the concurring opinion, but I do not find in the language of the board any basis for the statement of the concurring opinion; and it is improper, in my view, to attribute such a hypothetical foundation to the language of the board. I read the statement of the board which uses the word \u201cproximately\u201d as an effort by the board to note the proximity, or closeness, of this invention to atomic energy, etc., and to distinguish such inventions as the \u201ctranquilizer\u201d discussed by the concurring opinion. What the board was saying, I believe, was only that the compounds of the invention work against the very effect of atomic energy and special nuclear material production and utilization, radiation, while other inventions, such as tranquilizers, would not be so closely, or proximately, related to such production or utilization.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-9\">\n<em>My Decisional Basis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-10\">I would affirm the decision of the board. I am satisfied that there is a logical answer to each and every one of appellants\u2019 arguments and I find that the ordinary meaning of the statutory phrase \u201cuseful in the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy\u201d encompasses this invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-11\">While the breadth of the language of the statute is, as noted by the board, \u201canything but clearly delimited,\u201d I would limit our decision to the facts of this case<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and hold, as did the board, that \u201cthe efficacy of the drugs is so proximately related to the actual production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy as a protective agent for those involved in such activity\u201d that it is within the purview of \u00a7 152. In the posture in which this case comes before us it must be assumed that the invention will protect people, as well as mice, from the effects of gamma rays which are given off \u201cin the production <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1407\">*1407</page-number>* * * of [the] special nuclear material,\u201d plutonium, and is thus \u201cuseful in\u201d the production of such material.</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-4\">I am convinced that if Congress had not intended such a construction of its language, it would have used more limited phrases or limiting modifiers such as the majority now substitutes and such as Congress used in many other sections of the Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Congress not having done so, however, I conclude that Congress must have intended the broader scope of the broader language it used. Accordingly, on the required assumption that the invention would save human lives, as it did the lives of the mice, I find the invention to be \u201cuseful in the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy\u201d and would affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1467-14\">. See footnote 5 of the majority opinion which notes that Congress replaced the very word \u201cessential\u201d with the words \u201cof primary importance in\u201d in the 1954 Act in another section of the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1468-8\">. This is really a minor argument of the board, anyway, compared with the many pages the board spent construing the meaning of the terms of the statute it had to interpret.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1469-11\">. If such is the test to be applied, however, then the example given by counsel for appel-lee, discussed shortly, would suggest that the invention here fulfills it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1470-6\">. I do not believe that we should pre-decide that \u201cinventions relating to nuts and bolts on <em>general purpose </em>machinery used in the production of atomic energy\u201d are not within the statutory language. This is not the case before the court, and such statements will only make it more difficult for the court to decide other cases in the future, which may involve general purpose machinery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-7\">The statement of the majority opinion also suggests that the invention \u201c[has] a use predominantly in the nongovernmental sector.\u201d I do not find this supported by the record; and nothing is gained by speaking not of use in atomic energy, but predominant use in the nongovernmental sector. The implication of footnote 1 in the majority opinion is that the AEC counsel was giving a \u201cvivid example\u201d of use of the invention in the nongovernmental sector, when, in fact, I believe he was speaking only generally of the use of the invention \u201cin the area around a nuclear reaction, nuclear reactor, say for the production of electrical energy,\u201d and said nothing about whether nuclear reactors are governmental or nongovernmental. Section 2 of the Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2012) even seems to show a Congressional finding that the use of atomic energy and special nuclear material is, at least to some extent, a governmental function.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1471-5\">. For example, as has been shown, when Congress wanted to use the phrase \u201cof primary use in\u201d in \u00a7 153, it did so. Congress also used this more limiting language in \u00a7 158 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2188).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
