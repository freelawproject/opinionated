BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1076-10\">As with the companion case,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>we deal with race track problems of Seminole Downs, this time a controversy spanning two reorganizations and being between the Trustee in the 1971 reorganization proceeding and creditors of the earlier 1964 Chapter X proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-11\">The specific question is whether the District Court, reversing the recommended order of the Referee in Bankruptcy sitting as a special master, had appropriate power under Chapter X to effectuate a secured interest in favor of the 1964 Certificate Holders in the Florida racing permit as called for by the 1964 plan of reorganization even though the Bank, as indenture trustee<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the sinking fund failed to perfect the lien under the Florida UCC. We hold that power exists and was appropriately exercised and affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-23\">The 1964 Plan of Reorganization (confirmed in 1966) provided for issuance of Reorganization Certificates of Indebtedness <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to unsecured creditors to be administered by the Bank under the sinking fund trust.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plan expressly provided that payment was to be secured by a lien on the Florida state racing permit<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and other specified property.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1076-24\">Unfortunately, in 1972 it was discovered in connection with the Bank\u2019s claim for unsecured 1964 creditors in the 1971 proceedings that the financing statement required by \u00a7 679.401 of the Florida <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>UCC to be filed in the Secretary of State\u2019s office failed to list as property covered the Florida state racing permit. The Bankruptcy Trustee contended, and the special master agreed, that the Florida UCC controlled and extinguished the secured interest of the Certificate Holders in the racing permit. The District Court disagreed and held the security valid by virtue of the Court\u2019s powers to see that the 1964 plan was in fact complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"A0k_\">As the parties race to the finish line the controversy centers on \u00a7 229 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 629.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AvZc\">The Trustee invokes \u00a7 229 by arguing that there had been literal full compil-anee with elements (a)(1), (2), and (3) \u2014 indeed the District Court virtually found this to be a fact.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Trustee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>argument goes on to urge that, since everything required to be done under the plan had in fact been done, for the Court to take action in 1972 by virtue of the 1964 proceedings would amount to an attempt to belatedly modify the plan which is the very thing \u00a7 229 was to forbid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">The Bank, on the other hand, embracing \u00a7 229 just as enthusiastically, argues that the entry of the 1972 order under attack does not in any sense amount to an amendment of the plan but is simply one giving full fidelity to the express provisions of the plan through an order effectuating it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">Fortunately, in resolving the problem of \u00a7 229 we are spared the necessity of treating it in detail in view of our extensive discussion in <em>Atlas.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As we there pointed out, the section serves several important functions. In many ways it is the key to the whole of Chapter X which, as its name reflects, envisages that out of the proceedings will come a new reorganized company capable of sailing forth in the cold, cruel business world with no longer the protective wraps of the federal Bankruptcy Court. Section 229 furnishes the objective criteria for determining when that stage has arrived. As a corollary of this it means also that the Bankruptcy Court has no day-to-day supervision of the business operation of the new enterprise. And one of the principal reasons for its enactment was to inhibit Bankruptcy Courts, either because of economic changes or other circumstances, from succumbing to the temptation too infrequently resisted to second guess the approved plan of reorganization by establishing what was in fact a new plan in the guise of a simple order or an amendment. The possibility that the Bankruptcy Court would, or could legally, do this would be a depressant to the acceptance of the new entity by new creditors, customers, bankers and others dealing with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-6\">But while maintaining the integrity and finality of the approved plan as consummated and preventing Bankruptcy Courts from making changes after that stage are the important functions of \u00a7 229, the very nature of a statute which seeks to determine when the plan is consummated is to assure that the plan approved is consummated in fact. Whatever the plan calls for must be done. The Bankruptcy Court has the power to see that that is done, and \u00a7 229 is no obstacle either to the existence of power or the timeliness of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-7\">A key part of the 1964 plan was the satisfaction of claims of the unsecured creditors. This was to be effected through Reorganization Certificates. Precise provisions were made as to the source of money (a percentage of the pari-mutuel daily handle) and security for payment in the form of a lien on the Florida racing permit (and some other specified properties), see note 6, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1078-8\">So far was the racing permit immobilized for ultimate use of others than the Certificate Holders, the reorganized company was even expressly forbidden to transfer, incumber or otherwise dispose of it until the Certificate Holders were satisfied in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-9\">The plan did not merely provide that a mortgage should be given by the reorganized company. The plan stated positively that the Certificate Holders should be secured by a lien on the racing permit. If through oversight, neglect, inadvertence or the like on the part of the Sinking Fund Trustee there were omissions or errors in the recording or filing of the security instruments which would make the security interest of the Certificate Holders something less than that prescribed in the plan, the Bankruptcy Court by appropriate order had the power to accord that status.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-10\">Far from being a belated effort to alter or amend the plan, what the Court did was to make the plan effective. In short, it was to order the plan to be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>summated. This was in full keeping with the express holding and action in <em>Atlas,</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> supra, </em>384 F.2d at page 89.</p>\n<p id=\"ags-dedup-1\">Affirmed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1076-12\">.
