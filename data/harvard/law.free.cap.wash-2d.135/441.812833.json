The right may be limited, in rare circumstances, when necessary to further an important state interest and, then, only if the procedures used for taking the evidence adequately ensure the reliability of that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The purpose of RCW 9A.44.150 and the procedures set forth in the statute meet this standard. Accordingly, we hold the statute withstands constitutional scrutiny. We also hold that it was properly applied in this case and we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Defendant Boyd (Spud) Foster was convicted by a jury of first degree child molestation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The victim was a six-year-old girl.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">The trial court held two pretrial hearings to determine whether the child was competent to testify. The first was held in the courtroom, with the Defendant present. The second was held by closed-circuit television. In the second hearing, the child testified from the judge\u2019s chambers and the testimony was broadcast five into the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>In the initial hearing, the child testified that she had been to Kid\u2019s Court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that she understood the difference between telling the truth and telling a lie. However, she was unable to promise that she would tell the truth about the incident involving Defendant Foster. Her responses to repeated questions with respect to whether she would tell the truth about what happened were \u201cI might\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Report of Proceedings at 76-80. On redirect examination, the prosecutor asked the child the reason she was not able to promise to tell the truth. The testimony was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-4\">Q. If I ask you what happened with Spud [Defendant\u2019s nickname], will you tell me the truth or will you tell me a lie?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">A. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">Q. If I tell you that you have to tell me the truth, will you tell me the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">A. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-8\">Q. Is it because of the courtroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-10\">Q. Are you feeling shy because Spud is here? ... If you couldn\u2019t see Spud, would you be able to tell what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-12\">Q. If you couldn\u2019t see him, would you be able to tell me the truth about what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-13\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-14\">Q. Is it because you can see him that you feel that you can\u2019t tell the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-4\">Q. You don\u2019t want to say anything about what happened, you don\u2019t want to talk about it, because you see him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">Q. Are you afraid that something might happen if you tell the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">Q. It\u2019s just because you see him, that makes you scared?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">Report of Proceedings at 80-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">The trial court ruled that the child\u2019s statements to her mother and others about the alleged molestation were reliable and admissible hearsay statements, under RCW 9A.44.120, if corroborated or if the child was competent and chose to talk. However, the court determined that the child was not competent because she could not promise to tell the truth. Following the hearing, the child was unusually subdued. She repeatedly said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know he was going to be there.\u201d Report of Proceedings at 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-12\">Two days later the trial court held \u00e1 second competency hearing. This second hearing was conducted via closed-circuit television. The child victim, the victim\u2019s advocate, the prosecutor, defense counsel, the court reporter, and the technician operating the equipment were in the judge\u2019s chambers. The judge, Defendant, bailiff and court clerk were in the courtroom. There was an open microphone so that the judge could communicate with the attorneys and there was a two-way system for private communication between the Defendant and his counsel. The persons in the courtroom were able to view the video screen, and it showed an accurate reproduction of the judge\u2019s chambers.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-13\">During the second hearing the child answered questions more easily. She testified that she knew the difference between the truth and a he and testified about what she had learned when she attended Kid\u2019s Court. Her testimony, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>response to questions posed by the prosecutor, included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\">Q. What was the first rule of Kids\u2019 Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">A. Don\u2019t lie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">Q. Was there a second rule?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">A. If you don\u2019t know something, you say you don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">Q. Will you promise to tell the truth today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-10\">Q. What will happen if you don\u2019t know, what will you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-11\">A. Say I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-12\">Q. Will you promise to tell the truth about what happened with you and Spud?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-13\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-14\">Q. ... Do you know Spud?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-15\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-16\">Q. You promise to tell the truth about everything that happened with Spud?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-17\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-18\">Report of Proceedings at 241-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-19\">Testimony continued, in response to questions by defense counsel, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-20\">Q. ... [D]o you remember when you were in the courtroom with us?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-21\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-22\">Q. Do you remember you told the judge that you might tell her the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-23\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Q. Are you still going to tell her the truth, or maybe tell her the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">A. I will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">Q. You will tell the judge the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">(Witness nods head.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">Q. . . . [A]re you afraid of Spud?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-9\">(Witness nods head.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">Q. Has Spud ever threatened you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-11\">(Witness shakes head.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">Report of Proceedings at 242-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-13\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the child spontaneously asked, \u201cWhere is Spud?\u201d The prosecutor told her that the Defendant was in another room. The child then asked if he could hear her, and the prosecutor said, \u201cYes, he can hear you, you just can\u2019t see him.\u201d The child responded, \u201cI don\u2019t care if he can hear me, I just don\u2019t want to see him.\u201d Report of Proceedings at 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-14\">The trial court concluded, following the second hearing, that the child w\u00e1s a competent witness. The court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-15\">I found a great deal of difference between the child that testified the other day and the child who testified today. The child today was clearly competent. I would have found her competent at an earlier time had she promised to tell the truth. Clearly something was definitely bothering her when she testified at the first competency hearing. There was a totally different child that I observed today. What I observed today was an outgoing child. The child that I observed in the competency hearing the other day was a child who was very shy, very quiet, had to be really led by the prosecutor. A child who wouldn\u2019t promise to tell the truth, would just say maybe, and indicated she was afraid of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-16\">I\u2019m convinced, as of the other day, that the child knew what it meant to tell the truth, but that she appeared to be, to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>court, afraid to testify. She wouldn\u2019t promise to tell the truth. Today I think it is clear that the child is competent, that she knows the difference between right and wrong. That she\u2019s able to relate matters and is able to express herself and knows the importance of telling the truth in court....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">Furthermore, it would certainly appear that she is definitely afraid of the defendant. There is no indication that the defendant has made threats, but clearly the child is in fear. She expressed that fear the other day when she testified. She expressed the fear today. She expressed it when she was leaving my chambers. She expressed it, not only in words, but in the way that she communicated in the hearing. It is quite clear that she is afraid of the defendant. I don\u2019t know precisely how or why this fear arose, but it is quite clear to me that she would not be able to testify were she present in court and able to observe the defendant. She was looking at him the other day and it apparently figured very strongly in her mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Report of Proceedings at 250-52. <em>See also </em>Clerk\u2019s Papers at 44-48 (Findings and Conclusions Pursuant to Testimony of Child by Closed Circuit Television).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">The trial court ruled that requiring the child to testify in front of the Defendant would cause her to suffer serious emotional or mental distress that would prevent her from reasonably communicating at trial; that the prosecutor had made all reasonable efforts to prepare the child for trial; that the strength of the State\u2019s case would be significantly impaired without the testimony of the child; and that there was no less restrictive method of obtaining the child\u2019s testimony that could adequately protect her from serious emotional or mental distress. The trial court then ruled that the child would be permitted to testify at trial via closed-circuit television, pursuant to RCW 9A.44.150.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Following the trial, the jury found the Defendant guilty of first degree child molestation.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">The Defendant appealed his conviction on the ground that the child\u2019s testimony by closed-circuit television violated his state and federal constitutional right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>confront witnesses against him \u201cface to face\u201d and also violated his rights to due process and trial by jury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, <em>State v, Foster, </em>81 Wn. App. 444, 915 P.2d 520 (1996), and this court granted review.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">1. Does RCW 9A.44.150, on its face or as applied in this case, violate a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confront witnesses against him?</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">2. Was there substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that requiring the child victim to testify in the presence of the Defendant would cause the child serious emotional or mental distress that would prevent her from reasonably communicating at trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">3. Does testimony \u00f3f a child victim by closed-circuit television deny a defendant his constitutional right to due process or to trial by jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">RCW 9A.44.150, the statute which permits a child witness to testify via one-way closed-circuit television provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>(1) On motion of the prosecuting attorney in a criminal proceeding, the court may order that a child under the age of ten may testify in a room outside the presence of the defendant and the jury while one-way closed circuit television equipment simultaneously projects the child\u2019s testimony into another room so the defendant and the jury can watch and hear the child testify if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">(a) The testimony will describe an act or attempted act of sexual contact performed with or on the child by another or describe an act or attempted act of physical abuse against the child by another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">(b) The testimony is taken during the criminal proceeding;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-7\">(c) The court finds by substantial evidence, in a hearing conducted outside the presence of the jury, that requiring the child to testify in the presence of the defendant will cause the child to suffer serious emotional or mental distress that will prevent the child from reasonably communicating at the trial. If the defendant is excluded from the presence of the child, the jury must also be excluded;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-8\">(e) The court finds that the prosecutor has made all reasonable efforts to prepare the child for testifying, including informing the child or the child\u2019s parent or guardian about community counseling services, giving court tours, and explaining the trial process. If the prosecutor fails to demonstrate that preparations were implemented or the prosecutor in good faith attempted to implement them, the court shall deny the motion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-9\">(f) The court balances the strength of the state\u2019s case without the testimony of the child against the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights and the degree of infringement of the closed-circuit television procedure on those rights;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-10\">(g) The court finds that no less restrictive method of obtaining the testimony exists that can adequately protect the child from the serious emotional or mental distress;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-11\">(h) When the court allows the child to testify outside the presence of the defendant, the defendant can communicate constantly with the defense attorney by electronic transmis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>sion and be granted reasonable court recesses during the child\u2019s testimony for person-to-person consultation with the defense attorney;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">(i) The court can communicate with the attorneys by an audio system so that the court can rule on objections and otherwise control the proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">(j) All parties in the room with the child are on camera and can be viewed by all other parties. If viewing all participants is not possible, the court shall describe for the viewers the location of the prosecutor, defense attorney, and other participants in relation to the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">(k) The court finds that the television equipment is capable of making an accurate reproduction and the operator of the equipment is competent to operate the equipment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-8\">(l) The court imposes reasonable guidelines upon the parties for conducting the filming to avoid trauma to the child or abuse of the procedure for tactical advantage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-9\">The prosecutor, defense attorney, and a neutral and trained victim\u2019s advocate, if any, shall always be in the room where the child is testifying. The court in the court\u2019s discretion depending on the circumstances and whether the jury or defendant or both are excluded from the room where the child is testifying, may remain or may not remain in the room with the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-10\">(3) The court shall make particularized findings on the record articulating the factors upon which the court based its decision to allow the child to testify via closed-circuit television pursuant to this section. The factors the court may consider include, but are not limited to, a consideration of the child\u2019s age, physical health, emotional stability, expressions by the child of fear of testifying in open court or in front of the defendant, the relationship of the defendant to the child, and the court\u2019s observations of the child\u2019s inability to reasonably communicate in front of the defendant or in open court. The court\u2019s findings shall identify the impact the factors have upon the child\u2019s ability to testify in front of the jury or the defendant or both and the specific nature of the emotional or mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>trauma the child would suffer. The court shall determine whether the source of the trauma is the presence of the defendant, the jury, or both, and shall limit the use of the closed-circuit television accordingly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">(4) This section does not apply if the defendant is an attorney pro se unless the defendant has a court-appointed attorney assisting the defendant in the defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">(5) This section may not preclude the presence of both the victim and the defendant in the courtroom together for purposes of establishing or challenging the identification of the defendant when identification is a legitimate issue in the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">(7) All recorded tapes of testimony produced by closed-circuit television equipment shall be subject to any protective order of the court for the purpose of protecting the privacy of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">(8) Nothing in this section creates a right of the child witness to a closed-circuit television procedure in lieu of testifying in open court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-9\">(9) The state shall bear the costs of the closed-circuit television procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">In 1990 the United States Supreme Court held that a substantially similar Maryland statute did not violate the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Maryland v. Craig, </em>497 U.S. 836, 110 S. Ct. 3157, 111 L. Ed. 2d 666 (1990). Defendant Foster concedes that, under the reasoning of <em>Craig, </em>Washington\u2019s statute does not facially violate the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. He argues, instead, that the state constitution\u2019s confrontation clause, Const, art. I, \u00a7 22 (amend. 10), provides greater protection than that provided by the Sixth Amendment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>and that the Washington statute is unconstitutional, on its face, under article I, section 22, or that, as applied in his case, the statute violates his right to confrontation under both federal and state constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Although this court has not previously addressed the issue, the Court of Appeals has determined that the protection afforded by the state and federal confrontation clauses is identical. <em>State v. Florczak, </em>76 Wn. App. 55, 71, 882 P.2d 199 (1994); <em>State v. Whisler, </em>61 Wn. App. 126, 132-33, 810 P.2d 540 (1991) (analysis is the same under both state and federal confrontation clauses). <em>See also Pettit v, Rhay, </em>62 Wn.2d 515, 519-20, 383 P.2d 889 (1963) (the purposes of the state and federal constitutional provisions pertaining to the right of confrontation appear to be the same). However, in <em>State v. Palomo, </em>113 Wn.2d 789, 794, 783 P.2d 575 (1989), this court opined that the state confrontation clause arguably provides greater protection than its federal counterpart but declined to decide the issue because it was not properly presented for review. The issue is properly raised and thoroughly briefed in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The <em>Gunwall </em>Test</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">In deciding whether this state\u2019s constitution extends broader rights than the federal constitution in any particular context, we examine the constitutional guarantees in light of the criteria outlined in <em>State v. Gunwall, </em>106 Wn.2d 54, 720 P.2d 808, 76 A.L.R.4th 517 (1986). It is through the application of these criteria that \u201cRecourse to our state constitution as an independent source for recognizing and protecting the individual rights of our citizens [will] spring not from pure intuition, but from a process that is at once articulable, reasonable and reasoned.\u201d <em>Gunwall, </em>106 Wn.2d at 63 (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The purpose of the <em>Gunwall </em>analysis</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>is two-fold: first, to lend assistance to counsel where briefing might be appropriately directed in cases in which independent state grounds are urged; and second, to help ensure that if the court does use independent state grounds in reaching its conclusion it will consider the six factors to the end that the decision shall be based on well founded legal reasons and not by merely substituting its own notion of justice for that of duly elected legislative bodies or the United States Supreme Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-5\"><em>State v. Boland, </em>115 Wn.2d 571, 575, 800 P.2d 1112 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">We begin our analysis with an overview of the federal right of confrontation because we must first understand the breadth of that right before we can determine whether our state confrontation clause provides greater protection to an accused than does the federal confrontation clause. <em>See, e.g., State v. Rainford, </em>86 Wn. App. 431, 436, 936 P.2d 1210 (our state constitutional analysis begins with federal law only to place the state law in context), <em>review denied, </em>133 Wn.2d 1019 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The Sixth Amendment provides that a person accused of a crime has the right \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d This Sixth Amendment right is applicable to state court proceedings through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 406, 85 S. Ct. 1065, 13 L. Ed. 2d 923 (1965). The primary object of the Confrontation Clause was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">to prevent depositions or <em>ex parte </em>affidavits, such as were sometimes admitted in civil cases, being used against the prisoner in lieu of a personal examination and cross-examination of the witness in which the accused has an opportunity, not only of testing the recollection and sifting the conscience of the witness, but of compelling him to stand face to face with the jury in order that they may look at him, and judge by his demeanor upon the stand and the manner in which he gives his testimony whether he is worthy of belief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-9\"><em>Mattox v. United States, </em>156 U.S. 237, 242-43, 15 S. Ct. 337, 39 L. Ed. 2d 409 (1895).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>The rights guaranteed under the Confrontation Clause include the right to have the witness physically present, to have that testimony offered under oath and subject to cross-examination, and to provide the trier of fact with an opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witness. <em>Craig, </em>497 U.S. at 845-46. The primary interest secured by the Confrontation Clause, however, is the right of cross-examination, \u201c \u2018the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the truth of his testimony are tested.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kentucky v. Stincer, </em>482 U.S. 730, 736, 107 S. Ct. 2658, 96 L. Ed. 2d 631 (1987) (quoting <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 316, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974)). The Court in <em>Stincer </em>called cross-examination the \u201c \u2018greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth,\u2019 \u201d 482 U.S. at 736 (quoting <em>California v. Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 158, 90 S. Ct. 1930, 26 L. Ed. 2d 489 (1970), which, in turn, quoted from 5 John Henry Wigmore, Evidence in Trials at Common Law \u00a7 1367 (3d ed. 1940)); <em>White v. Illinois, </em>502 U.S. 346, 356, 112 S. Ct. 736, 116 L. Ed. 2d 848 (1992); <em>State v. Rohrich, </em>132 Wn.2d 472, 477-78, 939 P.2d 697 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In <em>Craig, </em>the Supreme Court explained that although face-to-face confrontation with witnesses appearing at trial is important, it is not an indispensable element of the right guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. <em>Craig, </em>497 U.S. at 849-50. Face-to-face confrontation is not the sine qua non of the right to confrontation. <em>Craig, </em>497 U.S. at 847. The <em>Craig </em>Court held that interpreting the Confrontation Clause to require face-to-face confrontation in every instance would result in the abrogation of virtually every hearsay exception, 497 U.S. at 848, as well as other exceptions such as the removal from the courtroom of a defendant whose behavior is disruptive. 497 U.S. at 850. <em>See also Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 63, 100 S. Ct. 2531, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1980). The Court in <em>Craig, </em>after reviewing prior Confrontation Clause cases, held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">In sum, our precedents establish that \u201cthe Confrontation Clause reflects a <em>preference </em>for face-to-face confrontation at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>trial,\u201d <em>[Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 63], a preference that \u201cmust occasionally give way to considerations of public policy and the necessities of the case,\u201d <em>[Mattox, </em>156 U.S. at 243]. \u201c[W]e have attempted to harmonize the goal of the Clause\u2014 placing limits on the kind of evidence that may be received against a defendant\u2014with a societal interest in accurate fact-finding, which may require consideration of out-of-court statements.\u201d <em>[Bourjaily v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 171, 182, 107 S. Ct. 2775, 97 L. Ed. 2d 144 (1987)]. We have accordingly interpreted the Confrontation Clause in a manner sensitive to its purposes and sensitive to the necessities of trial and the adversary process .... Thus, though we reaffirm the importance of face-to-face confrontation with witnesses appearing at trial, we cannot say that such confrontation is an indispensable element of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of the right to confront one\u2019s accusers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-5\"><em>Craig, </em>497 U.S. at 849-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">In <em>Craig </em>the Court retreated from its earlier statements in <em>Coy v. Iowa, </em>487 U.S. 1012, 1016-17, 108 S. Ct. 2798, 101 L. Ed. 2d 857 (1988) (holding that the Confrontation Clause guarantees the defendant a physical, face-to-face meeting with the witnesses appearing before the trier of fact), and returned to the reasoning of <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 64 (holding that competing interests, if closely examined, may justify dispensing with face-to-face confrontation at trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Thus, although the right is not absolute, a defendant generally has the right, under the Sixth Amendment, to demand the physical presence, at trial, of accusatory witnesses. This preferred right of physical presence, or \u201cface-to-face\u201d confrontation, may be dispensed with only where denial of such confrontation is necessary to further an important public policy and only where the reliability of the testimony is otherwise assured. <em>Craig, </em>497 U.S. at 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">The Supreme Court has recognized that child abuse \u201cis one of the most difficult crimes to detect and prosecute, in large part because there often are no witnesses except the victim.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 60, 107 S. Ct. 989, 94 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1987); <em>Coy, </em>487 U.S. at 1022-23 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring). Accordingly, in <em>Craig, </em>the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>held that \u201ca State\u2019s interest in the physical and psychological well-being of child abuse victims may be sufficiently important to outweigh, at least in some cases, a defendant\u2019s right to face his or her accusers in court.\u201d 497 U.S. at 853. Under the Sixth Amendment, a state may authorize testimony via one-way closed-circuit television where that procedure is necessary to protect the welfare of the particular child witness who seeks to testify; where the child would be traumatized, not by the courtroom generally, but by the presence of the defendant; and where the emotional distress suffered by the child witness in the presence of the defendant is more than de minimus, i.e., more than mere nervousness or reluctance to testify. <em>Craig, </em>497 U.S. at 855-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">With this background of federal law, we turn to our analysis of this state\u2019s confrontation clause. In determining whether our state constitution\u2019s confrontation clause provides greater protection to defendants than does the Sixth Amendment, we consider the so-called <em>Gunwall </em>factors, namely: (1) the textual language of the state constitution; (2) significant differences in the texts of the parallel provisions of the federal and state constitutions; (3) state constitutional and common law history; (4) preexisting state law; (5) differences in structure between the federal and state constitutions; and (6) whether the subject matter of the particular constitutional provision presents a matter of particular state interest or local concern. <em>Gunwall, </em>106 Wn.2d at 61-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The Defendant\u2019s argument relies primarily on the difference in the language and structure between the federal and state constitutions <em>(Gunwall </em>factors 1, 2 and 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">We have previously concluded that an analysis of the differences in structure (factor 5 of the <em>Gunwall </em>criteria) supports an independent state constitutional analysis in every case. Our consideration of this factor is always the same; that is that the United States Constitution is a <em>grant </em>of limited power to the federal government, while the state constitution imposes <em>limitations </em>on the otherwise plenary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>power of the state. <em>Gunwall, </em>106 Wn.2d at 66; <em>State v. Russell, </em>125 Wn.2d 24, 61, 882 P.2d 747 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">With respect to factors 1 and 2, we look first to the language of our state constitution\u2019s confrontation clause. Article I, section 22 provides, in pertinent part, that an \u201caccused shall have the right ... to meet the witnesses against him face to face.\u201d The parallel provision in the federal constitution provides that an accused has the right \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Although the language of the Sixth Amendment and this state\u2019s confrontation clause is not word-for-word identical, the meaning of the words used in the parallel clauses is substantially the same. <em>See, e.g., </em>William C. Anderson, A Dictionary of Law 226 (1889) (defining the word \u201cconfront\u201d as to \u201cbring face to face\u201d); Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 477, 811 (1986) (defining \u201cconfront\u201d to mean to \u201cbring face to face\u201d; defining \u201cface\u201d to mean to \u201cconfront\u201d). Additionally, the United States Supreme Court has consistently interpreted the language of the Confrontation Clause to mean \u201cface-to-face\u201d confrontation. <em>See, e.g., Mattox, </em>156 U.S. at 244 (an 1895 case in which the Supreme Court stated that the Confrontation Clause guaranteed a face-to-face confrontation at trial); <em>Coy, </em>487 U.S. at 1017.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">We find no significant difference between the language used in the parallel provisions of the state and federal confrontation clauses. Even if we were to determine that the state provision was significantly distinctive, this fact, alone, would be an insufficient reason for relying on the state constitution as an independent ground for decision. <em>State v. Jones, </em>112 Wn.2d 488, 498 n.11, 772 P.2d 496 (1989); <em>State v. Reece, </em>110 Wn.2d 766, 778, 757 P.2d 947 (1988) (analysis of textual differences is the beginning of state constitutional analysis, it is not the end; if it were, the other <em>Gunwall </em>criteria would be superfluous).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The Defendant also argues that state constitutional history supports an independent application of the state confrontation clause <em>(Gunwall </em>factor 3). This third <em>Gun-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number><em>wall </em>factor directs the court to determine whether state constitutional history and common law reflect an intention to confer greater protection from the state government than has been afforded by the federal constitution. <em>Gunwall, </em>106 Wn.2d at 61; <em>Reece, </em>110 Wn.2d at 779.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Although the history of the adoption of a particular constitutional provision sometimes reveals an intention that will support reading the provision independently of federal law, <em>Gunwall, </em>106 Wn.2d at 61, the history of article I, section 22 provides no such support. The Journal of the 1889 Washington State Constitutional Convention is not helpful in determining whether the drafters of the state constitution intended the rights of an accused under the face-to-face language to be broader than those guaranteed under the federal Confrontation Clause.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Journal, in a footnote, indicates that some provisions of Washington\u2019s constitution, including article I, section 22, were identical to the Indiana and Oregon state constitutions. Journal of the Washington State Constitutional Convention, 1889, at 511 n.37 (Beverly P. Rosenow ed., 1962). However, the phrase meet witnesses against him \u201cface to face\u201d is used in many state constitutions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The language appears, as well, in the early statutory law of the Washington Territory. <em>See, e.g., </em>Laws of 1859, ch. 1, \u00a7 2, at 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>\u201cFace to face\u201d confrontation or \u201cphysical presence\u201d of witnesses was generally, but not always, required under the Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause or under common law near the time our state was drafting its constitution. <em>See, e.g., Mattox, </em>156 U.S. 237; <em>Reynolds v. United States, </em>98 U.S. 145, 25 L. Ed. 244 (1878); <em>State v. Baldwin, </em>15 Wash. 15, 18-19, 45 P. 650 (1896) (admission of dying declaration in murder trial did not violate defendant\u2019s right to confront witnesses face to face as it was the practice to admit such statements in this state \u201cup to the present time\u201d); <em>State v. Cushing, </em>17 Wash. 544, 563-64, 50 P. 512 (1897) (admission of deceased witness\u2019s prior testimony did not violate defendant\u2019s right to confront witnesses face to face; such evidence was not intended to be excluded by the constitution).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">A review of the limited history of this state constitutional provision does not reveal an intent on the part of the drafters to create a broader right than that which was stated in the Sixth Amendment and which existed at common law. Therefore, our early constitutional and common law history does not support an analysis of the state confrontation clause independent of the federal right.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">In considering factors 4 and 6 of the <em>Gunwall </em>criteria, we focus on the context in which the issue involving the state constitutional right is raised. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>128 Wn.2d 431, 445, 909 P.2d 293 (1996) (factors 4 and 6 are generally unique to the context in which the interpretation question arises); <em>Russell, </em>125 Wn.2d at 58. Under factor 4 we examine preexisting state law relevant to a defendant\u2019s right to confront, face to face, a child witness who claims to have been physically or sexually abused by the defendant. <em>See Gunwall, </em>106 Wn.2d at 66 (tracing the history of pertinent law from territorial days to the present). Factor 6 requires us to determine whether the right claimed, in the context of the particular case before us, is a matter of such singular state interest or local concern that our constitution should be interpreted independently of the federal constitution. These two factors overlap in this case and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>discuss them together. We consider (1) statutory and case law relating to a defendant\u2019s right to confront witnesses \u201cface to face\u201d and whether that right has historically been interpreted to be absolute and without exception, and (2) a defendant\u2019s right of confrontation as it relates to testimony of young children who are alleged to be victims of sexual or physical abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Since 1859 Washington has recognized a defendant\u2019s right to confront accusing witnesses \u201cface to face.\u201d Laws of 1859, ch. 1, \u00a7 2, at 104.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As originally enacted, the law appeared to guarantee an accused an absolute right \u201cto meet the witnesses against him face to face.\u201d However, in 1881, several years before the state constitution was drafted, this statute was amended to provide for an exception to face-to-face confrontation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At least since that time, neither the statute nor our state confrontation clause has been interpreted literally to provide a defendant with an absolute right to meet accusing witnesses face to face in every instance. <em>Cushing, </em>17 Wash. 544 (admission of deceased witness\u2019s prior testimony at a trial following remand did not violate defendant\u2019s article I, section 22 right to face-to-face confrontation); <em>State v. Bolen, </em>142 Wash. 653, 254 P. 445 (1927) (right to confront witnesses did not apply to documentary evidence of victim\u2019s fingerprints); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>194 Wash. 438, 78 P.2d 561 (1938) (admission of documentary evidence does not violate article I, section 22); <em>State v.

Perkins, </em>32 Wn.2d 810, 204 P.2d 207 (1949) (jury view of crime scene outside presence of defendant does not violate article I, section 22); <em>State v. Ryan, </em>103 Wn.2d 165, 691 P.2d 197 (1984) (upholding this state\u2019s child victim hearsay statute as constitutional).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">In 1975, this court in <em>State v.

United States, </em>221 U.S. 325, 330, 55 L. Ed. 753, 31 S. Ct. 590 (1911). These exceptions are subject to modification and addition, so long as the purpose of the rule is not hindered:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-8\">The exceptions are not even static, but may be enlarged from time to time if there is no material departure from the reason of the general rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-9\"><em>Synder </em>[sic] <em>v.

Ortego, </em>22 Wn.2d 552, 563, 157 P.2d 320, 159 A.L.R. 1232 (1945).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">In recent years, the exceptions to the right have been enlarged, particularly in cases involving the testimony of very young victims. In 1982 the Legislature enacted RCW 9A.44.120, the child victim hearsay statute. Laws of 1982, ch. 129, \u00a7 2. This law provides that hearsay evidence of a child\u2019s descriptions of sexual abuse is admissible at trial if the child testifies or is unavailable and, if unavailable, the evidence is corroborated. In <em>Ryan, </em>this court upheld the constitutionality of RCW 9A.44.120 against a confrontation clause challenge. We recognized that neither the federal nor state confrontation clause has been read literally, for to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>do so would result in eliminating all exceptions to the hearsay rule. <em>Ryan, </em>103 Wn.2d at 169. <em>See also State v. Swan, </em>114 Wn.2d 613, 666, 790 P.2d 610 (1990) (child victim hearsay statute does not violate Sixth Amendment right to face-to-face confrontation).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">In <em>State v. Jones, </em>112 Wn.2d 488, 772 P.2d 496 (1989), we discussed the State\u2019s interest in permitting testimony under the child victim hearsay statute in light of the defendant\u2019s right to test the trustworthiness of the evidence against him. The State\u2019s interest in the present case is similar. In <em>Jones, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">RCW 9A.44.120 is principally directed at alleviating the difficult problems of proof that often frustrate prosecutions for child sexual abuse. Acts of abuse generally occur in private and in many cases leave no physical evidence. Thus, prosecutors must rely on the testimony of the child victim to make their cases. Children are often ineffective witnesses, however. Feeling intimidated and confused by courtroom processes, embarrassed at having to describe sexual matters, and uncomfortable in their role as accuser of a defendant who may be a parent, other relative or friend, children often are unable or unwilling to recount the abuses committed on them ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">RCW 9A.44.120 is responsive to the prosecutor\u2019s need for such hearsay evidence, making it available when it would not otherwise be admissible. The statute is not without its proper limitations, however.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">112 Wn.2d at 493-94 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">More recently, this court has discussed the right to confrontation in child abuse prosecutions in <em>Rohrich, </em>132 Wn.2d 472 (interpreting the meaning of \u201ctestify\u201d as used in RCW 9A.44.120). While primarily relying on the language of the Sixth Amendment right to confrontation, this court noted the applicability of article I, section 22. In <em>Rohrich </em>we recognized that at the core of the right to confrontation is \u201ca preference for live testimony.\u201d <em>Rohrich, </em>132 Wn.2d at 477. We held that live testimony, under oath, subject to cross-examination, and under the watchful eyes of the jury maximizes the accuracy of the truth-seeking process in criminal trials. <em>Rohrich, </em>132 Wn.2d at 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Live testimony is preferred because it is believed that face-to-face confrontation enhances the accuracy of fact-finding. <em>Rohrich, </em>132 Wn.2d at 479; <em>Coy, </em>487 U.S. at 1019 (it is always more difficult to lie about a person \u201cto his face\u201d than \u201cbehind his back\u201d). The nature and purpose of witness examination, however, are to elicit honest testimony, not fearful responses, and to procure the truth, not cause intimidation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Like the Sixth Amendment guarantee, the right to confront accusing witnesses face to face under the Washington constitution has not been interpreted to be absolute. This is particularly true in cases involving young children alleged to have been the victims of sexual abuse. Preexisting law does not support an independent analysis of our state confrontation clause in the context of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The concern of this state in the fundamental right of an accused to confront witnesses against him or her, in the context of child victim testimony, is not unique to the State of Washington <em>(Gunwall </em>factor 6). <em>See, e.g., Maryland v. Craig, </em>497 U.S. at 839 (amicus briefs urging the Supreme Court to uphold the constitutionality of the Maryland child witness protection statute were filed by the attorneys general of 40 states); Karen R. Hornbeck, <em>Washington\u2019s Closed-Circuit Testimony Statute: An Exception to the Confrontation Clause to Protect Victims in Child Abuse Prosecutions, </em>15 U. Puget Sound L. Rev. 913, 915-19 (1992). Washington\u2019s interest in the protection of a defendant\u2019s confrontation right in this context is comparable to the national interest in this same right. An analysis of the sixth <em>Gunwall </em>factor, therefore, does not support an independent analysis of our constitution in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">It is only the textual and structural differences between the Sixth Amendment and article I, section 22 that provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>any support for independent construction of this state\u2019s confrontation clause in the present case. These differences, while important to constitutional analysis, do not, by themselves, generally justify an independent analysis of our constitutional provisions, and they do not justify it in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">For purposes of determining whether RCW 9A.44.150 comports with the confrontation clause, we view the Defendant\u2019s state right to confrontation and his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation as being identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Constitutionality of RCW 9A.44.150</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\"> The confrontation clauses of the state and federal constitutions guarantee the right of an accused to confront witnesses against him or her \u201cface to face.\u201d This is a preferred right of physical presence, or \u201cface-to-face\u201d confrontation, which may be dispensed with only if (1) excusing the physical presence of the particular witness is necessary to further an important public policy and (2) the reliability of the testimony is otherwise assured. <em>Craig, </em>497 U.S. at 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">The important interest of this state in enacting RCW 9A.44.150 is set forth in the legislative declaration of the law\u2019s purposes.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-9\">The legislature declares that protection of child witnesses in sexual assault and physical abuse cases is a substantial and compelling interest of the state. Sexual and physical abuse cases are some of the most difficult cases to prosecute, in part because frequently no witnesses exist except the child victim. When abuse is prosecuted, a child victim may suffer serious emotional and mental trauma from exposure to the abuser or from testifying in open court. In rare cases, the child is so traumatized that the child is unable to testify at trial and is unavailable as a witness or the child\u2019s ability to communicate in front of the jury or defendant is so reduced that the truth-seeking function of trial is impaired. In other rare cases, the child is able to proceed to trial but suffers long-lasting trauma as a result of testifying in court or in front of the defendant. <em>The creation of procedural devices designed to enhance the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number><em>truth-seeking process and to shield child victims from the trauma of exposure to the abuser and the courtroom is a compelling state interest.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Laws of 1990, ch. 150, \u00a7 1 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The Supreme Court has held that a state\u2019s interest in protecting child abuse victims from the emotional trauma of testifying is sufficiently important to permit a child witness to testify at trial via one-way closed-circuit television, if the state makes an adequate showing of necessity on a case-by-case basis. <em>Craig, </em>497 U.S. at 855.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">The Court held that the requisite finding of necessity must be case specific and must include: (1) a finding by the trial court that the use of the closed-circuit television procedure is necessary to protect the welfare of the particular child witness who seeks to testify; (2) a finding by the trial court that the child witness would be traumatized, not by the courtroom generally, but by the presence of the defendant; and (3) a finding by the trial court that the emotional distress suffered by the child witness in the presence of the defendant is more than de minimus. <em>Craig, </em>497 US. at 855-56. The Court in <em>Craig </em>declined to decide the minimum showing required before the closed-circuit television procedure could be used because the Maryland statute, like the Washington statute, RCW 9A.44.150, required a showing that the child would suffer serious emotional distress such that the child cannot reasonably communicate. The Court held this statutory standard \u201cclearly suffices to meet constitutional standards.\u201d <em>Craig, </em>497 U.S. at 856. The Defendant points out that Washington\u2019s statute, unlike the Maryland statute, permits the procedure in cases where the child witness will experience \u201cserious emotional or mental distress that will prevent the child from reasonably communicating <em>at the trial,\u201d </em>RCW 9A.44.150(l)(c) (emphasis added), rather than permitting the procedure only where emotional trauma \u201cprevents the child from reasonably communicating.\u201d The Defendant argues that the inclusion of the term \u201cat the trial\u201d in the Washington statute goes beyond the decision in <em>Craig. </em>We disagree. The state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>statute, like the statute before the court in <em>Craig, </em>deals with a child\u2019s inability to testify, at trial, in the presence of the defendant. <em>Craig </em>held that the st\u00e1te\u2019s interest in protecting children <em>\u201cfrom the trauma of giving testimony </em>in child abuse cases\u201d was the important state interest justifying the televised testimony. <em>Craig, </em>497 U.S. at 853 (emphasis added). It did not hold, as Defendant Foster suggests, that the state\u2019s interest is limited to preventing trauma to children in a general sense which is unrelated to the child\u2019s ability to testify. The Court in <em>Craig </em>was concerned about the ability of the child to testify as a witness at trial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">Indeed, where face-to-face confrontation causes significant emotional distress in a child witness, there is evidence that such confrontation would in fact <em>disserve </em>the Confrontation Clause\u2019s truth-seeking goal....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">In sum, we conclude that where necessary to protect a child witness from trauma that would be caused by testifying in the physical presence of the defendant, at least where such trauma would impair the child\u2019s ability to communicate, the Confrontation Clause does not prohibit use of a procedure that, despite the absence of face-to-face confrontation, ensures the reliability of the evidence by subjecting it to rigorous adversarial testing and thereby preserves the essence of effective confrontation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-7\"><em>Craig, </em>497 U.S. at 857 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">We agree with the Court of Appeals in the present case that the degree of emotional distress required by RCW 9A.44.150(l)(c) is \u201cthat degree which renders the child unable to reasonably communicate in the defendant\u2019s presence at trial\u2014no more and no less.\u201d <em>Foster, </em>81 Wn. App. at 454-55. This standard comports with the standard approved of in <em>Craig.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Like the statutory scheme examined in <em>Craig, </em>Washington\u2019s statutory procedure set forth in RCW 9A.44.150 preserves all of the elements of the confrontation right except physical face-to-face confrontation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-10\">The child witness must be competent to testify and must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>testify under oath; the defendant retains full opportunity for contemporaneous cross-examination; and the judge, jury, and defendant are able to view (albeit by video monitor) the demeanor (and body) of the witness as he or she testifies. Although we are mindful of the many subtle effects face-to-face confrontation may have on an adversary criminal proceeding, the presence of these other elements of confrontation\u2014oath, cross-examination, and observation of the witness\u2019 demean- or\u2014adequately ensures that the testimony is both reliable and subject to rigorous adversarial testing in a manner functionally equivalent to that accorded live, in-person testimony .... [T]o the extent the child witness\u2019 testimony may be said to be technically given out of court (though we do not so hold), these assurances of reliability and adversariness are far greater than those required for admission of hearsay testimony under the Confrontation Clause. We are therefore confident that use of the one-way closed circuit television procedure, where necessary to further an important state interest, does not impinge upon the truth-seeking or symbolic purposes of the Confrontation Clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-5\"><em>Craig, </em>497 U.S. at 851-52 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Washington\u2019s statute, on its face and as applied in this case, is limited in its application to children who are under the age of 10 and whose testimony will describe an act or attempted act of sexual contact performed with or on the child by another or describe an act or attempted act of physical abuse against the child by another. RCW 9A.44-.150(l)(a). The testimony must be taken during the criminal proceeding. RCW 9A.44.150(l)(b). There must be no less restrictive method of obtaining the testimony that can adequately protect the child. RCW 9A.44.150(l)(g). The defendant must have constant communication with defense counsel by electronic means and must be granted reasonable recesses during the child\u2019s testimony for person-to-person contact with the defense counsel. RCW 9A.44- . 150(1) (h). All parties in the room with the child must be on camera, the television equipment must be capable of making an accurate reproduction, and there must be no abuse of the procedure for tactical advantage. RCW <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>9A.44.150(l)(j)-(l). The prosecuting attorney must have made all reasonable efforts to prepare the child for testifying. RCW 9A.44.150(l)(e). The child must be competent to testify must testify, in person, at trial, must testify under oath, must be subjected to the rigors of cross-examination, and must be visible, through electronic means, during testimony so that the jury may observe the child\u2019s demeanor during testimony. We hold that these procedures are adequate for ensuring the reliability of the child\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Under the reasoning of <em>Craig, </em>we hold that the use of closed-circuit testimony, when necessary and under the procedures and protections outlined in RCW 9A.44.150, does not violate a defendant\u2019s right to confront the witnesses against him or her, as guaranteed by article I, section 22 of our state constitution and by the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Sufficiency of Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The Defendant next argues that substantial evidence did not exist in this case to support a finding that the child involved here would suffer serious emotional or mental distress sufficient to satisfy the standard of <em>Craig </em>or of RCW 9A.44.150(l)(c). That subsection of the statute requires the court to find by substantial evidence that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">requiring the child to testify in the presence of the defendant will cause the child to suffer serious emotional or mental distress that will prevent the child from reasonably communicating at the trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">In making this finding, the trial court may consider</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">the child\u2019s age, physical health, emotional stability, expressions by the child of fear of testifying in open court or in front of the defendant, the relationship of the defendant to the child, and the court\u2019s observations of the child\u2019s inability to reasonably communicate in front of the defendant or in open court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">RCW 9A.44.150(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Substantial evidence exists when the record contains evidence of sufficient quantity to persuade a fair-minded, rational person that the declared premise is true. <em>Ino Ino, Inc. v. City of Bellevue, </em>132 Wn.2d 103, 112, 937 P.2d 154, 943 P.2d 1358 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>118 S. Ct. 856 (1998); <em>World Wide Video, Inc. v. City of Tukwila, </em>117 Wn.2d 382, 387, 816 P.2d 18 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">Here the evidence included two competency hearings. The trial court was able to observe the demeanor of the child on two occasions\u2014once in the presence of the Defendant and once by closed-circuit television, outside the presence of the Defendant. The trial court also heard the child\u2019s testimony that she was scared when she was in the presence of the Defendant, and that she was so afraid she could not promise to tell the truth if she could see him. The trial court heard the child\u2019s spontaneous remarks in chambers with respect to her fear of testifying in the Defendant\u2019s presence. The court heard evidence of the child\u2019s behavior following the first hearing. This personal observation of the child\u2019s ability to communicate when testifying both in and out of the Defendant\u2019s presence in this case, coupled with the statement made by the child, is of a sufficient quantity to persuade a fair-minded person that testifying in the presence of the Defendant would cause her to suffer such serious emotional or mental distress that she would not be able to reasonably communicate at trial. It is doubtful that expert testimony from counselors or psychologists could have added much to the trial court\u2019s basis for assessment in this case. <em>See Wildermuth v. State, </em>310 Md. 496, 530 A.2d 275 (1987) (a case cited with approval in <em>Craig, </em>497 U.S. at 856, and in which testimony was taken only from experts and then primarily about the effects of testifying on children generally); Allison C. Goodman, <em>Two Critical Evidentiary Issues in Child Sexual Abuse Cases: Closed-Circuit Testimony by Child Victims and Exceptions to the Hearsay Rule, </em>32 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 855, at 866-67 (1995) (questioning the accuracy and neutrality of expert testimony in these kinds of cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">In the present case, the trial judge had the opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>to personally observe the effects of the circumstances on the child victim herself. The trial court found that the child suffered severe emotional and mental distress after the first competency hearing, and that the Defendant was her source of trauma. The only reason the trial court initially found the child incompetent to testify was because the child suffered emotional distress to the point where she was unable to reasonably communicate in the Defendant\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">We conclude the trial court had substantial evidence to find that the child victim would suffer serious emotional distress that would prevent her from reasonably communicating at trial if she were required to testify in the presence of the Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Due Process/Right to Jury</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The Defendant argues that the child\u2019s testimony by closed-circuit television denied him his right to due process because it impacted the presumption of innocence. The Defendant appears to argue that he was unable to present a defense claiming that the child witness was not telling the truth. In fact, the Defendant had the opportunity to, and did, cross-examine the child, Report of Proceedings at 285-89, and was able to, and did, argue that the child\u2019s story was not accurate. Report of Proceedings at 505-13. However, he argues that he was not able to give the jury the additional evidence of having the child\u2019s reactions to him while the child testified in his presence. The Defendant cites no authority for this proposition. The child testified that she understood the difference between a lie and a truth and she understood the importance of telling the truth in court. She was sworn and testified under oath. The jury was able to observe the child\u2019s demeanor as she testified. The jury was instructed to treat the televised testimony the same way it treated all testimony. A jury is presumed to follow the court\u2019s instructions. <em>Hizey v. Carpenter, </em>119 Wn.2d 251, 269-70, 830 P.2d 646 (1992); <em>State v. Imhoff, </em>78 Wn. App. 349, 351, 898 P.2d 852 (1995). There is nothing in the record to indicate the televised testimony affected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>jury\u2019s ability to decide the case fairly. The only evidence the jury did not see was what the trial court described as the child\u2019s fear of the Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">The Defendant also argues that he was denied the right to a jury trial because the jury viewed the child via closed-circuit television, rather than in person. The Defendant argues that the television camera reduced 12 sets of eyes to one set. Under the statute, and the trial court\u2019s directions, all of the individuals in chambers during the child\u2019s testimony were on camera. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the jury\u2019s ability to perceive and to observe the child witness was diminished or manipulated by the televised procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">We find no constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The right to face-to-face confrontation under the federal and state confrontation clauses, while a fundamental and important right of an accused, is not absolute. The right must occasionally give way to considerations of public policy and the necessities of the case. However, any encroachment upon this right should be rare and may be justified only as necessary on a case-by-case basis and, then, only when the encroachment does not impinge upon the truth-seeking purpose of the constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">Durham, C.J., and Dollxver and Talmadge, JJ., concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b496-10\"><em>mCW </em>9A.44.083 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">\u201c(1) A person is guilty of child molestation in the first degree when the person has . . . sexual contact with another who is less than twelve years old and not married to the perpetrator and the perpetrator is at least thirty-six months older than the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">\u201c(2) Child molestation in the first degree is a class A felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-13\">RCW 9A.44.010(2) defines \u201csexual contact\u201d as \u201cany touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of a person done for the purpose of gratifying sexual desire of either party or a third party.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b497-15\">Kid\u2019s Court is a program operated in King County which is designed to prepare children who are alleged to be victims of sexual abuse and assault for their appearance at trial.

The focus of the program is to demystify the courtroom for young children who will be required to testify. <em>State v. Carlson, </em>66 Wn.

After oral argument the State moved to exclude this issue and two other issues which the State claims were raised for the first time at oral argument. We agree with the Defendant that no new issues were raised at oral argument. With respect to the issue allegedly first raised in the supplemental brief, we conclude that although the Defendant claims he objected to being excluded from the physical presence of the child at the second competency hearing, the objection is not clear from the record. Report of Proceedings at 232 (objection to leading questions). Furthermore, there is no Confrontation Clause violation under the Sixth Amendment where a defendant is excluded from a competency hearing so long as the defendant has the opportunity to cross-examine a child witness at trial, and where the questions asked at the competency hearing are limited to matters which are not related to the basic issues at trial. <em>Kentucky v.

I disagree with that conclusion and join the dissent in its conclusion that an analysis indepen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>dent of the Sixth Amendment confrontation right is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">I part company with the dissent, however, in its conclusion that article I, section 22 requires, in all circumstances, an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation between witnesses and the accused. That view of article I, section 22 is too rigid and inflexible. For reasons I set forth hereafter, I prefer a more flexible and enduring view of article I, section 22 and conclude, therefore, that the procedures outlined in RCW 9A.44.150 do not run afoul of that provision. Accordingly, I join the result reached by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The dissent correctly acknowledges that all that we know of the history of article I, section 22, is that, upon adoption, it was identical to the confrontation clauses of the constitutions of the states of Indiana and Oregon. Dissent at 488 (citing <em>Journal of the Washington State Constitutional Convention, 1889, </em>at 511 n.37 (Beverly P. Rosenow ed., 1962)). In examining, then, how this court should construe the meaning of the \u201cface-to-face\u201d language in article I, section 22, I agree that it is instructive to turn first to the examples of those two states. Unfortunately, in doing so the dissent draws the wrong conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The Oregon Supreme Court, in contrasting the \u201cconfrontation\u201d language used in other state constitutions with the \u201c \u2018face to face\u2019 formulation\u201d employed in article I, section 11 of Oregon\u2019s constitution has written only that \u201c[w]e do not suggest any difference in meaning between these phrases.\u201d <em>State v. Smyth, </em>286 Or. 293, 593 P.2d 1166, 1168 n.3 (1979). Moreover, the Oregon Supreme Court has noted that \u201c[i]n interpreting Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution, the court has looked to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decisions interpreting the federal <em>parallel </em>Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>State v. Hancock, </em>317 Or. 5, 854 P.2d 926, 933 n.8 (1993) (emphasis added). Although Oregon appellate courts have not been confronted with a case similar to the present case, what they have written so far provides no support for the dissent\u2019s position. Indeed, it is curious that the dissent quotes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>language from <em>Smyth </em>wherein the Oregon Supreme Court embraces the United States Supreme Court\u2019s construction, in <em>Mattox v. United States, </em>156 U.S. 237, 15 S. Ct. 337, 39 L. Ed. 409 (1895), of the Sixth Amendment confrontation right. Dissent at 489. By doing this the dissent sets a trap for itself. After all, if the Oregon Supreme Court is to be bound by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s Sixth Amendment jurisprudence in interpreting Oregon\u2019s own confrontation clause, surely it must follow that it would agree with the holding in <em>Maryland v. Craig, </em>497 U.S. 836, 110 S. Ct. 3157, 111 L. Ed. 2d 666 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The Indiana Constitution also contains \u201cface-to-face\u201d language in its article I, section 13 confrontation clause. The dissent correctly observes that the Indiana Supreme Court nullified, as violative of Indiana\u2019s confrontation clause, a portion of a law that allowed <em>videotaped </em>testimony by a child sexual abuse victim. <em>Brady v. State, </em>575 N.E.2d 981, 988 (Ind. 1991). The dissent, however, misreads <em>Brady </em>and somehow construes the invalidated <em>recorded </em>testimonial procedure as being analogous to the <em>live </em>closed-circuit testimonial procedure at issue here. Dissent at 489. In actuality, the <em>Brady </em>court expressly left intact that portion of the Indiana statute providing for live closed-circuit testimony, noting that \u201c[i]n such a closed circuit arrangement, there is no person or body interposed between the witness and the accused and a face-to-face meeting as contemplated by the Constitution occurs.\u201d <em>Brady, </em>575 N.E.2d at 989. The statute was, thus, \u201cleft in a sensible and administrable form.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Brady, </em>575 N.E.2d at 988-89. The Indiana Supreme Court has also written that \u201c[o]f course, the \u2018face to face\u2019 language in the Indiana clause, as in other states, has not always been interpreted literally. Otherwise, the testimony of all absent witnesses, whether unavailable through death or illness or threat, would never be admissible at trial.\u201d <em>Miller v. State, </em>517 N.E.2d 64, 71 (Ind. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Rather than heeding guidance from states upon whose constitutions article I, section 22 was based, the dissent selectively relies upon declarations by the highest courts in Massachusetts<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and Pennsylvania that the \u201cface-to-face\u201d language in their states\u2019 confrontation clauses was incompatible with closed-circuit or videotaped testimony laws. The Pennsylvania constitution was subsequently amended to replace the \u201cface-to-face\u201d language in its confrontation clause, leaving Massachusetts as the only state taking the position that the dissent advocates.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Indeed, the dissent glosses over decisions in \u201cface-to-face\u201d jurisdictions that are contrary to its holding at the same time, ironically, that it chides the majority for ignoring \u201copinions from other states interpreting their \u2018face-to-face\u2019 confrontation clauses.\u201d Dissent at 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">There are six states where statutory language allowing closed-circuit or videotaped testimony from child sexual abuse victims has been deemed constitutional under those states\u2019 \u201cface-to-face\u201d confrontation clauses.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See Brady, 575 </em>N.E.2d 981; <em>State v.

Two other \u201cface-to-face\u201d jurisdictions appear likely to join the majority rule when confronted with this issue. <em>State v. Sanchez, </em>201 Wis. 2d 219, 548 N.W.2d 69, 72 (1996) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>(\u201c[T]he confrontation clause ... of the state constitution, which provides \u2018[i]n all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right... to meet the witnesses face to face . . .,\u2019 provides a right <em>identical </em>to that stated in the federal Constitution\u2019s confrontation clause . . . .\u201d) (emphasis added) (citing <em>State v. Burns, </em>112 Wis. 2d 131, 332 N.W.2d 757, 762 (1983)); <em>McGriff v. State, </em>672 A.2d 1027, 1030 (Del. Super. 1996) (\u201cThe right of a criminal defendant to confront the witnesses against him ... is not absolute . . . and does not require that every witness testify in court in front of the defendant.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">I agree with the Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]here is no constitutional right to eyeball to eyeball confrontation. The choice of the words \u2018face to face\u2019 may have resulted from an inability to foresee technological developments permitting cross-examination without physical presence.\u201d <em>Willis, </em>716 S.W.2d at 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Beyond the fact that the Indiana and Oregon confrontation clauses inspired the framers of article I, section 22, we have no record of what definitions of the term \u201cface-to-face\u201d were considered by the delegates to the constitutional convention. Finding definitions in dictionaries contemporaneous with the 1889 constitutional convention is no easy task at this late date, and the dissent was not able to\u2014 although it was certainly correct to seek definitions of the term \u201cface-to-face,\u201d as opposed to those interpreting the word \u201cconfront.\u201d <em>See </em>dissent at 483-84. I will share two brief historic definitions of the term \u201cface-to-face,\u201d not because I accept the contention that dictionaries displace the law but, rather, to show only that others <em>could </em>envision a meaning for the term beyond that contemplated, in contemporary hindsight, by the dissent. The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia, first published in 1889, in 1913 defined \u201cface-to-face\u201d as follows: \u201c[I]n a confronting attitude or position; in actual presence or propinquity: as, to be <em>face to face </em>with impending disaster.\u201d The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia 2110 (1913). A 1930 law dictionary defined \u201cface-to-face\u201d as follows: \u201cIt seems to be held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>everywhere and by all courts of last resort, that \u2018to be confronted with the witnesses against him\u2019 and to \u2018meet the witnesses face to face,\u2019 mean one and the same thing; and that is that the accused shall have the right or privilege to cross-examine the witnesses against him.\u201d Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary 480 (1930). Obviously, neither of these definitions provides comfort for the dissent\u2019s literalist position.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Even assuming that the fundamental purpose of the \u201cface-to-face\u201d language of article I, section 22 is that the defendant be in the physical presence of adverse witnesses, this objective is met under the statute at issue here because it provides that the defendant\u2019s counsel is always in the same room -with the witness. RCW 9A.44.150(1)(1). Defense counsel is in constant contact with the defendant both electronically and physically. RCW 9A.44.150(l)(h). If the defendant is acting as his own attorney closed-circuit testimony will not be allowed. RCW 9A.44.150(4). This is consistent with our previous holding that \u201c \u2018[t]he essential purpose of confrontation is cross-examination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pettit v. Rhay, </em>62 Wn.2d 515, 521, 383 P.2d 889 (1963) (quoting approvingly <em>Brown v. United States, </em>234 F.2d 140, 144 (6th Cir. 1956)); <em>see also Self, </em>564 N.E.2d at 452 (\u201c[T]he purpose of the \u2018face to face\u2019 clause of the Ohio Constitution (as well as the parallel provision of the Sixth Amendment) is to guarantee the opportunity to cross-examine and the right to observe the proceeding.\u201d). Because the right to cross-examine is in no way impaired by closed-circuit testimony, criminal defense is not compromised by admission of this testimony. Indeed, a setting that facilitates candor by otherwise reluctant witnesses, such as children accusing adults of sex crimes, \u201cmay well aid a defendant in eliciting favorable testimony from the child witness.\u201d <em>Craig, </em>497 U.S. at 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The dissent cites a preexisting Washington law enacted in 1909 as evidence that the term \u201cface-to-face\u201d is to be read literally. Dissent at 493-94 (citing RCW 10.52.060). Yet RCW 10.52.060 does not define what the term requires, and its mere repetition of the words \u201cface-to-face\u201d adds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>nothing to their interpretation. The dissent also cites an early Washington case for its statement that \u201cthe examination of . . .a witness shall be in open court, in the presence of the accused.\u201d Dissent at 487 (quoting <em>State v. Stentz, </em>30 Wash. 134, 142, 70 P. 241 (1902)). This dicta, however, is no more compelling, or clear, than that from other cases.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Nor does our recent statement that the <em>federal </em>confrontation clause \u201crepresents <em>&amp; preference </em>for live testimony. ... in a face-to-face setting before the watchful eyes of the jury\u201d compel the result that the dissent seeks here.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>State v. Rohrich, </em>132 Wn.2d 472, 477, 939 P.2d 697 (1997) (emphasis added) (citation omitted). This \u201cpreference\u201d under the Sixth Amendment is not without its exceptions, as <em>Craig </em>certainly illustrates. Thus, state preexisting law does not support the majority\u2019s application of article I, section 22 in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">In light of the foregoing, it appears that the dissent is unduly modest about the uniqueness and implications of its literal interpretation of the \u201cface-to-face\u201d language in our state\u2019s confrontation clause. It only makes an exception for hearsay on the basis of some , fancy linguistic footwork that does not explain away an earlier statement of this very court in analyzing the Sixth Amendment and article I, section 22 confrontation clauses: \u201cNeither clause has been read literally, for to do so would result in ehminating all exceptions to the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>State v. Ryan, </em>103 Wn.2d 165, 169, 691 P.2d 197 (1984) (citing <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>448 U.S. 56, 100 S. Ct. 2531, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1980)). The dissent is at odds with this holding when it strains to find, as it must given its literalist position in this case, that hearsay is, in fact, acceptable under a <em>literal </em>reading of article I, section 22. In so doing, the dissent appears to label a binding precedent to the contrary as \u201cfolly.\u201d <em>See </em>dissent at 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">In this case, I find that, due to modem technology, RCW 9A.44.150 provides for the functional equivalent of the temporal and physical proximity that the \u201cface-to-face\u201d language of article I, section 22 requires. This is in keeping with the fact that \u201c[constitutions are designed to endure through the years, and constitutional provisions should be interpreted to meet and cover changing conditions of social and economic life.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Linn v. Superior Court, </em>20 Wn.2d 138, 145, 146 P.2d 543 (1944). Moreover, children have long enjoyed a special status under the law. <em>See, e.g., New York v. Ferber, </em>458 U.S. 747, 757, 102 S. Ct. 3348, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1113 (1982) (\u201c[W]e have sustained legislation aimed at protecting the physical and emotional well-being of youth even when the laws have operated in the sensitive area of constitutionally protected rights.\u201d). This court has, to give a related example, held that \u201cclosure of judicial proceedings or court documents may, under some circumstances, be necessary in order to protect child victims of sexual assault from further trauma and harm and to protect their rights of privacy.\u201d <em>Allied Daily Newspapers v. Eikenberry, </em>121 Wn.2d 205, 214, 848 P.2d 1258 (1993); <em>see also Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court, </em>457 U.S. 596, 608, 102 S. Ct. 2613, 73 L. Ed. 2d 248 (1982) (\u201cA trial court can determine on a case-by-case basis whether closure is necessary to protect the welfare of a minor victim.\u201d) (footnote omitted). This despite the First Amendment interests of the press, and the right of open access to judicial proceedings guaranteed by article I, section 10 of the Washington State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Finally, I should note that I do not imply that, even with regard to child witnesses, all alternative testimonial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>procedures (e.g., videotaped depositions in lieu of live testimony) would necessarily meet the command of article I, section 22. Even this procedure with respect to witnesses <em>other </em>than the children statutorily protected here might not pass muster. However, we cannot rule on hypotheticals. Given that the majority opinion does not find an independent meaning for the \u201cface-to-face\u201d language, it would be premature at this juncture to offer an \u201canalytical test or a framework for determining when the confrontation clause <em>is </em>violated,\u201d dissent at 482, without there being a consensus on this court to embrace it. That task is better left for another day. Today, though, I find simply that the specific testimonial procedure at issue here is supported by an important state interest and is sufficiently open and within the orbit of the courtroom to pass constitutional muster\u2014 even under an independent analysis of article I, section 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">Johnson, J. (dissenting) \u2014 Article I, section 22 of our state constitution provides every accused with the right to \u201cmeet the witnesses against him face to face.\u201d The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides an accused with the right simply to \u201cbe confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d The majority neither considers our cases discussing article I, section 22 nor looks to opinions from other states interpreting their \u201cface-to-face\u201d confrontation clauses. Even though our state constitution requires that its provisions are \u201cmandatory, unless by express words they are declared to be otherwise,\u201d Wash. Const, art. I, \u00a7 29, the majority and the concurrence/dissent interpret our state confrontation clause identical to its federal counterpart. The majority and the concurrence/dissent effectively write \u201cface-to-face\u201d out of article I, section 22, by not giving meaning to those specific words and by not conducting the proper analysis. Therefore, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">FACE-TO-FACE</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The majority is correct in analyzing Foster\u2019s argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>ment under the framework of <em>State v. Gunwall, </em>106 Wn.2d 54, 720 P.2d 808, 76 A.L.R.4th 517 (1986). Furthermore, I agree that analysis of the fifth <em>Gunwall </em>factor (differences in structure between the federal and state constitutions) \u201csupports an independent state constitutional analysis in every case.\u201d Majority at 458. I write separately, however, because I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that, after a <em>Gunwall </em>analysis, \u201cthe Defendant\u2019s state right to confrontation and his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation [are] identical.\u201d Majority at 466. Instead, I would hold Wash. Const, art. I, \u00a7 22 has a different meaning than the Sixth Amendment and that RCW 9A.44.150 fails to comport with that meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Furthermore, neither the majority nor the concurrence/ dissent have established any analytical test or a framework for determining when the confrontation clause <em>is </em>violated. In my opinion, the language of the state confrontation clause is absolute and allows for no \u201cflexibility,\u201d dependent on the significance of the interest involved. Article I, section 22 prohibits any adopted procedure where live testimony is presented in a manner other than in the physical presence of the defendant. Under the analysis of the majority and the concurrence/dissent, the Legislature is free to prescribe this method of testimony anytime it feels compelled to do so, regardless of the protections of our state constitution.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\"><em>Gunwall </em>Factor 1 - The Textual Language of Article I, Section 22</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">The majority combines this factor with the second <em>Gun-wall </em>factor (differences in texts of the parallel constitutional provisions) concluding, \u201cthe <em>meaning </em>of the words used in the parallel clauses is substantially the same\u201d and there is \u201cno significant difference between the language used in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>parallel provisions of the state and federal confrontation clauses.\u201d Majority at 459 (emphasis added). Such cursory analysis does injustice to the constitutional jurisprudence we established in <em>Gunwall. </em>Particularly where the plain language of article I, section 22, without relation to other state or federal constitutional provisions, provides the clear and cogent answer. <em>See Malyon v. Pierce County, </em>131 Wn.2d 779, 799, 935 P.2d 1272 (1997) (\u201cAppropriate constitutional analysis begins with the text and, for most purposes, should end there as well\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The majority points to various dictionary definitions of \u201cconfront\u201d in support of its conclusion that \u201cface-to-face\u201d should not he literally interpreted. Focus on the term \u201cconfront,\u201d however, is misplaced. We know Foster has a fundamental right to confront witnesses against him, including the child witness in this case. The issue before us is the <em>manner </em>in which he is entitled to exercise that fundamental right. In that regard, the focus should be placed on those words we attempt to ascribe a particular meaning\u2014\u201cface-to-face.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 812 (1986) defines \u201cface-to-face\u201d as \u201cwithin each other\u2019s sight or presence : involving close contacts : in person &lt; a <em>face-to-face </em>meeting of the two leaders&gt; &lt;we met <em>face-to-face </em>for the first time&gt;.\u201d <em>See also </em>Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary 431 (1853) defining \u201cface,\u201d in part, as <em>\u201cface to face-, </em>when both parties are <em>present-, </em>as to have accusers <em>face to face.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) This indicates that over the past 133 years, the common understanding of \u201cface-to-face\u201d includes actual presence. I.can envision no other meaning. While the ordinary and customary understanding of the term \u201cconfront\u201d may support the majority\u2019s conclusion, that is not the issue or the proper analysis. Under our state provision, we must give meaning to the plain words used: face-to-face. Use of the specific term \u201cface-to-face\u201d renders RCW 9A.44.150 unconstitutional by preventing witnesses from being within an accused\u2019s \u201csight or presence\u201d or testifying \u201cin person.\u201d The textual language of article I, section 22 on its own, and the common understanding of that textual language, support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Foster\u2019s assertion that a different interpretation is required under our state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">In <em>State v. Coe, </em>101 Wn.2d 364, 679 P.2d 353 (1984) we faced an analogous situation. That case involved the broadcast of tape recordings in violation of a court order. The superior court held the broadcasters in contempt. We reversed, holding that the superior court\u2019s order was void under article I, section 5 of our state constitution. In so holding, we compared article I, section 5 to the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and concluded that the particular words of the state constitution provided the clear answer, stating, \u201cunlike the first amendment to the United States Constitution, the <em>plain language </em>of Const, art. 1, \u00a7 5 seems to rule out prior restraints under any circumstances[.]\u201d <em>Coe, </em>101 Wn.2d at 374 (emphasis added). Here, the unequivocal plain language of article I, section 22 also provides the clear answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\"><em>Gunwall </em>Factor 2 - Significant Differences in the Texts of the Parallel Provisions of the Federal and State Constitutions</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">The majority holds, \u201cif we were to determine that the state provision was significantly distinctive, this fact, alone, would be an insufficient reason for relying on the state constitution as an independent ground for decision.\u201d Majority at 459 (citing <em>State v. Jones, </em>112 Wn.2d 488, 498 n.11, 772 P.2d 496 (1989); <em>State v. Reece, </em>110 Wn.2d 766, 778, 757 P.2d 947 (1988)). Because our primary responsibility in this case requires us to give meaning to and define the scope of the provisions of our state constitution, I disagree. <em>See Coe, </em>101 Wn.2d at 373-74 (\u201cstate courts have a duty to independently interpret and apply their state constitutions ... to apply the federal constitution before the Washington Constitution would be . . . improper and premature\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Oftentimes, significant textual differences <em>do </em>require a different interpretation of the state constitution. <em>See Malyon v. Pierce County, </em>131 Wn.2d 779, 935 P.2d 1272 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>(1997) (the difference between language in article I, section 11 and the First Amendment alone demands a different interpretation). While it is true that stylistic or rhetorical differences in language between state and federal constitutional provisions do not always support a different analysis, <em>Richmond v. Thompson, </em>130 Wn.2d 368, 380, 922 P.2d 1343 (1996), I cannot conclude that the differences between the two provisions here are either stylistic or rhetorical.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">We must assume when the framers of our state constitution drafted and adopted article I, section 22 they were aware of the linguistic differences between that section and the Sixth Amendment. <em>See </em>Robert F. Utter, <em>Freedom and Diversity in a Federal System: Perspectives on State Constitutions and the Washington Declaration of Rights, </em>7 U. Puget Sound L. Rev. 491, 515 (1984); Lebbeus J. Knapp, <em>The Origin of the Constitution of the State of Washington, </em>4 Wash. Hist. Q., No. 4, at 246 (1913) (\u201c[t]hat these prohibitions [the prohibitions against legislation in the state constitution] are not copied verbatim from any other constitution shows that the convention contained men of sufficient originality, ability and legal training to formulate the prohibitions along lines they believed to be important\u201d).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We know the Sixth Amendment existed at the time the Washington Constitution was debated and we know the framers chose different and specific words for use in article I, section 22. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Bergstrom, </em>402 Mass. 534, 541 n.9, 524 N.E.2d 366 (1988) (framers of Massachusetts\u2019 \u201cface-to-face\u201d confrontation clause were aware of other states\u2019 confrontation clauses and chose more explicit language to convey unequivocally their meaning). The challenge in this case is to give meaning to those specific words, not to ignore them.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">In addition to the significant textual differences between the state and federal confrontation clauses, both constitutional provisions as a whole contain differences requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>an independent analysis of article I, section 22. For example, article I, section 22 explicitly enunciates several rights not specifically delineated in the language of the Sixth Amendment: the right to appear in person; the right to have a copy of the charge; the right to testify in one\u2019s own behalf; and the right to appeal in all cases. These additional specific rights conferred support the conclusion that the state provision must be interpreted independent of its federal counterpart\u2014an interpretation that is more restrictive against legislative interference with an accused\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Perhaps the best indicator that article I, section 22 has a different meaning than the Sixth Amendment, however, is the difference between the <em>methods </em>each clause provides for confrontation. Namely, the Sixth Amendment provides no method by which confrontation is to be achieved. Article I, section 22, on the other hand, explicitly dictates that confrontation is to take place in a \u201cface-to-face\u201d manner. The proper inference drawn from this language difference is that the framers of our state confrontation clause intended to delineate the confrontation right in greater detail, thus requiring a different interpretation than the federal right.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">While the significant textual differences between the state and federal confrontation clauses are, in my opinion, enough to warrant an interpretation of article I, section 22 different than the Sixth Amendment, we must give a proper analysis to the remaining <em>Gunwall </em>factors. That analysis also provides additional support for a different interpretation of article I, section 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\"><em>Gunwall </em>Factor 3 - State Constitutional and Common Law History</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">The majority concludes the constitutional and common law history of article I, section 22 provide no support for an independent interpretation of the state confrontation clause. Majority at 460. I disagree. In <em>State v. Stentz, </em>30 Wash. 134, 70 P. 241 (1902), we addressed the meaning of article I, section 22, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>[T]he appellant had the right ... to meet the witnesses against him face to face. Art. 1, \u00a7 22, constitution. This <em>means </em>that the examination of such a witness shall be <em>in open court, in the presence of the accused, </em>with the right of the accused to cross-examine such witness as to facts testified to by him ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-5\"><em>Stentz, </em>30 Wash, at 142 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">We reaffirmed the \u201cface-to-face\u201d requirement of article I, section 22 in <em>State v. Rohrich, </em>132 Wn.2d 472, 939 P.2d 697 (1997). In that case, we held the federal confrontation clause, at its core, \u201crepresents a preference for live testimony\u201d because live testimony requires the witness to \u201crelate the facts herself in open court subject to cross examination while under oath in a <em>face-to-face </em>setting before the watchful eyes of the jury.\u201d <em>Rohrich, </em>132 Wn.2d at 477 (emphasis added). In so holding, we specifically noted the confrontation clause in article I, section 22 is \u201ceven more specific\u201d than its federal counterpart. <em>Rohrich, </em>132 Wn.2d at 477 n.9. The majority has not addressed <em>Stentz </em>and, while recognizing the proposition for which <em>Rohrich </em>stands, dismisses that case by stating if requiring witnesses to testify in a face-to-face setting will elicit \u201cfearful responses\u201d and \u201ccause intimidation,\u201d the \u201cface-to-face\u201d mandate of article I, section 22 may be disregarded. Majority at 465.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Curiously, the majority cites the dissenting opinion in <em>Brady v. State, </em>575 N.E.2d 981 (Ind. 1991) for this proposition. As discussed below, <em>Brady </em>supports the conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>that article I, section 22 has a meaning different than the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The constitutional history of article I, section 22 supports a different interpretation than the United States Supreme Court has chosen to give the Sixth Amendment. When adopted, article I, section 22 was identical to article I, section 11 of the Oregon Constitution- and article I, section 13 of the Indiana Constitution. <em>Journal of the Washington State Constitutional Convention, 1889, </em>at 511 n.37 (Beverly E Rosenow ed., 1962). Without discussion of cases from other jurisdictions employing \u201cface-to-face\u201d confrontation clauses, let alone Oregon or Indiana, the majority concludes state constitutional and common law history \u201cdoes not reveal an intent on the part of the drafters to create a broader right than that which was stated in the Sixth Amendment.\u201d Majority at 461. A look to how those states have interpreted the language our provision was modeled after is helpful in analyzing the same words used in our state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\"><em>Brady, </em>575 N.E.2d 981, indicates that a literal interpretation of \u201cface-to-face\u201d in article I, section 22 is required. The majority cites this case, concedes it means that Indiana interprets its face-to-face language literally, and then ignores the decision without even an attempt to distinguish it. Majority at 460 n.7. In <em>Brady, </em>the Indiana Supreme Court addressed the constitutional validity of a statute that provided for two-way, closed-circuit testimony and testimony by videotape. The court expressly struck down that portion of the statute providing for videotaped testimony as violative of Indiana\u2019s \u201cface-to-face\u201d confrontation clause. <em>Brady, </em>575 N.E.2d at 988. The videotape procedure used in <em>Brady </em>is identical to the closed-circuit testimony procedure employed under RCW 9A.44.150.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Like this case, the witness in <em>Brady </em>was a child molestation victim. The witness\u2019s testimony was videotaped with the judge, prosecutor and defense attorney present. The defendant was able to see and hear the witness via <em>closed-circuit television. </em>The defendant was also able to speak <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>with his counsel through two-way microphone hook-up. <em>Brady, </em>575 N.E.2d at 984. A videotape of the examination of the witness was then shown to the jury. The sole difference between the procedure in <em>Brady </em>and the procedure under RCW 9A.44.150 is that in <em>Brady </em>the jury saw a videotape, while in this case the jury viewed the testimony live. In striking down the statute, the Indiana Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">The Indiana Constitution recognizes that there is something unique and important in requiring the face-to-face meeting between the accused and the State\u2019s witnesses as they give their trial testimony. While the right to cross-examination may be the primary interest protected by the confrontation right in Article I, \u00a7 13 of the Indiana Constitution, <em>the defendant\u2019s right to meet the witnesses face to face </em>cannot simply be read out of our State\u2019s Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-6\"><em>Brady, </em>575 N.E.2d at 988 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">While the Oregon Supreme Court has not interpreted the precise issue we face in this case, it has analyzed its \u201cface-to-face\u201d confrontation clause in a manner supporting a literal interpretation of Wash. Const, art. I, \u00a7 22. In <em>State v. Smyth, </em>286 Or. 293, 593 P.2d 1166 (1979), the Oregon Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">There, the Court referred to the object of the requirement to secure \u2018a personal examination and cross-examination of the witness in which the accused has an opportunity ... of compelling him [the witness] to stand face to face with the jury in order that they may look at him, and judge by his demeanor upon the stand and the manner in which he gives his testimony whether he is worthy of belief.\u2019 <em>Mattox v. United States, </em>156 U.S. 237, 242-243, 15 S. Ct. 337, 39 L. Ed. 409 (1895), quoted at 390 U.S. 721, 88 S. Ct. 1318, 1320.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">\n<em>While the importance of the jury\u2019s observation of the witness was not given weight in the Oregon decisions cited above, we think the point stressed in Mattox is also the better view of Or. Const, art. I, \u00a711.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-10\"><em>Smyth, </em>286 Or. at 300 n.8 (emphasis added). The majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>does not acknowledge the existence of <em>Smyth, </em>let alone analyze or attempt to distinguish it. With regard to <em>Brady, </em>the majority concedes it stands for a contrary interpretation of an identical provision then simply ignores it.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The analysis of the constitutional history of article I, section 22 does not end there, however. The \u201cface-to-face\u201d language of Oregon\u2019s confrontation clause was derived from the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780, one of the original state declarations of rights. The Massachusetts confrontation clause states, in part, \u201cevery subject shall have the right ... to meet the witnesses against him face to face.\u201d Mass. Const, art. 12. In <em>Commonwealth v. Johnson, </em>417 Mass. 498, 631 N.E.2d 1002 (1994), the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts interpreted \u201cface-to-face\u201d to provide greater protection than the Sixth Amendment stating, \u201c[ujnlike the Sixth Amendment, however, art. 12 contains an indispensable element of face-to-face confrontation of witnesses appearing at trial.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>417 Mass, at 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The Massachusetts high court affirmed that interpretation in <em>Commonwealth v. Amirault, </em>424 Mass. 618, 677 N.E.2d 652 (1997). In that case, the court invalidated a defendant\u2019s conviction for child sexual abuse due to a seating arrangement in the courtroom. The arrangement allowed various child witnesses to testify in such a manner that, although in the physical presence of the defendant, the witnesses and the defendant could not view each others\u2019 faces. The court held the defendant\u2019s right to face-to-face confrontation was violated by the arrangement, stating \u201c[w]e now state unequivocally that the right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>confrontation in our Declaration of Rights simply requires a judge to refrain from designing seating configurations which comfortably shield a witness from a face-to-face meeting.\u201d <em>Amirault, </em>677 N.E.2d at 663 n.9.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The case of <em>Commonwealth v. Ludwig, </em>527 Pa. 472, 594 A.2d 281 (1991) provides particular support for the idea that Wash. Const, art. I, \u00a7 22 has a different meaning than the Sixth Amendment. In 1776, the Pennsylvania Constitution did not provide a \u201cface-to-face\u201d confrontation right for accused persons. Then, in 1790 and 1792, after the federal constitution was adopted, Pennsylvania amended its constitution to provide for \u201cface-to-face\u201d confrontation. <em>See Smyth, </em>286 Or. at 297 n.3. Two hundred years later, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court determined the use of closed-circuit television to transmit a child\u2019s testimony violated the defendant\u2019s state constitutional right to \u201cface-to-face\u201d confrontation. <em>Ludwig, </em>527 Pa. 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The concurrence/dissent correctly points out that the Pennsylvania constitution was amended to eliminate the \u201cface-to-face\u201d provision of that state\u2019s confrontation clause. Concurrence/dissent at 476. This, however, illustrates the proper method to change constitutional protections. If the citizens of Washington want to give up their right to \u201cface-to-face\u201d confrontation then, like Pennsylvania, our state constitution should be amended. In fact, the reason the Pennsylvania constitution was amended was to ameliorate the exact problem we face today. <em>See Commonwealth v. Campion, </em>449 Pa. Super. 9, 17, 672 A.2d 1328, 1332 (1996) (\u201cKit is apparent that the amendment allows for flexibility in the manner in which an accused is confronted by a child witness, apparently in recognition of the special sensitivi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>ties of children in such situations\u201d).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In bypassing the citizens of this state, the majority and the concurrence/ dissent simply amend article I, section 22 by judicial fiat. Protecting our children from the \u201ctrauma\u201d resulting from testifying is, I would agree, a compelling and legitimate policy. If the confrontation clause of article I, section 22 somehow hinders that policy, the clause may be amended. Such a change, however, must be instigated and approved by the citizens of Washington, not a majority of the sitting justices of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The concurrence/dissent chides the dissent for \u201cselectively\u201d relying upon the above Massachusetts and Pennsylvania decisions \u201c[rjather than heeding guidance from states upon whose constitutions article I, section 22 was based[.j\u201d Concurrence/dissent at 476. However, the concurrence/ dissent, in yet another attempt to support the majority\u2019s lacking analysis, is guilty of its own accusations by relying on decisions from other jurisdictions that have <em>no ties whatsoever </em>to the development of our state\u2019s confrontation clause.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">A conclusion other than that offered by the majority and concurrence/dissent is required. Case law from our own state interpreting article I, section 22 requires a literal in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>terpretation, as does the case law from jurisdictions upon which Washington\u2019s confrontation clause is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\"><em>Gunwall </em>Factor 4 - Preexisting Washington Law</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The majority fails to address this factor separately, feeling the need to address it in conjunction with factor six (discussed <em>infra). </em>The majority states that because the territorial law and RCW 10.52.060 provide an exception to face-to-face confrontation in the case of depositions taken at a time earlier than trial, our state confrontation clause has never been interpreted literally to provide a defendant with an absolute right to \u201cmeet accusing witnesses face to face in every instance.\u201d Majority at 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The majority\u2019s reliance on the deposition exception to the statute\u2019s \u201cface-to-face\u201d command is misplaced. To understand that, one must read the proviso of the statute. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-8\">PROVIDED, That whenever any witness whose deposition shall have been taken pursuant to law by a magistrate, in the presence of the defendant and his counsel, shall be absent, <em>and cannot be found when required to testify upon any trial or hearing, </em>so much of such deposition as the court shall deem admissible and competent shall be admitted and read as evidence in such case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">RCW 10.52.060 (emphasis added). Thus, when we understand the nature of the exception to the otherwise applicable \u201cface-to-face\u201d rule, we see that two conditions must be met. First, the previous deposition must have been in the presence of the accused. Second, the witness must be absent. The first condition guarantees the accused has had the opportunity for a face-to-face confrontation with the witness at the deposition. The second condition assures that no better evidence can be found (i.e., the witness is not available to testify). Thus, the accused\u2019s right to face-to-face confrontation is still protected. If anything, the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>viso supports a literal and more protective reading of article I, section 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><em>Gunwall </em>Factor 6 - The Particular Local Concern or State Interest of the Constitutional Provision at Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The majority holds that analysis of this factor does not support a conclusion that article I, section 22 has a meaning different than the Sixth Amendment because \u201cthe fundamental right of an accused to confront witnesses against him or her, in the context of child victim testimony, is not unique to the State of Washington.\u201d Majority at 465. While I agree that the issue of closed-circuit testimony is not unique to Washington, the majority has misinterpreted this factor. The question under this factor is whether the protection provided by the constitutional provision at issue is a matter of particular state or local concern. In that regard, the confrontation clause in article I, section 22 is directly a matter of state concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Not all states provide \u201cface-to-face\u201d confrontation as a fundamental right of the accused. While confrontation rights in general are not matters indicating particularized local concern over federal uniformity, application of those rights under our state constitution to a statute enacted by our state Legislature is undoubtedly of local and state concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Under an appropriate <em>Gunwall </em>analysis, particularly factors one through four, an independent analysis and result is required by our state constitution. In light of this examination, I conclude article I, section 22\u2019s confrontation clause was intended to and does provide different protections than the Sixth Amendment, to wit, preserving an accused\u2019s right to a physical face-to-face meeting with the witnesses against him or her. The plain language and the constitutional history of this provision compels this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">HEARSAY</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">The State argues, and the majority holds, a literal interpretation of the confrontation clause in article I, section 22 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>would eliminate all exceptions to the hearsay rule. This is folly. The confrontation clause in article I, section 22 provides an accused with the right to a face-to-face confrontation of \u201cthe witnesses against him.\u201d In criminal cases, hearsay implicating a criminal defendant is admissible only if \u201cthe declarant is unavailable and the statement bears adequate indicia of reliability or particularized guaranties of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>State v. Whelchel, </em>115 Wn.2d 708, 715, 801 P.2d 948 (1991). Under the rules of evidence in Washington, there are five instances where hearsay from an unavailable declarant is admissible. <em>See </em>ER 804(b)(l)-(4); ER 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Contrary to the concerns of the majority, a strict reading of the confrontation clause in article I, section 22 does not implicate hearsay concerns. As noted above, the issue we face is the <em>method </em>by which an accused is guaranteed confrontation, not whether the accused is guaranteed confrontation at all. Under the hearsay exceptions, a value judgment has already been made that the accused is not entitled to confront those persons making the qualifying statements. Only after the right of confrontation arises with regard to available witnesses must we decide the <em>method by which </em>the accused is entitled to exercise that right. The correct analysis asks: (1) Does the accused have a right to confrontation in the given instance? (2) If so, to what type of confrontation is the accused entitled?</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">A recent Court of Appeals case is instructive. In <em>State v. Connie J.C., </em>86 Wn. App. 453, 937 P.2d 1116 (1997), the defendant was convicted of numerous counts of child molestation. Her husband had previously pled guilty to the counts of rape, incest and child molestation. At the defendant\u2019s trial, her husband\u2019s statement on plea of guilty, including his written statement, was admitted into evidence and read three times. He never testified. The Court of Appeals reversed on the grounds that the defendant was denied her right to confrontation because \u201c[tjhere is no showing that Mr. C. [defendant\u2019s husband] was unavailable to testify at trial.\u201d <em>Connie J.C., </em>86 Wn. App. at 454. Unlike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>this case, only when a witness is unavailable to testify in person do hearsay exceptions come into play. When the witness testifies or is available to testify, however, article I, section 22 prescribes the method by which an accused is entitled to confront that witness: face-to-face.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The majority concludes \u201cthe trial court had substantial evidence to find that the child victim would suffer serious emotional distress that would prevent her from reasonably communicating at trial[.]\u201d Majority at 472. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Under RCW 9A.44.150, the trial court must find substantial evidence that requiring the child to testify in the presence of the defendant will result in the child suffering <em>\u201cserious emotional or mental distress </em>that will prevent the child from <em>reasonably communicating </em>at the trial.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The statute does not define the emphasized terms. The majority equates the witness\u2019 reluctance to testify truthfully with an inability to \u201creasonably communicate.\u201d There is no question that the witness could verbally express herself during a trial in front of the accused. The problem was with her veracity. That is an issue of competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">The record is replete with evidence that the child could reasonably communicate in front of Mr. Foster. The majority even points out all the information the child was able to communicate in front of the defendant. Majority at 445-46. The majority also recognizes that in response to the question, \u201cAre you afraid that something might happen if you tell the truth,\u201d the child communicated, \u201cNo.\u201d Majority at 446. But because the child answered questions more easily during a second hearing, out of Mr. Foster\u2019s presence, the trial court concluded the child would suffer serious emotional or mental distress that would prevent her from reasonably communicating in front of Mr. Foster. Although we do not conduct an independent statutory analysis, the United States Supreme Court has stated what is required at a bare minimum. In <em>Maryland v. Craig, </em>497 U.S. 836, 856, 110 S. Ct. 3157, 111 L. Ed. 2d 666 (1990) the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Court stated that under a similar Maryland statute \u201cthe trial court must find that the emotional distress suffered by the child witness in the presence of the defendant is more than de minimus, i.e., more than \u2018mere nervousness or excitement or some reluctance to testify!.]\u2019 \u201d As the majority notes, at least one author has suggested that RCW 9A.44.150 is more deferential to the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation. Majority at 453 (citing 5B Karl B. Tegland, Washington Practice (Evidence) \u00a7 355(15) (3d ed. Supp. 1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">In my opinion, the record indicates that is the situation here. The witness never refused to communicate, and was never unresponsive or unintelligible. While it may have been <em>easier </em>for the witness to testify in the closed-circuit television arrangement, that is not the standard. While intimidation may, under some circumstances, bring about untruthfulness, it may also cause a false accuser to admit the defendant is innocent of the crime charged. <em>See Coy v. Iowa, </em>487 U.S. 1012, 1020, 108 S. Ct. 2798, 101 L. Ed. 2d 857 (1988) (\u201cface-to-face presence may, unfortunately, upset the truthful rape victim or abused child; but by the same token it may confound and undo the false accuser, or reveal the child coached by a malevolent adult. It is a truism that constitutional protections have costs\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">I am disappointed by the failure of both the majority and the concurrence/dissent to give effect or meaning to the words \u201cface-to-face\u201d in article I, section 22. By the mere fact those words appear in our state constitution, they mean <em>something. </em>Instead, the majority and the concurrence/ dissent sidestep the issue and conclude what they <em>do not </em>mean. I am also troubled by the lengths the concurrence/ dissent has gone to attack the dissent\u2019s position. The opinion of the concurrence/dissent may be summarized by one sentence, \u201cI concur in the result only.\u201d By attacking the dissent\u2019s <em>Gunwall </em>analysis without offering its own, the concurrence/dissent engages in simple rabble-rousing.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Under the higher protection that should be afforded under the confrontation clause of Wash. Const, art. I, \u00a7 22, the statute in question fails to pass constitutional muster. We cannot read out of article I, section 22 the exact right guaranteed by the confrontation clause\u2019s plain language.
