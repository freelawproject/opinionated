Ned Hall, a probate attorney in Vancouver, served as Nick Stein\u2019s attorney for a number of years in matters involving Nick\u2019s property. Nick\u2019s son, Jack Stein, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>opposed Mr. Hall\u2019s legal position on a number of matters involving his father\u2019s property. Nick Stein, with Mr. Hall\u2019s assistance, was successful in having a bank appointed as the trustee for Nick Stein\u2019s significant estate. The trustee bank and Ned Hall, on behalf of Nick Stein, brought an action to have a transfer of a real estate contract from Nick Stein to Jack Stein set aside on the basis of fraud and undue influence. Thelma Lund, a longtime friend of Nick Stein, testified on behalf of the limited guardian and adversely to Jack Stein. The trial judge, Tom Lodge, set aside the transfer on the basis of undue influence and ruled against Jack Stein in several other lawsuits regarding his father\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Testimony indicates that Jack Stein asked his stepson, Michael Norberg, to hire \u201chitmen\u201d to kill Ned Hall, Thelma <em>Lund, </em>Judge Lodge, and others. Norberg hired Richard Bailey and Gordon Smith. In April 1987, Thelma Lund was severely beaten and strangled to death in her home. In June 1987, several attempts were made to murder Ned Hall.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Jack Stein was convicted of three counts of attempted murder in the first degree and one count of burglary in the first degree with regard to the attempts on Hall\u2019s life and was found not guilty of the murder of Lund. Norberg pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder in the second degree. Smith pleaded guilty to conspiracy to murder and to attempting to murder Hall. Bailey pleaded guilty as an accomplice to the murder of Thelma Lund and the attempted murder of Ned Hall.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">The estate of Thelma Lund filed a wrongful death action against Jack Stein and Michael Norberg and the State filed a criminal profiteering action against Jack Stein, Michael Norberg, Richard Bailey and Gordon Smith. The trial court consolidated the two actions and the case was tried to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">Michael Norberg\u2019s statement on plea of guilty was admitted into evidence. He stated that Jack Stein had asked him to find \u201chitmen\u201d to kill certain people and that between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>1983 and 1986, Jack Stein told him that several people, including Ned Hall, Judge Lodge, and Thelma Lund were causing problems for him. Jack Stein told Norberg that he would provide money if Norberg could locate people who would eliminate those people causing Jack his problems. The money to be paid was $10,000 for each person on the \u201clist.\u201d He stated that Jack Stein had told him that Ned Hall was getting in the way of Jack\u2019s plans to handle Nick Stein\u2019s money and property. Norberg stated that Bailey and Jack Stein had also discussed blowing up the Clark County courthouse with a bomb in order to kill Judge Lodge. Jack Stein\u2019s psychologist testified that Jack Stein had told him he wanted to obtain hitmen to kill Judge Lodge and Ned Hall. Another witness testified that Michael Norberg and Jack Stein offered him $10,000 to kill Thelma Lund and $10,000 to kill the attorney who represented Nick Stein.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\">The jury found in favor of Thelma Lund\u2019s estate in the wrongful death action and in favor of the State in the criminal profiteering action. The jury concluded by special verdict that: (1) Stein, Norberg and Bailey had conspired to commit murder between 1984 and 1987; (2) Stein, Norberg and Bailey had attempted to commit murder in the first or second degree or extortion in the first degree on April 13, 1987; (3) Stein, Norberg and Bailey had caused the death of Thelma Lund on April 13, 1987; (4) the total damages for injury to the person, the estate or heirs of Thelma Lund was $4,000,000; (5) Stein, Norberg, Bailey and Smith had attempted to commit murder in the first degree on June 1, 1987; (6) Stein, Norberg, Bailey and Smith had attempted to commit murder in the first degree between June 1 and 14, 1987; (7) Stein, Norberg, Bailey and Smith had attempted to commit murder in the first degree on June 14, 1997; (8) Stein, Norberg, Bailey and Smith had engaged in the act of criminal profiteering as defined in the court\u2019s instructions; (9) Stein, Norberg, Bailey and Smith had engaged in a pattern of criminal profiteering activity as defined in the court\u2019s instructions; (10) the total amount of damages for injury to the person or property of Ned Hall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>was $8,200; (11) the costs and expenses incurred in the investigation and prosecution had been $223,894.19.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Pursuant to RCW 9A.82.100(4)(d), the trial court trebled the damages due the victims, adding $8,000,000 to be held in trust for the benefit of Lund\u2019s estate. The trial court also awarded the following amounts to the State: $24,600 to be held in trust for Ned Hall as treble damages; $223,894.19 for the cost of investigation and prosecution; $250,000 as a civil penalty under the Criminal Profiteering Act payable to the Clark County Anti-Criminal Profiteering Revolving Fund; and $38,301 for costs, disbursements, and attorney fees incurred by the State. Stein and Norberg appealed and the Court of Appeals affirmed all aspects of the judgment except the $250,000 penalty. <em>Winchester v. Stein, </em>86 Wn. App. 458, 937 P.2d 618, <em>review granted in part, </em>133 Wn.2d 1010 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">In the Court of Appeals, Stein and Norberg raised the following issues: whether the State\u2019s action under the Criminal Profiteering Act violated double jeopardy, whether the judgments were excessive, whether the court erred in denying Stein\u2019s request for a separate trial from Norberg and in consolidating the profiteering and the wrongful death actions, and whether the court erred in admitting a letter from Stein\u2019s psychologist which had reported that Stein had told him he wanted to hire a \u201chitman\u201d to kill his father\u2019s lawyer, Ned Hall, and a judge who had ruled against him. The Court of Appeals, relying on <em>United States v. Halper, </em>490 U.S. 435, 109 S. Ct. 1892, 104 L. Ed. 2d 487 (1989), concluded that neither the treble damages to the murdered woman\u2019s estate nor the award to the State for the costs of the criminal or civil litigation was punishment for purposes of the double jeopardy doctrine, but that the $250,000 civil penalty was solely punishment and therefore barred by double jeopardy. <em>Winchester, </em>86 Wn. App. at 464. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court on all other issues, concluding that the damages to the murdered woman\u2019s estate were not excessive, that the trial court properly denied the motion to sever the trials and properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>consolidated the actions, and that the testimony of the psychologist was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Jack Stein sought review of the Court of Appeals decision and the State sought review of that part of the Court of Appeals decision that reversed the civil penalty. We accepted review. The attorney representing the estate of Thelma Lund filed a motion seeking clarification of the issues before this Court. We granted the motion to clarify the issues and entered an order stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-6\">Review is limited to the issues of whether the exemplary damages and civil penalty awarded in the State\u2019s criminal profiteering action violate double jeopardy principles. The parties are further directed to submit supplemental memoranda discussing the effect on this case of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hudson v. United States, </em>[522 U.S. 93, 118 S. Ct. 488, 139 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1997)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">As a result of this order, the estate of Thelma Lund is no longer appearing in this appeal and the only issue on review is double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">Does an action brought under the Washington Criminal Profiteering Act, RCW 9A.82, for treble damages to the victims of crime and for other sanctions following a criminal proceeding violate the double jeopardy clause?</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">Whether an action for civil sanctions following a criminal conviction violates double jeopardy is an issue of law which is reviewed de novo. <em>E.g., LaCrosse v. Commodity Futures Trading Comm\u2019n, </em>137 F.3d 925 (7th Cir. 1998); <em>United States v. $292,888.04 in U.S. Currency, </em>54 F.3d 564, 566 (9th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-12\">Article I, section 9 of the Washington Constitution states: \u201cNo person shall be compelled in any criminal case to give evidence against himself, or be twice put in jeopardy for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>the same offense.\u201d The double jeopardy clause of the federal constitution provides that no person shall be \u201csubject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. V</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">The Supreme Court has declared that \u201c \u2018Congress may impose both a criminal and a civil sanction in respect to the same act or omission.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Ursery, </em>518 U.S. 267, 292, 116 S. Ct. 2135, 135 L. Ed. 2d 549 (1996) (quoting <em>Helvering v. Mitchell, </em>303 U.S. 391, 399, 58 S. Ct. 630, 82 L. Ed. 917 (1938)); <em>United States v. Ward, </em>448 U.S. 242, 250, 100 S. Ct. 2636, 65 L. Ed. 2d 742 (1980); <em>One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, </em>409 U.S. 232, 235, 93 S. Ct. 489, 34 L. Ed. 2d 438 (1972). We have explained that double jeopardy does not apply \u201c \u2018unless the sanction sought to be imposed in the second proceeding is punitive in nature so that the proceeding is essentially criminal.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Personal Restraint of Young, </em>122 Wn.2d 1, 24, 857 P.2d 989 (1993) (quoting <em>O\u2019Day v. King County, </em>109 Wn.2d 796, 817, 749 P.2d 142 (1988)). In the United States Supreme Court opinion which we asked the parties to brief, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-5\">We have long recognized that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not prohibit the imposition of any additional sanction that could, \u201c \u2018 in common parlance,\u2019 \u201d be described as punishment. The Clause protects only against the imposition of multiple <em>criminal </em>punishments for the same offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-6\"><em>Hudson v. United States, </em>522 U.S. 93, 98-99, 118 S. Ct. 488, 493, 139 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1997) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">It is settled law that an acquittal on a criminal charge is not a bar to a civil action by the government, remedial in its nature, arising out of the same facts on which the criminal proceeding was based. <em>Cole v. United States Dep\u2019t of Agric., </em>133 F.3d 803, 805 (11th Cir. 1998) <em>(citing Helvering, </em>303 U.S. at 397); <em>United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, </em>465 U.S. 354, 359, 104 S. Ct. 1099, 79 L. Ed. 2d 361 <em>(1984). The </em>Supreme Court has also held that it is not a bar to a private civil treble damages Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) action that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>defendants have not been convicted of the underlying predicate crimes. <em>Sedima v. Imrex Co., </em>473 U.S. 479, 493, 105 S. Ct. 3292, 87 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">We held in <em>State v. Gocken, </em>127 Wn.2d 95, 896 P.2d 1267 (1995), that the double jeopardy clause in Constitution article I, section 9 is given the same interpretation the Supreme Court gives to the double jeopardy clause in the Fifth Amendment. <em>See also State v. Cole, </em>128 Wn.2d 262, 274 n.7, 906 P.2d 925 (1995); <em>State v. Hardesty, </em>129 Wn.2d 303, 309 n.2, 915 P.2d 1080 (1996). In <em>State v. Catlett, </em>133 Wn.2d 355, 359, 945 P.2d 700 (1997), we accepted review in a double jeopardy case and asked the parties to brief the question whether, in light of <em>Ursery, </em>518 U.S. 267, Constitution article I, section 9 should be interpreted as more protective than the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">In Catlett,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we adopted the two-part test of <em>One Assortment of 89 Firearms, </em>465 U.S. 354, and <em>In re Young, </em>122 Wn.2d 1, for the purpose of determining whether a statute is remedial or punitive under article I, section 9 of our state constitution. We articulated the test as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-6\">The categorization of a particular statute as civil or criminal is largely a matter of statutory construction. The Supreme Court has adopted a 2-part analysis:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-7\">First, we have set out to determine whether Congress, in establishing the penalizing mechanism, indicated either expressly or impliedly a preference for one label or the other. Second, where Congress has indicated an intention to establish a civil penalty, we have inquired further whether the statutory scheme was so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate that intention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-8\"><em>Catlett, </em>133 Wn.2d at 365 (citations omitted) (quoting <em>Ward, </em>448 U.S. at 248-49). Following our <em>Catlett </em>case, the Supreme Court decided <em>Hudson, </em>522 U.S. 93. The test for double jeopardy set out by the <em>Hudson </em>Court is substantially the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>same methodology described by this Court in <em>Catlett. </em>Therefore, under both the federal and the state constitutions, the test for double jeopardy is the one set out in <em>Hudson </em>and in <em>Catlett.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">In <em>Hudson, </em>the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency imposed monetary penalties and occupational debarment on the defendants for violating federal banking statutes. The government later criminally indicted the defendants for the same conduct, and the defendants moved to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds. The Supreme Court held that double jeopardy did not bar the later prosecution since the previous proceeding was civil and not criminal. The Court disavowed the method of analysis used in <em>Halper, </em>490 U.S. 435, and reaffirmed the previously established rule exemplified in <em>Ward, </em>448 U.S. 242. <em>Hudson, </em>522 U.S. at 96. In reaching its conclusion in <em>Hudson, </em>the Court acknowledged that all civil penalties have some deterrent effect and that if a sanction must be \u201csolely\u201d remedial to avoid implicating the double jeopardy clause, then no civil penalties are beyond the scope of the clause. <em>Id. </em>at 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">The <em>Hudson </em>methodology, which clarified the test for determining whether a particular sanction is criminal or civil for the purposes of double jeopardy analysis, was stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-7\">Whether a particular punishment is criminal or civil is, at least initially, a matter of statutory construction. <em>Helvering, </em>[303 U.S] at 399. ... A court must first ask whether the legislature, \u201cin establishing the penalizing mechanism, indicated either expressly or impliedly a preference for one label or the other.\u201d <em>Ward, </em>448 U.S., at 248. . . . Even in those cases where the legislature \u201chas indicated an intention to establish a civil penalty, we have inquired further whether the statutory scheme was so punitive either in purpose or effect,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 248-49, ... as to \u201ctransform] what was clearly intended as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty,\u201d <em>Rex Trailer Co. v. United States, </em>350 U.S. 148, 154[, 76 S. Ct. 219, 222, 100 L. Ed. 149] (1956).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-8\">In making this latter determination, the factors listed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number><em>Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, </em>372 U.S. 144, 168-69[, 83 S. Ct. 554, 567-568, 9 L.Ed.2d 644] (1963), provide useful guideposts, including: (1) \u201c[w]hether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint\u201d; (2) \u201cwhether it has historically been regarded as a punishment\u201d; (3) \u201cwhether it comes into play only on a finding of <em>scienter\u201d-, </em>(4) \u201cwhether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment\u2014retribution and deterrence\u201d; (5) \u201cwhether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime\u201d; (6) \u201cwhether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it\u201d; and (7) \u201cwhether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned.\u201d It is important to note, however, that \u201cthese factors must be considered in relation to the statute on its face,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 169, and \u201conly the clearest proof\u201d will suffice to override legislative intent and transform what has been denominated a civil remedy into a criminal penalty. <em>Ward, </em>[448 U.S.] at 249.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-5\"><em>Hudson, </em>522 U.S. at 99-100.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">The <em>Hudson </em>Court specifically disavowed the part of the <em>Halper </em>opinion which focused on whether the sanction, regardless of whether it was civil or criminal, was so grossly disproportionate to the harm caused as to constitute \u201cpunishment.\u201d The Court found this to be erroneous because it elevated a single <em>Kennedy </em>factor, <em>Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, </em>372 U.S. 144, 83 S. Ct. 554, 9 L. Ed. 2d 644 (1963), to dispositive status. The Court pointed out that no one factor could be dispositive, as they often point in different directions. The other error in <em>Halper </em>was the Court\u2019s decision to \u201c \u2018asses[s] the character of the actual sanctions imposed\u2019 \u201d rather than, as <em>Kennedy </em>demanded, \u201c \u2018evaluating the statute on its face\u2019 \u201d to determine whether it provided for what amounted to a criminal sanction. <em>Hudson, </em>522 U.S. at 101. The Court explained that this was unworkable, because the determination whether a second proceeding violated double jeopardy would not be made until the sanction was imposed and even the attempt to criminally punish a second time would violate double jeopardy. The focus therefore is on the sanction allowed by the statute, not the actual sanction imposed in a particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>Applying the <em>Hudson </em>methodology to the facts of this case, we conclude that the action imposing monetary sanctions and treble damages did not constitute a violation of double jeopardy. The first part of the <em>Hudson </em>test asks if the Legislature intended the \u201cpenalizing mechanism\u201d to be civil or criminal. The penalizing mechanism here is the state Criminal Profiteering Act, RCW 9A.82.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">There is very little Washington law generally discussing the Criminal Profiteering Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This Court has characterized our Criminal Profiteering Act as a \u201clittle RICO\u201d statute. <em>Rice v. Janovich, </em>109 Wn.2d 48, <em>55, </em>742 P.2d 1230 (1987). Our statute is similar in many ways to the federal RICO act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because of the similarities, it is helpful to look to federal RICO cases. <em>See City of Bellevue v. Cashier\u2019s Check for $51,000 &amp; $1,130 in U.S. Currency, </em>70 Wn. App. 697, 701, <em>855 </em>P.2d 330 (1993); <em>Rozner v. City of Bellevue, </em>116 Wn.2d 342, 351, 804 P.2d 24 (1991). The Court of Appeals recently noted that law construing the federal RICO act is of assistance in construing our state profiteering act. <em>State v. Barnes, </em>85 Wn. App. 638, 667, 932 P.2d 669, <em>review denied, </em>133 Wn.2d 1021 (1997). Other states have looked to the federal RICO act when construing their state \u201clittle RICO\u201d acts. <em>E.g., State v. Huynh, </em>519 N.W.2d 191, 194 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>(Minn. 1994); <em>Boyd v. State, </em>578 So. 2d 718, 720 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1991);</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">The federal RICO act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1968, was enacted in 1970. Congress enacted RICO to combat organized crime; but, although it had organized crime as its focus, the act was not limited in application to organized crime. <em>National Org. for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, </em>510 U.S. 249, 260, 114 S. Ct. 798, 127 L. Ed. 2d 99 (1994). The Supreme Court has explained that the federal RICO act is to be read broadly and that it is to be \u201cliberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes.\u201d <em>Sedima, </em>473 U.S. at 497-98. RICO provides for both civil and criminal remedies to redress violations of the act, as does the Washington Criminal Profiteering Act. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1968; RCW 9A.82. The Senate report regarding the federal RICO statute recognized a difference between criminal and civil enforcement in describing proposed civil remedies that would have been available to the government. The report emphasized that although those proposed remedies were intended to place additional pressure on organized crime, they were intended to reach essentially an economic, not a punitive goal. The Senate report explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-5\">However remedies may be fashioned, it is necessary to free the channels of commerce from predatory activities, <em>but </em>there is no intent to visit punishment on any individual; the purpose is civil. Punishment as such is limited to the criminal remedies</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">S. Rep. No. 91-617, at 81 (1969), <em>quoted in Sedima, </em>473 U.S. at 529 (Powell, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">In an effort to combat organized crime, a number of states, including Washington, have enacted their own versions of RICO. <em>See </em>Michael P Sullivan, Annotation, <em>Civil Action for Damages under State Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Acts (RICO) for Losses from Racketeering Activity, </em>62 A.L.R.4th 654, 657 (1988). In 1985, the Washington Legislature passed the Criminal Profiteering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>Act (formerly Racketeering Act<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>). The act created several new crimes and also provided for a variety of civil penalties and remedies. \u201cCriminal profiteering\u201d includes the commission, or attempted commission, for financial gain, of any one of a number of crimes listed in the statute. Among the crimes which may constitute profiteering are many violent felonies and felonies relating to gambling, drugs, pornography, prostitution, extortion, and securities fraud. The act provides that a \u201cpattern of criminal profiteering activity\u201d means engaging in at least three acts of criminal profiteering within a five-year period. To constitute a \u201cpattern,\u201d the three acts must have the same or similar intent, results, accomplices, principals, victims or methods of commission, or be otherwise interrelated by distinguishing characteristics including a nexus to the same enterprise, and must not be isolated events. A \u201cpattern\u201d of profiteering is usually required before any of the special civil remedies apply. RCW 9A.82.010(14), (15); 9A.82.100; Final Legislative Report, 49th Wash. Leg., 1st Reg.

The act calls the $250,000 penalty a \u201ccivil penalty.\u201d RCW 9A.82.100(l)(d). The act creates a civil burden of proof. RCW 9A.82.100(9). The act refers to the \u201ccivil proceedings under this section\u201d in the statute of limitations section. RCW 9A.82.100(7). The Final Legislative Report explains that a person injured by racketeering activity may file a \u201ccivil action for treble damages\u201d and a \u201ccivil penalty of up to $250,000\u201d may be imposed. Final Legislative Report at 140. We conclude the Legislature intended the sanctions contained in RCW 9A.82.100, which include the civil penalty, the treble damages to the victim and reimbursement for the costs of investigation and prosecution, to be civil in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">Stein argues that the Legislature considered the statute to be criminal because the sanctions are imposed on the basis of a previous conviction for a crime. We have recently rejected this argument. In <em>Catlett, </em>we explained that \u201c[t]he fact that the basis for the civil forfeiture may be criminal activity does not render the forfeiture proceeding either criminal or a resulting forfeiture punishment for double jeopardy purposes. The <em>Ursery </em>court held that such linkage was insufficient to render the statute punitive.\u201d <em>Catlett, </em>133 Wn.2d at 364-65. We have repeatedly held that the Legislature may provide for both civil sanctions and criminal penalties in the same statute without thereby converting the civil proceeding to a criminal or penal one. <em>Beckett </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number><em>v. Department of Soc. &amp; Health Servs., </em>87 Wn.2d 184, 188, 550 P.2d 529 (1976), <em>overruled on other grounds by Dunner v. McLaughlin, </em>100 Wn.2d 832, 676 P.2d 444 (1984) (citing <em>Helvering, </em>303 U.S. at 399); <em>Yakima County Clean Air Auth. v. Glascam </em>Builders, <em>Inc., </em>85 Wn.2d 255, 260, 534 P.2d 33 (1975); <em>State v. Ralph Williams\u2019 N.W. Chrysler </em>Plymouth, <em>Inc., </em>82 Wn.2d 265, 278, 510 P.2d 233, 59 A.L.R.3d 1209 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\">A legislature\u2019s designation of a penalty as civil is entitled to considerable deference and that designation will not be overborne unless the statute, considered on its face and without reference to the level of sanction imposed in the particular case, is clearly so punitive as to render it criminal despite the legislature\u2019s intent to the contrary. <em>Securities &amp; Exch. Comm\u2019n v. Palmisano, </em>135 F.3d 860 (2d Cir. 1998); <em>Kennedy, </em>372 U.S. at 169; <em>Ursery, </em>518 U.S. at 290; <em>see also Catlett, </em>133 Wn.2d at 367. The Court in <em>Hudson </em>stated that only the clearest proof of its punitive character will suffice to override legislative intent and transform a sanction labeled civil into one that is criminal. <em>Hudson, 522 </em>U.S. at 100 (citing <em>Ward, </em>448 U.S. at 249).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Turning to the second stage of the <em>Hudson </em>analysis, a court is to decide whether the statutory scheme was so punitive either in purpose or effect as to transform what was intended as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty. Following the <em>Hudson </em>methodology, we look to the <em>Kennedy </em>factors. The Supreme Court has explained that the list of considerations \u201cwhile certainly neither exhaustive nor dis-positive,\u201d has proved helpful. <em>Ward, </em>448 U.S. at 249. The <em>Kennedy </em>factors include: (1) whether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint; (2) whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment; (3) whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter; (4) whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment\u2014retribution and deterrence; (5) whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime; (6) whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it; and (7) whether it appears excessive in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>relation to the alternative purpose assigned. <em>Kennedy, </em>372 U.S. at 168-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">First, the penalties imposed in this case do not involve an \u201caffirmative restraint,\u201d such as imprisonment. <em>See Cole, </em>133 F.3d at 806; <em>Hudson, </em>118 S. Ct. at 496; <em>see also Palmisano, </em>135 F.3d 860. Second, the Supreme Court has determined that money penalties have not historically been viewed as criminal punishment. \u201c \u2018[T]he payment of fixed or variable sums of money [is a] sanction which ha[s] been recognized as enforcable [sic] by civil proceedings since the original revenue law of 1789.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hudson, </em>118 S. Ct. at 496 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Helvering, </em>303 U.S at 400); <em>Cole, </em>133 F.3d at 806. The first two factors point toward a conclusion that the sanctions are not criminal in nature. The third factor is more equivocal. The penalties do involve scienter in the sense that the predicate crimes underlying a \u201cpattern of criminal profiteering\u201d require whatever mental element is necessary to the crime, and criminal profiteering is defined as an act or offense committed for financial gain. RCW 9A.82.010(14), (15); 9A.82.100.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">The fourth factor is whether the sanction\u2019s operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment\u2014retribution and deterrence. The possibility of treble damages to victims and civil penalties to the government, together with the costs of prosecution available under the profiteering act, may serve somewhat as a deterrent. However, the Supreme Court has recognized that all civil penalties will have some deterrent effect. <em>See Hudson, </em>118 S. Ct. at 493. This does not necessarily render them criminal punishments since deterrence \u201c \u2018may serve civil as well as criminal goals.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hudson, </em>118 S. Ct. at 496 (quoting <em>Ursery, </em>116 S. Ct. at 2149). In <em>Hudson, </em>the Court held that in the context of the banking industry, government regulation in the form of monetary sanctions to deter fraud and self-dealing is designed to, inter alia, foster public confidence and promote the stability of the banking industry. The Court noted that \u201c[t]o hold that the mere presence of a deterrent purpose renders such sanctions \u2018criminal\u2019 for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>double jeopardy purposes would severely undermine the Government\u2019s ability to engage in effective regulation.\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>522 U.S. at 105. Similarly, in a recent case using the <em>Hudson </em>analysis, the Second Circuit held that the deterrence of securities fraud serves other important non-punitive goals, such as encouraging investor confidence, increasing the efficiency of financial markets and promoting the stability of the securities industry. <em>Palmisano, </em>135 F.3d 860. The Seventh Circuit recently held that under a <em>Hudson </em>double jeopardy analysis, civil sanctions for violation of the Commodity Exchange Act, while serving the goal of deterrence, also served the remedial purpose of ensuring the integrity of the commodities markets. <em>LaCrosse, </em>137 F.3d 925.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">The Senate report for the federal RICO statute explained that the civil remedies of that act were intended to reach essentially an economic, not a punitive, goal. S. Rep. at 81, <em>cited in Sedima, </em>473 U.S. at 529 (Powell, J., dissenting). The State Attorney General, amicus in this case, argues that no legitimate business can compete with criminal profiteering enterprises and that such profiteering injures the economy. The Attorney General argues that the civil RICO statute is remedial because it takes away the illegal profit, restores integrity in the marketplace, and compensates society for the economic harm and the cost of investigating and remedying patterns of crimes committed for economic profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">The statement of findings that prefaces the federal RICO act indicates that deterrence serves a civil goal as well as a criminal goal: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number><em>United States v. Turkette, </em>452 U.S. 576, 588, 101 S. Ct. 2524, 69 L. Ed. 2d 246 (1981) (quoting 84 Stat. 922-23<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>). Similarly, we conclude that under our \u201clittle RICO\u201d act, deterrence serves civil as well as criminal goals.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>\u201c[T]his money and power are increasingly used to infiltrate and corrupt legitimate business and labor unions and to subvert and corrupt our democratic processes. . . .

The sanctions here are imposed for a \u201cpattern\u201d of criminal profiteering and are based on the predicate crimes committed. However, the <em>Hudson </em>Court explained that the fact that the same conduct for which a person received a civil money sanction is also criminal in nature is insufficient to render the money penalties criminally punitive in the double jeopardy context. <em>Hudson, </em>522 U.S. at 105 (citing <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>509 U.S. 688, 704, 113 S. Ct. 2849, 125 L. Ed. 2d 556 (1993) (rejecting the \u201csame-conduct\u201d test for double jeopardy purposes)); <em>LaCrosse, </em>137 F.3d 925.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">The sixth and seventh <em>Kennedy </em>factors are whether the penalty is rationally related to an alternative, nonpunitive purpose and whether the penalty is excessive in relation to this alternative purpose. We have considered these two factors to be critical when resolving a double jeopardy claim. <em>Catlett, </em>133 Wn.2d at 367 (citing <em>In re Young, </em>122 Wn.2d at 23). The inquiry focuses on the statute on its face, not on the facts of a particular defendant\u2019s case. <em>Hudson, </em>522 U.S. at 101; <em>Cole, </em>133 F.3d at 807 n.4. Our state statute allows for up to treble damages to victims of a pattern of crimes committed for profit, a civil penalty of up to $250,000, and the costs of litigation. RCW 9A.82.100. The primary goal of these damages is to make victims of crime whole, to provide incentive to seek damages, and to reimburse society for the very high costs involved with investigating, prosecuting and seeking recompense in a civil action. Like Congress\u2019 intent in enacting the federal RICO act, our state Legislature has sought to take the profit out of organized crime and to place the financial burden on those who engage in repeated crimes for monetary gain.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>The Supreme Court has noted that treble damages, awardable to federal RICO plaintiffs who have been the victims of criminal activity, serve the purpose to give those victims an incentive to litigate. <em>Sedima, </em>473 U.S. at 493. Even in <em>Halper, </em>the Supreme Court distinguished between cases where the government seeks a sanction and where a victim seeks damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-4\">Finally, nothing in today\u2019s opinion precludes a private party from filing a civil suit seeking damages for conduct that previously was the subject of criminal prosecution and punishment. The protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause are not triggered by litigation between private parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-5\"><em>Halper, </em>490 U.S. at 451; <em>see also Jines v. Seiber, </em>193 Ill. App. 3d 390, 549 N.E.2d 964, 966, 140 Ill. Dec. 313 (1990) (holding that because punitive damages awarded to the victim of an assault are not \u201cessentially criminal\u201d in nature, their imposition does not bar subsequent criminal action under double jeopardy principles).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">We noted in <em>Rice </em>that the Supreme Court has characterized the federal RICO statute as having \u201cremedial purposes\u201d which are \u201cnowhere more evident than in the provision of a private action for those injured by racketeering activity.\u201d <em>Rice, </em>109 Wn.2d at 55 (citing <em>Sedima, </em>473 U.S. at 498). The federal act was described as \u201c \u2018a major new tool in extirpating the baneful influence of organized crime in our economic life.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sedima, </em>473 U.S. at 488 (quoting 116 Cong. Rec. at 25190 (1970)). The Supreme Court, in considering the federal RICO act, stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-7\">the fact that conduct can result in both criminal liability and treble damages does not mean that there is not a bona fide civil action. The familiar provisions for both criminal liability and treble damages under the antitrust laws indicate as much. Nor are attorney\u2019s fees \u201cclearly punitive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-8\"><em>Sedima, </em>473 U.S. at 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">Our statute allows either the victim, or the State on behalf of the victim, to seek compensatory and punitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>damages. As a practical matter, a private citizen who has been the victim of crime may be afraid to oppose one who has engaged in a pattern of criminal acts. We perceive no prohibition which would stop the Legislature from providing that the Attorney General or a prosecutor may seek damages for the victims of crime. While the State may bring the action, the treble damages are sought on behalf of the victim and it is the victim who is awarded the compensation. RCW 9A.82.100(4)(d). The jury awarded Thelma Lund\u2019s estate damages pursuant to the wrongful death cause of action. No issues pertaining to that action are before the Court in this appeal. Pursuant to the Criminal Profiteering Act, the judge awarded additional double damages to the victim\u2019s family.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The jury awarded damages to Ned Hall, the attorney who was the guardian for Nick Stein and the intended victim of the three murder attempts. The judge imposed treble damages pursuant to statute. Mr. Stein argues that punitive damages are not allowed under Washington law. This is inaccurate. Punitive damages are allowed when expressly authorized by the Legislature. <em>E.g., Dailey v. North Coast Life Ins. Co., </em>129 Wn.2d 572, 919 P.2d 589 (1996); <em>Kammerer v. Western Gear Corp., </em>96 Wn.2d 416, 421, 635 P.2d 708 (1981); <em>Barr v. Interbay Citizens Bank, </em>96 Wn.2d 692, 699, 635 P.2d 441, 649 P.2d 827 (1981). We conclude the punitive damages awarded to the victims of a pattern of criminal profiteering serve the nonpunitive purpose of compensating victims for their losses, and the provision for treble damages affords incentive to litigate against the perpetrators. The statutory penalty of treble damages awarded in the court\u2019s discretion is not excessive in relation to this alternative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>In light of existing precedent, we also conclude that the portion of the profiteering act allowing a civil penalty not exceeding $250,000 in addition to the cost of the suit does not violate the double jeopardy clause. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that civil sanctions imposed subsequent to criminal prosecutions will not violate double jeopardy principles when the sanction serves to reimburse or compensate the government for investigatory, detection, prosecution and other costs. We have explained that liquidated damages and double the actual governmental costs do not constitute criminal punishment for the purposes of the double jeopardy bar. This Court has distinguished between civil remedial actions brought primarily to protect the government from financial loss and actions intended to authorize criminal punishment to vindicate public justice. Only the latter subjects a defendant to \u201cjeopardy\u201d within the constitutional sense. <em>United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, </em>317 U.S. 537, 548-49, 63 S. Ct. 379, 87 L. Ed. 443 (1943). In <em>Hess, </em>the Supreme Court explained that after being fined in a criminal action for bidding collusively on public-works projects, it did not violate double jeopardy when plaintiffs in the name of the United States brought an action for a civil penalty including $2,000 per violation plus double the amount of actual damages and the costs of the suit. The <em>Hess </em>Court reasoned that the device of double damages plus a specific sum was chosen to make sure that the government would be completely made whole and since the proceedings under the statute were remedial and designed to \u201cprotect the government from financial loss\u201d\u2014 rather than to \u201cvindicate public justice\u201d\u2014they were civil in nature. <em>Hess, </em>317 U.S. at 551-52, 548-49. <em>See also Rex Trailer Co. v. United States, </em>350 U.S. 148, 76 S. Ct. 219, 100 L. Ed. 149 (1956) (after defendants paid fines in a criminal case for fraudulently purchasing vehicles under the Surplus Property Act, it did not violate double jeopardy when the government brought a civil action for $2,000 per act plus double damages and the costs of suit); <em>Helvering, </em>303 U.S. 391 (after acquittal on tax evasion charges, it did not violate double jeopardy when the government brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>an action to collect a tax deficiency as well as a 50 percent additional penalty because the deficiency sanction was remedial, providing reimbursement to the government for investigatory and other costs of taxpayer fraud).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Even the <em>Halper </em>case, which the Supreme Court recently found to have articulated too strict a double jeopardy standard, concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-6\">The relevant teaching of these cases is that the Government is entitled to rough remedial justice, that is, it may demand compensation according to somewhat imprecise formulas, such as reasonable liquidated damages or a fixed sum plus double damages, without being deemed to have imposed a second punishment for the purpose of double jeopardy analysis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-7\"><em>Halper, </em>490 U.S. at 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">In further discussing what civil sanctions can be imposed in a proceeding which follows a criminal action without violating the double jeopardy bar, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-9\">We acknowledge that this inquiry will not be an exact pursuit. In our decided cases we have noted that the precise amount of the Government\u2019s damages and costs may prove to be difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain. <em>See, e.g., Rex Trailer, </em>350 U.S., at 153. Similarly, it would be difficult if not impossible in many cases for a court to determine the precise dollar figure at which a civil sanction has accomplished its remedial purpose of making the Government whole, but beyond which the sanction takes on the quality of punishment. In other words, as we have observed above, the process of affixing a sanction that compensates the Government for all its costs inevitably involves an element of rough justice. Our upholding reasonable liquidated damages clauses reflects this unavoidable imprecision. Similarly, we have recognized that in the ordinary case fixed-penalty-plus-double-damages provisions can be said to do no more than make the Government whole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-10\"><em>Halper, </em>490 U.S. at 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">In a recent case, the Eleventh Circuit explained that the Supreme Court \u201cemphatically denied any intention to limit the Government to the recovery of direct damages, exclusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>of ancillary costs.\u201d <em>United States v. Barnette, </em>10 F.3d 1553, 1559 (11th Cir. 1994). In that case, after the defendant\u2019s criminal conviction, the government filed a civil action asserting claims under federal RICO and other theories based on the same conduct for which Barnette was convicted. The Eleventh Circuit held that even a civil sanction which is three times what the defendant\u2019s fraud caused the government \u201csimply does not lack a \u2018rational relation to the Government\u2019s loss\u2019 \u201d and concluded such a civil penalty did not violate double jeopardy. <em>Barnette, </em>10 F.3d at 1560 (quoting <em>United States v.

However, that case dealt only with the gain that a person had acquired through an offense included in the definition of criminal profiteering and did not address the civil penalties or treble damages available under that statute. That case is narrow on its facts because it dealt only with \u201cproceeds\u201d of illegal activity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b900-6\">However, our statute is narrower in some respects than the federal act.

As the State notes, while it might be in certain circumstances that an award of punitive damages or a civil penalty is so excessive or irrational as to implicate the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendment, or constitute an abuse of discretion, that is not the case here and would not, in any event, implicate the double jeopardy clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b914-6\">Alexander, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Anc\">(dissenting in part) \u2014 I dissent in part. In my view, the Court of Appeals was correct in concluding that the trial court\u2019s imposition of the $250,000 penalty violated the double jeopardy clause of the state and federal constitutions. Although the Legislature has labeled sanctions imposed pursuant to RCW 9A.82.100(l)(d) a \u201ccivil penalty,\u201d it is apparent that the legislative declaration does not accurately characterize the penalty that was imposed here. Despite the majority\u2019s effort to square the penalty with the seven factors enumerated in <em>Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, </em>372 U.S. 144, 83 S. Ct. 554, 9 L. Ed. 2d 644 (1963), in the final analysis its holding that the $250,000 penalty passes constitutional muster is based on its conclusion that the penalty \u201ccompensate^ the government for costs it has incurred because of violations of the law.\u201d Majority op. at 861. How the majority reaches that conclusion is beyond me. This so-called \u201ccivil penalty\u201d followed on the heels of an award to the State of $223,894.19 for the costs it incurred in investigation and prosecution, and another award of $38,301 for costs, disbursements, and attorney fees. What additional costs did the State incur that are indemnified by the $250,000 penalty? That question is <em>not </em>answered by the majority. Indeed, at oral argument before this court, the State was asked that precise question and its counsel was unable to identify any specific costs that the State incurred that were not covered by the specific awards for costs that totaled over $250,000. Its brief is similarly unavailing. The plain fact is that this \u201ccivil penalty\u201d of $250,000 serves only to punish and it does not indemnify the State for any costs that it incurred. I would, therefore, affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>Johnson, Madsen, and Sanders, JJ., concur with Alexander, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
