Committee violated RCW 42.17.530(l)(a) by publishing false political advertising. We must decide two issues: does RCW 42.17.530(l)(a) violate the First Amendment on its face; and, if not, did the subject advertisement violate the statute. As we conclude, RCW 42.17.530(l)(a) indeed facially violates the First Amendment\u2014the second question falls by the way.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">The State of Washington on relation of the Public Disclosure Commission brought suit against the 119 Vote No! Committee, its executive director and its treasurer. The State alleges the Committee published political advertising contrary to RCW 42.17.530(l)(a) during the course of its campaign in opposition to Initiative 119, the so-called \u201cDeath with Dignity Act.\u201d Ultimately the initiative went down to defeat at the polls on November 5, 1991. The one-page printed advertisement begins with the words \u201cVote No!\u201d superimposed over the words \u201cInitiative 119,\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 18, and generally suggests the initiative invites assisted suicide without sufficient safeguards.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">RCW 42.17.530(l)(a) prohibits any person from sponsoring, with actual malice, a political advertisement contain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>ing a false statement of material fact.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The State\u2019s complaint alleged the advertisement distributed by the Committee \u201ccontained false statements of material fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>and was published by the Committee with actual malice, that is, with knowledge that the statements contained in the advertisement were false or in reckless disregard of whether the statements were false.\u201d CP at 6. The PDC\u2019s referral arose from a complaint filed by proponents of the initiative. The State\u2019s complaint prayed the Committee and individual defendants be fined up to $10,000 plus costs, attorney fees, and treble damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">The Committee moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim for which relief could be granted. CR 12(b)(6). The American Civil Liberties Union of Washington (ACLU) intervened pursuant to CR 24 to challenge the facial constitutionality of RCW 42.17.530(l)(a) by declaratory judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following briefing and argument, the trial court concluded the advertisement did not contain materially false statements and dismissed. The trial court awarded the Committee attorney fees and costs pursuant to RCW 42.17.4(H)(5).3 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Notwithstanding dismissal of the principal action against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>the Committee, the ACLU pursued its claim for a declaratory judgment of invalidity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The ACLU and the State cross-moved for summary judgment each seeking a declaration as to the statute\u2019s constitutionality under the First Amendment. On stipulated facts concerning the enforcement of RCW 42.17.530(l)(a) the court granted the State\u2019s motion, concluding the statute facially passed First Amendment muster. Both parties appealed. We granted direct review.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">\u201cUnder CR 12(b)(6), a complaint can be dismissed if it fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Because a trial court\u2019s dismissal under this rule is a holding on a question of law, appellate review is de novo.\u201d <em>Hoffer v. State, </em>110 Wn.2d 415, 420, 755 P.2d 781 (1988). Likewise, the facial constitutionality of a statute is a question of law which requires de novo review. <em>Timberline Air Serv. Inc. v. Bell Helicopter-Textron, Inc., </em>125 Wn.2d 305, 311, 884 P.2d 920 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">III. Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">RCW 42.17.530(l)(a) provides: \u201cIt is a violation of this chapter for a person to sponsor with actual malice . . . [political advertising that contains a false statement of material fact . . . .\u201d The Committee and the ACLU argue the statute is a facially unconstitutional abridgment of free speech. The State asserts its interest in an informed electorate justifies this burden upon political debate.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\"> The constitutional guarantee of free speech has its \u201cfullest and most urgent application\u201d in political cam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>paigns. <em>Brown v. Hartlage, </em>456 U.S. 45, 53, 102 S. Ct. 1523, 71 L. Ed. 2d 732 (1982) (quoting <em>Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy, </em>401 U.S. 265, 271-72, 91 S. Ct. 621, 28 L. Ed. 2d 35 (1971)). Therefore, the State bears a \u201cwell-nigh insurmountable\u201d burden to justify RCW 42.17.530\u2019s restriction on political speech. <em>Meyer v. Grant, </em>486 U.S. 414, 425, 108 S. Ct. 1886, 100 L. Ed. 2d 425 (1988). This burden requires the court to apply \u201cexacting scrutiny\u201d to RCW 42.17.530(1)(a). <em>Meyer, </em>486 U.S. at 420. <em>See also Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 39, 96 S. Ct. 612, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659 (1976). Exacting scrutiny will invalidate the statute unless the State demonstrates a compelling interest that is both narrowly tailored and necessary. <em>McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm\u2019n, </em>514 U.S. 334, 347, 115 S. Ct. 1511, 1519, 131 L. Ed. 2d 426 (1995); <em>Burson v. Freeman, </em>504 U.S. 191, 198, 112 S. Ct. 1846, 119 L. Ed. 2d 5 (1992). Such burdens are rarely met. <em>Burson, </em>504 U.S. at 199-200. <em>Ino Ino, Inc. v. City of Bellevue, </em>132 Wn.2d 103, 114, 937 P.2d 154 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1077 (1998) (\u201cThe State bears the burden of justifying a restriction on speech.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">A. RCW 42.17.530(l)(a) infringes on speech protected by the First Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Uninhibited speech \u201c \u2018is the single most important element upon which this nation has thrived.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nelson v. McClatchy Newspapers, Inc., </em>131 Wn.2d 523, 536, 936 P.2d 1123 (quoting <em>Guzick v. Drebus, </em>305 F. Supp. 472, 481 (N.D. Ohio 1969), <em>aff'd, </em>431 F.2d 594 (6th Cir. 1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>401 U.S. 948, 91 S. Ct. 941, 28 L. Ed. 2d 231 (1971)), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 866 (1997). Free speech is revered as the \u201cConstitution\u2019s most majestic guarantee,\u201d central to the preservation of all other rights. <em>Id. </em>at 536. Advocacy of one\u2019s political views through leafleting lies at the very core of our First Amendment freedoms. <em>McIntyre, </em>514 U.S. at 346-47; <em>Meyer, </em>486 U.S. at 421-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The State asserts it may prohibit false statements of fact contained in political advertisements. This claim pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>supposes the State possesses an independent right to determine truth and falsity in political debate. However, the courts have \u201cconsistently refused to recognize an exception for any test of truth\u2014whether administered by judges, juries, or administrative officials\u2014and especially one that puts the burden of proving truth on the speaker.\u201d <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 271, 84 S. Ct. 710, 11 L. Ed. 2d 686, 95 A.L.R.2d 1412 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">Rather, the First Amendment operates to insure the public decides what is true and false with respect to governance. Meyer,; 486 U.S. at 419-20; <em>Riley v. National Fed\u2019n of the Blind of N.C., Inc., </em>487 U.S. 781, 791, 108 S. Ct. 2667, 101 L. Ed. 2d 669 (1988). In <em>Meyer, </em>the Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">\u201c \u2018The very purpose of the First Amendment is to foreclose public authority from assuming a guardianship of the public mind .... In this field <em>every person </em>must be his own watchman for truth, because the forefathers did not trust any government to separate the true from the false for us.\u2019 <em>Thomas v. Collins, </em>[323 U.S. 516, 545 (1945)] (Jackson, J., concurring).\u201d [Gr<em>ant v. Meyer, </em>828 F.2d 1446, 1455 (10th Cir. 1987)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-6\"><em>Meyer, </em>486 U.S. at 419-20 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Particularly in the religious and political realms, \u201cthe tenets of one man . . . seem the rankest error to his neighbor.\u201d <em>Cantwell v. Connecticut, </em>310 U.S. 296, 310, 60 S. Ct. 900, 84 L. Ed. 2d 1213, 128 A.L.R. 1352 (1940). Therefore, the Supreme Court has recognized that to sustain our constitutional commitment to uninhibited political discourse, the State may not prevent others from \u201cresort[ing] to exaggeration, to vilification of men who have been, or are, prominent in church and state, and <em>even to false statement.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). At times such speech seems unpalatable, but the value of free debate overcomes the danger of misuse. <em>McIntyre, </em>514 U.S. at 357. For even false statements make valuable contributions to debate by bringing about \u201cthe clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.\u201d <em>New York Times, </em>376 U.S. at 279 n.19 (quoting John S. Mill, On Liberty 15 (Oxford, Blackwell 1947)).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Specifically, the First Amendment prohibits the State from silencing speech it disapproves, particularly silencing criticism of government itself. Threats of coerced silence chill uninhibited political debate and undermine the very purpose of the First Amendment. <em>See Riley, </em>487 U.S. at 791; <em>Brown, 456 </em>U.S. at 61; <em>Meyer, </em>486 U.S. at 419-20.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-4\">[The Founders of the nation] believed that freedom to think as you will and speak as you think are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth. . . . Believing in the power of reason as applied through the public discussion, they eschewed silence coerced by law\u2014the argument of force in its worst form.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-5\"><em>Whitney v. California, </em>274 U.S. 357, 375-76, 47 S. Ct. 641, 71 L. Ed. 1095 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring), <em>overruled on other grounds by Brandenburg v. Ohio, </em>395 U.S. 444, 89 S. Ct. 1827, 23 L. Ed. 2d 430 (1969). <em>See also New York Times, </em>376 U.S. at 270. The State cannot \u201csubstitute its judgment as to how best to speak for that of speakers and listeners; free and robust debate cannot thrive if directed by the government.\u201d <em>Riley, </em>487 U.S. at 791. \u201cFor speech concerning public affairs is more than self-expression; it is the essence of self government.\u201d <em>Garrison v. Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 64, 74-75, 85 S. Ct. 209, 13 L. Ed. 2d 125 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Instead of relying on the State to silence false political speech, the First Amendment requires our dependence on even more speech to bring forth truth. <em>Brown, </em>456 U.S. at 61. <em>See also Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323, 339-40, 94 S. Ct. 2997, 41 L. Ed. 2d 789 (1974). In the political context, a campaign\u2019s factual blunder is most likely noticed and corrected by the campaign\u2019s political opponent rather than the State. <em>Id. </em>Contrary to claims made by Justice Talmadge in his concurrence, the Supreme Court has refused to recognize the possibility of \u201c \u2018an eleventh-hour anonymous smear campaign\u2019 \u201d as enough to justify a restriction on speech. <em>McIntyre, </em>514 U.S. at 352 n.16 (quoting <em>People v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number><em>White, </em>116 Ill. 2d 171, 506 N.E.2d 1284, 1288, 107 Ill. Dec. 229 (1987)). Moreover, a well-publicized, yet bogus, complaint to the PDC on election eve raises the same concern. Therefore, \u201c[t]he preferred First Amendment remedy of \u2018more speech, not enforced silence\u2019 thus has special force.\u201d <em>Brown v. Hartlage, </em>456 U.S. 45, 61, 102 S. Ct. 1523, 1533, 71 L. Ed. 2d 732 (1982) (citation omitted). Underlying our dependence upon more speech is the presupposition \u201cthat right conclusions are more likely to be gathered out of a multitude of tongues, than through any kind of authoritative selection. To many this is, and always will be, folly; but we have staked upon it our all.\u2019 \u201d <em>New York Times, </em>376 U.S. at 270 (quoting <em>United States v. Associated Press, </em>52 F. Supp. 362, 372 (S.D.N.Y. 1943)).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">RCW 42.17.530 coerces silence by force of law and presupposes the State will \u201cseparate the truth from the false\u201d for the citizenry. The government made a similar attempt to suppress \u201cseditious libel\u201d in the Sedition Act of 1798, 1 Stat. 596 (1798). <em>New York Times, </em>376 U.S. at 273. That Act made it a crime for any person to write, print, utter or publish any false writings against the government. <em>Id. </em>at 273-74 (quoting 1 Stat. 596). The Act was vigorously condemned as unconstitutional because it inevitably chilled that political debate needed for self-governance; however, it was allowed to expire by its own terms in 1801 before judicial challenge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 274, 276. The First Amendment exists precisely to protect against laws such as RCW 42.17.530(l)(a) which suppress ideas and inhibit free discussion of governmental affairs. <em>See McIntyre, </em>514 U.S. at 357; <em>Mills v. Alabama, </em>384 U.S. 214, 218, 86 S. Ct. 1434, 16 L. Ed. 2d 484 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Even assuming, as per Justice Talmadge\u2019s concurrence, that malicious falsehoods against candidates are beyond constitutional protection, this statute has broader reach and brings within its sweep every maliciously false state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>ment of \u201cmaterial fact\u201d whether it is defamatory to an individual or not. Justice Talmadge\u2019s concurrence cites no authority to support its broad claim that all false statements in a political advertisement, including statements relating to issues campaigns, may be prohibited as unprotected speech. Moreover, the statutory requirement that malice be proved by a high standard of proof does not cure the infirmity as the chilling effect of possible governmental sanction will not be lost on the faint of heart.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">B. RCW 42.17.530(l)(a) does not serve a compelling state interest</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Because RCW 42.17.530(l)(a) infringes upon protected speech, the court must apply \u201cexacting scrutiny.\u201d The State bears the \u201cwell-nigh insurmountable\u201d burden to prove a compelling interest that is <em>both </em>narrowly tailored and necessary to achieve the State\u2019s asserted interest. <em>McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm\u2019n, </em>514 U.S. 334, 347, 115 S. Ct. 1511, 1519, 131 L. Ed. 2d 426 (1995); <em>Burson, </em>504 U.S. at 198. States rarely meet this heavy burden. <em>Burson, </em>504 U.S. at 199-200.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">The State claims its interest to foster an informed electorate outweighs the imposition upon political expression by RCW 42.17.530(1)(a). The State relies heavily on defamation cases to prove a compelling interest to justify intrusion into public debate citing <em>Gertz, </em>418 U.S. at 340, which states: \u201c[Tjhere is no constitutional value in false statements of fact. Neither the intentional lie nor the careless error materially advances society\u2019s interest in \u2018uninhibited, robust, and wide-open\u2019 debate on public issues.\u201d <em>See also Garrison, </em>379 U.S. at 75 (quoting New <em>York Times Co., </em>376 U.S. at 270). The State argues the language in these defamation cases applies with equal force to all political speech, even if no one is defamed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">However the State\u2019s rebanee on the law of defamation is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>misplaced. By its nature defamation concerns statements made by one person against another and is designed to protect the property of an individual in his or her good name.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-4\">The legitimate state interest underlying the law of libel is the compensation of individuals for the harm inflicted on them by a defamatory falsehood. . . . [T]he individual\u2019s right to the protection of his own good name \u201creflects no more than our basic concept of the essential dignity and worth of every human being\u2014a concept at the root of any decent system of ordered liberty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-5\"><em>Gertz, </em>418 U.S. at 341 (quoting <em>Rosenblatt v. </em>Baer; 383 U.S. 75, 92, 86 S. Ct. 669, 15 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1966) (Stewart, J., concurring)). Clearly, a competing interest exists in defamation cases which is absent here. As then-Professor Fried explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">Free speech cases often explain that \u201c[t]here is no such thing as a false idea.\u201d But why may the state intervene to prohibit or punish factually false statements? Defamation and deception are actionable wrongs, perhaps on the reasoning I have already offered: they vindicate private rights invoked by, or at least on behalf of, private individuals. But the First Amendment precludes punishment for generalized \u201cpublic\u201d frauds, deceptions and defamation. In political campaigns the grossest misstatements, deceptions, and defamations are immune from legal sanction unless they violate private rights\u2014that is, unless individuals are defamed.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Charles Fried, <em>The New First Amendment Jurisprudence: </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number><em>A Threat to Liberty, </em>59 U. Chi. L. Rev. 225, 238 (1992) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">However RCW 42.17.530(l)(a) restricts political speech absent the competing interest present in defamation cases, and, unlike a defamation suit, creates a cause of action for the government to pursue against a private person. \u201cThe legitimate state interest underlying the law of libel is the compensation of individuals for the harm inflicted on them for defamatory falsehood.\u201d <em>Gertz, </em>418 U.S. at 341. <em>See also Rosenblatt, </em>383 U.S. at 93 (\u201c[A]n action for damages is the only hope for vindication or redress the law gives to a man whose reputation has been falsely dishonored.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Additionally, the State relies upon the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>McIntyre, </em>as well as this court\u2019s decision in <em>In re Discipline of Donohoe, </em>90 Wn.2d 173, 580 P.2d 1093 (1978), to support its contention that it has a compelling interest to regulate maliciously false speech. But neither case supports its claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">In <em>McIntyre </em>the Supreme Court held a statute prohibiting anonymous leaflets violated the First Amendment. The Court noted Ohio\u2019s Elections Code contained detailed prohibitions against making false statements. 514 U.S. at 349. Therefore the State asserts <em>McIntyre </em>impliedly suggested laws prohibiting false political statements are constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">However the inference to be drawn from <em>McIntyre </em>is just the opposite. <em>McIntyre </em>explained that speech made in the heat of a political contest receives more protection than any other form of political speech. <em>Id. </em>at 347. The state in <em>McIntyre </em>argued the speech restrictions were necessary because false advertising might be distributed as \u201can eleventh-hour anonymous smear campaign.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353 n.16. The Court explained the statute could not be upheld on that ground because it swept within it speech unrelated to the state\u2019s concern. <em>Id. </em>Describing the statute\u2019s unconstitutional breadth, the Court distinguished between literature supporting or opposing candidates from referenda as \u201c[a] public question clearly cannot be the victim of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>character assassination.\u201d <em>Id. McIntyre </em>indicates the State does not possess an independent right to determine truth and falsity in public issues.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">In <em>Donohoe </em>a judicial candidate made numerous allegedly false statements regarding incumbent judges. The Court disciplined the candidate, claiming the State possessed a unique interest in maintaining the integrity of the judiciary. 90 Wn.2d at 180. However the continuing viability of this precedent is questionable in light of more recent authority which prompted 1995 revisions to the Code of Judicial Conduct. <em>See, e.g., Buckley v. Illinois Judicial Inquiry Bd., </em>997 F.2d 224 (7th Cir. 1993). Justice Talmadge\u2019s concurrence quotes <em>Burson v. Freeman, </em>504 U.S. at 199-200, to suggest the State possesses a compelling interest in \u201censuring the integrity of the electoral process.\u201d Concurrence (Talmadge, J.) at 650. However, <em>Burson </em>is distinguishable as the statute there dealt with whether campaign materials could be displayed near the entrance to a polling place.

The Court reasoned: \u201c[I]f it be conceded that the First Amendment was \u2018fashioned to assure the unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people,\u2019 <em>Roth v.

The other side of the coin, of course, is that where the actual malice standard is met, speech may subject the speaker to pay damages without running afoul of the First Amendment. Thus, statements about candidates for public office made with actual knowledge of falsity or with reckless disregard of whether they are true or false are not protected under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. A state, in short, may allow recovery of damages for defamation to public officials, including candidates for public office, provided that the <em>New York Times </em>actual malice standard is satisfied. Accordingly, although there is no case directly on point, it is reasonable to contend that the Legislature could enact a law prohibiting a person from sponsoring with actual malice political advertising containing false statements of material fact about a candidate for public office.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">We need not, however, decide that issue because where an initiative measure is involved, as in this case, the First Amendment does not permit governmental censorship of political speech. There must be no impediment to free and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>open debate regarding such issues.

In so doing, the majority opinion flouts numerous United States Supreme Court pronouncements to the contrary. The majority determines RCW 42.17.530, a statute providing penalties for dissemination of false political advertising, is facially violative of the First Amendment because the State has no compelling interest in preventing lies in the course of an initiative or referendum campaign, no matter how egregious the lies may be.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">The sweep of the majority\u2019s rhetoric is so encompassing that no statute designed to ensure statements of fact in political campaigns are truthful would survive a First Amendment challenge. Moreover, the breadth of the majority\u2019s rhetoric has untold impacts on existing law regarding political campaigns for candidates and ballot measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">The majority is also shockingly oblivious to the increas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>ing nastiness of modern American political campaigns. This trend is highlighted by a \u201cwin at any cost\u201d attitude involving vilification of opponents and their ideas. This new type of campaign neither illuminates nor exemplifies the best of our democratic tradition, and has caused too many of our fellow citizens to turn away from participation in the political process.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">While I believe the First Amendment properly presents extraordinarily difficult hurdles for statutes addressing political speech and conduct, I cannot agree RCW 42.17.530 violates the First Amendment. However, because I believe the 119 Vote No! Committee (Committee) did not violate RCW 42.17.530(l)(a), I concur in the majority\u2019s disposition of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">In view of the majority\u2019s pioneering foray into uncharted First Amendment territory, one might expect an extensive legal discussion explaining what new and original insights led it to this understanding. Instead, the majority opinion consists largely of a collage of quotes extolling the virtues of free speech, propositions with which no one disagrees, and then concludes summarily the challenged statute fails the First Amendment test. Given the uniqueness of the majority\u2019s conclusion, more rigorous constitutional analysis is certainly required.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">The issue at bar has reached us on cross-motions for summary judgment. We decide appeals from summary judgments de novo. Because this case involves a First Amendment challenge to a statute regulating the content of speech, we presume the statute is unconstitutional, and subject the statute to strict scrutiny. <em>Collier v. City of Tacoma, </em>121 Wn.2d 737, 748-49, 854 P.2d 1046 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">B. Constitutionality of RCW 42.17.530</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">The majority cites only a small portion of the challenged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>statute, Majority op. at 623, and undertakes no analysis of the wording of the statute. Thus, one must guess as to the constitutional infirmities the majority claims exist. The majority tells us the State may not prohibit \u201cunpalatable\u201d speech. Majority op. at 625. But the statute addresses only lies, not vitriol. The majority tells us the State may not silence criticism of the government. <em>Id. </em>at 626. But the statute addresses only calculated falsehoods, not censure. The majority tells us the State may not chill uninhibited political debate. Majority op. at 626. But the statute addresses only malicious prevarication, not honest, robust, political debate. The majority tells us factual blunders are best corrected by the opponent. Majority op. at 626. But the statute addresses deliberate falsehoods, not innocent errors of fact.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">The key to the majority\u2019s analysis of the statute is found in the following two sentences: \u201cThe State asserts it may prohibit false statements of fact contained in political advertisements. The claim presupposes the State possesses an independent right to determine truth and falsity in political debate.\u201d Majority op. at 624-25. The majority thus presumes the people of Washington have no authority to require persons to tell the truth. This presumption is, of course, wrong. Perjury has been a part of Washington\u2019s criminal code since territorial days. <em>See </em>ch. 9A.72 RCW. Prohibitions against lying and bearing false witness may be found in cultures worldwide from time immemorial. <em>See </em>Richard H. Underwood, <em>False Witness: A Lawyer\u2019s History of the Law of Perjury, </em>10 Ariz. J. Int\u2019l &amp; Comp. L. 215 (1993), for a comprehensive survey of prohibitions against lying.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Although peijury itself concerns lying under oath or in official proceedings, there is no reason the State may not prohibit lying in other contexts pursuant to the exercise of its police power. That is precisely what the State has done by enacting the challenged statute in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The challenged statute is plainly a valid exercise of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>police power. <em>Lawton v. Steele, </em>152 U.S. 133, 137, 14 S. Ct. 499, 38 L. Ed. 385 (1894); <em>State v. Crediford, </em>130 Wn.2d 747, 752, 927 P.2d 1129 (1996) (quoting <em>State v. Brayman, </em>110 Wn.2d 183, 193, 751 P.2d 294 (1988), which in turn quoted <em>State v. Conifer Enters., Inc., </em>82 Wn.2d 94, 96-97, 508 P.2d 149 (1973)). If the elected representatives of the people of Washington, who are accountable to their constituents every two and four years, in their considered judgment believe calculated lying does not belong in electoral politics, it is not for us to question the wisdom of or necessity for such legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">Turning to the First Amendment, the threshold question is whether the statute affects speech over which the First Amendment affords protection. Without examining the wording or effect of the statute, the majority simply assumes protected speech is involved. Subsuming the answer in the question falls a good way short of the penetrating rigor a legitimate constitutional analysis requires. We start with the wording of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Before 1988, RCW 42.17.530 read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-6\">A person shall not sponsor political advertising which contains information that the person knows, or should reasonably be expected to know, to be false. No political advertising may falsely represent that a candidate is an incumbent for the office sought. A person or candidate shall not make, either directly or indirectly, a false claim stating or implying the support or endorsement of any person or organization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">In Laws of 1988, chapter 199, section 2, the Legislature replaced that language with the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-8\">(1) It is a violation of this chapter for a person to sponsor with actual malice:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-9\">(a) Political advertising that contains a false statement of material fact;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-10\">(b) Political advertising that falsely represents that a candidate is the incumbent for the office sought when in fact the candidate is not the incumbent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-11\">(c) Political advertising that makes either directly or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>indirectly, a false claim stating or implying the support or endorsement of any person or organization when in fact the candidate does not have such support or endorsement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\">(2) Any violation of this section shall be proven by clear and convincing evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The new statute now requires <em>actual malice </em>before a violation may be found. In Laws of 1988, chapter 199, section 1, now codified as RCW 42.17.505(1), the Legislature defined actual malice to mean \u201cto act with knowledge of falsity or with reckless disregard as to truth or falsity.\u201d By requiring the intermediate standard of proof, clear and convincing evidence, the new statute made violations more difficult to prove. Thus, a person violates the statute if and only if he or she sponsors political advertising that is (1) a false statement of material fact (2) with actual malice, as defined, and (3) is found to have done so by clear and convincing evidence. One example of a violation of this statute might be a political flyer from a candidate who declares herself to be the incumbent when in fact she is not. She has acted with \u201cknowledge of falsity.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Another example could be one candidate\u2019s accusing an opponent of having been convicted of desertion during the Vietnam War. In a case such as this, the accuser may have no actual knowledge one way or the other, but has violated the statute by acting with \u201creckless disregard as to the truth or falsity\u201d of the accusation. These examples are what men and women of common understanding would describe as deliberate lies. Do deliberate lies come under the protective umbrella of the First Amendment? The majority opinion says \u201cyes.\u201d The Supreme Court of the United States has said \u201cno\u201d on numerous occasions, as have all other courts addressing the same question.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The Supreme Court has unequivocally and repeatedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>refused to extend First Amendment protection to <em>deliberate lies. </em>The Court said in <em>Garrison v.

At the time the First Amendment was adopted, as today, there were those unscrupulous enough and skillful enough to use the deliberate or reckless falsehood as an effective political tool to unseat the public servant or even topple an administration. Cf. Riesman, Democracy and Defamation: Fair Game and Fair Comment I, 42 Col. L. Rev. 1085, 1088-1111 (1942). That speech is used as a tool for political ends does not automatically bring it under the protective mantle of the Constitution. For the use of the known lie as a tool is at once at odds with the premises of democratic government and with the orderly manner in which economic, social, or political change is to be effected.

As support for its position, the majority cites to <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 </em>U.S. 254, 84 S. Ct. 710,11 L. Ed. 2d 686, 95 A.L.R.2d 1412 (1964), on four separate occasions. Yet <em>nowhere </em>does the majority opinion reveal the <em>holding </em>of <em>New York Times, </em>which is \u201ca public official cannot recover for defamation unless he or she establishes the defendant made the defamatory statement with actual malice, that is, knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard for whether it was false or not.\u201d <em>Richmond v. Thompson, </em>130 Wn.2d 368, 376, 922 P.2d 1343 (1996). The new RCW 42.17.530(1)(a), having added actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>malice as a required element of the violation and having adopted from <em>New York Times </em>the exact language defining \u201cactual malice,\u201d plainly passes muster under that case. Similarly, the new statute\u2019s requirement of clear and convincing evidence mirrors the requirement for the higher standard of proof set forth in <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323, 342, 94 S. Ct. 2997, 41 L. Ed. 2d 789 (1974). How, then, can a statute on all fours with controlling United States Supreme Court authority be unconstitutional in Washington? As long as <em>New York Times </em>remains the supreme law of the land, we are not free to ignore it, or to interpret it to our liking, short of articulating independent state grounds for doing so under the Washington constitution. Nobody has made such an argument in this case. The United States Supreme Court would not find RCW 42.17.530(l)(a) unconstitutional under its First Amendment jurisprudence. Nor may we. <em>See </em>Wash. Const, art I, \u00a7 2 (\u201cThe Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the land.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">The Court\u2019s holding in <em>New York Times </em>and its repeated refusals to grant First Amendment protection to lies are completely dispositive of the issues in this case. The majority is undeterred by authority, however, and finding no case extending First Amendment protection to deliberate lies in political campaigns, asserts a novel proposition to support its conclusion: the majority decides that everything the Supreme Court said in <em>New York Times, Garrison, </em>and <em>Gertz </em>concerning deliberate lies is applicable only to defamation cases, and not to ballot issues that, because they do not involve individuals, are not susceptible to defamation actions. The Supreme Court itself has never indicated such a dichotomy exists, nor has any other court in any other jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The majority takes its cue from intervenor American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which cited in its brief a law review article by former Harvard Law School Professor Charles Fried. Fried writes: \u201cIn political campaigns the grossest misstatements, deceptions, and defamations are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>immune from legal sanction unless they violate private rights\u2014that is, unless individuals are defamed.\u201d Charles Fried, <em>The New First Amendment Jurisprudence: A Threat to Liberty, </em>59 U. Chi. L. Rev. 225, 238 (1992). Then-Professor Fried did not discuss the rationale for his assertion; nor is it the central or even the peripheral subject of his law review article. He did not discuss <em>New York Times, </em>or <em>Gertz, </em>or <em>Garrison </em>in the context of his statement. Nor did he suggest calculated lying has a legitimate role in American politics. Fried\u2019s bare assertion has the effect of a throwaway line. No other court has adopted his proposition; indeed, I can find none that has even discussed it. Although the article in which the statement appears has been cited many times in the scholarly literature for other reasons, the statement itself has gone largely unnoticed in the five years since it was published, except by the ACLU. On such flimsy authority, the majority suggests we ignore all the Supreme Court pronouncements to the contrary and hold the First Amendment protects calculated falsehoods.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Professor Fried is flat wrong. Numerous laws affecting First Amendment rights intended to protect the integrity of the electoral process itself, and not just private dignitary rights, have been upheld. The leading example is <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 96 S. Ct. 612, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659 (1976). There, the Court upheld federal statutory limitations on political contributions and requirements that candidates disclose the sources of their campaign funding against First Amendment challenges. <em>Buckley </em>had nothing to do with reputational interests, yet the Court upheld restrictions on First Amendment activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Other examples of constitutional restrictions on First Amendment rights that do not involve reputational interests abound. For example, in Washington, it is a gross misdemeanor on the day of a general or special election to \u201c[sjuggest or persuade or attempt to suggest or persuade any voter to vote for or against any candidate or ballot measure\u201d within 300 feet of the entrance to a polling place. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>RCW 29.51.020(l)(a), (5). This prohibition implicates several First Amendment rights: the right of association, the right to travel, and the right to engage in political speech. Political advocacy may perhaps be the quintessential value the First Amendment protects. Nevertheless, the United States Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of such electioneering laws. <em>Burson v. Freeman, </em>504 U.S. 191, 112 S. Ct. 1846, 119 L. Ed. 2d 5 (1992) (upholding Tennessee statute prohibiting the solicitation of votes and display of campaign materials within 100 feet of a polling place).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">In summary, there are numerous valid restrictions on the content of speech that do not involve personal, reputational interests. Fried was wrong, and the majority is wrong in basing its conclusion solely on Fried\u2019s unanalyzed statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Thus, the majority holds that in political campaigns involving ballot issues the deliberate he must receive First Amendment protection. Given the majority\u2019s analysis, the language cited above from <em>Garrison </em>would read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-6\">For the use of the known lie as a tool is <em>not </em>at odds with the premises of democratic government and with the orderly manner in which economic, social, or political change is to be effected. Calculated falsehood falls into that class of utterances which \u201care <em>an </em>essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such <em>great </em>social value as a step to truth that <em>their benefits support </em>the social interest in order and morality . . . .\u201d <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568, 572, [62 S. Ct. 766, 769, 86 L. Ed. 1031 (1942)]. Hence the knowingly false statement and the false statement made with reckless disregard of the truth . . . enjoy constitutional protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">I could not disagree more. I discern no benefit whatsoever to our treasured democracy from use of the calculated lie in electoral politics, and cannot conceive the First Amendment protects it.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">Most recently, in <em>McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm\u2019n, </em>514 U.S. 334, 115 S. Ct. 1511, 131 L. Ed. 2d 426 (1995), the United States Supreme Court struck down Ohio\u2019s statutory prohibition against distribution of anonymous cam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>paign literature in a ballot measure campaign as violative of the First Amendment. However, the Court did not categorically hold that <em>any </em>statute addressing deliberately false statements in a ballot measure campaign violated the First Amendment per se. The Court recognized that Ohio\u2019s statutory prohibition on anonymous leaflets was not the state\u2019s principal weapon against campaign fraud. The Court noted the Ohio Election Code included statutory provisions providing detailed and specific prohibitions against making or disseminating false statements during political campaigns. The Court impliedly approved such specific prohibitions, describing them \u201cas a deterrent to the making of false statements by unscrupulous prevaricators.\u201d* 12*******<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AdN\">The chilling effect of the statute on free speech is infinitesimal, if it exists at all. The scope of RCW 42.17.530(l)(a) is severely proscribed. It does not reach hyperbole or rhetoric, polemic or beguiling commentary, satire or mockery, zealotry or insanity, insincerity or low cunning, true beliefs or mere mistakes.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It does not concern itself with opinion or political position. The communists, the fascists, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>socialists, the New Democrats, the Old Democrats, the moderate Republicans, the radical right Republicans, the liberals, the Luddites, the conservatives, the Christian Coalition, the Reform Party, the Socialist Workers Party, the Wobblies, the Webeloes, the cranks, the crackpots, the naive, the foolish, the property rights advocates, the environmentalists, the Tsarists, the monarchists, the anarchists, the disgruntled, the Sandanistas, the survivalists, the Ku Klux Klan, the America Firsters\u2014all have nothing to fear from the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">The statute speaks to only one person: the calculating liar, who with clear mind and steadfast, deliberate purpose, coldly composes and diligently distributes knowing lies to effect a desired political result. The statute chills only this devious bar, not free speech. In short, \u201cThe actual malice test penalizes only the \u2018calculated falsehood.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tavoulareas v. Washington Post Co., </em>567 F. Supp. 651, 657 (D.D.C. 1983) (citing <em>Garrison, </em>379 U.S. at 73-75), <em>affd, in part, rev\u2019d in part sub nom. Tavoulareas v. Piro, </em>759 F.2d 90 (D.C. Cir. 1985). I agree with Justice Brennan writing in <em>Garrison </em>that the First Amendment does not protect the deliberate be.

Compelling State Interest</p>\n<p id=\"A5H\">Because I conclude calculated lies are not protected speech under the First Amendment, it is not necessary to address the second question, which is, does the state have a compelling interest in prohibiting calculated lies in political campaigns. Nevertheless, I address it because the majority implies the State does not have a compelling interest in preserving the sanctity of the electoral process.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">We require a compelling governmental interest for regulation of protected speech in a public forum, <em>Bering v. Share, </em>106 Wn.2d 212, 236, 721 P.2d 918 (1986), and political speech is scrupulously protected. <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 96 S. Ct. 612, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659 (1976); <em>Young Americans for Freedom, Inc. v. Gorton, </em>83 Wn.2d 728, 522 P.2d 189 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Do the people of Washington have a compelling interest in penalizing deliberate lies in political campaigns? The answer is obvious. The United States Supreme Court said in <em>Burson v. Freeman, </em>504 U.S. 191, 199, 112 S. Ct. 1846, 119 L. Ed. 2d 5 (1992):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-6\">Accordingly, this Court has concluded that a State has a compelling interest in protecting voters from confusion and undue influence. See <em>Eu [v.

Ed. 2d 271 (1989)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-7\">The Court also has recognized that a State \u201cindisputably has a compelling interest in preserving the integrity of its election process.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 231[, 109 S.

Ct. 1564, 1570, n.9, 75 L. Ed. 2d 547] (1983) (collecting cases). In other words, it has recognized that a State has a compelling interest in ensuring that an individual\u2019s right to vote is not undermined by fraud in the election process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">The State has a compelling interest in ensuring the integrity of the electoral process, for ballot measures as well as for election of candidates. That compelling interest includes punishing calculated deceit and knowing lies.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>A distressing feature of the majority\u2019s analysis is its fundamental lack of any connection with the real world of political campaigns. Its entire answer to any concerns about an electoral process flowing from deliberate lies is that more speech will cure such falsehoods. I wish this were true, and, in the best of all possible worlds, it could be. But, in modern American politics, it isn\u2019t reality. It is indeed all too common for candidates, political committees and individuals in political campaigns to make last-minute charges, usually distributed the weekend before election day or in a fashion calculated to forestall a reply through whatever means at their disposal. There is simply no time to use any of the traditional means of political communication\u2014leaflets, direct mail, newspaper, radio or television advertising\u2014to combat late hour, outrageously false statements. Further speech, in the classic formulation, will not cure such a situation. <em>Texas v. Johnson, </em>491 U.S. 397, 419, 109 S. Ct. 2533, 105 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1989) (more speech, not enforced silence, cures false speech). As the United States Supreme Court in <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323, 344 n.9, 94 S. Ct. 2997, 41 L. Ed. 2d 789 (1974), stated: \u201c[A]n opportunity for rebuttal seldom suffices to undo harmful defamatory falsehood. Indeed the law of defamation is rooted in our experience that the truth rarely catches up with a lie.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">Ironically, in the case of defamation in a campaign involving candidates, the remedies for such conduct may actually be greater than those available to address outright hes in a ballot measure campaign. A defamed candidate has a cause of action in court. That candidate may also suggest to the legislative body that the offending candidate should not be seated. <em>See </em>Wash. Const, art. II, \u00a7 8 (\u201cEach house shah be the judge of the election, returns and quahfications of its own members . . . .\u201d). That candidate could even challenge the offender in the next election. By contrast, the ballot measure enacted on the basis of a campaign of lies may be amended only by a two-thirds vote of the Legislature for the period of two years after its enactment. Wash. Const. art. II, \u00a7 41 (amend. 26). Few legislators would choose to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>risk proposing the repeal of a popularly enacted measure, let alone two-thirds of all legislators necessary for such repeal, to express antagonism to a campaign flawed by deliberate lies.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">American political campaigns in general and campaigns in the State of Washington have become all too often campaigns of vilification and mudslinging, rather than campaigns of communication. While this has been true throughout the course of American history,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the sophistication of recent political campaigns coupled with the ability of the media to reach so many so quickly have only enhanced the power of last-minute campaign smears. Moreover, money talks in elections. If the victim is without significant campaign resources, the \u201cBig Lie\u201d technique can, unfortunately, prevail over the truth. All too many of our fellow citizens, turned off by these kinds of political maneuvers, have turned away from the political system, expressing indifference to the extreme tactics taken by partisans of candidates or issues.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Because of the foregoing realities of modern electoral politics, the State Legislature was justified in declaring a compelling interest in ensuring that at least a modicum of propriety be observed in political campaigns, that modicum being honesty. In particular, the State has a compelling interest to ensure no deliberately false statements of fact are disseminated in the course of a campaign involving candidates or ballot measures. The majority would destroy any statutory effort to prohibit deliberate falsehoods in campaigns or, for that matter, disclosure of information to the public regarding adherence to campaign ethics standards. With this, the majority sends out the wrong message to a public troubled by rampant problems in the campaign process while it condones lies in ballot measure campaigns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>as constitutionally protected, leaving our society powerless to take the most minimal steps to stop them. Unlike the majority, I am unwilling to find, as a matter of First Amendment principles, that any and all lies, no matter how egregious, are constitutionally protected in ballot measure campaigns.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">The majority considers invocation of society\u2019s interest in campaign integrity \u201cpatronizing and paternalistic.\u201d This is a novel approach to constitutional analysis. We have no authority to strike down legislation because we consider it to be patronizing and paternalistic. No constitutional standard of review with which I am familiar encompasses those terms. I consider it remarkably patronizing to claim the people of Washington have no compelling interest in preventing political campaigns from being corrupted by deliberate liars.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Were we to adopt the sweeping scope of the First Amendment in political campaigns advocated by the majority here (the State has no compelling interest in ensuring the sanctity of the electoral process because such concern is patronizing and paternalistic), <em>any </em>statute regulating the campaign process would fail. It is difficult to discern how public disclosure of contributions or expenditures would stand a First Amendment challenge in light of the majority\u2019s notion that the State has no compelling interest in the integrity of the campaign process. Yet we have held it does. <em>Fritz v. Gorton, </em>83 Wn.2d 275, 301, 517 P.2d 911 (1974) (\u201cit is within the power of the people to prescribe informational standards or disclosure qualifications relative to public office\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Moreover, the specific provisions of RCW 42.17.530 not at issue in this case would similarly be subject to attack. RCW 42.17.530(l)(b) prohibits political advertising that falsely represents a candidate is the incumbent for an office sought when in fact the candidate is not the incumbent. Similarly, RCW 42.17.530(l)(c) prohibits advertising that directly or indirectly suggests a person has been endorsed or supported by an organization or person when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>candidate has no such support or endorsement.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> To use the majority\u2019s analysis, deliberately false statements concerning incumbency or concerning endorsements do not involve defamatory conduct with respect to <em>another candidate, </em>but rather impugn the integrity of the process. The State does, in fact, have a compelling interest in ensuring political campaigns are conducted within some bounds of propriety and within the bounds of the public\u2019s need for appropriate information about the issues and sponsors of such issues.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">In summary, the First Amendment does not protect calculated lies. Moreover, the people of Washington have a compelling interest in preventing such lies in electoral campaigns. I would uphold the facial constitutionality of RCW 42.17.530(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">D. Application of RCW 42.17.530</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Having found the statute constitutional, I next address whether it was violated. The trial court correctly determined the 119 Vote No! Committee did not violate RCW 42.17.530 because the Committee engaged in traditional political campaign hyperbole in the campaign against Initiative 119. The Committee distributed a leaflet with statements of opinion regarding the contents of the proposed law; those opinions did not constitute facts within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The statute does not purport to define \u201ca material fact\u201d in the context of a political campaign or determine whether the campaign involves a candidate or a ballot measure. An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>opinion is not subject to the statute\u2019s reach, as the deputy attorney general for the Public Disclosure Commission (PDC) conceded in oral argument. Prior decisions of Washington courts have indicated whether a statement or communication is a fact or opinion is a question of law for the court; the court should consider the entire communication, not particular portions of it, the degree to which the truth or falsity of a statement can be objectively determined without resort to speculation, and whether ordinary persons hearing or reading the statement or communication receive it as an expression of opinion rather than a statement of fact in analyzing the existence of a fact or opinion. <em>Benjamin v. Cowles Publ\u2019g Co., </em>37 Wn. App. 916, 922-23, 684 P.2d 739, <em>review denied, </em>102 Wn.2d 1018 (1984); <em>Camer v. Seattle Post-Intelligencer, </em>45 Wn. App. 29, 39-40, 723 P.2d 1195 (1986), <em>review denied, </em>107 Wn.2d 1020, <em>cert. denied, </em>482 U.S. 916, 107 S. Ct. 3189, 96 L. Ed. 2d 677 (1987); <em>Hoppe v. Hearst Corp., </em>53 Wn. App. 668, 671-73, 770 P.2d 203 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">In construing a similar statute, Oregon courts have consistently held that a statement that can in any way be inferred to be either factually correct or a mere opinion is not prohibited by Oregon\u2019s statute, even though it could also be interpreted as a false factual statement. <em>See, e.g., Committee of One Thousand to Re-Elect State Senator Walt Brown v. Eivers, </em>296 Or. 195, 674 P.2d 1159, 1164 (1983). The Oregon standard is a very difficult one to establish, but still provides that factually false statements may be actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">In light of the First Amendment issues present in the political campaign context\u2014whether a campaign by candidates or a campaign by ballot measure\u2014and the benefits of robust political discussion, I would adopt the standard for opinion and fact articulated in <em>Benjamin </em>and <em>Hoppe </em>with the additional refinement of the Oregon courts.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Turning to the facts in this case, the trial court held as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>matter of law the statements made by the Committee were not statements of material fact, but rather involved the effect or meaning of the proposed law and, therefore, were more in the nature of opinions rather than factual statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-4\">As commonly understood, facts do not include comments regarding the contents of laws of [sic] their interpretations. Statements about the effect or meaning of law are other-than-fact, are a matter of law and are determined by judicial opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Clerk\u2019s Papers at 274. I agree with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The leaflet here stated Initiative 119 would permit doctors to end patients\u2019 lives \u201cwithout safeguards,\u201d arguing the Initiative did not specify special qualifications for physicians under the Initiative, rules against coercion of patients, reporting requirements for when the authority under the Initiative was exercised, notification requirements for family members, or special protections for vulnerable individuals. These concerns relate particularly to the operation or effect of the law. As the PDC indicates in its brief, these statements are often far beyond the actual text of the Initiative. PDC Br. at 9-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">However, these statements are debatable assertions of opinion regarding the impact of the Initiative from the perspective of the Initiative\u2019s opponents, who believed the Initiative went too far in allowing physician-assisted suicide and did too little to protect individuals subject to its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">Political campaigns are communications exercises and often involve heated debate rife with hyperbole that pushes the truth to its edge. The Committee\u2019s statements in its leaflet were statements of opinion about the effect of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>proposed law. They were sufficiently debatable to fall within the wide latitude this Court has traditionally given to political speech.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">In 1938, the Wisconsin Supreme Court considered a state statute prohibiting the pubhshing of false representations pertaining to a candidate or referendum.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> 1 wholeheartedly agree with the following statement by that court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">Nothing is more important in a democracy than the accurate recording of the untrammeled will of the electorate. Gravest danger to the state is present where this will does not find proper expression due to the fact that electors are corrupted or are misled. . . . It is . . . possible and feasible to require of candidates that statements of fact known to be false and so substantially bearing upon the fitness of other candidates as to have a tendency to influence votes shall not be made the basis of appeals for votes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-6\"><em>State ex rel.

It is not clear at all from the majority\u2019s analysis that the statute should be unconstitutional under the first circumstance. Indeed, insofar as the statute tracks the <em>New York Times </em>test, it plainly cannot be unconstitutional.
