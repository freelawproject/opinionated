The record shows that this suit was brought in 1934 but the defendant\u2019s affidavit merely states that he was adjudicated a bankrupt on January 9, 1931, and surrendered all of his property; and it does not appear from it that he was ever discharged in that proceeding. It, therefore, does not state a defense to the plaintiff\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">With certain exceptions, that need not be considered by us, <em>Section </em>17 of the <em>Federal Bankruptcy Act </em>of 1898, provides: \u201cA discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all of his provable debts\u201d (11 <em>TJSCA, </em>\u00a7 35).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\"><em>Section </em>14 of the same act, as amended in 1926 (11 <em>TJSCA, </em>\u00a7 32), also provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-10\">\u201cAny person may, after the expiration of one month and within the next twelve months subsequent to being adjudged a bankrupt, file an application for a discharge in the court of bankruptcy in which the proceedings are pending; if it shall be made to appear to the judge that the bankrupt was unavoidably prevented from filing it within such time, it may be filed within but not after the expiration of the next six months.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">From these provisions, it is apparent that it is the discharge and not the filing of the bankruptcy petition, or even the adjudication, that protects the bankrupt from subsequent actions by his creditors. <em>Shamis v. Rice-Stix Dry Goods Co., </em>155 <em>Ark. </em>353, 244 <em>S. W. </em>340; 7 <em>Rem. on Bankr., </em>\u00a7 3193.30; see, also, 7 <em>Rem. on Bankr., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3437, 3438, 3443.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">It is, also, apparent that pursuant to the provisions of <em>Section </em>14 of the <em>Act, </em>no discharge can be granted unless the application therefor is made within, at most, eighteen months following the adjudication. 7 <em>Rem. on Bankr., </em>\u00a7 3168.</p>\n<p id=\"A4O\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Whether because of delay in' filing the petition, or otherwise, if, therefore, no discharge is procured by the bankrupt he may be sued on all claims to the same extent as though bankruptcy had not intervened. 7 <em>Rem. on Bankr., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3193.30; 3486; <em>Shamis v. Rice-Stix Dry Goods Co., </em>155 <em>Ark. </em>352, 244 <em>S. W. </em>340; <em>Tutt v. Fighting Wolf Min. Co. (Mo. App.), </em>209 <em>S. W. </em>304; <em>In re Camelo (D. C.), </em>195 <em>F. </em>632.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">If the defendant in this action was discharged by the Bankruptcy Court that fact does not appear in his affidavit, but even though he has been, such an order does not extinguish the debt. It merely bars the remedy thereon. <em>Tubbs v. McCabe, </em>5 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>(35 <em>Del.) </em>327, 165 <em>A. </em>336.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">To be effective as a defense in an action against him by a creditor whose debt was created prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition, the discharge must, therefore, be both pleaded and proved by the bankrupt. <em>Tubbs v. McCabe, </em>5 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>(35 <em>Del.) </em>327, 165 <em>A. </em>336; <em>Rice v. Chapman, </em>234 <em>App. Div. </em>279, 255 <em>N. Y. S. </em>35; 7 <em>Rem. on Bankr., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3459, 3487, 3490.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The same general principles are, also, applicable to a case of this character where, pursuant to statute <em>(Revised Code </em>1915, \u00a7 4169) judgment in certain specified cases will be entered for the plaintiff on affidavit of demand filed unless the defendant, by counter affidavit, sets up a good and sufficient defense to the plaintiff\u2019s claim. As we have already indicated, the defendant\u2019s affidavit does not comply with that rule. And this is particularly true in view of the lapse of time since the defendant was adjudicated a bankrupt. <em>Chase v. F. &amp; M. Nat. Bank of Baltimore (C. C. </em>A.), 202 <em>F. </em>904.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Judgment will, therefore, be entered for the plaintiff on his affidavit of demand notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s affidavit of defense.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
