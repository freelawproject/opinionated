They may be briefly grouped as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>1. \u201cThat <em>Section </em>3 of the <em>Act of the General Assembly, </em>being <em>Chapiter </em>142, <em>Volume </em>38, <em>Laws of Delaware, page _ </em>548, by which the sum of five thousand dollars ($5,000.) was appropriated for providing transportation of pupils attending schools supported by any church or religious society and which the said relators claim the State Board of Education refused to expend for such transportation of pupils attending such schools as set forth in paragraphs 3, 4, and 5 of said petition, is unconstitutional and in violation of <em>Section </em>3 of <em>Article </em>10 of the <em>Constitution of the State of Delaware.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">2. \u201cThat said <em>Section </em>3 of said <em>Chapter </em>142 of <em>Volume </em>38, <em>Laws of Delaware, </em>is unconstitutional and in violation of the Constitution of the State of Delaware, by being repugnant to the provisions of <em>Section </em>16 of <em>Article </em>2 of.said <em>Constitution, </em>in that the subject included in said third section is not expressed in the title of said <em>Chapiter </em>142, which said Act, by the title thereof, is limited to the transportation of pupils to and from the public schools of the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-7\"><em>Section </em>3 of <em>Article </em>10 of the <em>Constitution of Delmvare </em>is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-8\">\u201cNo portion of any fund now existing, or which may hereafter be appropriated, or raised by tax, for educational purposes, shall be appropriated to, or used by, or in aid of any sectarian, church or denominational school.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">Rewriting this provision, without changing its meaning, it will, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-10\">\u201cNo portion of any fund now existing, for educational purposes, nor any fund which may hereafter be appropriated for educational purposes, nor any fund raised by tax for educational purposes, shall be appropriated to, or used by, or in aid of any sectarian, church or denominational school.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">The relators, in their petition, contend that the monies appropriated in <em>Section </em>3 of the <em>Act </em>under consideration, come from the General Fund and not from the so-called School Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">They further contend that the prohibition found in <em>Section </em>3 of <em>Article </em>10 of the <em>Constitution </em>applies only to appropriations from the School Fund and does not apply to appropriations from the General Fund. That the appropriation made by <em>Section </em>3 of the <em>Act </em>under consideration being from the General Fund is, therefore, not in violation of the constitutional prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-13\">A careful reading, however, of <em>Section </em>3 <em>of Article </em>10 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>of the <em>Constitution </em>reveals a much broader and more comprehensive prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">When this constitutional provision is rewritten as above set forth and the several prohibitions therein are drafted into distinct clauses or sentences, one of them reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">\u201cNo portion of any fund which may be hereafter appropriated for educational purposes, shall be appropriated to, or used by, or in aid of, any sectarian, church, or denominational school.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">The word \u201cfund\u201d has the same general meaning as \u201cmoney.\u201d It is money, or its equivalent, gathered for or to be appropriated to a specific object. <em>McCammon v. Cooper, et al., </em>69 <em>Ohio St. </em>366, 69 <em>N. E. </em>658. The school fund is a fund made up in a certain manner. The appropriation of money for the transportation of pupils is, when accomplished, a fund for a certain object. The real difference between the two funds is the way by which the money is gathered together. As to the school fund, it is money collected from the proceeds of certain investments and taxes. As to the fund for the transportation of pupils, it is money obtained by appropriations from the General Fund in the Treasury of the State and when so obtained, it constitutes a fund for educational purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">It would be entirely too narrow a construction to hold that this provision of the Constitution applies only to the School Fund. The provision itself does not so declare. It provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-10\">\u201cNo portion of any fund now existing, * * * for educational purposes, shall be appropriated,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-12\">\u2014and again:</p>\n<p id=\"b201-13\">No fund which may be hereafter appropriated for educational purposes shall be used, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-14\">The section not only prohibits the General Assembly from making appropriations in aid of Sectarian \u25a0 Schools, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>but it also prohibits the use of such appropriations (if made) in aid of such schools.</p>\n<p id=\"AHR\">The words \u201csectarian, church or denominational school\u201d as used in the Constitution mean schools which are under the control, domination or governing influence of any religious sect or denomination. The ordinary understanding of the phrase \u201csect or denomination\u201d is a church or body of persons in some way united for purposes of worship, who profess a common religious faith and are distinguished from those composing other such bodies by a name of their own. <em>Collins v. Kephart, </em>271 <em>Pa. </em>433, 117 <em>A. </em>440.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\"><em>Section </em>3 of the <em>Act </em>under consideration purports to appropriate funds for the transportation of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">_ \u201cPupils attending daily free schools supported by any Church or Religious Society and located outside of the City, of Wilmington.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">It can hardly be maintained that the schools mentioned in <em>Section </em>3 of this <em>Act </em>are other than sectarian or denominational schools within the meaning of <em>Section </em>3 of <em>Article </em>10 of the <em>Constitution. </em>In fact, the relators in their petition quite frankly admit that St. Peter\u2019s School and St. John\u2019s School are supported respectively by the members of St. Peter\u2019s Roman Catholic Church and the members of St. John\u2019s Roman Catholic Church.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">But the relators contend that the appropriation provided for in <em>Section </em>3 of the <em>Act </em>under consideration is not appropriated \u201cto, or used by, or in aid of any sectarian, church or denominational school.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">It is true that the appropriation is not made to any sectarian school, but it is not so clear that it is not made to be used by or in aid of such school. In discussing the word \u201caid\u201d in a constitutional provision somewhat similar to <em>Section </em>3 of <em>Article </em>10 of our <em>Constitution, </em>the Supreme Court of South Dakota said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-12\">\u201cWhat, then, constitutes benefit or aid? Webster defines * * <em>* </em>\u2018aid\u2019 \u201d as \u201c \u2018to support, either by furnishing strength or means to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>help to success.\u2019 \u201d <em>Synod of Dakota v. State of S. D., </em>2 S. <em>D. </em>366, 50 <em>N. W. </em>632, 635, 14 <em>L. B. A. </em>418.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">In discussing a somewhat similar question, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">\u201cThe school is not the building and its equipment; it is the organization, the union of all the elements in the organization, to furnish_ education in some branch of learning. * * * It is the institution, and the teachers and scholars together, that make it up. The pupils are a part of the school. * * * It seems to us to be giving a strained and unusual meaning to words if we hold that the books and the ordinary school supplies, when furnished for the use of pupils, is a furnishing to the pupils, and not a furnishing in aid or maintenance of a school of learning. It seems very plain that such furnishing is at least indirectly in aid of the institution, and that, if not in actual violation of the words, it is in violation of the true intent and meaning, of the Constitution, and in consequence equally unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Smith v. Donahue, </em>202 <em>App. Div. </em>656, 195 <em>N. Y. S. </em>715, 721.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">We are of the opinion that to furnish free transportation to pupils attending sectarian schools, is to aid the schools. It helps build up, strengthen and make successful the schools as organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">The relators cite in opposition to the above cases, the case of <em>Borden v. Louisiana State Board of Education, </em>168 <em>La. </em>1005, 123 <em>So. </em>655, 67 <em>A. L. R. </em>1183. We are not impressed by the reasoning of this case. There was a strong dissenting opinion. Four of the Justices concurred in the majority opinion and three in the dissenting opinion. The case apparently stands alone and we prefer to follow the South Dakota and New York cases. The case of <em>State v. Milquet, </em>180 <em>Wis. </em>109, 192 <em>N. W. </em>392, is also in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">After a careful reading and study of all the cases cited by counsel for the relators and for the State Board of Education, we are constrained to hold that <em>Section </em>3 of <em>Chapter </em>142 of <em>Volume </em>38, <em>Laws of Delaware, </em>is in violation of <em>Section </em>3, <em>Article </em>10, of the <em>Constitution </em>of this State and, therefore, void.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-13\">Having reached this conclusion, it is unnecessary for us to consider the question as to the title of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>The motion to dismiss the petition should be granted and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
