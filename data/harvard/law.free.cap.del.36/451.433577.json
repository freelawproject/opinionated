The more difficult question has always been as to just what constitutes \u201crequisite knowledge or skill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">Along with the general principle of liability for injury due to want of requisite knowledge or skill, there \u2022 exists the cognate principle that where the possession of requisite knowledge and skill has been shown, together with the use of such qualities with reasonable care and diligence, that then the practitioner is not responsible for the results that follow the treatment administered by him. The law does not make a doctor an insurer of the best result of the treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The great weight of authority is to the effect that in malpractice cases the skill and care of the dentist or physician will be presumed in the absence of any evidence to the contrary. In 21 <em>R. C. L. </em>406, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">\u201cThe law accords the medical practitioner the presumption that he has done his duty, and in a suit for injury caused by alleged malpractice the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the want of reasonable or ordinary care or skill. * * * The burden of proof is not shifted by showing an unsuccessful result has attended the treatment of the patient by the physician. Nor does the unsuccessful result of the case shift from the plaintiff to the defendant the burden of going forward.\u201d <em>Moore v. Smith, </em>215 <em>Ala,. </em>592, 111 <em>So. </em>918.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">The application of the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>to cases of malpractice by dentists has been considered in a number of cases. Most of these cases are cited in the <em>note </em>in 69 A. <em>L. R. </em>1142 and in the annotations thereto. See, also, <em>notes, </em>27 <em>N. C. C. </em>A. 756, 35 <em>N. C. C. </em>A. 144. In a few jurisdictions it has been held, that where in a suit against a dentist for malpractice it was shown that the defendant was negligent in the use of an instrumentality such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>as an electric drill, that the rule of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>is not excluded. A typical case is <em>Vergeldt v. Hartzell (C. C. </em>A.), 1 <em>F. (2d) </em>633, which is much relied on by the plaintiff, where recovery was sought on the following allegation of negligence:\u2014\u201c(5) Negligence while and in the manner of handling and operating the instrument.\u201d There the Court drew the clear distinction between the possession of skill or knowledge on the one hand and the negligent performance of an operation on the other. There the Court considered <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>as a rule of evidence. The Court held, that where it appeared that a machine or instrumentality was, as to user and inspection in the control of the party charged and was of such a nature that no injurious consequence would ordinarily flow except from careless construction, inspection or user and that the injurious occurrence must have happened irrespective of any voluntary action of the injured party, that then in such case the rule of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>would apply. It is not entirely clear to me, that, properly speaking, the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>was there involved at all, for, ordinarily, <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>does not apply where there is evidence of specific negligence. The cited case, however, is clearly distinguishable from the present one. In the cited case the defendant was polishing an inlay with a sandpaper disc attached to an electric drill, operated at high speed. The attention of the operator being momentarily diverted, the drill and disc slipped from the inlay, penetrating the floor of the-plaintiff\u2019s mouth and burying the disc deeply near the roots of the tongue. The negligence was not in treating that which he was employed to treat but consisted of a negligent extraneous injury. The Court cited with approval <em>Evans v. Roberts, </em>172 <em>Iowa </em>653, 154 <em>N. W. </em>923, 925, where a surgeon, operating for the removal of adenoids, allowed an appliance to slip, whereby a severe injury was inflicted upon another and undiseased portion of the body. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>\u201cHis negligence, if any, was in failing to take due care to avoid injury to the undiseased parts * * * which he was not called upon to treat and did not pretend to treat.\u201d See, also, <em>Bence v. Denbo, </em>98 <em>Ind. App. </em>52, 183 <em>N. E. </em>326.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">On the other hand, there are a number of cases which hold that the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>does not ordinarily apply in malpractice cases. <em>Donoho v. Rawleigh, </em>230 <em>Ky. </em>11, 18 <em>S. W. (2d) </em>311, 69 <em>A. L. R. </em>1135; <em>Stacy v. Williams, </em>253 <em>Ky. </em>353, 69 <em>S. W. (2d) </em>697; <em>Smith v. McClung, </em>201 <em>N. C. </em>648,161 <em>S. E. </em>91; <em>United Dentists v. Bryan, </em>158 <em>Va. </em>880, 164 <em>S. E. </em>554; <em>Mournet v. Sumner, </em>19 <em>La. App. </em>346, 139 <em>So. </em>728; <em>McTyeire v. McGaughy, 222 Ala. </em>100, 130 <em>So. </em>784; <em>Johnson v. Arndt, </em>186 <em>Minn. </em>253, 243 <em>N. W. </em>67; <em>Chubb v. Holmes, </em>111 <em>Conn. </em>482, 150 A. 516; <em>Ewing v. Goode (C. C.), </em>78 <em>F. </em>442; <em>McCoy v. Clegg, </em>36 <em>Wyo. </em>473, 257 <em>P. </em>484, 27 <em>N. C. C. A. </em>756 and <em>note; Inglis v. Morton, </em>99 <em>Wash. </em>570, 169 <em>P. </em>962.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">The present case, under count 4, is possibly distinguishable from but certainly stronger than any cited case. Here there is no allegation of negligence at all. Reliance is had solely upon the rule of <em>res ipsa loquitur, </em>operating upon the mere facts of administration of an anaesthetic and subsequent death as establishing <em>prima facie </em>negligence sufficient to place upon the defendant some burden of justification. It is true that the plaintiff in the Declaration had stated the fact that the deceased had theretofore been in good health, and also the conclusion that the death could not have occurred except for the defendant\u2019s negligence. Whether this negligence be that of failure to possess requisite knowledge and skill or in failing to exercise due care and dilligence, of course, does not appear, and evidence of one might be inadmissible in support of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">The mere fact that a patient dies under the influence of an anaesthetic does not show negligence. <em>Loudon v. Scott, </em>58 <em>Mont. </em>645, 194 <em>P. </em>488, 12 <em>A. L. R. </em>1487 and <em>note; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number><em>Levy v. Vaughan, </em>42 <em>App. D. C. </em>146; <em>Spain v. Burch, </em>169 <em>Mo. App. </em>94, 154 <em>S. W. </em>172; <em>Johnson v. Arndt, </em>186 <em>Minn. </em>253, 243 <em>N. W. </em>67; <em>Dolan v. O\u2019Rourke, </em>56 <em>N. D. </em>416, 217 <em>N. W. </em>666.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">In an action of this kind there must either be alleged and proved a lack of requisite knowledge or skill or there must be alleged and proved a failure to exercise a proper degree of care and diligence on the part of the defendant or, some negligence of the defendant being alleged, there should appear some state of facts connected with an instrumentality in the control of the defendant or with the treatment accorded to the plaintiff which brings about a result so inconsonant with the normal and usual result that it must pre-suppose negligence in the application of the relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Assuming the truth of the allegations of count 4, no cause of action is therein set out.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">The demurrer is sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
