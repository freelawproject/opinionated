The cases were consolidated for trial because the appellants alleged paternity through a common grandfather and claimed they were raised together. After hearing the evidence, Judge Dimock, relying on what he considered the unsatisfactory character of appellants\u2019 testimony in regard to their childhood surroundings, and evasions and contradictions in their testimony with respect to their life in the United States, held that their allegations of paternity were not proved. Since the opportunity of the trial judge to hear and observe the witnesses is most significant in such a case, we have held that his finding will be reversed \u201conly in the most unusual circumstances.\u201d Lee Dong Sep v. Dulles, 2 Cir., 1955, 220 F.2d 264, 265. The record affords no basis for reversing Judge Di-mock\u2019s findings and his conclusion that the plaintiffs had failed to sustain their burden of proof.
