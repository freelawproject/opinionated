On November 20, 1959, while incarcerated at the United States Penitentiary, McNeil Island, Washington, the appellant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus attacking the above conviction and seeking immediate release in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, Southern Division. The court ordered the petition dismissed and petitioner has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">Appellant\u2019s petition contains nothing which shows or tends to show that the remedy provided under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 is \u201c * * * inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention,\u201d as required by that section before a petition for writ of habeas corpus will be entertained. Appellant attempts to avoid the requirement that he assert his claim in the sentencing court by the bare allegation in his petition that he has twice sought such relief without success; but this does not by itself establish that the prescribed remedy is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d within the meaning of the statute. Nor are any facts alleged in the petition which would support this contention. In absence of such a showing, the lower court was correct in dismissing the petition. Robinson v. Swope, 9 Cir., 1952, 197 F.2d 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
