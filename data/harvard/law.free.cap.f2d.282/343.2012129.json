He was acquitted on count two and found guilty on count one, and sentenced to seven and a half years imprisonment. The jurisdiction of the district court was based on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. This Court has jurisdiction of the appeal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. But one issue is raised on this appeal; that of entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-19\">The sale named in the first count, of which appellant was convicted, took place on October 22, 1957. It was made to a government informer, one Pendergraph. Pendergraph testified he asked appellant for some heroin, they discussed the quantity to be sold, and appellant took the money supplied to the informer by government agents. Appellant had his co-defendant deliver the heroin to the informer. Appellant denied this conversation and any knowledge of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-20\">No issue of entrapment was involved; none was raised below; none appears in the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-21\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
