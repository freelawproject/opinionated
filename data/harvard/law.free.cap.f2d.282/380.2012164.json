When action stayed time does not run.] \u00a7 23. <em>When the commencement of an action is stayed </em>by injunction, <em>order of a </em>judge or <em>court, </em>or statutory prohibition, the time of the continuance of the injunction or prohibition is not part of the time limited for the commencement of the actions.\u201d (Italics supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">On June 15, 1959, an order was entered by the executive committee of the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-8\">\u201cIt appearing to the Executive Committee that, by the statutes of this State, the 4th day of July, commonly called Independence Day, is declared to be a legal holiday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-9\">\u201cAnd it further appearing to the said Committee that Independence Day will fall on Saturday this year and that many employers in this area plan to close in observance of this holiday on the day before Independence Day, and that this method of observance will be practiced by many commercial, mercantile and insurance companies as well as governmental agencies in the community;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-10\">\u201cIt Is, Therefore, Ordered that the Circuit Court of Cook County and the office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County shall be closed on Friday, July 3, 1959, and on Saturday, July 4 (Independence Day) 1959.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-11\">\u201cIt Is Further Ordered that the time within which to file all motions, pleas, answers, or any other pleadings, the time for the filing of which will expire Friday, July 3, 1959, and Saturday, July 4, 1959, be, and it is hereby, extended to Monday, July 6, 1959, without further notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-15\">\u201cIt Is Further Ordered that all rules and orders made returnable and expiring on Friday, July 3, 1959, and Saturday, July 4, 1959, be, and they are hereby continued to Monday, July 6, 1959, without further order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-16\">Sec. 6, ch. 25, R.S.Il.1959, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-17\">\u201c\u00a7 6. The clerks of the Circuit Courts, * * * of Cook County, * * * shall keep their offices open and attend to the duties thereof during such hours on each day, and on such days as may be ordered by the rule of the court in such county, which rule may be changed from time to time as the judges or judges of said court may see fit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-19\">Sec. 2(2), ch. 110, R.S.Ill.1959, provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-20\">\u201cSubject to rules the * * * circuit * * * Courts may make rules regulating their dockets, calendars, and business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-21\">Secs. 32 and 33, ch. 110, R.S.I11.1959 provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-22\">\u201c\u00a7 32. * * * The first plead- . ing by the plaintiff shall be designated a complaint. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-23\">\u201c\u00a7 33. Form of pleadings. (1) All pleadings shall contain a plain and concise statement of the pleader\u2019s cause of action, counterclaim, defense, or reply. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-24\">These statutory provisions recognize that a complaint initiating an action in court is included in the generic term \u201cpleading\u201d. It is apparent that the order of the executive committee closing the office of the clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County on July 3, and July 4, 1959, and extending the time for filing motions, pleas, answers, or any other plead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>ings, the time for the filing of which expired od July 3 or July 4, 1959, to July 6, 1959, without further notice, included a complaint commencing a new suit, such as that filed by plaintiff in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">The time for the filing of plaintiff\u2019s complaint on July 3, 1959 was stayed by the court\u2019s order to include July 6, 1959 by virtue of sec. 24, ch. 83, R.S.Ill.1959. During that extended period the statute of limitations did not expire.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that plaintiff was within his rights in filing his complaint on July 6, 1959 and that his action was not barred by the two-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">For these reasons the order from which an appeal has been taken is hereby reversed and this cause is remanded to the district court for further proceedings not inconsistent with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Reversed and remanded with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-12\">. Both parties herein have treated this order as final and appealable and, for the purpose of this case, we are not averse to also so doing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
