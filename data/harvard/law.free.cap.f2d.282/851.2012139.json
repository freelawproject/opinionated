Three officers were selected. By direction of the Secretary, the selection board also considered the cases of all such officers \u201cwith less than twenty years of service\u201d whose records indicated their unsatisfactory performance of duty in their present grade and that they would not satisfactorily perform the duties of a higher grade. The board found this appellant includable among the latter group. The report of the selection board was concurred in by the Chief of Naval Operations, and thereafter was approved by the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of Defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">Finally, after the report had been approved by the President on October 17, 1957, appellant was given notice of the action taken and was informed that he would be separated from the service as of June 30, 1958. After the Secretary of the Navy had refused appellant\u2019s request that his discharge be suspended, appellant filed suit in the District Court where a temporary restraining order was issued. A motion for a preliminary injunction was denied, and appellant was finally discharged on July 18, 1958. Cross motions for summary judgment having been filed, the Secretary\u2019s motion was granted. Appellant\u2019s motion was denied and his case was dismissed, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">Appellant\u2019s complaint had asked the District Court to adjudge and declare null and void that portion of the report of the selection board which reflected the board\u2019s opinion that appellant\u2019s record indicated his unsatisfactory performance of duty in his grade of Commander. Alternatively, appellant asked the District Court to adjudge and declare 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 6384 to be a nullity, (a), for its failure to prescribe with reasonable clarity the limits of the power entrusted to the selection board, or (b), for prescribing \u201cunreasonable and too broad limits of authority which Congress is without power to prescribe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">The record shows that appellant on October 14, 1937 was appointed Lieutenant (j. g.) in the Civil Engineer Corps of the United States Naval Reserve and that he accepted appointment December 29, 1937. He was not called to active duty until January 22, 1941. He served in various grades until, on September 7, 1946, he was appointed an officer in the Regular Navy, Civil Engineer Corps, achieving the permanent rank of Commander in June, 1949. Pursuant to the Act approved April 18, 1946, 60 Stat. 92, 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 15 (1952), many officers like appellant who had served in World War II as Reserves transferred to the Regular Navy. It is clear from the Act that Congress contemplated no discrimination against officers because of the source from which they entered the Regular Navy and that no preference was to be accorded officers because they entered the Regular Navy from a particular source. Problems arose, nevertheless, and Congress next passed the Officer Personnel Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 795, 851, 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 306d(c) (2) (1952), (now 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 6384(a) (1958)), where provision was made for certain action by a selection board as to officers \u201cof less than twenty years\u2019 service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">Despite appellant\u2019s claims, we perceive no proper basis upon which to conclude that the sections here applied were a \u201cnullity.\u201d Not only does Congress possess specific constitutional authority to legislate with respect to the Navy, U.S.Const, art. I, \u00a7 8, but the President from the same source derives his authority as Commander-in-chief. He appointed the Secretary of the Navy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>by whose \u201cprecept\u201d the selection board was convened. To the latter, expressly detailed duties were assigned by the Secretary. The carefully outlined agenda, set forth in the record, discloses a comprehensive plan whereby a recorder was named and sworn, each member of the board was sworn to the performance of the specific duties devolving upon the board, at least two-thirds of the membership were bound to, and did, concur in the ultimate individual opinions and conclusions, and the final findings were read aloud in the presence of all members who then signed the report as did the recorder. We can not agree that the administrative plan authorized by statute with the report of the board proceeding through channels, and ultimately approved by the President, was a \u201cnullity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Apparently the records of some 125 Civil Engineer Corps officers of the Navy were under consideration by the board. Three officers were found eligible for promotion and three others were in the board\u2019s sworn, collective judgment not qualified for continued service. Short of court martial proceedings based upon gross dereliction or retirement for physical or mental disability, the mechanism may well seem to reflect the experience of long years involving thousands of officers, whose qualifications for continued service may thus become subject to periodic review. Congress has long been aware of the problem, with severance pay, retirement status and other personnel factors the subject of extensive legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">To decide, as we do, that the statutes and the proceedings under them are not a \u201cnullity\u201d is not to end our task. If appellant had achieved \u201ctotal commissioned service\u201d of twenty years, he would not have been subject to separation from service. He insists he possessed a record of twenty years\u2019 service for the purposes of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6384(a) (providing for action by the selection board looking to separation from the service), and 6388 (a) and (b) (1) and (b) (2) (providing for computation of total commissioned service). He argues that the codifiers in drafting 10 U.S.C. and particularly \u00a7 6388(a) and (b)(1) and (b)(2), erroneously and substantively altered the source provisions to be found in the Officer Personnel Act of 1947, particularly section 202(d) (1). The latter not only specified how \u201ctotal commissioned service\u201d must be computed for Regular Navy Officers but related his service to one of the latter next junior to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">Appellant thus claims that his \u201ctotal commissioned service\u201d should be deemed to date back to June 30, 1937 of the fiscal year from which his Naval Academy \u201crunning mate\u201d must date his service under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 6388(a). On appellant\u2019s theory, his twenty years\u2019 service would have been concluded by June 30, 1957, and the selection board therefore lacked power to recommend his separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">We do not agree. The record clearly shows that appellant\u2019s running mate had been appointed Ensign in the Regular Navy on June 3, 1937, but he did not accept appointment as Lieutenant (j. g.) in the Navy\u2019s Civil Engineer Corps until August 23, 1940. The onset date of his staff corps service, under the Act, became June 30, 1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">Appellant seems totally to have overlooked the effect which must be given to section 202(a) of the 1947 Act. There the word \u201cofficers\u201d was defined for the purposes of Title II to mean \u201ccommissioned officers * * * in the <em>Staff Corps </em>of the Regular Navy,\u201d (emphasis supplied) which included the Civil Engineer Corps. Thus section 202(d) (1) in referring to \u201ctotal commissioned service\u201d of such a Regular Navy Officer provided that computation must date \u201cfrom June 30 of the fiscal year in which he accepted <em>such appointment,\" i. e., </em>as a commissioned officer in the <em>Staff Corps. </em>Sections 202(a) and 202(d)(1) must be read together. The codifiers in drafting 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 6388 simply elided the terminology as to \u201cstaff corps\u201d service to avoid the circumlocution and interpolation essential to a proper reading of the 1947 Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>The affidavits and administrative records before us demonstrate a consistent application by the Navy of interpretations with which we agree. The Officer Personnel Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 815 denominates Title II as containing \u201cPermanent Provisions Relating to Officers of the Staff Corps of the Navy.\u201d The Judge Advocate General of the Navy had clearly distinguished section 102(d) of the 1947 Act as applicable to line officers from section 202(d)(1) as applicable to staff corps officers. That his persuasive opinion, Court-Martial Order 2-1949, p. 40, since followed, had commended itself to Congress, we do not doubt. The Comptroller General agrees. See 37 Comp.Gen. 747 (1958).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When Title 10 of the United States Code was enacted into positive law as of August 10, 1956, Senate Report No. 2484, 84th Cong., 2d Sess. 19 (1956), to accompany H.R. 7049, explained in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-4\">\u201cThe object of the new titles has been to <em>restate existing law, not to make new law. </em>* * * Where court decisions, opinions of officials such as the Attorney General or the Comptroller General, executive orders, regulations, or well-established administrative practice have established authoritative interpretations clarifying ambiguities in the law, the text has been reworded to express those interpretations.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">We are satisfied that the original statute, the departmental interpretations, the codification and the Comptroller General\u2019s decision, supra, demonstrate that appellant\u2019s total commissioned service was correctly computed. Calculated as it was, appellant had not achieved the twenty years\u2019 service which would have insulated him from separation from service.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">It is not our function to reassess the appellant\u2019s performance record which the selection board deemed \u25a0 unsatisfactory. Various references therein may</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">well have appeared to an expert body to suggest an adequate basis for the conclusion which was reached. This may seem especially the case where this appellant\u2019s record was to be contrasted with many others. The criteria were for the board in its sworn judgment to apply for the good of the service. Suffice it to say that we are in no position to assess and appraise that record by itself even were we free to do so. Cf. Orloff v. Willoughby, 1953, 345 U.S. 83, 93, 73 S.Ct. 534, 97 L.Ed. 842; Creary v. Weeks, 259 U.S. 336, 343, 42 S.Ct. 509, 66 L.Ed. 973, affirming Weeks v. United States, 1922, 51 App.D.C. 195, 277 F. 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">We have carefully considered every aspect of the claims advanced before us. We can not say that appellant\u2019s separation from service was improperly accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b902-7\">. Appellant on brief concedes that if these two administrative opinions can be' sus-. tained, his allegation that he had over 20 years\u2019 service, computed under 10 \u00dc.S.C. \u00a7 6388, \u201cmust fail.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
