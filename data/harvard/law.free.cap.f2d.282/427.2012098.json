Frigidaire Sales Corp. v. Maguire Homes, Inc., D.C., 186 F.Supp. 767. It will be enough for us to say that since the plaintiff below knew from purchase orders that it was supplying materials to a prime contractor for incorporation in a so-called Capehart Project, it can well be assumed that it also knew that the contractor had provided the payment bond required by 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1594(a), and that it supplied the materials in reliance upon that bond. This as we see it is enough to satisfy the requirement, insofar as it may be a requirement, of Massachusetts law that one who supplies materials to a bonded contractor but is not specifically named as an obligee in the contractor\u2019s bond must show knowledge of and reliance upon the bond in order to maintain suit thereon against the surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">Judgment will be entered affirming the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
