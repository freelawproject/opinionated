It engaged in the concrete business and in the distribution of building material. Its principal place of business was at Orlando, Florida. Franklin Williamson was its president and general manager. Thomas C. Ross was its construction engineer. In the spring of 1954 Williamson negotiated for Holloway the purchase of the 27-foot inboard cruiser, the Overtime. The boat was powered by a gasoline motor. When not in use it was berthed at the Sanford Boat Works in Sanford, Florida. The boat was used, for a time after it was purchased, for the pleasure of Williamson and for the entertainment of customers. For about a year prior to July 4, 1957, the use of the boat by Williamson was negligible. Ross was free to use the boat and did frequently use it for himself and his family, and from time to time they would take customers or prospective customers of Holloway out on the boat. Ross, with the acquiescence of Williamson, assumed the responsibility for the maintenance of the boat.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-16\">On July 3, 1957, Ross was using the boat and had trouble with the bilge pump. The following day he went to the boat yard to remove the pump in order to have it repaired. At the invitation of Ross, his personal and business friend, Francis Emerson, went with him. Emerson was an architect practicing in the area in which Holloway was engaged in the concrete and building materials business. When Ross and Emerson went on the boat, it was found that water was standing in the bilge and Ross decided to pump the water out before removing the pump. The pump was electrically operated. In order to avoid draining the power of the batteries while operating the pump, Ross chose to run the engine so that the generator might keep the batteries charged. The electric hookup was such that one or the other of the two batteries might be operated but in normal operation both batteries were not in use at any one time. Ross attempted unsuccessfully to start the motor with one of the batteries. He then threw a switch which cut that battery out and cut the other in. It also was too weak to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>start the motor. He then concluded that both batteries should be hooked together to get the engine running. This was not an unusual practice and a jumper wire was kept on board for that purpose. R^ss knew, as did Williamson, that sparks would or might fly off as this operation took place. Starting the motor by the use of the jumper wire required two people, one to hold the wire against the poles of the batteries and the other to manipulate the starting mechanism. Ross asked Emerson to assist. As Ross was explaining the method of hooking the batteries together and showing him the process, an electric spark caused an explosion of gas in the boat\u2019s bilge, the boat took fire, burned, and sank. Emerson died from injuries received by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Judicial proceedings were initiated by the filing by Holloway of a petition for exoneration and for limitation of liability, under the Limitation of Shipowners\u2019 Liability Act, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 182 et seq. A claim for damages to another boat was listed with the claim of Ellen Emerson, wife of Francis Emerson, for the wrongful death of her husband. Holloway proposed to convey the boat, then and thereafter at the bottom of the water in which it sank, to a trustee in discharge of its liability. Mrs. Emerson answered charging unseaworthiness and negligence, and denied the right of Holloway to the benefit of the limitation of liability. Mrs. Emerson filed a claim against Holloway for the negligent death of her husband asserting he was an invitee, that Holloway\u2019s negligence caused his death, and claimed damages in the amount of $200,000. To this claim Holloway filed an objection, saying its boat was seaworthy, and that the invitation of Ross to Emerson was not made in the scope of the employment of Ross. There was a denial of negligence of Holloway and its agents and employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The district court found that Ross, as an agent and employee of Holloway, had custody of the boat. It was found that Emerson voluntarily accompanied Holloway\u2019s agent Ross upon the boat, and that Ross, the agent of Holloway, was not guilty of any gross or wanton negligence with respect to Emerson. Having so found, the court determined as a matter of law that the claim of Mrs. Emerson had not been established. This appeal followed. On appeal it is urged that the question whether there is liability of Holloway to Mrs. Emerson is to be determined by the law of Florida; that Emerson was an invitee upon the boat but, whether he was an invitee or licensee, Holloway owed him a duty of reasonable care; that this duty was breached; that Emerson\u2019s death resulted from the negligence of Holloway\u2019s agent and employee; and that recovery should not be denied to Mrs. Emerson. The district court denied the petition of Holloway for limitation of liability. No appeal is before us with respect to this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The common law allowed no recovery for wrongful death. Dean Prosser has stated the rule and observed, \u201cThe result was that it was more profitable to kill the plaintiff than to scratch him, and that the most grievous of all injuries left the bereaved family of the victim, who frequently were destitute, without a remedy.\u201d Prosser on Torts, 2d ed. 710. And so in admiralty, in the absence of statute, the death of a person did not give rise to a cause of action, Norris, Maritime Personal Injuries, 361 et seq., \u00a7 125; The E. B. Ward, Jr., C.C., 16 F. 255. The remedy in England was provided by Lord Campbell\u2019s Act and each of the states has enacted a wrongful death statute. In the area of admiralty the Congress has created a cause of action for the death of seamen by the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 688. A remedy for death on the high seas is provided by a statute known as the Death on the High Seas Act, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 761 et seq. Emerson was not a seaman and the injury resulting in his death occurred on inland water. Neither of these statutes is available to Mrs. Emerson. Nor is she entitled to death benefits from the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 901 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Where death occurs on, or as a result of injuries received on navigable waters within a state, as was the case here, admiralty jurisdiction exists to enforce the right created by the state statute. Where the injured person survives and is the plaintiff or libellant in admiralty the principles governing are the rules of maritime law rather than the state substantive law and the duties of the shipowner are not limited by the law of the state. From this it follows that the person injured has a right to a seaworthy ship, and common law distinctions between licensees and invitees are inapplicable. Kermarec v. Compagnie Generate Transatlantique, 358 U.S. 625, 79 S.Ct. 406, 3 L.Ed.2d 550. But where the action is for wrongful death the liability, although established and enforced in admiralty, is to be measured by state standards, and the issues are to be determined in accordance with the substantive law of the state. Any defenses which are available under the law of the state may be successfully interposed in the admiralty proceeding. Goett v. Union Carbide Co., 361 U.S. 340, 80 S.Ct. 357, 4 L.Ed.2d 341. Hess v. United States, 361 U.S. 314, 80 S.Ct. 341, 4 L.Ed.2d 305; The Tungus v. Skovgaard, 358 U.S. 588, 79 S.Ct. 503, 3 L.Ed.2d 524; Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia, 257 U.S. 233, 42 S.Ct. 89, 66 L.Ed. 210; Graham v. A. Lusi, Limited, 5 Cir., 1953, 206 F.2d 223; Graff v. Parker Bros. &amp; Co., 5 Cir., 1953, 204 F.2d 705; Quinette v. Bisso, 5 Cir., 1905, 136 F. 825, 5 L.R.A., N.S., 303; 1 Benedict on Admiralty, 6th Ed. 392 \u00a7 148; Norris, Maritime Personal Injuries, 373 et seq. \u00a7\u00a7 130, 131. This is true unless the state law has adopted the general maritime concepts of negligence applicable in the case of death resulting from a maritime injury, rather than its own standards of negligence liability. Goett v. Union Carbide Corp., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The State of Florida has had for many years a statute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> providing for an action by libel in rem or in personam by a widow<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for the death of her husband caused by the negligence of a boat or of a person employed thereon. As the appellant has recognized, the problem here is to determine what law the courts of Florida would apply to the facts in this case if the case were presented in the courts of that state as an action for wrongful death. Such is the principle applied in the case of Graham v. A. Lusi, Ltd., supra, where it is held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\">\u201cThe statute must be applied in admiralty just as if the suit had been brought in the state courts, and any defenses which are open to the appellee under the jurisprudence of the state, if successfully maintained, will bar recovery under the libel.\u201d 206 F.2d 223, 225.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">In the Graham case the widow of the decedent sought to recover upon a showing that the injury resulting in death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>was caused by unseaworthiness. Under the maritime substantive law unseaworthiness would have given the injured person a right of action even though the injured plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence and the defendant shipowner had used due care. In holding contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s contentions, this Court, in the Graham case, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-4\">\u201cThere is a complete absence of merit in appellant\u2019s attempt to avoid the foregoing defenses by invoking a right of action for unseaworthiness which, being a right of action the deceased might have maintained had he simply been injured and lived, is clearly not preserved by the legislative enactment under which appellant proceeds.\u201d 206 F.2d 223, 225.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">As in the Graham case where unseaworthiness alone did not allow recovery under the Florida statute and contributory negligence could be asserted as a defense, so here the defendant shipowner must be permitted to assert whatever distinction there may be under the Florida law between the duty owed to an invitee and the duty owed to a licensee.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The answers to the state law questions seem to be found in the recent opinion of District Court of Appeal of Florida in the case of Cochran v. Abercrombie, 118 So.2d 636, 637. In its opinion the Florida precedents are discussed and the principles of the law of that state which control our decision are set forth. There the plaintiff alleged that he went to the residence of the defendant for the purpose of discussing a proposed fishing trip. While there the defendant requested the plaintiff to step over to the carport for the purpose of looking over the motor of the defendant\u2019s automobile. The defendant raised the hood and, while leaving the plaintiff in front of the car observing the motor, which was not then running, the defendant opened the car door and engaged the starter of the car which was in forward gear. The car lurched forward injuring the plaintiff. The complaint alleged that the defendant\u2019s conduct was done negligently and without warning. The factual similarity to the ease before us is apparent. The Florida trial court held that there could be no recovery because the plaintiff was merely a licensee to whom the defendant owed no greater care than to refrain from wilfully or wantonly causing him injury. The trial court dismissed the complaint and the District Court of Appeal affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">The courts of Florida make a distinction between the duties owed by the owner or occupier of property to trespassers, licensees and invitees. The duties owed to each of these classes are set forth in the court\u2019s opinion in Cochran v. Abercrombie, supra, by the following quotation from McNulty v. Hurley, Fla., 97 So.2d 185:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-9\">\u201c \u2018The duty owed by the owner or occupant of premises to each class of persons is also distinct. The duty owed by the owner or occupant to the trespasser is to refrain from committing a wilful or wanton injury against him with the rule being softened after discovery by the landowner of peril to the trespasser. Byers v. Gunn, Fla.1955, 81 So.2d 723.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-10\">\u201c \u2018The duty owed a licensee is to refrain from wanton negligence or wilful misconduct which would injure him, or to refrain from intentionally exposing him to danger. City of Boca Raton v. Mattef, Fla. 1956, 91 So.2d 644. There may be a further duty to the licensee to warn him of a defect or condition known to the owner or occupant to be dangerous when such danger is not open to ordinary observation by the licensee. [Citing authorities.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-11\">\u201c \u2018A greater duty is owed to an invitee than to either of the other class of persons above mentioned. The. owner or occupant owes an invitee the duty of keeping the premises in a reasonably safe condition, and, as plaintiff contends, also to guard against subjecting such person to dangers of which the owner or oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>cupant is cognizant or might reasonably have foreseen.\u2019 \u201d [Citing authorities.] 118 So.2d 636, 637.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The Florida court, in its Cochran v. Abercrombie opinion, had occasion to define \u201clicensee\u201d and to distinguish a licensee from an invitee. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">\u201cA \u2018licensee\u2019 has been broadly defined as \u2018a person who enters upon the property of another for his own convenience, pleasure, or benefit.\u2019 Stewart v. Texas Co., Fla.1953, 67 So.2d 653, 654. \u2018An invitee is normally considered to be one who enters upon the premises of another for purposes connected with the business of the owner or occupant of the premises.\u2019 City of Boca Raton v. Mattef, Fla., 1956, 91 So.2d 644, 647. That the plaintiff was a licensee on the facts stated has been determined by the trial court, and this, we think, is well supported by the cases collected in 25 A.L.R.2d 598, notwithstanding the fact that at the time of his injury he was carrying out a request by the defendant. The courts of various jurisdictions have held that incidental motives of the visit of a social guest, other than purely social ones, will not be sufficient to characterize the visitor as an \u2018invitee\u2019. These cases also indicate that minor services performed by the guest for the host during the visit will not be sufficient to change his status from licensee to invitee or business visitor.\u201d 118 So.2d 636, 637-638.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Although the decedent, Emerson, at the time of receiving the injury that resulted in his death, was carrying out a request of his host and performing a minor service for him, Emerson was nevertheless a licensee and not an invitee. There was no wilful or wanton misconduct and no condition of danger known to Ross of which he should have warned Emerson. Under the law there can be no recovery and that law is controlling of our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">The appellant makes one further point by urging that there was negligence of Ross which was affirmative or active and that in such a case recovery may be had even though there was no wilful or wanton negligence or misconduct. This doctrine and the application of it, or rather the lack of application of it in Florida, is also discussed and decided in Cochran v. Abercrombie, supra. From that opinion we again quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq0\">\u201cMany jurisdictions follow the rule that the possessor is under a duty to both licensees and trespassers to abstain from \u2018active\u2019 as opposed to \u2018passive\u2019 negligence. Some of the cases clearly distinguish this rule from the \u2018wilful and wanton injury\u2019 rule. Other cases combine the two rules, without distinction. In support of the classification of active and passive negligence the plaintiff has called our attention to the annotation which appears in 156 A.L.R. at page 1228, where the annotator has cited cases decided by the U. S. Courts of Appeal and the Courts of California, District of Columbia, Nevada, Illinois, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina-and Pennsylvania.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-10\">\u201cWhile no Florida cases have been cited in the briefs of either plaintiff or defendant where the facts are similar to those in the instant case, we feel that the case of Pensacola, St. Andrews <em>&amp; </em>Gulf S.S. Co. v. Austin, 1912, 63 Fla. 241, 58 So. 611, 613, precludes our adopting the \u2018active\u2019 and \u2018passive\u2019 negligence theory which is urged by the plaintiff. In that case the negligence of the defendant can be classified as \u2018active\u2019, although the words \u2018active\u2019 and \u2018passive\u2019 were not used to distinguish the types of negligence. The negligence involved in the instant case would undoubtedly be held in the jurisdictions which have adopted the \u2018active\u2019 and \u2018passive\u2019 negligence theory to be \u2018active\u2019 negligence. Following the reasoning in the Pensacola, St. Andrews &amp; Gulf S.S. Co. v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Austin case, supra, then, we must decline to adopt from other jurisdictions the \u2018active\u2019 and \u2018passive\u2019 negligence theory.\u201d 118 So.2d 636, 638-639.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Since the Florida court has declined to adopt the \u201cactive\u201d and \u201cpassive\u201d negligence theory we cannot apply it in a case which is governed by the laws of that state.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">From what has been said it follows that the judgment of the district court must be and it is Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-4\">. \u201cWhenever the death of any person in this state shall be caused by the wrongful act, negligence, carelessness or default of any individual or individuals, or by the wrongful act, negligence, carelessness or default of any corporation, or by the wrongful act, negligence, carelessness, or default, of any agent of any corporation, acting in his capacity of agent of such corporation (or by the wrongful act, negligence, carelessness or default of any ship, vessel or boat or persons employed thereon), and the act, negligence, carelessness or default, is such as would, if the death had not ensued, have entitled the party injured thereby to maintain an action (or to proceed in rem against the said ship, vessel or boat, or in personam against the owners thereof, or those having control of her) and to recover damages in respect thereof, then and in every such case the person or persons who, or the corporation (or the ship, vessel or boat), which would have been liable in damages if death had not ensued, shall be liable to an action for damages (or if a ship, vessel or boat, to a libel in rem, and her owners or those responsible for her wrongful act, negligence, carelessness or default, to a libel in personam), notwithstanding the death of the person injured, and although the death shall have been caused under such circumstances as amount in law to a felony.\u201d Fla.Stat.1959, \u00a7 768.01, F.S.A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b323-11\">.

BROWN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AvC\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">To the natural cynicism of Dean Prosser echoed by the Court\u2019s quotation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac2\">\u201cThe result was that it was more profitable to kill the plaintiff than to scratch him, and that the most grievous of all injuries left the bereaved family of the victim, who frequently were destitute, without a remedy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">may be added another. As he would say, it is more profitable to kill a man than destroy property. For the maritime tort which killed Emerson and which was brought about solely because Emerson, pursuant to request, was doing a task indispensable to Ross\u2019 work, destroyed seven nearby motor yachts and a shipyard. The District Court allowed a recovery of $36,384.71 (including $15,-000 in hull underwriters subrogation) for this property damage. Holloway, the petitioner, was denied the right to limit liability because the fault and neglect of Ross was with the privity and knowledge of the corporate owner of the M/Y Overtime.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">The Court approaches it this way: being a maritime death action we must decide what the Florida <em>courts </em>would say. Having gotten that far, and ignoring the plain words of the Florida Death Statute, the Court then proceeds to declare, not what the Florida courts would hold, but what this Court one time said. Taking Graham v. A. Lusi, Ltd., 5 Cir., 1953, 206 F.2d 223, decided in 1953 as the law of the Medes and Persians which altereth not, the Court then makes the pronouncement that as was a claim of unseaworthiness without fault, or one involving contributory negligence on the part of the decedent, not within the Florida statute, so too must be one in which status\u2014 licensee \u2014 for a land-based Florida injury would prevent recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">My bewilderment can be quickly pinpointed : what has happened to the Florida legislature? Is it not the Act \u2014 not what judges say of it \u2014 that controls?</p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">My view is that the Florida Death Statute has spelled it out in the most unmistakable manner. The test of a survivor\u2019s death recovery is this simple query: could the deceased have recovered had he survived and sued ? And for maritime injuries resulting in death Florida has made that query even more specific: could the decedent have recovered in an admiralty proceeding <em>in rem </em>against the vessel or <em>in personam </em>against the owner or operator? When it comes to the answer to that question, the facts show glaring negligence and in no sense was the casualty the result of that sort of unseaworthiness \u2014 liability without fault \u2014 considered by us in Graham, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-14\">The Court\u2019s opinion gives quite a different impression. Reading it one would suppose that there were but two claims \u2014one for Emerson\u2019s death and the other for damage to a single vessel. More so, as to them the opinion merely reflects with an almost classic understatement that the District Court \u201cdenied the petition of Holloway for limitation of liability.\u201d That could occur from a variety of reasons, not the least of which might be a technical failure to comply with statutory requirements on time, surrender of vessel, inadequate ad interim stipulation and the like. Oil Transport Do. v. Verret, 5 Cir., 1960, 278 F.2d 464. This is far from the case. What happened was that the District Court denied it on the merits on the ground that the corporate shipowner through its presi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>dent, Williamson, and through Ross to whom the management of the M/Y Overtime was committed as ship\u2019s husband, had privity and knowledge of the fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">This was a substantial catastrophe. In response to the monition and restraining orders there were seven claims and answers filed to the petition for limitation of shipowner\u2019s liability besides that for Emerson\u2019s death. These were for the destruction of the motor vessels \u201cBeltz \u2014 Beatty,\u201d the \u201cMike,\u201d the \u201cRainbow,\u201d the \u201cDreamgirl,\u201d the \u201cJoyce Ann,\u201d and the \u201cHilda\u201d (and hull underwriters\u2019 subrogation) and destruction of the Sanford Boat Works where the M/Y \u25a0Overtime was kept. After the trial on liability vel non and right to limit participated in by all claimants including Emerson, the District Court held that this fire and explosion occurred with the privity and fault of Holloway, the corporate shipowner. Exoneration from and right to limit liability were denied. All claims (save Emerson\u2019s) were then referred to a Commissioner upon whose award a final decree was entered for $36,384.74 including interest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">The Court\u2019s opinion is accurate in stating in a negative way that the trial court \u201cfound that Emerson voluntarily accompanied Holloway\u2019s agent Ross upon the boat, and that Ross, the agent of Holloway, was not guilty of any gross or wanton negligence with respect to Emerson.\u201d But the record tells much more,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and both the uncontradicted evidence and the District Judge\u2019s statements in the record reflect that the fire and explosion was the result of active<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> negligence on the part of Ross.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">As this record comes to us, this was a crude setup. On at least a dozen occasions the batteries had proved inadequate. It was necessary to use the jumper wire. Even the president had witnessed the operation and had acknowledged that sparks were produced. Of course, the sparks were either in or right over the bilge areas where gasoline fumes would frequently accumulate. To those owed the duty of seaworthiness, cf. United New York and New Jersey Sandy Hook Pilots Ass\u2019n v. Halecki, 1959, 358 U.S. 613, 79 S.Ct. 517, 3 L.Ed. 2d 541, and West v. United States, 1959, 361 U.S. 118, 80 S.Ct. 189, 4 L.Ed.2d 161, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>such a system with its known deficiencies made the vessel unseaworthy. But it was not a static condition or one for imposition of liability without fault, see Mitchell v. Trawler Racer, Inc., 1960, 362 U.S. 539, 80 S.Ct. 926, 4 L.Ed.2d 941. The use of this nondescript method causing the vessel to be unseaworthy in an operational as well as legal sense was, at the same time, negligence of the most patent sort.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">With a gasoline engine it was impossible to avoid some leakage or resulting gasoline fumes. In optimum mixture of very small parts, this is highly explosive. Two witnesses of unusual technical qualification as experts testified without any contradiction whatsoever that the use of this \u201cbailing wire\u201d jumper system was fraught with great danger of explosion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">And the District Judge expressly thought of this in terms of negligence, i. e., specific acts of commission or omission. His unqualified declarations are as much a part of the record as the formal findings of fact, note 2, supra. They show that he was acutely aware of the problem for legal decision. After extended arguments of counsel on the substantial question of privity and knowledge, the Judge called for briefs. But as the underlying basis for the briefs, he several times announced that he was holding that Ross was guilty of negligence proximately causing the damage.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This left then for briefs only the question whether petitioner was charged with privity and knowledge of Ross\u2019 negligence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-15\">Consequently, we do not have, as one might infer from the casual nature of the opinion, damage and death caused only by unseaworthiness without fault. We have damage due to specific conduct of Ross (chargeable to Williamson) which the Court found to be both negligent and a kind of which the shipowner had personal complicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-16\">Would Emerson have been entitled to recover had he lived? The Court almost \u2014but not quite \u2014 says as much.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-17\">But the Court really never answers this question. All that it does is place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>great store<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> on the statement by us in Graham, supra [206 F.2d 225]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">\u201cThe statute must be applied in admiralty just as if the suit had been brought in the state courts # # # ^</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Actually, this is no test at all. It either begs the question or in the light of the decisions of the past few years it is simply wrong. The injuries being maritime a Florida state court would be bound by the maritime law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">And at least one thing we know positively. Status as an invitee or licensee is irrelevant to the maritime law insofar as maritime injuries are concerned. The shipowner owes the duty of due care to each alike. This was the precise holding of Kermarec v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 1959, 358 U.S. 625, 79 S.Ct. 406, 408, 3 L.Ed.2d 550. The opinion first demonstrates that it does no good to make a theoretical assessment in terms of what would have occurred in a state court since, if the action \u201chad been brought in a state court, reference to admiralty law would have been necessary to determine the rights and liabilities of the parties.\u201d 358 U.S. 625, at page 628, 79 S.Ct. 406, at page 408, 3 L.Ed. 2d 550, at page 553. And without a doubt Emerson comes within the Court\u2019s declaration. \u201cWe hold that the owner of a ship in navigable waters owes to all who are on board for purposes not inimical to his legitimate interests the duty of exercising reasonable care under the circumstances of each case.\u201d 358 U.S. 625, at page 632, 79 S.Ct. 406, at page 410, 3 L.Ed.2d 550, at page 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-18\">For maritime injuries, the maritime law supplies the sole standard. This includes cases pending either in the state court or as a civil action based on diversity. \u201cWhatever doubt may once have existed on that score was effectively laid to rest by Pope &amp; Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn, 346 U.S. 406, 410-411, 74 S.Ct. 202, 204, 98 L.Ed. 143.\u201d Kermerac v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, supra, 358 U.S. 625, at page 628, 79 S.Ct. 406, at page 409, 3 L.Ed.2d 550, at page 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-19\">What does death do ? I would not here try to fashion a consistent mosaic<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> from the momentary, shifting, sometimes conditional concurrences among the several Justices which now make up the Court\u2019s view.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The common core is the recognition by all that the maritime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>law ultimately controls the area in which the states may operate and the extent to which the so-called state substantive standards are to be followed as the guide.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">As of the present moment the principle that musters a working majority can be stated briefly. The right effectively to recover for maritime death depends on a state death statute. The federal admiralty court (or in civil actions in diversity cases) may enforce these rights. What those rights are depends on the state statute or, wherever necessary, the construction put upon the state statute by the courts of that state. In this approach the state has the power to incorporate or adopt within its death statute substantive maritime law principles of negligence and unseaworthiness. If it does, then the survivors will recover, as would the decedent, on admiralty principles whether in a state court, a federal diversity civil action, or the admiralty. Otherwise, if the state confines the standard to that for non-maritime common law situations, the admiralty takes the case with all of the limitations and defenses of the right under that interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">It is a question, then, of the terms of the state death statute or, where needed, the interpretation and construction of that statute by the state judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-13\">Here the Florida Death Statute is plain and it is remarkably precise as the interpolated brackets in note 12 reflect.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-14\">All doubt is eliminated as to parties who are to be held legally accountable. These include specifically [la] individuals, [16] corporations, and [lc] corporate agents. To these is then added [Id] a ship and all persons employed thereon. But it is even more refined, for the statute speaks in terms of the legal remedies open to the decedent had he survived. These specifically include the right to [2a] maintain an action to recover damages. Of decisive importance, they specifically cover his right to [26] proceed by libel <em>in rem </em>against a vessel or [2c] <em>in personam </em>against her owner or operator. With equal precision it speaks in terms of specific categories of those entries having a legal liability for such injuries had death not ensued. The op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>erative result is then defined in like terms. It specifies that those in category [la, <em>b, c, d] </em>causing injuries which entitle the injured person to resort to rerriedies in category <em>[2a, b, </em>c] for recovery of damages shall be liable to [3a.] in action for damages or [36] a libel <em>in rem </em>or [3c] a libel <em>in personam.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The statute makes a triple approach to the problem in terms of the party or thing inflicting the wrong, the rights of the injured person had he survived, and the legal remedies available for redress. In each category specific note is taken of maritime injuries and the unique remedies known only to the admiralty (see [Id], [26], [2c], [36], [3c]). In this respect it has few counterparts in state death statutes. Except for Virginia<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> with which it is almost identical, and somewhat similar provisions in Maryland,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Mississippi,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and Oregon,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> no other state death statutes speak in terms of specific admiralty remedies or maritime substantive rights.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-14\">Unfortunately, (or fortunately depending on how one looks upon these things, see Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Acker, 1959, 361 U.S. 87, 80 S.Ct. 144, 4 L.Ed.2d 127, 132, dissenting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>opinion), no formal legislative history is available. But it can be said of this Florida statute what the Fourth Circuit recently said of Virginia\u2019s. That Court in Holley v. The Manfred Stansfield, 4 Cir., 1959, 269 F.2d 317, 320, held that under the Virginia Act, note 13, supra, the trial court\u2019s finding of contributory negligence did not bar recovery for a maritime death.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Of the statute the Court remarked, \u201cIt is too obvious to escape attention that the statute was drafted by one well versed in admiralty law.\" 269 F.2d at page 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-23\">Now all of this has decisive significance both affirmatively and negatively. The Florida standard of recovery* for death is the vicarious right to proceed by libel <em>in rem </em>or <em>in personam. </em>The term \u201clibel\u201d is one of art for the traditional pleading of the party seeking relief. A admiralty libel <em>in rem </em>requires a lien either implied by the maritime law or pursuant to a statute, state or federal. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>a statutory lien, as has long been established, can be enforced only in admiralty.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> That means that the Florida reference to the vicarious standard contemplated admiralty proceedings. This is of crucial importance since in any such supposed admiralty proceeding it is clear that the maritime, not Florida, substantive law would control. Florida would be powerless to prescribe any standard of lesser liability. Specifically Florida could not, by legislation or judicial decision, impose on the admiralty any common law status concepts of invitee, licensee, or trespasser, Kermarec v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, supra, or contributory negligence as a complete bar. Pope &amp; Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn, 1953, 346 U.S. 406, 74 S.Ct. 202, 98 L.Ed. 143. Having prescribed two distinctive types of admiralty proceedings, it is unreasonable to assume that Florida contemplated that in such proceedings, substantive law other than maritime would control. The Constitution would forbid anything else as Florida well knew.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">And viewing it affirmatively the specific reference to such admiralty proceedings reflects a purpose on Florida\u2019s part to extend to survivors whatever benefit the substantive maritime law would have afforded for maritime injuries. This was a natural thing since Florida has extensive maritime interests. And anyone familiar enough with admiralty to distinguish carefully, as this Act does, between <em>in rem </em>and <em>in personam </em>libels, would know instinctively that its purpose was to <em>broaden, </em>not restrict, the rights of recovery. As an immediate objective the Act sought the great advantages of financial security in the maritime lien, the <em>in rem </em>proceeding, the flexibility of <em>in personam </em>actions with writ of foreign attachment without the cumbersome bonding and similar requirements under state garnishment proceedings and the like. And most clearly in mind must have been the maritime law\u2019s historic view on contributory-comparative negligence and the sweeping protection of the concept of the warranty of seaworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">As the test for maritime death\u2019 damage recovery, the Florida statute asks a simple question: could the injured person have recovered had he sued in admiralty? The answer is equally simple.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-13\">Florida has therefore exercised the choice allowed to it by the maritime law. The \u201cState might apply the substantive law generally applicable to wrongful death cases within its territory, or it might choose to incorporate the general maritime law\u2019s concepts of unseaworthiness or negligence.\u201d Goett v. Union Carbide Corp., 1960, 361 U.S. 340, 80 S.Ct. 357, 358, 4 L.Ed.2d 341, at page 343. It has done so in unmistakable language which leaves no place for judicial interpretation, much less an uncritical acquiescence in a former 1953 decision which, like Goett v. Union Carbide Corp., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>supra, decided by the Court of Appeals in 1958, (4 Cir., 256 F.2d 449) was without the benefit of Tungus and Halecki.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">So long as the Tungus standard remains, it is a question of state law. The state law is here found in the statute. We cannot make state law, nor can we by one or a dozen opinions eradicate the positive terms of the statute. The statute does not say that death damages shall be allowed \u201cif the suit had been brought in the state courts\u201d or that in such action \u201cany defenses which are open * * * under the jurisprudence of the state * * * will bar recovery under the libel.\u201d See note 8, supra. This is an impermissible judge-made amendment to Florida legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The Florida statute asks: could Emerson have recovered in admiralty?</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">The Court never answers that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">I therefore dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b327-6\">. Utilizing Rule 23 of this Court, 28 U.S. C.A., I have examined the entire record of the limitation proceedings in the District Court of which the instant appeal is an integral part.

In the formal findings of fact the District Court, concerning the jumper wire setup, had this to say: \u201cThe method thus used to start the motor was calculated to and often did produce sparks capable of igniting any sufficient accumulation of gasoline fumes present in the area of the batteries. * * * The explosion and fire was the result of the ignition of accumulated fumes by means of the sparks caused by the use of jumper wires.\u201d Upon that the Judge concluded that this \u201cunsafe and dangerous method * * * made the boat unseaworthy * * * \u201d which \u201ccondition * * * known to Williamson * * * \u201d was with the \u201cknowledge and privity\u201d of petitioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b327-18\">. I use this in the sense of liability with fault to distinguish it from those instances in which liability without fault may flow from a breach of the absolute warranty of seaworthiness.

Abercrombie, Fla.App., 1960, 118 So. 2d 636, at pages 638-639.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b328-6\">.

In the 1959 annual survey of American Law, 35 N.Y.U.L.Rev. (1960), Nicholas J. Hoaly, 3rd, in Admiralty and Shipping, pages 587-599, at pages 597-598 reports: \u201cFollowing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in The Tungus v. Skovgaard, a number of lower courts were quick to hold that the wrongful death statutes of various states were worded broadly enough to include a cause of action for death resulting from unseaworthiness.\u201d To this is appended footnote 56. \u201cSee, e. g., Holley v. The Manfred Stansfield, 269 F.2d 317, 1959 AMC 2189 (4th Cir.), certiorari denied [Reederei Blumenfeld, G. M. B. H.] 361 U.S. 883 [80 S.Ct. 154, 4 L.Ed.2d 119] (1959), interpreting Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 8-633 (1957); [State of] Maryland ex rel. Gladden v. Weyerhaeuser S.S. Co., 176 F.Supp. 664, 1959 AMC 1380 (D.Md.1959), interpreting Md.Ann.

States Marine Corp. of Delaware, 9 Cir., 1959, 265 F.2d 554, in which the Ninth Circuit reversing dismissal of a complaint reserves the question of contributory negligence under the California Death Statute until trial on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-29\">The Texas Court of Civil Appeals in Vassallo v. Nederl-Amerik Stoomv Maats Holland, 1960, 337 S.W.2d 309 has just held that the state death act, Arts. 4671, 4672, does not absorb the maritime doctrine of comparative fault and contributory negligence is a complete bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-30\">The New Jersey statute is set out in The Tungus v. Skovgaard, 1959, 358 U.S. 588, 79 S.Ct. 503, 3 L.Ed.2d 524 at note 7. Both the Second and Third Circuits have construed this act as incorporating the doctrine of unseaworthiness and in Halecki the Supreme Court approves the Second Circuit\u2019s construction that the maritime principle of comparative fault would apply to decedent\u2019s contributory negligence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b333-6\">.

The answer is not found, as would usually be the case, by a vicarious determination of what some other court would hold. For whatever doubt there might be theoretically is dispelled by the actual final decree allowing recovery for property damage. The District Court, as a constitutional court of admiralty having jurisdiction over the whole limitation proceeding, Pershing Auto Rentals, Inc. v. Gaffney, 5 Cir., 1960, 279 F.2d 546, and not sitting as a mere Brie adjunct to state courts, Levinson v. Deupree, 1953, 345 U.S. 648, 73 S.Ct. 914, 97 L.Ed. 1319, has held as a matter of maritime substantive law that the conduct of petitioner gave rise to the right to recover damages for the maritime tort inflicted upon the floating vessels. Under the maritime law Emerson would fare as well as a vessel. If any different factors would apply to the claim for $6,088.20 for nonmaritime damage to Sanford Boat Works, we need not consider them here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
