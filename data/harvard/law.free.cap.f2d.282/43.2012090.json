In conference the court was in disagreement, Judges Waterman and Lewis voting to reverse and the writer voting to affirm. Draft opinions reflecting this disagreement, together with the briefs, record, transcript, and appendix, were then circulated among the active judges, a majority of whom, believing that the case presented a general problem important to the administration of justice in this circuit, thereupon voted for disposition of the appeal <em>in banc, </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 46(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Four active judges having then voted to affirm, the writer was assigned to prepare an opinion reflecting this prevailing view.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-23\">The defendant was charged with having knowingly received and possessed goods stolen in interstate commerce in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 659. The trial got under way before Judge Abruzzo on February 4, 1959, after the declaration of a mistrial on the previous day.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> From <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>the opening by counsel it appeared that the defendant would not contest his receipt and possession of stolen goods on February 11, 1958, with the codefendant Corbett \u2014 who pleaded guilty \u2014 but would claim that he acted without knowledge of their character and only as Corbett\u2019s hired employee. The Assistant United States Attorney attempted to prove this fairly simple case first by the testimony of the shipper\u2019s traffic manager, second by the truckman from whose truck the goods w'ere stolen, and third by two FBI Special Agents investigating the theft. He ran into repeated difficulty, however, in part because of continuous formal objections by the defense, but even more by interference on the part of the trial judge, who repeatedly ordered the re-framing of questions and otherwise took the conduct of the case away from him. The trial continued its rocky course throughout the morning and early afternoon until upon the examination of the fourth witness, Special Agent Deery, there occurred the colloquy set forth in the margin resulting in the declaration of a mistrial by the judge.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Later Judge Kayfiel in a reasoned opinion denied defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the information on plea of former jeopardy, and he was convicted and sentenced to imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>ment after a jury trial before Chief Judge Bruchhausen. He now appeals from both these actions of the district court, but relies only on the claim of former jeopardy and assigns no error as to his trial before Judge Bruchhausen.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The colloquy set forth in the margin demonstrates that the prosecutor did nothing to instigate the declaration of a mistrial and that he was only performing his assigned duty under trying conditions. This is borne out by the entire transcript, including also that covering the morning session. Nor does it make entirely clear the reasons which led the judge to act, though the parties appear agreed that he intended to prevent the prosecutor from bringing out evidence of other crimes by the accused. Even so, the judge should have awaited a definite question which would have permitted a clear-cut ruling. But if he was thus overassiduous, pursuing the command role which he had assumed for himself, it seems clear that he was acting according to his convictions in protecting the rights of the accused. The defense now urges that the judge was endeavoring to punish counsel\u2019s disobedience, but such a characterization, even if apt, adds nothing significant to his over-all purpose; and as to this the defense elsewhere states, \u201cIt is undeniable that the trial court was concerned with protecting the rights of the appellant.\u201d It is to be noted that the defendant made the original objections leading to the order of mistrial and that he made or attempted no protest to the order itself, but accepted the benefit of the new trial. We have the issue, therefore, whether active and express consent \u2014 something beyond acquiescence \u2014 is required to prevent this defendant, now convicted after a concededly fair trial, from receiving absolution for his crime by reason of the over-zealousness of the trial judge on his behalf. A majority of this court concludes that the federal law does not so command.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The mandate of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution is \u201c * * * nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb * * In considering whether the declaration of a mistrial precludes a subsequent prosecution for the same offense the Supreme Court has rejected any rigid formularization of the constitutional requirement in favor of a flexible application of the prohibition. Wade v. Hunter, 336 U.S. 684, 690, 69 S.Ct. 834, 93 L.Ed. 974. This approach originated in United States v. Perez, 9 Wheat. 579, 580, 22 U.S. 579, 580, 6 L.Ed. 165, where Justice Story stated: \u201cWe think, that in all cases of this nature, the law has invested courts of justice with the authority to discharge a jury from giving any verdict, whenever, in their opinion, taking all the circumstances into consideration, there is a manifest necessity for the act, or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated. They are to exercise a sound discretion on the subject; and it is impossible to define all the circumstances which would render it proper to interfere.\u201d This controlling principle was succinctly reiterated in Brock v. State of North Carolina, 344 U.S. 424, 427, 73 S.Ct. 349, 350, 97 L.Ed. 456:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Af\">\u201cThis Court has long favored the rule of discretion in the trial judge to declare a mistrial and to require another panel to try the defendant if the ends of justice will be best served. Wade v. Hunter, 336 U.S. 684 [69 S.Ct. 834, 93 L.Ed. 974]; Thompson v. United States, 155 U.S. 271, 273-274 [15 S.Ct. 73, 74, 39 L.Ed. 146]. As was said in Wade v. Hunter, supra, [336 U.S.] p. 690 [69 S.Ct. at page 638, 93 L.Ed. 974], \u2018a trial can be discontinued when particular circumstances manifest a necessity for so doing, and when failure to discontinue would defeat the ends of justice.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">To the same effect are Lovato v. State of New Mexico, 242 U.S. 199, 37 S.Ct. 107, 61 L.Ed. 244; Simmons v. United States, 142 U.S. 148, 12 S.Ct. 171, 35 L.Ed. 968 ; United States v. Cimino, 2 Cir., 224 F.2d 274; United States v. Potash, 2 Cir., 118 F.2d 54, certiorari denied Potash v. Unit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>ed States, 313 U.S. 584, 61 S.Ct. 1103, 85 L.Ed. 1540; Scott v. United States, 91 U.S.App.D.C. 232, 202 F.2d 354, certiorari denied 344 U.S. 879, 73 S.Ct. 176, 97 L.Ed. 681; United States v. Giles, D.C. W.D.Okl., 19 F.Supp. 1009. It is to be noted that in none of these cases is the element of consent by the accused held necessary to obviate the constitutional bar; in fact, they are authority for the contrary view. Actually in several the mistrial had been declared either on the motion of the prosecution or by the court of its own motion, but over the vigorous opposition of the defense; this was the situation in the Simmons, Scott, and Giles cases, as well as in the Brock case, which concerned a state conviction reviewed under the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In yet others, as in Lovato, Cimino, and Potash, it had been declared on the government\u2019s or the court\u2019s motion, with no showing of express consent by the accused. In all these the ultimate conviction was upheld against the plea of double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\"> The defendant relies on Himmelfarb v. United States, 9 Cir., 175 F.2d 924, 932, certiorari denied 338 U.S. 860, 70 S.Ct. 103, 94 L.Ed. 527, as showing the need of consent; but such was not the court\u2019s approach there. Accepting the now well settled view that waiver or consent by the defendant barred his later resort to the plea,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the court first considered and held ineffective a waiver by counsel without his client\u2019s specific assent. Having thus cleared the way, it passed to the \u201creal issue presented,\u201d which was \u201cwhether or not there was a legal necessity supporting the discharge of the first jury.\u201d And this it considered at considerable length with a wealth of learning and citation of authority, concluding: \u201cWe think the court did not abuse its discretion.\u201d So the denial of the plea was upheld and the conviction was <em>affirmed. </em>To similar effect are cases such as Ex parte Glenn, C.C.N.D.W.Va., 111 F. 257, reversed on other grounds Moss v. Glenn, 189 U.S. 506, 23 S.Ct. 851, 47 L.Ed. 921, and United States v. Watson, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 28 Fed.Cas. page 499, No. 16,651. Thus while consent may bar resort to the plea, its absence does not relieve the judge of responsibility and discretion to discontinue a particular trial when justice so requires. Wade v. Hunter, supra, 336 U.S. 684, 689, 69 S.Ct. 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The law as thus stated comports more with our fundamental concepts of the federal administration of criminal justice than does the rigid and inflexible rule contended for by the accused. It has been a source of pride federal-wise that a United States district judge is more than a mere automaton or referee and bears an affirmative responsibility for the conduct of a criminal trial. This responsibility is particularly acute in the avoidance of prejudice arising from nuances in the heated atmosphere of trial, which cannot be fully depicted in the cold record on appeal. If the accused retains essentially a power of veto on pain of ban of all prosecution, even though fully justified, it is clear that the judge does not retain control of his courtroom and cannot act as he thinks necessary either to protect the interests of the litigants or to preserve proper respect for federal law administration. Even though there may be a rare case where in retrospect the judge may seem to have been overzealous in his protection of the rights of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>an accused, we think the law is better served by the preservation of the responsibility which the federal precedents impose upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">On this basis we do not believe decision should be difficult, for the responsibility and discretion exercised by the judges below seem to us sound. Here the defendant was in no way harmed by the brief trial which, indeed, revealed to him the prosecution\u2019s entire case. He was thus in a position to start anew with a clean slate, with all possibility of prejudice eliminated and with foreknowledge of the case against him. The situation was quite unlike the more troublesome problems found in various of the cases, as where the prosecution desires to strengthen his case on a new start or otherwise provokes the declaration of mistrial, or the court has acted to the prejudice of the accused, or the accused has actually been subject to two trials for essentially the same offense.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On the other hand, for the defendant to receive absolution for his crime, later proven quite completely, because the judge acted too hastily in his interest, would be an injustice to the public in the particluar case and a disastrous precedent for the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">I am authorized to say that Chief Judge LUMBARD and Judges MOORE and FRIENDLY concur in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"Alt\">Conviction affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b92-16\">. Although disagreeing with the conclusion. of the panel majority, the writer did not vote for the <em>in banc </em>procedure. In his experience such procedure does not reconcile differences, but in fact accentuates them. Hence it should be reserved for clarifying issues otherwise presented ambiguously or in a one-sided fashion. Here the important issue seemed fully presented, and there was the added difficulty of superseding the judgment of a distinguished visitor who had graciously complied with our request for help. Though we have acted similarly in other cases, it appears not to be a settled practice in other circuits. See, e. g., National Latex Products Co. v. Sun Rubber Co., 6 Cir., 276 F.2d 167.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b92-25\">.

The question in Green was as to jurisdiction, after reversal on appeal, to retry the accused for the greater offense of which he had been originally acquitted. But the majority, in sustaining the plea and pointing out that it \u201cprevents a prosecutor or judge from subjecting a defendant to a second prosecution by discontinuing the trial when it appears that the jury might not convict,\u201d reiterate, 355 U.S. at page 188, 78 S.Ot. at page 224: \u201cAt the same time jeopardy is not regarded as having come to an end so as to bar a second trial in those cases where \u2018unforeseeable circumstances * * * arise during [the first] trial making its completion, impossible, sucb as the failure of a jury to agree on a verdict.\u2019 Wade v.

If not, a second question arises: did the defendant here expressly or impliedly request or consent to the mistrial order? I believe that both these questions must be answered in the negative, and therefore I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">The former jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment reads as follows: \u201c * * * nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; * * *\u201d The clause consistently has been interpreted not only to forbid multiple punishment for the same offense but also to forbid successive exposures to a single punishment.

There are also eases disallowing the plea of former jeopardy when the mistrial order resulted from the courtroom conduct of particular persons. Prior to this case the prosecuting attorney has not been included in this group. See United States v. Cimino, 2 Cir., 1955, 224 F.2d 274 (exclamations of a juror); Scott v. United States, 1952, 91 U.S.App.D.C. 232, 202 F.2d 354, certiorari denied 344 U.S. 879, 881, 73 S.Ct. 176, 97 L.Ed. 681 (withdrawal of associate counsel appointed by the court); United States v. Giles, D.C.W.D.Okl.1937, 19 F.Supp. 1009 (exclamations of a trial judge questioning Government\u2019s good faith in prosecuting); but cf. United States v. Whitlow, D.C. D.C.1953,110 F.Supp. 871 (misconduct of defendant\u2019s counsel held too minor to nullify plea of former jeopardy). For reasons to be set forth subsequently I am of the opinion that a mistrial ordered because the trial judge believed that the prosecuting attorney was guilty of misconduct presents a different problem than that presented in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">All the cases purporting to be exceptions to the rule that a mistrial may not be ordered without the defendant\u2019s consent \u201conce jeopardy has attached\u201d rely upon the authority and rationale of United States v. Perez, supra. There, 9 Wheat, at page 580, Justice Story said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-9\">\u201cWe think that in all cases of this nature, the law has invested courts of justice with the authority to discharge a jury from giving any verdict, whenever, in their opinion, taking all the circumstances into consideration, there is a manifest necessity for the act, or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated. They are to exercise a sound discretion on the subject; and it is impossible to define all the circumstances which would render it proper to interfere. To be sure, the power ought to be used with the greatest caution, under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causes; and, in capital cases especially, courts should be extremely careful how they interfere with any of the chances of life, in favor of the prisoner. But, after all, they have the right to order the discharge; and the security which the public have for the faith<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>ful, sound and conscientious exercise of this discretion, rests, in this as in other cases, upon the responsibility of the judges, under their oaths of office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Without in any way disagreeing with the result in the Perez case or with the results in the cases which have relied upon it, I submit that as a guide for determining when subsequent prosecution is to be barred by the former jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment, Justice Story\u2019s discussion in Perez is analytically inadequate. If the former jeopardy clause is to be taken seriously as a constitutional right of criminal defendants and if one accepts the principle that jeopardy attaches at the commencement of trial, it defies analysis to hold that this constitutional right can <em>always </em>be nullified by some discretionary act on the part of the judge at the first trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The inadequacy of such a \u201cdiscretionary\u201d rationale becomes peculiarly apparent in the present case. The majority opinion is at pains to demonstrate the propriety of the Assistant United States Attorney\u2019s conduct. They state that the Assistant United States Attorney did nothing to instigate a mistrial, that he merely performed his assigned duties \u201cunder trying conditions.\u201d The action of the district judge in ordering the mistrial, expressly characterized as \u201cover-assiduous\u201d and \u201cover-zealous,\u201d is thus clearly regarded by my colleagues as having been a mistaken action. Plow then can it be said that the district judge did <em>not abuse </em>his discretion in ordering a mistrial ? I cannot follow my colleagues on this issue; the result they reach is to me a <em>non sequitur. </em>However, my dissent is based upon other grounds, for I believe the question before us should be resolved without any reliance whatever upon amorphous principles of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Even if all other questions in the law of former jeopardy remain unsettled it is clear that in the one case where the trier of fact has fully considered the evidence against a defendant and the defendant has been acquitted that man may not thereafter be prosecuted for the same offense. United States v. Ball, 1896, 163 U.S. 662, 669-670, 16 S.Ct. 1192, 41 L.Ed. 300. As a corollary, a prosecuting attorney, sensing that the trier of fact will acquit if the case being tried is completed, may not enter a \u201cnolle prosequi\u201d during the trial without the bar of former jeopardy attaching. See Green v. United States, 1957, 355 U.S. 184, 188, 78 S.Ct. 221, 2 L.Ed.2d 199; Cornero v. United States, 9 Cir., 1931, 48 F.2d 69, 71, 74 A.L.R. 797; Ex parte Ulrich, D.C. W.D.Mo.1890, 42 F. 587, 595, reversed on other grounds, C.C.W.D.Mo.1890, 43 F. 661, appeal dismissed sub nom. Ulrich v. McGowan, 1893, 149 U.S. 789, 13 S.Ct. 1053, 37 L.Ed. 967; United States v. Shoemaker, C.C.D.Ill.1840, 27 Fed.Cas. page 1067, No. 16,279; and cf. Frankfurter, J., concurring, Brock v. State of North Carolina, 1953, 344 U.S. 424, 428-429, 73 S.Ct. 349, 97 L.Ed. 456. Therefore, what the prosecuting attorney is forbidden to do directly by nolle he ought not to be permitted to do indirectly by way of trial misconduct. I would hold that misconduct by a prosecuting attorney during trial may not deprive a defendant without his consent of the right to have that trial completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">So far as I have been able to discover, of the cases permitting retrial subsequent to a mistrial that had been ordered after the initial trial had begun, in only two have the factors that produced the mistrial order been within the control of the prosecution. These two cases are Wade v. Hunter, 1949, 336 U.S. 684, 69 S.Ct. 834, 93 L.Ed. 974, rehearing denied 337 U.S. 921, 69 S.Ct. 1152, 93 L.Ed. 1730, and Lovato v. State of New Mexico, 1916, 242 U.S. 199, 37 S.Ct. 107, 61 L.Ed. 244, and neither case contradicts the conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>sion expressed in the preceding paragraph. Wade v. Hunter involved court martial proceedings initiated at the front during the invasion of Germany during the Second World War. There the Court, at pages 691-692 of 336 U.S., at pages 838-839 of 69 S.Ct., found \u201cextraordinary reasons\u201d justifying adjournment of the first trial. The circumstances of the Wade ease would appear to objectively preclude any possibility that the adjournment ordered there resulted from a fear that the trier of fact would decide against the prosecution. Similarly, the abuse was objectively impossible under the facts in Lovato. There the identical jury which had been discharged so that the defendant could be arraigned prior to trial was reimpaneled to hear the case after the defendant\u2019s arraignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">The references throughout this opinion to \u201cmisconduct\u201d on the part of the Assistant United States Attorney should not be taken as indicating that, on this point, I am in accord with the District Judge and, with him, believe that the conduct of the Assistant United States Attorney was improper. I agree with my colleagues that the Assistant United States Attorney attempted conscientiously to present his case in a manner consistent with the rulings of the district judge. However, the significant fact is the district judge\u2019s belief. This erroneous belief deprived appellant of his right to take his case to the jury as the jury was then constituted. It is implicit in the former jeopardy clause that, as in criminal proceedings generally, the injurious consequences of erroneous rulings by the trial judge have to be borne by the prosecution rather than by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Furthermore, although we reach contrary conclusions, I agree with my colleagues that the correct disposition of the issue before us does not depend upon whether the district judge was acting to protect the defendant or whether he was acting to punish imagined disobedience. If the former, I maintain that the district judge must give the defendant the right to decide whether his interest will be better protected by having a new trial or by proceeding with the present one. The defendant here was denied that choice; his retrial should not be permitted. If the latter, I think it equally clear that the maintenance of a court\u2019s authority and of a trial judge\u2019s control of a trial cannot be had at the expense of a defendant's constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">I conclude that a district judge, acting <em>sua sponte, </em>does not have power to order a mistrial because of trial misconduct by the prosecuting attorney without giving rise to a sustainable plea of former jeopardy should retrial be attempted. Thus it becomes necessary to consider whether this appellant in some manner may be said to have consented to the mistrial order.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">Although I find the court\u2019s opinion unclear on this point, it may be that my colleagues imply consent from two actions by appellant during the trial. My colleagues mention the fact that appellant made objections which might have led to the mistrial order, and they also mention that he did not protest the order itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">As to the first ground, objections to testimony cannot be said to constitute consent to a subsequent mistrial order, for objections to testimony obviously assume that the trial is to continue. Moreover, as a matter of policy, I oppose a rule that would inhibit defense counsel from making objections during a trial lest, by objecting, counsel be found to have consented, in advance, to a mistrial order. Finally, I think the part the defendant\u2019s objections played in leading to the mistrial order in the present case has been overemphasized in the court\u2019s opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>As to the contention that consent may be implied from appellant\u2019s failure to object to the mistrial order, similar contentions were made and rejected in Himmelfarb v. United States, 9 Cir., 1949, 175 F.2d 924, 931-932, certiorari denied 338 U.S. 860, 70 S.Ct. 103, 94 L.Ed. 527; Ex parte Glenn, C.C.N.D.W.Va.1901, 111 F. 257, 259, reversed on other grounds 189 U.S. 506, 23 S.Ct. 851, 47 L.Ed. 921; United States v. Watson, D.C.S.D.N.Y. 1868, 28 Fed.Cas. page 499, No. 16,651. Under different circumstances than here present one court may have implied consent from a failure to object to a mistrial order. In Scott v. United States, 1952, 91 U.S.App.D.C. 232, 202 F.2d 354, certiorari denied 344 U.S. 879, 881, 73 S.Ct. 176, 97 L.Ed. 681, during the absence of the jury but in the presence of the defendant and his attorney, the trial judge stated he had decided to declare a mistrial. The jury was then called back into the courtroom and the order announced. During this time no objection was made. In the present case, however, the possibility of a mistrial had not been suggested until almost immediately before the district judge angrily ordered a juror discharged. The suddenness and vehemence of the order renders it highly unrealistic for us to imply consent here from appellant\u2019s failure to protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">I would reverse with directions to dismiss the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">On Petition of Appellant for Rehearing.</p>\n<author id=\"b100-6\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">On the merits of this appeal we find nothing to add to the discussions already had. Appellant, however, objects to the procedure <em>in banc </em>followed here and claims a right of oral argument. This is a point we should discuss, since counsel generally should be apprised of our procedure so far as we have developed it. There is of course nothing secret as to our processes of advancing a case to the point of adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">We have recently adopted our Rule 25(b) dealing with petitions for rehearing. This reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-11\">\u201c(b) <em>Disposition. </em>Any petition for rehearing shall be addressed to the court as constituted in the original hearing. It shall be disposed of by the court as so constituted unless a majority of said court or any active judge of this court, either from a suggestion by petitioner or <em>sua sponte, </em>shall be of the opinion that the case should be reheard in banc, in which event the Chief Judge shall cause that issue to be determined by the active judges of this court. Rehearing, whether by the court as constituted in the original hearing or in banc, shall be without oral argument and upon the papers then before the court, unless otherwise ordered.\u201d (Eff. April 25, 1960.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-12\">But additionally the court reserves the right, as the statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 46(c), provides, to proceed <em>in banc </em>whenever a majority of the active judges think such course in the interest of justice and so vote. This necessarily involves the exercise of discretion in each particular case and we have kept formal rules to a minimum. So when the procedure <em>in banc </em>has been voted, we have proceeded to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>cisi\u00f3n on only the original papers, Mc-Weeney v. New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co., 2 Cir., 282 F.2d 34; Sperry Rand Corp. v. Bell Telephone Laboratories, 2 Cir., 272 F.2d 29; Mueller v. Rayon Consultants, 2 Cir., 271 F.2d 591; Reardon v.

Thus we have no set rule in this regard, but are guided by what we conclude are the needs of a particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\"> These various cases presented all the questions here adverted to, including the supersession of retired or visiting judges by a court comprised of only the active judges. As appears above, the Supreme Court passed upon many of the cases in their substantive aspects, but without raising any question as to the procedure. Petitioner has no absolute right to oral argument; where, as here appeared, the researches of the court and its staff had proceeded beyond that disclosed in the briefs of counsel, further briefs and oral argument would have been a barren formalism without advantage to the court and counsel and a waste of time for all concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Petition denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-13\">.

In a non-jury ease it is stated that jeopardy attaches once the defendant has pleaded and the court has begun to hear evidence. Clawans v.

My colleagues refer to the defense\u2019s \u201ccontinuous formal objections.\u201d This is misleading. At the morning session only did the defense interpose frequent objections. The first government witness, the shipper\u2019s traffic manager, was then testifying. Primarily these objections were directed to the admissibility of certain bills of lading. The district judge consistently overruled the defense, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>the frequency of the objections was caused in part from the district judge\u2019s admonition to the defense to preserve this point. The district judge did not display notable impatience with the conduct of the Assistant United States Attorney or rule favorably to the defense until the abbreviated testimony of the third and fourth government witnesses, the two FBI agents, who testified in the afternoon. The district judge\u2019s displeasure with the trial conduct of the Assistant United States Attorney during their examination, a displeasure that I join my colleagues in being unable to account for, was not instigated by defense counsel, \u25a0whose role during this portion of the trial was entirely passive. The trial record discloses that neither counsel anticipated the course so suddenly taken and that the withdrawal of the juror must have been as much of a surprise to defense counsel as it was to the Assistant United States Attorney.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
