Forno, William Flynn, Internal Revenue agent, and Leslie Jacobs, special agent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\">\u201cAnd that during the period they were present the following questions, among others, were asked of this defendant, to which he gave the following replies (under oath):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-9\">\u201cQ. Have you ever been engaged in the following types of business or activities: * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-10\">\u201cQ. How about prostitution or house of ill repute ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-11\">\u201cA. Never.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-12\">\u201cQ. $3,000 taken from a Friday to a Monday morning from prostitution. Did you share in that ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-14\">\u201cA. No, I never shared in any kind of money that was derived from prostitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-15\">Exhibit 1-B, containing the above questions and answers, was introduced and admitted in evidence. No contention is made that 1-B is not a correct extract taken from sworn statement of Cooper in the office of the Intelligence Division, Internal Revenue Service, 417 South Hill Street, Los Angeles, California, March 27, 1956.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-17\">Witnesses Jacobs and Flynn identified themselves as the Internal Revenue Agents who interviewed defendant Cooper on March 27, 1956. Mr. Jacobs testified that the purpose of the conference was, \u201cIt was an inquiry to determine Mr. Cooper\u2019s tax liability.\u201d And Mr. Flynn stated, \u201cIt was in connection with the audit made on Mr. Cooper\u2019s income tax.\u201d It is apparent from the testimony of Mr. Jacobs and Mr. Flynn that the questions and answers set forth in Exhibit 1-B were propounded to and given by the defendant in a matter within the jurisdiction of a department of the United States, namely, the Treasury Department, Internal Revenue Service, at and during the conference of March 27, 1956. Brandow v. United States, 9 Cir., 268 F.2d 559, 564; Cohen v. United States, 9 Cir., 201 F.2d 386, 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-18\">That the answers or statements given by the defendant Cooper at the conference of March 27, 1956, were false is supported by the testimony of the five female witnesses. The jury could fairly infer from the evidence that such false statements were fraudulent and were given for the purpose of defrauding the Government of revenue to which it was entitled. It is apparent from the record that the jury\u2019s verdict is based upon substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-19\">Defendant complains of the denial by the District Court of his motions for dismissal of the indictment, for discovery and inspection of certain affidavits, and for a bill of particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-20\">Defendant contends that the indictment is defective, and that the Court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment. In United States v. Silver, 2 Cir., 235 F.2d 375, the indictment, under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1001, like that under consideration here, followed the language of the statute and was held to be fully adequate to inform the defendant of the essential facts constituting the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Considering indictments in the language of the statute, the Supreme Court in United States v. Debrow, 346 U.S. 374, 377, 74 S.Ct. 113, 115, 98 L.Ed. 92, held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\">\u201cThe charges of the indictments followed substantially the wording of the statute, which embodies all the elements of the crime, and such charges clearly informed the defendants of that with which they were accused, so as to enable them to prepare their defense and to plead the judgment in bar of any further prosecutions for the same offense. It is inconceivable to us how the defendants could possibly be misled as to the offense with which they stood charged. The sufficiency of the indictment is not a question of whether it could have been more definite and certain. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The motion to dismiss the indictment was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The motion for discovery and inspection and the motion for a bill of particulars each seek access to and have photostats made of three affidavits taken March 27, 1956, by an agent of the Internal Revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Paragraph I of the motion for discovery and inspection is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-9\">\u201cYour petitioner, Bruce Cooper, hereby asks this Court to require the Attorney for the United States of America for the Southern District of California, Laughlin E. Waters, to allow your petitioner, Bruce Cooper, to have photostats made of the three affidavits in the United States Attorney\u2019s possession. These affidavits were taken March 27, 1956 by one Harry Lockman of the Internal Revenue Department of the United States Government; said affidavits purportedly stating that money was given to your petitioner for purposes of prostitution during the period, 1951 through 1954.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">Paragraph III of said motion for discovery and inspection reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-11\">\u201cYour petitioner respectfully moves under Rule 16 of the Federal Code of Criminal Procedure that this Honorable Court compel the United States Attorney to allow these affidavits to be photostated at a time and place set out by this Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-12\">\u201cRule 16 Discovery and Inspection</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-13\">\u201c \u2018Under Motion of a defendant any time after the filing of the indictment or information, the court may order the attorney for the government to permit the defendant to inspect and copy or photograph designated books, papers, documentary or tangible objects \u2014 -upon a showing that the items sought may be material to the preparation of his defense and that the request is reasonable.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-14\">In the motion for a bill of particulars, Paragraph III is as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-15\">\u201cYour petitioner, Bruce Cooper, hereby asks this Court to require the Attorney for the United States of America for the Southern District of California, Laughlin E. Waters, to allow your petitioner, Bruce Cooper, to have photostats made of the three affidavits in the United States Attorney\u2019s possession. These affidavits were taken March 27, 1956 by one Harry Lockman of the Internal Revenue Department of the United States Government; said affidavits purportedly stating that money was given to your petitioner for purposes of prostitution during the period 1951 through 1954.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-16\">The motion for discovery and inspection was heard and denied by Judge Tolin and Judge Harrison heard and denied the motion for a bill of particulars. Subsequently, and just prior to the beginning of the trial, Judge Hall, the trial Judge, informed counsel for the defendant that if any of the persons who made the three affidavits were called as witnesses, he would require counsel for the Government to deliver the affidavit or affidavits to defendant\u2019s counsel. No contention seems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>to have been made that 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3500(b) was not complied with by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">The motion for discovery and inspection on its face shows that counsel for the defendant invoked Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. It will be noted that Rule 16 was not correctly quoted in Paragraph III of the motion. Rule 16 is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">\u201cUpon motion of a defendant at any time after the filing of the indictment or information, the court-may order the attorney for the government to permit the defendant to inspect and copy or photograph designated books, papers, documents or tangible objects, <em>obtained from or belonging to the defendant or obtained from others by seizure or by [process, </em>upon a showing that the items sought may be material to the preparation of his defense and that the request is reasonable. * * * \u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Obviously, Rule 16 has no application here as no contention seems to have been made that the affidavits were obtained from or belonged to the defendant, or obtained from others by seizure or by process.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The motion for discovery and inspection was correctly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">The motion for a bill of particulars is apparently an attempt to circumvent the ruling of Judge Tolin in his denial of a motion for discovery and inspection. As above noted, each of these motions sought the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">Rule 7(f), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.A., should not be invoked to bring about a result prohibited in effect by Rule 16, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C. A.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-10\">\u201cA bill of particulars should be granted where it is thought necessary (1) to protect the defendant against a second prosecution for the same offense, or (2) to enable the defendant to adequately prepare his defense and avoid surprise at the trial. * * * It is apparent that the offense charged is sufficiently defined to protect appellant from double jeopardy.\u201d Remmer v. United States, 9 Cir., 205 F.2d 277, 281.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-12\">The bill of particulars here does not ask that the charge be particularized. All that is asked here is disclosure of evidence. Defendant requests that three affidavits taken March 27, 1956, by one Harry Lockman of the Internal Revenue, be made available to defendant for purposes of having photostats made. As there is no request for the names of those who made the affidavits, it is fair to imply that the defendant knew who made them and if he did not know the names of the witnesses, the Government would not be required to provide them. In United States v. Bryson, 16 F.R.D. 431, 436, District Judge Murphy, in the Northern District of California, considering an indictment under 18 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1001, held that it is not the function of bill of particulars to force Government to spread its entire case before accused and order requiring Government to state in bill of particulars overt acts upon which indictment is based would be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-13\">The motion for a bill of particulars is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court and the trial court\u2019s ruling thereon should not be disturbed in the absence of an abuse of that discretion. Nye &amp; Nissen v. United States, 9 Cir., 168 F.2d 846, 851; Schino v. United States, 9 Cir., 209 F.2d 67, 69; Kobey v. United States, 9 Cir., 208 F.2d 583, 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-14\">The defendant was not prejudiced and Judge Harrison rightly denied his motion for a bill of particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-15\">Defendant claims error by the Court in permitting defendant\u2019s former wife, Patricia Bulayunjan, to testify against him. Outside of the presence of the jury, counsel objected as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>\u201cMr. Strong: This woman was married to Mr. Cooper from 1946 to 1958 and cannot testify against him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">In the course of the colloquy which followed between Court and Counsel, Exhibit 6, a certified copy of a judgment of annulment entered in the Superior Court of the State of California, in and for the County of Los Angeles, on the 18th day of January, 1957, was marked for identification and shown to the Court. Following that counsel for the defendant urged that the witness could not testify as to what happened in 1951, 1952, and 1953. After admitting Exhibit 6 in evidence, the trial Judge advised the witness as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">\u201cThis is a certified copy of a judgment of annulment, which is dated the 18th of January, 1957, in the Superior Court of the State of California in and for the County of Los Angeles and which was filed on January 18, 1957, and entered January 22, 1957. * * *, I will state to the witness, the question has been raised by counsel for Mr. Cooper as to whether or not you can testify concerning any act dr conduct between both of you during the period from the date of the marriage ceremony on December 1st, 1945, until the annulment. The effective date of the annulment was January 22, 1957. * * * \u2014 that you may testify concerning any conduct of Mr. Cooper\u2019s during the period that you were married to him; you may testify concerning any statement he made to you while other people were present; but you may not testify concerning any statements or concerning matters told you when the two of you were alone. Do you understand ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">There was no contention made at the trial by the defendant that the marriage relation, if it ever existed, existed after January 22, 1957. The language of counsel in urging his objections to the calling of the witness, Patricia Bulayunjan, recognized that the marriage had terminated and no objection was made to the introduction of Exhibit 6 in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">From an examination of the record, it is apparent that the witness, Patricia Bulayunjan, did not testify as to any confidential marital communications. She disclosed no part of any conversation or communication occurring between her and defendant while alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">Regardless of whether the marriage was by the decree of annulment rendered void from its inception or whether the decree operated only from the date of entry, we have a state of facts similar to those dealt with by Chief Justice Warren in Pereira v. United States, 347 U.S. 1, 6, 74 S.Ct. 358, 361, 98 L.Ed. 435 :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atiz\">\u201cThe petitioners challenge the admissibility of Mrs. Joyce\u2019s testimony as being based on confidential communications between Mrs. Joyce and Pereira during the marriage. Petitioners do not now contend that Mrs. Joyce was not a competent witness against her ex-husband. They concede that the divorce removed any bar of incompetency. That is the generally accepted rule. Wig-more, Evidence, \u00a7 2237; 58 Am. Jur., Witnesses, \u00a7 204. Petitioners rely on the proposition that while divorce removes the bar of incompetency, it does not terminate the privilege ' for confidential marital communications. Wigmore, Evidence, \u00a7 2341(2); 58 Am.Jur., Witnesses, \u00a7 379. This is a correct statement of the rule, but it is inapplicable to bar the communications involved in this case, since under the facts of the case, it cannot be said that these communications were confidential. Although marital communications are presumed to be confidential, that presumption may be overcome by proof of facts showing that they were not intended to be private. Blau v. United States, 340 U.S. 332 [71 S.Ct. 301, 95 L.Ed. 306]; Wolfle v. United States, 291 U.S. 7 [54 S.Ct. 279, 78 L.Ed. 617]. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>The presence of a third party negatives the presumption of privacy. Wigmore, Evidence, \u00a7 2336. So too, the intention that the information conveyed be transmitted to a third person. Id., \u00a7 2336. The privilege, generally, extends only to utterances, and not to acts. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The testimony of Patricia Bulayunjan was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">In the process of the selection of the jury, the Judge informed the venire, among other matters, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\">\u201cAs noted in the indictment, the charge is that the defendant made a false statement, in that he had never received any money from prostitution, * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">And the jurors were instructed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Apj\">\u201cThe gist of the offense is that the statements to the effect that he never received or shared in money derived from prostitution were false as to his source of income. You cannot convict the defendant merely because he engaged in the business of, or activities connected with, prostitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">\u201cThere thus remains for your determination two elements: Was the statement false, that is, did the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt receive substantial income during the tax years 1951, 1952, 1953, and 1954 which was derived from prostitution. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-9\"> The jury was not misled and the instruction was an accurate and correct statement. Furthermore, defendant is in no position to assign error as to any portion of the charge as failed to avail himself of the privilege given by Rule 30, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.A., of objecting to the instructions given as a whole or to any individual instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">Defendant claims error \u201c * * * in admitting evidence of ownership of houses of prostitution (Rep.Tr. 258-262) on the theory of \u2018prior similar acts\u2019 (Rep.Tr. 260).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-12\">The indictment charged and Exhibit 1-B tended to show that the defendant stated that he had never shared in any kind of money that was derived from prostitution. It was brought out on cross-examination by defendant\u2019s counsel that the witness, Patricia Bulayunjan, first met the defendant in February of 1945 (Rep.Tr. 211); that she had engaged in prostitution px-ior to meeting the defendant and that she wox-ked in Delano, California, as a prostitute after meeting him. (Rep.Tr. 212) Then followed cross-examination showing that after meeting defendant she had worked, obviously, as a prostitute, at various other locations. (Rep.Tr. 212, 213) She testified she first went to work in San Francisco, California, in 1945. Counsel for the Government, in opening his re-direct examination (Rep.Tr. 258), propounded the question: \u201cYou mentioned on cross-examination a number of addx-esses.\u201d Then followed a mention of a number of addresses given by the witness on her cross-examination (Rep.Tr. 213); then the question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-13\">\u201cQ. Will you go into more detail about those places \u2014 what were they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-14\">\u201cA. Well, they were all existing as houses of prostitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-15\">\u201cQ. Do you know who owned those ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-16\">\u201cA. Bruce Cooper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-17\">\u201cThe Court: Do you mean he owned the real estate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-18\">\u201cThe Witness: He owned the place, the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-19\">\u201cQ. By Mx*. Osborne: What</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-20\">was his position in the house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-21\">\u201cMr. Forno: Objected to, irrelevant and immaterial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-22\">\u201cThe Court: Objection overruled.\u201d (Rep.Tr. 259)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-23\">It will be noted that the witness\u2019 testimony as to Cooper\u2019s ownership was received without objection. The above noted objection came after the testimony as to ownership was given. The first mention of \u201cother offenses\u201d appears in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>the statement by the Court (Rep.Tr. 260) after the testimony of ownership of houses of prostitution had been received without objection upon the ground that such testimony constituted evidence of other and prior offenses, or without objection on any other ground. Defendant complains that such testimony was highly prejudicial. While this testimony of ownership of houses of prostitution was not complimentary, it tended to refute defendant\u2019s statement that he had never shared in any kind of money that was derived from prostitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Defendant also complains that the Court erred in denying motions for continuance before the trial and after the Government rested. He argues that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">\u201cManifestly, in view of the insufficiency of the indictment, appellant could not prepare to defend against undisclosed accusations of prostitutes until he learned who, when, where, it was claimed he was paid, and in what amount. This information did not come up until the trial was under way.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Defendant was not hurried into trial. The indictment was returned November 19, 1958, and the trial began March 3, 1959. The indictment clearly informed the defendant of that with which he was charged and the Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing continuances. Elkins v. United States, 9 Cir., 266 F.2d 588, 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">There is no merit to the contention that the prosecutor engaged in prejudicial misconduct. Nor is there merit to the contention that the answer in Exhibit 1-B, \u201cNo, I never shared in any kind of money that was derived from prostitution,\u201d is limited or restricted by the question, namely, \u201c$3,000 taken in from Friday to a Monday morning from prostitution. Did you share in that?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">The evidence being sufficient to sustain the verdict of the jury and finding no error, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b577-14\">. \u00a7 1001.
