Then on April 1, 1960, the district court entered an \u201cOrder Denying Motion for New Trial and Amending Findings.\u201d These new findings with ac-companying conclusions of law reach the same end as the previous findings but are \u25a0entirely self-sufficient and obviously intended to replace in toto the findings of March 1. The two sets of findings generally overlap but have some variance. The amended findings (and conclusions) \u25a0of April 1 conclude with \u201cLet judgment be entered accordingly.\u201d Unlike the -events of March 1, no judgment was ever '\u201centered accordingly.\u201d Indeed, the district court docket on the case for April 1 shows only: \u201cFiled order denying motion for new trial and amended findings and \u2022conclusions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Obviously, on the record something remained to be done before the district \u25a0court had completed the finality of its process of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">We cannot construe the order of April 1 as trying to put the new findings back in harness with the old judgment of March 1, something that is an invitation \u2022always to a first class accident. We believe the second set of findings and con\u25a0clusions, together with the concluding: \u201cLet judgment be entered accordingly,\u201d vitiated the first judgment. The correct procedure, when entering new findings, normally is to enter a new judgment. The trial court was on the correct tack. It didn\u2019t go far enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">We find prematurity here, but not of the character envisioned by appellee in her motion to dismiss the appeal, wherein she asserts that appellants lost their right to appeal by filing their notice of appeal too soon. Accordingly her motion is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
