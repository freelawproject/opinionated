The appellees moved for, and the District Court granted, summary judgment, and the complaint was dismissed. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-22\">Before the District Court were certified copies of the records of the Department of the Army and of the Civil Service Commission. The appellant, as of July 15, 1957, having received a temporary appointment such as is authorized by 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.302 (Supp.1960), came within 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.107(a) (Supp.1960), which provides for appointments \u201csubject to investigation * * * to establish the appointee\u2019s qualifications and suitability for employment in the competitive service.\u201d Less than six months later, as of December 10, 1957, appellant was advised that the appointing authority proposed to effectuate appellant\u2019s removal on December 20, 1957. In addition, specific details were supplied from which the appellant was put on notice as to the basis for the contemplated separation from service. He was advised of his right to answer the notice of the proposed adverse action \u201cpersonally, and in writing, and to submit any and all evidence you may desire.\u201d Under date of December 11, 1957, appellant filed a sworn answer, after which, by letter dated December 20, 1957, he was further notified that careful consideration had been given to the charges and to appellant\u2019s reply, notwithstanding which his removal was to be effectuated as of December 20, 1957. He was advised of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>right to appeal \u201cthrough the grievance procedure outlined in Civilian Personnel Regulations E-2.\u201d Appellant contends that he was not given a \u201chearing\u201d under that section, but none is required, as it is provided only that a hearing \u201cmay be held at the commanding officer\u2019s discretion.\u201d Even so, appellant presented an oral statement before the Commanding Officer and the Civilian Personnel Officer of the Army Map Service, and was thereupon given an opportunity further to present in writing, subject to review, such additional explanation as appellant might choose to submit.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">Appellant accordingly submitted a lengthy memorandum setting forth his position in its best light; he filed three character affidavits and a statement from his psychiatrist. Some weeks later appellant was informed that after careful review of all the proceedings and the evidence available, the December 20, 1957 notice of separation \u201cwas considered justifiable to better promote the efficiency of the Federal service and no action will be taken to reinstate you to your former position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">5 C.F.R. \u00a7 9.104 (Supp.1960) provides that \u201cAn employee serving under a temporary appointment may be separated at any time upon notice in writing from the appointing officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">We are satisfied that the latter accorded to the appellant all procedural prerogatives required to be extended in the case of temporary appointees, and that valid regulations of the Civil Service Commission authorized appellant\u2019s separation from the service. Hargett v. Summerfield, 100 U.S.App.D.C. 85, 243 F.2d 29, certiorari denied 1957, 353 U.S. 970, 77 S.Ct. 1060, 1 L.Ed.2d 1137; cf. Kohl-berg v. Gray, 1953, 93 U.S.App.D.C. 97, 207 F.2d 35, certiorari denied 1954, 346 U.S. 937, 74 S.Ct. 377, 98 L.Ed. 425; Jason v. Summerfield, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 197, 201, 214 F.2d 273, 277, certiorari denied 1954, 348 U.S. 840, 75 S.Ct 48, 99 L.Ed. 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">Our decision on this aspect of the ease makes it unnecessary for us to consider appellant\u2019s contentions with reference to the conclusions reached by the Civil Service Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">The order of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
