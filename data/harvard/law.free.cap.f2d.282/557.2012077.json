It is largely a holding company. For a considerable time prior to September 1957 the affairs of Swan-Finch were controlled by one Lowell M. Birrell. About September 1957 Birrell fled the country and is currently resisting extradition from Brazil. On January 2, 1958 Swan-Finch filed a petition in the Southern District of New York seeking reorganization pursuant to Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, Section 101 et seq., 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 501 et seq. The petition was approved, and two trustees were appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-19\">Due to Birrell\u2019s manipulations the affairs of Swan-Finch were in great confusion. One of the assets claimed by the Swan-Finch trustees was the entire issued and outstanding stock of Keta Gas and Oil Company, a Pennsylvania corporation. This stock had been acquired by Swan-Finch on September 27, 1955. On December 31, 1956, the Keta stock was purportedly transferred to Doeskin Products, Inc., a corporation at that time also controlled by Birrell. The subsequent controversy between Swan-Finch and Doeskin over the control of Keta was eventually resolved by the Second Circuit in favor of Swan-Finch in an opinion filed August 24, 1959, Pettit v. Doeskin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Products, Inc., 2 Cir., 1959, 270 F.2d 95, certiorari denied, 362 U.S. 910, 80 S.Ct. 660, 4 L.Ed.2d 618. However, prior to this decision, on July 16, 1958, while Keta was still under the control of Doeskin, Keta filed, in the Western District of Pennsylvania, a petition for an arrangement under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act, Section 301 et seq., 11 U.S.C. A. \u00a7 701 et seq. That petition was approved, Keta was continued in possession, and on March 3, 1959 appellant was appointed Keta\u2019s receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">On November 6, 1959 the two trustees of Swan-Finch, the adjudicated owner of all the corporate stock of Keta, filed a petition on Keta\u2019s behalf in the Southern District of New York seeking Chapter X reorganization. On November 9 Judge Ryan provisionally approved the petition, and, as Keta is a subsidiary of Swan-Finch, hearings on this petition were consolidated with the Swan-Finch proceeding. On November 13 Judge Ryan denied appellant receiver\u2019s motion to dismiss Keta\u2019s Chapter X petition. On January 26, 1960 Judge Palmieri designated the two Swan-Finch trustees to be also trustees of Keta, and appointed a third trustee to serve as a trustee of both Swan-Finch and Keta, this new trustee being specifically charged with the duty to safeguard Keta\u2019s position in the consolidated Chapter X proceeding. On March 9, 1960 Judge Palmieri filed an opinion and order constituting, final approval of Keta\u2019s Chapter X petition (Section 144 of the Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 544).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Appellant first contends that because a Chapter XI proceeding was pending in the Western District of Pennsylvania the court below should have dismissed Keta\u2019s Chapter X petition without considering its merits. Appellant\u2019s argument relates to venue. He maintains that Keta\u2019s petition in the Southern District of New York does not satisfy the venue requirements of Chapter X unless it qualifies as \u201can original petition\u201d under Section 129, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 529. He then argues that Section 129 must be read in conjunction with Section 128 which also only applies to \u201can original petition,\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the term \u201can original petition\u201d has the same meaning in both sections, and that in Section 128 the term is defined as a petition filed at a time when \u201cno bankruptcy proceeding is pending.\u201d Then, as the final step in this argument, appellant takes the position that the term \u201cbankruptcy proceeding\u201d in Section 128 refers to any proceeding initiated under any provision of the Bankruptcy Act, Title 11 of the U. S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">In support of this argument appellant relies heavily upon the Seventh Circuit\u2019s holding in Matter of National Aircraft Corporation (Duggan v. Sansberry), 7 Cir., 1945, 149 F.2d 548. The facts there, though similar, are not identical with the facts in the present case. On December 27, 1943 Christopher Engineering Company filed a petition for Chapter X reorganization in the Eastern District of Missouri. On January 21, 1944 creditors of National Aircraft Corporation filed in the Southern District of Indiana an involuntary petition in ordinary bankruptcy against that corporate debtor. On April 6, 1944 the referee in the Indiana proceeding ordered certain of National\u2019s properties sold on April 20. On April 19, upon allegations that National was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Christopher, a petition was filed on National\u2019s behalf in the Eastern District of Missouri seeking a Chapter X reorganization. Thereupon, on that same day, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>Missouri court issued an injunction enjoining the sale that had been ordered in the Indiana proceeding and that was to occur on the following day. The injunction order of the court in Missouri was ignored, the sale occurred as scheduled, and it was approved by the referee in the Indiana proceedings. This approval was affirmed by the district court in Indiana and then by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. One of the grounds for the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision was that a 'subsidiary which had been adjudicated a bankrupt in one district may not thereafter file a Chapter X petition in another district even though a Chapter X reorganization of its parent is pending in the latter district. The Seventh Circuit\u2019s reasoning in support of this ground is found at pages 551-552 of its opinion, supra, and is identical with appellant\u2019s argument as set forth in the preceding paragraph of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The decision of the Seventh Circuit in Duggan v. Sansberry was reversed by the Supreme Court, 1946, 327 U.S. 499, 66 S.Ct. 657, 90 L.Ed. 809. However, as we read the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, the reversal was on other grounds than the ground just mentioned. The Supreme Court held, we believe, that an injunction issued by the reorganization court pursuant to Section 113 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 513, may not be collaterally attacked, and that the existence of facts necessary to sustain the jurisdiction of the reorganization court is an issue to be litigated only in that court pursuant to the provisions of Sections 137 and 144 of the Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 537, 544. The language in the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion upon which we principally rely for this interpretation is set out in the footnote.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Our interpretation coincides with that of Collier (6 Collier, Bankruptcy (14th Ed.), \u00a7 3.12), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>and that of the Eighth Circuit, Magidson v. Duggan, 8 Cir., 1954, 212 F.2d 748, 757. Therefore we conclude that the question now before us was not considered by the Supreme Court in its decision reversing the Seventh Circuit in Duggan v. Sansberry.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">We agree with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s analysis of Section 129 in all particulars \u2014 save one. That single point of disagreement, however, is vital to the outcome of the present ease. We agree that Section 129 applies only to an \u201coriginal petition.\u201d We agree that the term \u201coriginal petition\u201d is defined by Section 128 to mean a petition filed on behalf of a corporation at that time not the subject of a pending \u201cbankruptcy proceeding.\u201d We disagree, however, with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s apparent conclusion \u2014 a conclusion that is clear dictum in view of the fact that the prior proceeding there involved was a proceeding in <em>ordinary </em>bankruptcy \u2014 that the term \u201cbankruptcy proceeding\u201d in Section 128 includes all Bankruptcy Act proceedings rather than merely proceedings in ordinary bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">Sections 126-133 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 526-533, are a unit constituting Sub-Chapter IV of Chapter X. Accordingly, as the Seventh Circuit recogni2;ed, these sections must be construed together. Section 127 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnE\">\u201cA petition may be filed in a pending bankruptcy proceeding either before or after the adjudication of a corporation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-13\">The use in this Section of the word \u201cadjudication\u201d (see Section 1(2), 11 U.S.C. A. \u00a7 1(2)) requires the conclusion that in Section 127, and hence in Sections 128 and 129 as well, the term \u201cbankruptcy proceeding\u201d refers only to a proceeding in ordinary bankruptcy, i. e., a proceeding under Chapters I-VII of the Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This careful use of the term \u201cbankruptcy proceeding\u201d occurs not only in Sub-Chapter IV of Chapter X but throughout Chapter X (see, e. g., Sections 112, 114, 121; respectively 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 512, 514, 521) and throughout Chapters XI, XII and XIII (see, e. g., Sections 312, 412, 612, 316, 416, 616; respectively 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 712, 812, 1012, 716, 816, 1016.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As Collier states, 6 Collier, Bankruptcy (14th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Ed.), \u00a7 1.10 at p. 245 (footnotes omitted) :</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">\u201cAs we have seen before, a Chapter X proceeding <em>is </em>a bankruptcy proceeding in the broad sense. But the Act itself, as a matter of technical terminology, does not use the words \u2018bankruptcy proceedings\u2019 or \u2018proceedings in bankruptcy\u2019 in that sense, but uses them rather to distinguish the ordinary bankruptcy proceeding under Chapters I-VII from the debt- or relief proceedings under other chapters of the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">And see also 8 Collier, Bankruptcy (14th Ed.), \u00a7 4.03 at pages 279-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Therefore, a Chapter XI arrangement is not a \u201cbankruptcy proceeding\u201d contemplated by Section 128; and so it follows that under Section 129 no objection may be raised on grounds of venue to Keta\u2019s petition in the Southern District of New York despite the existence of a prior Chapter XI proceeding in the Western District of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Appellant\u2019s second contention is that the court below erred in holding that Keta\u2019s Chapter X petition was filed in good faith.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under Section 141, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 541, this finding is essential to approval of a Chapter X petition, and the term \u201cgood faith\u201d is itself defined (at least partially) in Section 146, 11 U.S.C. A. \u00a7 546. At the outset two general principles seem clearly established. First, the burden is upon the petitioner to demonstrate that the petition has been filed in good faith. Marine Harbor Properties, Inc. v. Manufacturer\u2019s Trust Co., 1942, 317 U.S. 78, 84-85, 63 S.Ct. 93, 87 L.Ed. 64, rehearing denied, 317 U.S. 710, 63 S.Ct. 254, 87 L.Ed. 566. And, second, the district court\u2019s decision as to whether a given petition has been filed in good faith is a finding that will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous. Matter of Riddlesburg Mining Co., 3 Cir., 1955, 224 F.2d 834; Matter of Mt. Forest Fur Farms of America, Inc., 6 Cir., 1939, 103 F.2d 69, certiorari denied, Merritt v. Mt. Forest Fur Farms of America, 308 U.S. 583, 60 S.Ct. 105, 84 L.Ed. 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-13\">Appellant first argues that there has been no showing that adequate relief is unobtainable under Chapter XI. (Sections 130(7) and 146(2), 11 U.S.C. A. \u00a7\u00a7 530(7), 546(2).) Appellant, relying upon SEC v. U. S. Realty &amp; Improvement Co., 1940, 310 U.S. 434, 60 S.Ct. 1044, 84 L.Ed. 1293, maintains that Chapter X was designed to grant relief only for widely held corporations or corporations with complicated structures of secured debt. We disagree with appellant\u2019s interpretation of that case. Any doubts on this point have been dispelled by General Stores Corp. v. Shlensky, 1956, 350 U.S. 462, 465-468, 76 S.Ct. 516, 100 L.Ed. 550. There the Supreme Court held that it is not the size or capital structure of the debtor that determines whether Chapter XI relief is adequate, but rather this question is to be determined by the problems likely to be faced in the attempt to restore the debtor to health.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-15\">We hold that when the parent corporation is in manifest need of Chapter X relief that fact alone is sufficient to establish in most cases the inadequacy of Chapter XI proceedings for its wholly-owned subsidiary. Intervention by the Securities and Exchange Commission on behalf of the parent\u2019s security-holders (an intervention not available under Chapter XI) will be less effective if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>advice of the Commission as to the disposition of the parent\u2019s assets, e. g., its wholly-owned subsidiaries, cannot also be obtained. Again, the superior protection afforded the parent\u2019s creditors in a Chapter X proceeding will be partially dissipated if the management of the subsidiary is not subject to the same control. In addition, it is obvious that the consolidated proceedings will result in an expedient and economical administration.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See, generally, Duggan v. Sansberry, 1946, 327 U.S. 499, 510-511, 66 S. Ct. 657, 90 L.Ed. 809; SEC v. U. S. Realty &amp; Improvement Co., 1940, 310 U.S. 434, 448-454, 60 S.Ct. 1044, 84 L.Ed. 1293; Capitol Motor Courts v. LeBlanc Corp., 2 Cir., 1953, 201 F.2d 356, 358; certiorari denied, 345 U.S. 957, 73 S.Ct. 940, 97 L.Ed. 1378. Cf. Matter of Pittsburgh Rys. Co., 3 Cir., 1946, 155 F.2d 477, certiorari denied, Philadelphia Co. v. Guggenheim, 329 U.S. 731, 67 S.Ct. 89, 91 L.Ed. 632; Matter of Schafer\u2019s Bakeries, D.C.E.D.Mich.1955, 129 F. Supp. 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\"> Second, appellant argues that there has been no showing below that it is reasonable to expect that a plan of reorganization can be effected. Section 146 (3), 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 546(3). It is well settled that the petition need not contain a specific plan of reorganization. The petitioner need only demonstrate that there exists a reasonable possibility of successful reorganization. Matter of Castle Beach Apartments, Inc., 2 Cir., 1940, 113 F.2d 762; Matter of Julius Roehrs Co., 3 Cir., 1940, 115 F.2d 723; 6 Collier, Bankruptcy (14th Ed.), \u00a7 6.09, pp. 1779-1780. The finding of the court below that this possibility exists is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">Third, relying upon the fact that, as a consequence of Birrell\u2019s manipulations, Swan-Finch and Keta assert antagonistic claims to certain properties and also dispute an alleged loan from Keta to Swan-Finch, appellant argues that Keta\u2019s creditors will be adversely affected by the termination of Keta\u2019s Chapter XI proceeding in favor of a consolidated proceeding with the same persons serving as trustees of both Swan-Finch and Keta. Section 146(4), 11 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 546(4). We are of the opinion that Keta\u2019s creditors have been adequately protected by the appointment of a trustee charged with the specific responsibility of protecting Keta\u2019s interests. In support of this conclusion we note that no Keta creditor has joined in this appeal. In fact, the creditor alleging the largest claim against Keta has expressed approval of the three-trustee administration. Furthermore, the three creditors alleged to have the next three largest claims have offered no objection to the Chapter X petition. The facts do not support appellant\u2019s belief that Keta\u2019s creditors will be adversely affected. Cf. Matter of Diver; sey Hotel Corp., 7 Cir., 1948, 165 F.2d 655, 658; Matter of Loeb Apartments, 7 Cir., 1937, 89 F.2d 461, 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">Appellant\u2019s other contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">Affirmed. Costs to be paid by appellant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b607-10\">. Sections 128 and 129 read as follows: [128] \u201cIf no bankruptcy proceeding is pending, an original petition may be filed with the court in whose territorial jurisdiction the corporation has had its principal place of business or its principal assets for the preceding six months or for a longer portion of the preceding six months than in any other jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">[129] \u201cIf a corporation be a subsidiary, an original petition by or against it may be filed either as provided in section 528 of this title or in the court which has approved the petition by or against its parent corporation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b608-4\">. At pages 504-505 of 327 U.S., at page 659 of 66 S.Ct. the Court stated [footnotes omitted]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">\u201cRegardless of whether National\u2019s petition for reorganization in the Missouri proceedings was properly filed on April 19, the Indiana Court, on being notified that the petition had been filed and approved and that an injunction had issued, should have stayed immediately the sale of National\u2019s assets. Section 113, 11 U. S.C. \u00a7 513, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 513, provides with respect to reorganization proceedings : \u201cPrior to the approval of a petition, the judge may upon cause shown grant a temporary stay, until the petition is approved or dismissed, of a prior pending bankruptcy, mortgage foreclosure or equity receivership proceeding and of any act or other proceeding to enforce a lien against a debtor\u2019s property, and may upon cause'shown enjoin or stay until the petition is approved or dismissed the commencement or continuation \u00f3f a suit against a debtor.\u201d Bankr.Act \u00a7\u00a7 113, 141, 144, 148, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 513, 541, 544, 548. It was on the authority of this section, we may assume, that the injunction staying the sale of National\u2019s property was issued. As interpreted the section declares that when a petition for reorganization has been filed by a corporation, the judge may stay pending proceedings. It does not differentiate between petitions filed by parent corporations and petitions filed by subsidiaries, nor does it distinguish petitions which have been filed correctly from those which have been filed erroneously with the reorganization court. It thus applies to National, whose petition for reorganization had been filed and against which a bankruptcy proceeding was pending.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">At pages 510-511 of 327 U.S., at page 662 of 66 S.Ct. the Court summarized its holding as follows [footnotes omitted] :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">\u201cThe problem involves, of course, not the ordinary power of one court of general jurisdiction to question the jurisdiction of another court of general jurisdiction. The jurisdiction of both the bankruptcy forum and the reorganization forum is derived from and is limited by the Bankruptcy Act, enacted in accordance with the congressional power \u2018to establish * * * uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States.\u2019 Constitution, Article 1, \u00a7 8. It was within the power of Congress to provide that a bankruptcy court could not permit an attack, even on the usual grounds, to be made upon proceedings initiated in a . reorganization court. This power Congress exercised by permitting the reorganization court to stay, as it did, the bankruptcy proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-11\">\u201cThe exercise of this power, taken in relation to the facts at bar, was in pursuance of the congressional intention ordinarily to allow parent and subsidiary to be reorganized in a single proceeding, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>thereby effectuating its general policy that the entire administration of an estate should be centralized in a single reorganization court. If the reorganization forum lacked the power to stay the bankruptcy proceeding and thereby to prevent a collateral inquiry into its own jurisdiction, this policy of Congress would be frustrated; for instead of one court\u2019s having \u2018exclusive jurisdiction of the debt- or and its property, wherever located,\u2019 there would be two courts each with a claim to jurisdiction and each denying the other\u2019s jurisdiction. We may not construe the Bankruptcy Act as permitting such a state of affairs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">Footnote 5 at page 504 of 327 U.S., at page 659 of 66 S.Ct. of the opinion is significant for there the Court recognized that the Seventh Circuit had construed Sections 128 and 129 in reaching its decision approving the sale. That construction, the Supreme Court noted, was not unanimous, and the Supreme Court refused to choose between the conflicting constructions.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b609-8\">. In arguing to the contrary appellant relies upon the use of the word \u201cadjudged\u201d in Sections 236 and 376, 11 U.S. O.A. \u00a7\u00a7 636, 776, and the use of the phrase \u201corder of adjudication\u201d in Section 326, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 726. The argument fails. Under either Chapter X or Chapter XI whenever the peculiar form of debtor relief provided for by the chapter proves unavailing, recourse may be had to ordinary bankruptcy procedures. Hence the use in its various forms of the word \u201cadjudication.\u201d See 8 Collier, Bankruptcy (14th Ed.), \u00a7 4.03 at p. 280.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b609-15\">. This is clearly the import of Section 102, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 502, and the analogous sections in subsequent chapters. Section 102 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-17\">\u201cThe provisions of chapters 1-7, of this title shall, insofar as they are not inconsistent or in conflict with the provisions of this chapter, apply in proceedings under this chapter. * * * For the purposes of such application, provisions relating to \u2018bankrupts\u2019 shall be deemed to relate also to \u2018debtors,\u2019 and \u2018bankruptcy proceedings\u2019 or \u2018proceedings in bankruptcy\u2019 shall be deemed to include proceedings under this chapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-18\">When the phrase \u201cbankruptcy proceedings\u201d is used in Section 102, it refers to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>those instances where the phrase is used in Chapters I-VII.
