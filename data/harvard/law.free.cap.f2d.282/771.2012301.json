The bond was for the appearance of Thomas Simmons to answer an indictment charging violation of the narcotic laws. Simmons went to trial on July 13, 1959 before Judge Edelstein and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>a jury and two days later, when counsel was to sum up, Simmons failed to appear. A further adjournment was taken to the next day and, when Simmons again failed to appear, the trial proceeded and Simmons was found guilty. He was finally apprehended on August 5, 1959 and sentenced to ten years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Even though Simmons\u2019 capture came about through information furnished by the appellant, it seems clear to us that the entry of judgment for the full amount of the bond was well within the discretion of the district court. Smaldone v. United States, 10 Cir., 1954, 211 F.2d 161 and U. S. v. Dudley, 242 F.2d 656 (5 Cir.1957) are readily distinguishable on their facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
