He was given a four-year sentence. He filed a motion in the district court under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255, seeking to have the judgment and sentence vacated. In the motion the appellant states that he was not guilty of the offense. The appellant, in his motion, filed in propria personae, says that he \u201cwas discharged from the armed forces as a pyscho neurosis patient\u201d and that \u201cthe irresponsible acts held against him at his trial were acts beyond the control of petitioner which happen when his war scrambled brains failed to function like a normal person\u201d. The district court, without a hearing, entered an order denying the motion. From the order this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-20\">We think that the allegations of the motion, inartful though they be, are sufficient to set forth the contention that the appellant\u2019s mental condition was such that he could not and did not make intelligent waivers and plea. His statements of the prior determination of a mental illness takes the motion out of the category of frivolous claims and requires a hearing. Bishop v.
