If, as the result of such election, the district votes against the licensing of the sale of liquor, the state law supersedes the county ordinance, and one who subsequently sells intoxicating liquors within the limits of the district is properly prosecuted under the state law.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b336-10\">Id.\u2014Election Under Wyllie Act\u2014Announcement of Result of Election by Supervisors.\u2014Such an election held in the supervisorial district is not invalidated because the supervisors announced the result of the election and declared the district no license territory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>without waiting ninety days.

But since there was at the time of said election a valid ordiance, which has not since been formally repealed, prohibiting the sale or distribution of alcoholic liquors in Orange County, petitioner insists that the Wyllie Act did not operate upon the territory in question, and if guilty of anything at all she was a violator of the ordinance and that she was tried under the wrong statute\u2014one which had no force in the territory in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">It is undoubtedly true that there was and for a long time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>had been an ordinance prohibiting the sale of alcoholic liquors in Orange County when the election above mentioned was held. That ordinance had been declared valid by this court. <em>(Ex parte Young, </em>154 Cal. 319, [22 L. R. A. (N. S.) 330, 97 Pac. 822].) The election was held only in the fifth supervisorial district. The question then is this: Which of the laws \u2014the Wyllie Act or the ordinance\u2014is in force in the said district or are-both effectual therein?</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Petitioner insists that the holding of an election under the \u201cWyllie Law\u201d in a district which was already \u201cno license territory\u201d was a vain and idle act. With this contention we cannot agree. The board of supervisors could at pleasure repeal a mere ordinance; but when a supervisorial district is once declared \u201cno license territory\u201d after an election under the \u201cWyllie Act\u201d that condition may not be disturbed except by a vote of the people of the district. (Stats 1911, p. 602\u2014 sec. 11 of the Wyllie Act.) This alone would furnish a reason why the residents of a supervisorial district might demand an election under the \u201cWyllie Act\u201d in a portion of the county in which licenses were not then issued because of the prohibition of a county ordinance. Other reasons why the holding of such an election would not be an idle act are that under the \u201cWyllie Law\u201d an offender would be triable in a higher court, under a different procedure and subject to a different penalty than a violator of a mere ordinance would be. It is obvious, therefore, that the existence of a prohibitory ordinance is no bar to the holding of an election to determine whether or not the people of a certain district shall avail themselves of the advantages of the state law. It is equally obvious that the state law, when made applicable in such district is supreme. This matter was considered only a few months ago by this court in the <em>Matter of the Application of Ellsworth for a writ of habeas corpus, </em>165 Cal. 677, [133 Pac. 272.] In that case we were discussing the scope of the \u201cWyllie Act\u201d as operating in territory within a county having a general ordinance on the subject of liquor. Mr. Justice Henshaw, summing up his discussion of this matter, said: \u201cIt follows herefrom that the first supervisorial district which voted in favor of licensing the sale of liquors will be subject to the terms of such regulatory or prohibitory ordinance as the county of Sonoma may adopt; that the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>supervisorial district, which, voted against the licensing the sale of liquors, cannot be subjected to the terms of any regulatory license. But this fact, of course, does not render the ordinance void as to such other parts of the county as are subject to its operation.\u201d (See, also, <em>Ex parte Beck, </em>162 Cal. 701,711, [124 Pac. 543].)</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">It follows that the petitioner was not prosecuted under an inapplicable statute as she contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Petitioner insists that the election held in the district in which she was prosecuted was void because the supervisors announced the result of the election and declared said district no license territory without waiting ninety days. The declaration was made two days after the election. There is nothing in petitioner\u2019s contention in this behalf. Section 10 of the act provides that even a <em>failure </em>to make the prescribed entry declaring the district involved \u201cno license territory,\u201d will not affect the law in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The pleading is attacked on the ground that by the information the defendant is not mentioned as being without one of the excepted classes named in section 16 of the act\u2014pharmacists, manufacturers and the like. Even if we might pass upon the sufficiency of a complaint upon <em>hateas corpus </em>where an attempt is made in a pleading to charge an offense, we would find ample authority against petitioner\u2019s point. The excepted classes are not mentioned in the definition of the offense and it is therefore not necessary to enumerate them, nor to declare the defendant not a member of any one of them in drafting a complaint or information. The authorities almost without conflict declare that a complaint, indictment, or information need not allege that an accused comes within exceptions mentioned in the statute upon which the prosecution is founded. <em>(Ex parte Hornef, </em>154 Cal. 360, [97 Pac. 891]; <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>16 Cal. App. 793, [117 Pac. 947]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Priestley, </em>17 Cal. App. 176, [118 Pac. 965].)</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The writ is discharged and the petitioner remanded to custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Henshaw, J., Lorigan, J., Sloss, 'J., Shaw, J., and Angellotti, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
