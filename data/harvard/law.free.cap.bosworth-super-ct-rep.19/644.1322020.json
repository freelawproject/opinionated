The cause being put at issue, it was referred to Charles P. Kirkland, Esq., to hear and determine all the issues.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-6\">He found the facts as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-7\">1st. That in the month of May, 1854, the plaintiff was the owner of lot Ho. 143 Chambers street, in the city of Hew York, and the building thereon, and the defendant was the owner of the adjoining lot, Ho. 145, and the building thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-8\">2d. That these buildings were dwelling houses, and that the wall between them, standing partly on each lot, was a party wall, and had been used and occupied as such by the said parties and their predecessors, for upwards of forty years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-9\">3d. That the said party wall was, in said month of May, in a good and sound condition, and fully sufficient for the purposes for which it was erected, and for which it had been used up to that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-10\">4th. The said building of the plaintiff was in good repair and condition in the said month of May.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-11\">5th. That the said building of the defendant was then in a ruinous condition, and had been so since the taking down of the party wall on the westerly side of the defendant\u2019s lot, which wall was taken down by the owner of the lot on the westerly side of the defendant\u2019s one year previously, and the defendant had not repaired his building since the taking down of said party wall on his west side.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-12\">6th. That, by the progress of business and improvement in the city of Hew York, that part of Chambers street where these buildings were situated had then become a desirable location for the purposes of business, and that the said lot of the defendant could be used more advantageously and profitably for the purposes of business, than for a dwelling house; that in said month of May the defendant, for the purpose of erecting a large and valuable store on his said lot, took down and removed the said party wall.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-13\">7th. That said party wall was so taken down, and removed by the defendant, without any license, consent, or permission of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>8th. That in the month of February preceding, the defendant gave the plaintiff verbal notice of his intention to take down said wall; and, on the 26th of April preceding, gave him a written notice to the same effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-5\">9th. That the said party wall, after removal of defendant\u2019s building, and in the manner in which he was proceeding to erect his new building, would not have stood without being supported ; and the plaintiff took no steps towards supporting the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-6\">10th. That the defendant proceeded to erect a store on his said lot, with a sub-cellar, and laying the foundation sixteen or eighteen feet below the surface, and rebuilt said party wall of the thickness of sixteen inches; ten inches of the same being on his Own lot, and the remaining six inches on the plaintiff\u2019s lot, the original wall having been twelve inches thick, being six inches on the lot of each party.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-7\">11th. That, in taking down and rebuilding said party wall, the defendant did no more damage to plaintiff\u2019s building than would ordinarily arise from such an act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-8\">12th. That in taking down and rebuilding said wall, the defendant injured the plaintiff\u2019s building, and rendered it necessary to make repairs thereon, and rendered the same untenantable for one year, and caused the plaintiff the loss of the use and rent thereof for one year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-9\">13th. That the portion of the party wall standing on the defendant\u2019s lot being removed, the party wall would not have stood; and that the party wall standing upon the premises, when the defendant took down his building, would not have been of sufficient strength for the support of the new building erected by the defendant on his lot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-10\">14th. That the expense of the repairs thus rendered necessary to the plaintiff\u2019s building was $888.90, and that the plaintiff\u2019s loss of rent amounted to $1,300.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-11\">Conclusions of Law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-12\">1st. That the defendant had not the right, without the consent of the plaintiff, to take down or remove the party wall above mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>2d. That the defendant is liable to the plaintiff for the damages sustained by him, in consequence of such taking down .and removal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b655-5\">3d. That these damages are the expenses of repairs and loss of rent above stated, and that the plaintiff is entitled to recover those sums, with interest thereon, from the 1st of May, 1855.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b655-6\">Exceptions were duly taken sufficient to raise all the points taken by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b655-7\">Judgment having been duly entered, the present appeal was taken therefrom.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b655-8\"><em>W. </em>Hutchins, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b655-9\"><em>A. P. Man, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b652-15\"> This case was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, at its June Term, 1861.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b655-10\">By the Court\u2014Hoffman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AaC\">We are satisfied upon the evidence, with the conclusions of the Referee as to the character of the party wall, its sound condition and sufficiency for the purposes for which it was erected, and had been used; as also in regard to the ruinous condition of the defendant\u2019s building, and the inducements leading him to erect a new and profitable store upon his ground. The building of the plaintiff was also in good repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">The evidence is not enough to overrule the conclusion of the Referee, that the party wall was not removed with the license or consent of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">Then upon such a state of facts the case of <em>Eno v. Delvecchio, </em>(4 Duer, 53; 6 id., 17,) is decisive. The plaintiff was entitled to be indemnified to the full extent of the injury he had sustained. Here was a party wall, built partially on the ground of each owner, used as such for more than twenty years, and in a sound and serviceable condition. Neither party could remove it, or so deal with it as to render it an insufficient support for the building of the other, without his consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-13\">The remaining question is as to the amount of the damage. The amount allowed for the repairs is fully warranted by the evidence. And upon the whole, we do not see sufficient reason to change the conclusion of the Referee as to the loss of a year\u2019s rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-14\">The judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-15\">Affirmed accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
