And that such arrangement was consequently made in and by the said agreements of the 16th and 18th days of June, 1856, by and with the consent of all the said parties, and which arrangement was thought by the said parties, at the time, to be and was for the undoubted benefit of all interested.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-9\">And that the sum of $14,043.62, with interest to 8th June, 1859, after allowing all sums received by the plaintiff on account of the same, amounts to $14,982.45.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-10\">And the said Justice also decided, as conclusions of law\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-11\"><em>First. </em>That the defendant Storrs, as surviving partner of said late firm of Daniel Burgess &amp; Company, is personally liable to the plaintiff for said sum of $14,982.45.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number><em>Second. </em>That the said firm of Daniel Burgess &amp; Company was dissolved, as between Burgess and Storrs, on 29th April, 1856, and as between them Burgess then assumed and became individually liable to pay all the debts of the firm, and to protect said Storrs, his estate and representatives, from and against the same. And as between said Burgess and Storrs, Burgess then became, and was individually, the owner of all the property and effects of said firm, subject to the payment of said debts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-5\"><em>Third. </em>That the said agreements, dated 18th June, 1856, or any or either of them, were not in effect either separately or together, nor did they operate as to the defendants, or either of them, as a payment of the said amount of $14,043.62, and the interest thereon, or any part thereof, except to the extent of the amount of money since received by the plaintiff upon or under the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-6\"><em>Fourth. </em>That the plaintiff is not, by, under, or by reason of, the said agreements, dated 18th June, 1856, or any, or either of them, barred of or from, nor has he thereby lost or relinquished, his claim against said defendants, or either of them, or the estate of said Daniel Burgess, deceased, for the said sum of $14,043.62, with interest, or any part thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-7\"><em>Fifth. </em>That the plaintiff is entitled to judgment against the defendant, Richard A.

By and under the agreement of February 23d, 1856, the two contracts of Tower &amp; Walker with D. Burgess &amp; Company, and the stereotype plates of the books therein mentioned, were pledged to the plaintiff, to secure the payment of the money agreed to be loaned, and were put into his actual possession and under his complete control.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b614-10\">II. By the agreement of April 29th, 1856, the copartnership of D. Burgess &amp; Company was dissolved, and thereupon Burgess became the owner of all the property of the firm, and individually liable for all its debts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b614-11\">The <em>bona fides </em>of this transaction is not questioned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b614-12\">III. As Administrator of the estate of Burgess, Paine became possessed of, and entitled to represent, all the property of D. Burgess &amp; Company prior to the dissolution, and any interest therein which Storrs might by possibility have retained was transferred to him by the assignment dated June 6th, 1856.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b614-13\">IV. By the agreement made June 16th, 1856, between Walker &amp; Tower, and Paine, as Administrator, Walker &amp; Tower, for good consideration, assumed, and became primarily liable, as between them and Paine, and Burgess\u2019 estate, to pay the debt due Wright.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b614-14\">And thereupon the estate of Burgess, and Paine as Administrator, became sureties merely for the payment of such debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b614-15\">V. By the three agreements, dated June 18th, 1856, made between Tower &amp; Walker, Sanborn, Carter &amp; Bazin, and Wright, (the plaintiff,) Sanborn, Carter &amp; Bazin, for good consideration, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>assumed the payment of, and became primarily liable for, the debt which was due to Wright, the plaintiff, and were recognized by him as primarily liable to pay that debt. And the plaintiff agreed to receive payment thereof in the particular manner specified in the contract between them. And in consideration of such new agreement, Wright (the plaintiff) sold to Sanborn, Carter &amp; Bazin his interest in the contracts pledged and in the stereotype plates.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-5\">This transaction operated as, and effected, a payment of the debt of Burgess &amp; Company to the plaintiff, Wright, so far as the estate or the Administrator of Burgess, or Mr. Storrs, were liable therefor. <em>(The Herkimer Man. &amp; Hyd. Co. </em>v. <em>Small, </em>2 Hill, 127, [1841;] <em>S. C., </em>21 Wend., 273; <em>Case </em>v. <em>Boughton, </em>11 id., 106; <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Plumb, </em>9 id., 287; <em>Lansing </em>v. <em>Goelet, </em>in error, 9 Cow., 346.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-6\">VI. The plaintiff is also barred of any claim against Burgess\u2019 estate, because he has given time to Sanborn, Carter &amp; Bazin, the primary debtors, and has thereby released the estate of Burgess, which stood in the position of a surety. <em>(King </em>v. <em>Baldwin &amp; Fowler, </em>2 Johns. Ch. R., 554; <em>Pain </em>v. <em>Packard, </em>13 John. R., 174; <em>King </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>17 id., 384.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-7\">VII. The rule in respect to a surety is, that the principal contract cannot be varied without his consent, and this rule obtains even where the variance is, or appears to be, for his benefit. The surety has the right to say, <em>non in haec foedera veni.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-8\">VIII. In any event the plaintiff is bound, in the first instance, to exhaust his remedies against the pledged property, and also against Tower &amp; Walker, Sanborn, Carter &amp; Bazin, and upon Walker\u2019s guaranty, before he can come upon the estate of Burgess, or have an action against the administrator, and he can in that case only proceed for the balance or deficiency of his debt which he may not have thus realized. The judgment of the Special Term ought to be reversed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b615-9\"><em>E. S. Young, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-10\">I. The assets and property which belonged to the firm of Daniel Burgess &amp; Company, on the 29th April, 1856, and which afterwards came into the possession of the defendant Paine, Administrator, &amp;c., are assets of said late firm of Daniel Burgess &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Company, in the hands of said Administrator, and the creditors of said firm are entitled to priority of payment out of said assets, over any individual creditors of said Burgess. The firm being insolvent, the assets were converted into a trust fund for the payment of its debts. (3 Kent\u2019s Com., 64, &amp;c., 6th ed; <em>Nicholson </em>v. Leavitt, 4 Sand., 302, 306; <em>Dillon, </em>v. <em>Horn, </em>5 How. Pr. R., 35; <em>Burtus </em>v. <em>Tisdall, </em>4 Barb., 571-578, &amp;c.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-5\">1. The trust arises as soon as the insolvency exists. In this case, the firm being insolvent long prior to the agreement between Burgess and the defendant, Storrs, of 29fch April, they could not, by any arrangement as between themselves, divest the copartnership assets of its character of joint property, so as to deprive the joint creditors of their prior right to the joint funds for the payment of their debts. And further, no notice of dissolution was given; as to persons dealing with them, the firm continued to the time of the decease of Burgess. (Cases above cited; Coll. on Part., \u00a7\u00a7 889, 897, 898, &amp;c.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-6\">II. The arrangement made by the instruments of 16th and 18th June, 1856, for preventing the contracts, publishing rights, &amp;c., held by the plaintiff as collaterals, from becoming valueless, in nowise affects the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the assets of the firm, or the estate of Burgess. The condition of those collaterals was such, that it was requisite, for the protection of all parties interested in them, that something should be done to prevent them from depreciating and becoming valueless. The arrangement was with the concurrence of all parties interested in them, and was thought the best that could be made for all the parties concerned. The plaintiff\u2019s assenting to an arrangement necessary for preserving the value of the collaterals held by him, cannot be held to prejudice his right to proceed against his debtors, or the estate in their hands, for the amount due him. (Story on Bailments, \u00a7 329.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-7\">The arrangement made was highly beneficial to the estate of Burgess &amp; Company, relieving it of debts to the amount of $18,169.57, over and above the amount that should accrue therefrom, towards paying the debt due to the plaintiff. The arrangement was not only with the knowledge of the defendants, but was suggested by the defendant, Paine. The defendants cannot take advantage of an arrangement proposed and desired by them<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>selves, to defeat or prejudice the claim of the plaintiff against them, or the estate, for the debt, for securing which the col-laterals were taken and held by him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-5\">III. The contracts and plates being held by the plaintiff as collateral security, he had a right to proceed against his debtors personally for the debt, independently of the collaterals. (Story on Bailments, \u00a7\u00a7 316, 320.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-6\">The contracts and plates were delivered to, and held by, the the plaintiff in pledge, as collateral security. If the plaintiff had used the pledges in a manner injurious to the defendants, or had converted them, the defendants\u2019 remedy would be an action against him for damages sustained thereby. But they could not set it up in bar of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. (Story on Bailments, \u00a7\u00a7 315, 349 ; <em>Wilson </em>v. Little, 2 Comst., 443; <em>Steams </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>4 Denio, 227.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b617-7\">By the Court\u2014Bosworth, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq_\">The firm of D. Burgess &amp; Company owed the plaintiff the amount found at Special Term to be due to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">The plaintiff had a right to proceed against the defendant, Storrs, at law, as the surviving member of that firm, to recover from him the sum due. He also had the equitable right, Storrs having sold his interest to Burgess on his agreement to indemnify Storrs against all debts of the firm, to be paid by Paine, as administrator, <em>pari passu; </em>with other creditors, out of the copartnership assets, the firm being insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">If both causes of action could not be united in one suit against the will of the defendants, it is enough to say that this defect appeared on the face of the complaint, and if the defendants wished to object to it, they should have demurred to the complaint. (Code, \u00a7 144, sub. 5, and \u00a7\u00a7 147, 148.)</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">The plaintiff has done nothing to affect his legal or equitable rights, unless the agreement of the 18th of June, 1856, to which he is a party, in connection with the other agreements of that date, and that of the 16th of that month, work that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">The two contracts, one of June 7,1854, and the other of November 6, 1855, between David B. Tower of one part, and D. Burgess &amp; Company of the other, and which had been assigned by the latter to the plaintiff as security for the payment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>money due from them to him, could not be made productive of results which would pay any part of the debt due to the plaintiff, or bring money into the hands of the Administrator of Burgess, unless the latter could sell them at a premium, or they could be executed in behalf of the estate of D. Burgess in such wise as to produce profits. That estate was insolvent, and Storrs had ceased to have any title to the contracts, and the firm of D. Burgess &amp; Company had been dissolved by the death of D. Burgess.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The Court found at Special Term, that the arrangement effected by the several agreements of the 16th and 18th of June, 1856, was made \u201cby and with the consent of all the said parties, and which arrangement was thought by the said parties, at that time, to be and was for the undoubted benefit of all interested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">By the agreement of June 16, 1856, Paine, as Administrator of Burgess, assigned to D. B. Tower and C. Walker, all of Paine\u2019s interest in the two contracts of June 7, 1854, and November 6, 1855, and Tower released D. Burgess &amp; Company, and Paine as Administrator of Burgess, from all claims and demands under or by reason of said contracts; and Tower and Walker covenanted to pay to the plaintiff the amount due to him from D. Burgess &amp; Company, viz.: $14,043 with interest thereon from the 14th of June, 1856.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Thenceforth, neither Storrs nor Paine, as Administrator of Burgess, could do anything under those contracts which D. Burgess &amp; Company had originally agreed to do, and the plaintiff could not in any event find any indemnity in the performance or execution by either of them, of those contracts on behalf of D. Burgess &amp; Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">Tower and Walker by contract dated the 18th of June, 1856, assigned their interest to Sanborn, Carter &amp; Bazin, and the latter agreed to pay to the plaintiff certain sums on account of the debt due to him, but not, unconditionally, to pay him in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">The agreement of the 18th of June, 1856, to which Wright is a party, does not transfer his interest in the contracts to Sanborn, Carter &amp; Bazin, but merely contains his consent that they may use the stereotype plates, on the terms and for the consideration therein stated, and the guaranty of C. Walker of the same date.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>After the execution of the agreement between Paine as Administrator, and Tower and Walker, the latter did not become, at law, the plaintiff\u2019s principal debtors. The covenant of Tower and Walker was to a person, not personally liable to pay to the plaintiff the debt owing to him by D. Burgess &amp; Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Whether the plaintiff could maintain any action by reason of that covenant, against Tower &amp; Walker, to recover the debt due to him from Burgess &amp; Company, will, to say the least, admit of some doubt. <em>(Doolittle </em>v. <em>Naylor, </em>2 Bosw., 225; <em>Trotter </em>v. Hughes, 2 Kern., 74; <em>King </em>v. <em>Whitely, </em>10 Paige, 465.)</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">On the facts as found, this contract and those of the 18th of the same month, were, in the intent of the parties, parts of a single arrangement, which looked to securing competent and responsible publishers, as the only method of making the contracts, which had been pledged to the plaintiff, of any value to him, or to Storrs, or Paine as Administrator of D. Burgess, or to the owners of the copyrights.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">In <em>Chester </em>v. <em>The Bank of Kingston, </em>(16 N. Y. R., 338,) Mr. Justice Comstock, speaking of the dealings between the creditors and principal debtor, relied upon as a discharge of the sureties, says, that \u201c if they did so deal without the assent of the plaintiffs, (the sureties,) the latter were, to the amount of the note, discharged in equity, if not at law. If, however, they assented to the dealing, or have placed themselves in a situation where they cannot object, then their liability still remains, unless they have some other answer to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">No authority is cited, but the rules enunciated are stated, as being elementary or well settled law.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">Mr. Theobald states the rule to be, that the surety is not discharged by the creditor\u2019s agreeing to give time, if the agreement was authorized or ratified by the surety. (Prin. &amp; Agent, [by Theobald,] p. 87, \u00a7 165.)</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">In <em>Ex parte Harvey, In re Blakely, </em>(27 Eng. L. &amp; Eq., 280,) Turner, L. J., says: \u201cIt is not disputed that a surety, who concurs in an arrangement between the principal and a creditor, is not discharged by such arrangement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">The concurrence or assent of the surety, or his express agreement, if there were one, may be shown by parol. (<em>Wyke </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>12 Eng. L. &amp; Eq., 162.)</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>A knowledge of the arrangement while it is being negotiated, taking part in and encouraging it, or aiding in perfecting it, will justify a finding that the surety assented to it. <em>(Woodcock </em>v. <em>Oxford and Worcester Railway </em>Co., 21 Eng. L. <em>&amp; </em>Eq., 285.)</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Mr. Storrs testifies, that he knew at the time of the arrangement between Sanborn, Carter and Bazin, and Mr. Wright; that these arrangements were understood by the parties generally before any of the contracts were executed; that the arrangement was desired by himself and Paine, and that neither of them objected to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Mr. Paine testified, that he knew generally, the features of the arrangement between Wright and the firm of Sanborn, Carter &amp; Bazin; that he heard it talked about, and thinks he <em>\u201c </em>suggested the plan of paying Mr. Wright by a double copyright, (the one adopted,) or they spoke to me of it, and I thought it was fair.\u201d Although each of them says he was \u201c not asked to assent \u201d to this arrangement, yet we think there was enough proved to warrant the finding, as a fact, of actual assent by Storrs and Paine, to the agreements of the 18th of June, 1856, and that Mr. Wright signed the paper of that date which he did execute, in the full conviction that its execution was desired by them, and received their cordial assent, and that he was justified in acting on that belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
