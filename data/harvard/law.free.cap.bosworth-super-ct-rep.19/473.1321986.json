Elwell &amp; Company on the 22d of July, 1857, and passed its legal proceeds to their credit, and that the same were drawn out by said firm, and that James W. Elwell was then a Director of said Bank. That on the 28th of August, 1857, the Marine Bank transferred it to the plaintiffs and received $1,000 therefor; and that the interest was $155.15, and offered the note in evidence.

Gregory, President,\u201d is, under the proofs, sufficient to pass title to the note, and the objection to the sufficiency of such indorsement was properly overruled. <em>(Howland </em>v. Myer, 3 Comst., 290; <em>Commercial Bank of Buffalo </em>v. <em>Kortright, </em>22 Wend., 348; <em>Bank of Vergennes </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>7 Hill, 91; <em>Brouwer </em>v. <em>Harbeck, </em>1 Duer, 114; <em>Caryl </em>v. <em>McElrath, </em>3 Sand., 176; <em>Aspinwall </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>2 id., 180.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>II. The alleged facts, which the defendants offered to prove, were not sufficient to defeat the action, and the offer was properly rejected, and the evidence ruled out by the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-5\">1. The note in question, before its maturity, was regularly indorsed and delivered, for valuable consideration, to Elwell &amp; Company, and also by them indorsed and delivered, for valuable consideration, to the Marine Bank. Neither Elwell &amp; Company nor the Marine Bank had any notice of any irregularity in, or want of authority for, the indorsement; and their title could not be impeached for want of a resolution of the Board of Directors authorizing the transfer. (1 R. S., p. 591, \u00a7 8; <em>Howland </em>v. <em>Myer, </em>3 Comst., 290; <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Leavitt, </em>15 N. Y. R., 1; see pp. 11, 191, 192; <em>Brouwer </em>v. <em>Harbeck, </em>1 Duer, 114; <em>Caryl </em>v. <em>McElrath, </em>3 Sand., 176; <em>Aspinwall </em>v. <em>Meyer, 2 </em>id., 180.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-6\">2. That since 22d July, 1857, (when this note was discounted by the Marine Bank,) a sufficient amount of the other notes transferred to Elwell &amp; Company, has been paid to satisfy the loan made on the security of such transfer, can in nowise affect the right to recover on the note in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-7\">3. There was no offer to prove that the transfer of the note was made by the Globe Company \u201c when insolvent, or in contemplation of insolvency, with the intent of giving a preference to any particular creditor over other creditors of the Company,\u201d within the intent and meaning of the statute, declaring such an assignment invalid. (1 R. S., p. 591, \u00a7 9; <em>Brouwer </em>v. <em>Harbeck, </em>1 Duer, 114.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-8\">But if said transfer was within the purview and prohibition of the statute, the plaintiffs would, nevertheless, be authorized to collect the amount of this note from defendants, subject (perhaps) to liability to account therefor to the creditors or stockholders of the Company, or their trustees. (Statute, \u00a7 9, as above.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-9\">4. That the subscription to the Globe Company, upon which this note was given, was never made up to the amount specified in such subscription, is no defense to the note in the hands of a <em>bona fide </em>holder for valuable consideration, without notice. There is no allegation or pretense, or offer to prove, that either Elwell &amp; Company or the Marine Bank had any knowledge or notice in relation to such alleged subscription.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>5. That by the by-laws of the Company, the President alone had no authority to indorse the notes of the Company, is no defense to the note in the hands of a <em>bona fide </em>holder for valuable consideration, without notice. &lt;</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-6\">6. The appointment of a Receiver of the Company, on 14th October, 1856, could not affect the title of a <em>bona fide </em>holder , who received the note early in September, 1856, or of any person deriving title through such holder.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-7\">7. The plaintiffs, on receiving the note from the Marine Bank on 28th August, 1857, and then paying to that Bank the full amount thereof, succeeded to all the rights of the Marine Bank in such note, and notice to the plaintiffs on 25th August, 1857, not to pay the note, did in nowise impair such rights. (Story on Promissory Notes, \u00a7 191; <em>Jacks </em>v. <em>Darrin, </em>3 E. D. Smith, 557; <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>14 Texas R., 354; <em>Boyd </em>v. McCann, 10 Maryland R., 118; <em>Howell </em>v. Crane, 12 Louisiana An. R., 126; <em>Haskell </em>v. <em>Whitmore, </em>19 Maine R., 102.) Neither of the exceptions at the trial was well taken; and the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-33\"> See 5Bosworth, 762; \u201cTransfers * * without Resolution,\" <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Basset, </em>and other cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b486-8\">By the Court\u2014Hoffman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3F\">The first exception, to the ruling that the indorsement was not sufficiently proven, is not well taken. The proof of the habit of the Company to indorse in the manner followed in this instance, was sufficient. <em>(Caryl </em>v. <em>McElrath, </em>3 Sandf. S. C. R., 176; <em>Ogden </em>v. <em>Andre, </em>4 Bosw., 583; <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>5 id., 213.)</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">The admissibility of the first four offers of the defendants\u2019 counsel to prove the matters stated in them respectively, depends upon the fact whether the plaintiffs are in the position of holders of the note for value without notice. They got it from the Marine Bank, who, it is insisted, took it for valuable consideration without notice before maturity.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">The note fell due August 25th-28th, 1857. In September, 1856, one Hotchkiss had possession of it, and delivered it with other notes to Elwell &amp; Company, upon a loan, for which it was given as security. It seems as if it was again deposited-as such security with Elwell &amp; Company for another loan in July, 1857. However this may be, Elwell &amp; Company appear to have got it on a valuable consideration before maturity.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Elwell &amp; Company parted with it to the Marine Bank on a discount of it, at seven per cent, on the 22d of July, 1857. The money was passed to their credit, and drawn out. On the 28th of August, it was certified' by the Merchants\u2019 Bank, and the Marine Bank received the amount from the Merchants\u2019 Bank the present plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The title of the Marine Bank seems indisputable; and this title passed to the plaintiffs by the payment on the day of maturity. The plaintiffs have a right to avail themselves of the title of the Marine Bank. (Story on Prom. Notes, \u00a7 191; <em>Haskell </em>v. <em>Whitmore, </em>19 Maine R., 102.)</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The notice to the teller of the plaintiffs not to pay the note, could only, if of any avail, let in the defendants to any defenses which they had against the Marine Bank. If they could have sustained an action, the present plaintiffs were right in paying, and may sustain it also.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The appointment of a Receiver of the Company, can have no effect upon the rights of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">And as to the by-laws, not authorizing the President of the Company to indorse its notes, it is sufficient to say that a <em>bona fide </em>holder is not chargeable with notice of them, as of a general statute or the charter; and no actual notice of such by-laws to the Marine Bank, was offered to be proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
