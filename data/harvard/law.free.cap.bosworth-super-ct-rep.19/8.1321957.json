Where such agent was a broker, and induced the defendant to employ him as such to negotiate the contract, and made representations calculated and designed to induce the defendant to enter into it, and the defendant entered into it relying on such representations and the advice of the broker, believing the latter to be in his own exclusive interest; and such broker was at the time the secret and fraudulent agent of the plaintiff to obtain such contract from the defendant: <em>Held, </em>that no action could be maintained by the plaintiff against the defendant for a breach of it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b16-8\">3. Where the defense to an action upon a contract to sell and deliver merchandise at a future day is, that the alleged contract was not, when made, intended by either party to be actually performed, but was in the intent and understanding of both parties a gambling contract to be settled by the payment of differences; what was said at the making thereof by the parties making it, is competent evidence upon the question of the truth of the facts stated as a defense, although such contract was negotiated on behalf of one party by a broker.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b16-9\">(Before Hoffman, Pierrepont and Moncrief, J.

Nathan, a broker, to sign the contracts, and to entploy him as his agent to negotiate the same) that Nathan was at the time the secret and fraudulent agent of the plaintiff in the same matter, and made misrepresentations which are stated and on which the defendant relied, and by which he was induced to sign the contracts; <em>third, </em>it avers that it was the mutual design and intention of both the plaintiff' and the defendant, at the making of the said supposed contracts, that the same should not be specifically performed in whole or in part, but on the contrary that at the maturity of said supposed contracts, the differences between the then market value of said pork and the said contract prices therefor should be paid by the one party to the other as performance or satisfaction of said supposed contracts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-10\">The answer had also set up as a fourth defense, that the con- ' tract was entered into by the plaintiff as part of a design on his part, to obtain the control of all the pork in the market, and then to resell at a greatly enhanced price and to obstruct and hinder the proper course of trade, and rmjustly and unlawfully raise the price of pork to the injury of the public, and that the contract was on that ground illegal and void. This defense had been demurred to, and the demurrer thereto was sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-11\">At the trial the Judge excluded evidence to prove the second defense, on the ground that the part of the answer stating it was insufficient as a pleading.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>He also excluded evidence of any conversation between the defendant and Nathan, at the time \u201c of making the writings,\u201d \u201c as to the performance by receipt afid. delivery of pork, or the settlement by payment and receipt of differences.\u201d The defendant excepted to each decision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-5\">The court directed a verdict for the plaintiff for the difference between the contract price and the market price, at the time for performing the contracts, with interest from that time, and the defendant excepted to each branch of such instruction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-6\">The jury accordingly found a verdict for $3,200, and judgment having been entered thereon, the defendant appealed to the G-eneral Term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-7\">Some of the allegations employed in stating the second defense, not adverted to above, are recited in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b18-8\"><em>Wm.

That the making of the contracts, the readiness and willingness of the plaintiff to perform on his part, and the neglect and refusal of the defendant, are alleged with great distinctness in the complaint, and are not denied by the answer. The cause of action is therefore admitted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-8\">Under such a contract it is not necessary for the vendee to allege and prove \u00e1 tender on his part. Readiness and willingness to receive and pay are sufficient. <em>(Rawson </em>v. Johnson, 1 East., 203; <em>Waterhouse </em>v. Skinner, 2 Bos. &amp; P., 447; 2 Chit. Pl., 269-271, notes; <em>Porter </em>v. Rose, 12 J. R., 209.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-9\">Defendant should have given notice of an intention to deliver. <em>(Quarles </em>v. George, 23 Pick., 400.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-10\">II. The allegations contained in the second defense set up in the answer, if admitted to be true, as stated, -constitute no defense to the action; and evidence under that defense was, therefore, properly excluded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-11\"><em>(a.) </em>The contracts were not ffiade by the broker Nathan. They are set forth in the complaint, and are signed by Hinman himself. Whatever, therefore, the nature of Nathan\u2019s agency was, and it is left vaguely enough by the plea, it was not an agency to make the contracts. Hinman acted on his own behalf. This relieves the case at once of the first ground of objection.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-12\">(b.) The plea does not allege that the agency of Nathan was to make the contracts, or that he had any authority to make them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-13\">(c.) The plea does, however, speak of persuasion, inducement, representation, &amp;c., all of which necessarily suppose that the mind of Hinman, and not that of Nathan, was the one which assented to the contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-14\">2. It is clear that the plea states no case of false representations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number><em>(a.) </em>If the representations actually alleged to have been made by Nathan came up to the requirements of the law, it would still be necessary that it should appear that Nathan was Oassard\u2019s agent to make, and did make, the contracts, and that such representations were made in the course of the business of making such contracts. But neither of these things appear.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-5\"><em>(b.) </em>But no false representation whatever is alleged. Not a single fact is alleged to have been wrongly stated, and a false representation is not predicable of an opinion as to the present, much less the future, market value of merchandise. <em>[Foley </em>v. Cowgill, 5 Blackf., 18; <em>Sandford </em>v. Handy, 23 Wend., 260; <em>Hawkins </em>v. Campbell, 1 Eng., 513.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-6\">(c.) Nothing is clearer than that a man may state a false opinion as to the value of an article which he is selling, as an inducement to the purchaser, with impunity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-7\">3. A further difficulty in the way of the defendant is, that he shows no reason why the plaintiff should be bound by Nathan\u2019s representations, even if such representations were false and fraudulent. The plea does not allege that the plaintiff ever authorized Nathan to make such representations, nor does it allege that Nathan was in fact the plaintiff\u2019s agent for making the contracts, or that he did make them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-8\">III. The exception in folio 13, is frivolous. An inquiry as to a man\u2019s intentions in making a contract, without reference to whether the other party knew them or not, is manifestly irrelevant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-9\">IV. The question as to what was said between Nathan and the defendant, was clearly inadmissible. Nothing had been shown in the case to make the conversation between the defendant and a third person binding on the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-10\">V. The final exception to the direction of the Judge, is not well taken.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-11\">1. The question was, whether the evidence contained anything tending to show a mutual understanding between Oassard and Hinman, that the pork should not be specifically delivered, but that differences should be paid. It is plain that the evidence, so far as it tends to prove anything on this point, tends to prove that there was no such understanding.. The defense had wretchedly failed, and there was no alternative but to instruct the jury that the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>2. It was right to direct the jury to allow interest. In such cases the loss of interest is always an element of the damages. <em>(Fitch </em>v. Livingston, 4 Sandf., 492; <em>Van Rensselaer </em>v. Jewett, 2 Comst., 141; <em>Dana v. </em>Fiedler, 1 E. D. Smith, 484; opinion of Woodruff, J., and 12 N. Y. R., [2 Kern.,] 40.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b21-5\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b21-6\">By the Court\u2014Pierrepont, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZ\">The legislature abolished all forms of pleading in use at the time the Code was passed; and provided that a defendant might state in his answer any matter constituting a defense, \u201c in ordinary and concise language.\u201d If the second defense set up in this case was good in law, and so pleaded as to answer the requirements of the statute, it was error to exclude the defendant from giving any evidence under that pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-7\">If the broker, who negotiated these contracts, persuaded the defendant to employ him as his agent in the matter, and while professing to act as the defendant\u2019s confidential broker and agent, and only for the defendant\u2019s interest, was \u201c the secret and fraudulent agent of the plaintiff to induce the defendant to make such contracts,\" and while pretending to act for the defendant, and to guard the defendant\u2019s interest, he was in the employ and secret service of the plaintiff and using his information, ability and influence to entice the defendant into these contracts to the prejudice of the defendant and the advantage of1 the plaintiff,\u201d while \u201cthe defendant was ignorant of such fraud and treachery, and confiding in the broker, as the defendant\u2019s true and faithful agent, he entered into the contracts \u201d which the said broker well knew would be of great loss to the defendant and of great gain to the plaintiff, and if the broker being in the secret service of the plaintiff and deceiving the defendant, craftily combined together with the plaintiff to procure from the defendant those contracts, which he knew would be injurious to the defendant, for whom he was professing to act as a confidential and faithful agent, and which he knew would be beneficial to the plaintiff, in yhose secret service he was employed, and with whom he had craftily combined to procure these contracts, then, these contracts are void in law, and the plaintiff cannot recover npon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-8\">All this is substantially pleaded in the second defense, and in such language as, we think, answers the requirements of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>The plaintiff could not have been misled or taken by surprise on the trial, and no such suggestion was made. A demurrer had been interposed to the third and fourth, defenses, which had been argued both at Special and General Terms, and the demurrer to the third defense was overruled, but no demurrer or motion whatever had been .made touching the second defense. It was urged that there was no evidence that the plaintiff had authorized the broker to make the representations alleged. There was the clearest proof, given by the plaintiff himself, that the broker Nathan was his agent in the negotiation and completion of those contracts; and we think the law well settled that no . one can avail himself of the advantages of a contract which his agent has fraudulently obtained, and, on suit brought, deprive his adversary of the right to prove the fraud, on the ground that the principal did not authorize his agent to commit it. If these contracts were obtained by fraud they are void, and the plaintiff can no more, in such case, avail himself of his agent\u2019s fraud than of his own. We do not wish to intimate that there was any fraud in the procurement of these contracts; we merely wish to say that, under the pleadings, the defendant had the right to offer evidence of fraud; and that, if the proofs showed that the plaintiff\u2019s agent procured these contracts from the defendant by fraud, that such fraud would vitiate the contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">Another exception, taken by the defendant, arises under the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-6\">\u201c <em>Q. </em>At the time of making the writings between you and Cassard, was anything said by Nathan as to the performance by receipt and delivery of pork, or the settlement by payment and receipt of differences ? and if so, what ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">(This question was objected to by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, on the grounds, 1st. That it was relevant only to the third defense; 2d. And, as to that, it was offering parol evidence against the writings; and, Sd. There was no proof to show any authority in Nathan, except to negotiate as a broker between the parties, as to the contracts actually made, and in evidence. The Court sustained the objection, and excluded the question; to which decision the defendant\u2019s counsel objected.)</p>\n<p id=\"b22-8\">We think it plain that this inquiry was relevant to the third defense; and, as to that defense, this Court have, at a General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Term, held by five Judges, fully expressed their opinion, as follows : (Then follows the opinion which has since been reported in 1 Bosw., 207.)</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">As the proof was clear that Nathan was the plaintiff\u2019s agent, we think what he said at the time of making the written contracts may be received as evidence going to show whether or not these were gambling contracts and void by the statute. There are many contracts, good on their face, which may be rendered void or voidable by parol evidence; such as a bond or note which is usurious, or given for a gaming debt, or for any illegal consideration, or by an infant, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">We think the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
