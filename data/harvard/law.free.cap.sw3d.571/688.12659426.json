Cunningham (\"Husband\") appeals the trial court's judgment dissolving his marriage to Catherine S. Cunningham (\"Wife\"). In four points, Husband asserts the trial court erred in failing to classify and set aside his nonmarital property; that the allocation of marital property and debt was not supported by substantial evidence in that the trial court awarded Wife a disproportionate share of the value of the marital property; in finding the parties stipulated that the division of property was equal; and finding that both parties testified to the value of certain real property. Finding no merit to Husband's four points on appeal, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We view the evidence and its reasonable available inferences in the light most favorable\n   to the judgment.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Landewee v.

We recite only those facts relevant to our disposition, and as necessary for context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The parties were married on December 21, 2002, and separated on February 11, 2016. Both parties were gainfully employed throughout the marriage, but finances were kept separate until 2013 when the parties opened a joint checking account. During the marriage, both parties contributed financially to the marital household.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Prior to the marriage, Husband owned a parcel of land with a residence located in Cuba, Missouri (the \"Cuba property\"). Husband purchased the property in approximately 1996 with a former wife. The Cuba property became the marital home upon the parties' marriage. Husband owed approximately $ 80,000 on the Cuba property at that time. Title to the Cuba property remained in Husband's name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 26, 2014, the parties purchased a parcel of land, including a house, located in Hillsboro, Missouri (the \"Hillsboro property\") for $ 91,500. Wife used funds received from an inheritance to make a down payment of $ 20,000. The title to the property was in Husband's name only. Husband then financed the balance of approximately $ 71,500. Thereafter, Wife's daughter moved into the property, paying rent to Wife, who deposited those funds in a joint checking account with Husband. After the separation, Wife instructed daughter to pay her rent directly to Husband. Daughter occupied the premises until October 2017, when she was evicted by Husband for non-payment of rent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In January 2016, the parties agreed to refinance the Cuba property to pay off the Hillsboro mortgage. Appraisals valued the Cuba property at approximately $ 170,000, and the Hillsboro property at $ 94,000. At the time of refinancing, the debt on the Cuba property was $ 41,000, and the debt on the Hillsboro property was $ 71,000. After refinancing, the Cuba property remained in Husband's name only. At the time of trial, the debt on the Cuba property was approximately $ 107,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties also purchased a parcel of land in Sullivan (the \"Sullivan property\") for $ 20,000, consisting of 5 acres of undeveloped land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The parties utilized four vehicles, Husband's nonmarital Dodge truck, a 1997 Ford Taurus, a 2003 Ford Escape, and a 2013 Kia Rio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Other property at issue were each parties' respective checking/savings accounts, and 401K/retirement accounts held in their own name; a joint Edward Jones account in the amount of $ 25,000; bank accounts and/or savings accounts of Wife and Husband; a Branson timeshare; and a desk, cedar chest, chest of drawers, sewing machine, china cabinet, a glass cabinet, and a vacuum cleaner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A hearing was held on February 26, 2018, and both parties testified. Wife testified, without objection:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 that the parties agreed and stipulated that each party would receive their respective bank accounts and 401K/retirement accounts held in their own names (with no stated value); and that she could have personal property consisting of a desk, cedar chest, chest of drawers, sewing machine, china cabinet, a glass case, and a vacuum, with no stated value.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Wife stated she would like the trial court to award her additional marital property consisting of:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 the Hillsboro property, with a value of $ 94,000, which was free and clear of any indebtedness. Wife confirmed she had used $ 20,000 from an inheritance as a down payment to purchase the property;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 the 2003 Ford Escape, with a value of $ 2,500-$ 3,000;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 the 2013 Kia, with Husband to pay any remaining balance owed since Husband had agreed to take a tax refund and pay the balance off, which he failed to do. Wife was aware that Husband had been driving the Kia when he was rear-ended, and that repairs were to be made from insurance proceeds; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 savings bonds in her grandchildren's names, which were bought out of an inheritance, with no stated value.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Wife testified that Husband could have:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 his nonmarital Dodge pickup, with no stated value;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 the Cuba property (Husband had prior to the marriage) with an appraised value of $ 170,000, with Husband to pay the indebtedness of approximately $ 107,000. Wife testified she would be willing to pay Husband the sum of $ 20,000 toward the indebtedness, although stating that at the time of the marriage, Husband owed approximately $ 80,000, and at the time it was refinanced, it was paid down to approximately $ 41,000;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 the Sullivan property, which was purchased for $ 20,000, but no stated current value;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 the Branson timeshare, with no stated value;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 the 1997 Ford Taurus, with a value of approximately $ 2,000; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 the jointly-titled Edward Jones account in the amount of $ 25,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Wife indicated that she contributed to the marital home during the marriage from wages, unemployment and medical leave earnings. She earned approximately $ 30,000 a year. Wife admitted that since the separation, she had not financially contributed to the marital debt, and that Husband basically continued to pay everything, including (for a time) her auto and health insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Wife stated that she currently lived in an apartment paying $ 500 per month in rent. At the time of the separation, Wife moved to California to live with her son. Three months later, Wife returned to Missouri, found employment, and rented an apartment. She was unable to live in the Hillsboro property-even though vacant-because Husband refused to give her the keys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Husband testified, without objection, he would like the trial court to award him:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 the Cuba property (which he testified he owned prior to the marriage),\n   and pay only $ 40,000 (the balance due at the time of the refinancing) toward the outstanding indebtedness of approximately $ 107,000. Husband gave no testimony as to the value of the Cuba property, nor disputed Wife's testimony that, pursuant to a recent appraisal (that Husband paid for), the value of the property was approximately $ 170,000;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 the Sullivan property, (no stated value);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \u2022 the 2003 Ford Escape, he valued at $ 875;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \u2022 the 1997 Ford Taurus, he valued at $ 100;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \u2022 the Branson timeshare, (no stated value);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \u2022 the joint Edward Jones savings account, in the amount of $ 25,000; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \u2022 his bank accounts, and 401K/retirement accounts in his name.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Husband testified Wife could have:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \u2022 the desk, chest of drawers, cedar chest, sewing machine, china cabinet and vacuum, (no stated value);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \u2022 the Kia, and Wife pay the existing indebtedness of $ 2,000. Husband testified he was waiting on an insurance check in the amount of $ 1,300 so the Kia could be repaired.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Husband's income during the marriage was approximately $ 45,000 a year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   When the trial court questioned Husband regarding values of the Edward Jones accounts, Husband's attorney stated: \"We'll stipulate that the reason we got up and said he keeps what accounts he has and she keeps what accounts she has is we believe it's a fairly good division.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The following colloquy then took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [HUSBAND'S ATTORNEY]: If it please the Court, could we have a brief recess?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   THE COURT: We can, but my problem here, ... just so we're all clear, is you're telling me about all this property, nobody's telling me what it's worth, nobody's telling me how much money is in the bank accounts, nobody's telling me even how many bank accounts there are, and at some point in time I'm going to have to try to divide this property evenly between these parties, and it's very difficult to do if nobody's telling me what the value of anything is.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [HUSBAND'S ATTORNEY]: May I speak with counsel for a moment?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   THE COURT: You certainly may.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   THE COURT: I understand the two of you have agreed after a brief conference ... that all bank accounts, basically, essentially, balance?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   [HUSBAND'S ATTORNEY]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   THE COURT: And each just get their own bank accounts. And the Edward Jones account, even though it's in both names, should be considered one of [Husband]'s accounts?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   [WIFE'S ATTORNEY]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   [HUSBAND'S ATTORNEY]: That's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   At the conclusion of the evidence and testimony, the trial court requested the parties submit proposed judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In Husband's proposed judgment, Husband failed to set forth any values for a substantive portion of the property, including the real property, except the joint Edward Jones account listed at approximately $ 25,000. Husband's proposed judgment also failed to distinguish between marital and nonmarital property, and there was no reference to his nonmarital Dodge truck. It further stated that \"[Wife] and [Husband] stipulated and agreed that the division of property as to value was equal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   On March 19, 2018, the trial court entered its \"Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Judgment and Decree of Dissolution of Marriage.\" The trial court awarded Wife her personal belongings; 401K and/or retirement accounts; bank accounts and/or savings bonds held with her grandchildren; all checking, savings, and CDs in her name; the Hillsboro property; the 2013 Kia, as well as the insurance proceeds associated with the Kia; the 2003 Ford Escape; and desk, cedar chest, chest of drawers, sewing machine, china cabinet; a vacuum cleaner, and glass cabinet. Wife was also ordered to make an equalization payment to Husband of $ 20,000, and to pay any debt in her name alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The trial court awarded Husband the Cuba property; all checking, savings, 401k, and retirement accounts in his name; the joint Edward Jones account with approximately $ 25,000; the timeshare in Branson; the Sullivan property; the 1997 Ford Taurus; and the $ 20,000 equalization payment from Wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Husband was ordered to pay the indebtedness associated with the Cuba property in the amount of $ 107,000, and the indebtedness against the Kia automobile in the amount of $ 2,800.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Husband filed a \"Motion to Amend the Judgment of Decree of Dissolution of Marriage/Motion for New trial,\" which the trial court overruled. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In four points on appeal, Husband asserts the trial court erred: (1) in failing to classify and set aside the Cuba property and the Dodge truck to Husband as his nonmarital property, pursuant to section 452.330,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   as it was erroneous and prejudicial to the overall distribution of marital property; (2) in its division of marital property and debts because the allocation is not supported by substantial evidence and Wife received a disproportionate share of the property, pursuant to section 452.330; (3) in its division of marital property and debts because its determination that the parties stipulated to the division is not supported by substantial evidence in that Husband never testified that the division was equal; and (4) in finding that both parties testified that the Cuba property was worth $ 170,000 because such finding is against the weight of the evidence, Husband never testified as to the value, and Wife's testimony as to the value was inadmissible speculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   This Court must affirm a decree for dissolution of marriage unless there is no substantial evidence to support it, unless it is against the weight of the evidence, unless it erroneously declares the law, or unless it erroneously applies the law. All evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom are viewed in the light most favorable to the trial court's judgment, and all evidence and inferences to the contrary are disregarded. The party challenging the dissolution decree bears the burden of proving error.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Archdekin v.

This Court addressed a similar challenge of similar posture in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Marriage of Geske\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7266537\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/421/490/\">\n    421 S.W.3d 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo.App. S.D. 2013) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   As to any alleged omitted findings of fact in the judgment, Rule 73.01(c) provides that all fact issues upon which no specific findings are made shall be considered as having been found in accordance with the result reached. While a party may request that the trial court include specific findings in its judgment, pursuant to Rule 73.01(c), where he does not do so prior to the introduction of evidence, the trial court is under no obligation to specifically identify the facts it utilized in its determinations. Husband did not request that the trial court make any specific findings of fact pursuant to Rule 73.01(c), thus it was not required to make any.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Geske\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7266537\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/421/490/\">\n    421 S.W.3d at 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

While Husband's brief mentions some numbers, the absence of trial court findings on the value of several items, the lack of findings on designations of marital versus nonmarital property, and Husband's failure to preserve the issue via a motion to amend the judgment, pursuant to Rule 78.07(c), dooms this challenge.
