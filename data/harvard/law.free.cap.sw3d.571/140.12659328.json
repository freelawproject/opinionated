Martin, Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   James Kevin Adams (\"Adams\") appeals his convictions of two counts of statutory sodomy in the first degree, and one count of child molestation in the first degree, following a jury trial. Adams argues that the verdict directors for these counts violated his constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict because the verdict directors failed to identify a single criminal act in a manner sufficient to differentiate it from multiple similar acts described in the evidence. We affirm in part, and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Adams does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions. Viewed in the light most favorable to the jury's verdicts, the evidence establishes that in April 2015, eight-year-old H.M. moved with her mother into a house where Adams lived. Adams resided in the basement of the house. During the summer of 2015, among other acts unchallenged here, Adams touched H.M. through\n   her clothing on her \"privates,\" a term H.M. used to reference her vaginal area; Adams removed his clothing and directed H.M. to use her hand to \"go up and down\" on Adams's \"wee-wee;\" and Adams \"licked\" H.M.'s vaginal area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In August 2015, H.M. told her mother about Adams's conduct. Shortly thereafter, H.M. and her mother moved out of the house. Two forensic interviews were eventually conducted through a Child Advocacy Center. During those interviews, H.M. provided additional details regarding Adams's conduct. Adams was charged with three counts of statutory sodomy in the first degree, one count of child molestation in the first degree, and witness tampering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At trial, recorded videos of the two Child Advocacy Center forensic interviews (\"CAC interviews\") were admitted into evidence. During those interviews, H.M. described two different incidents where Adams had H.M. masturbate him. The first incident occurred while H.M.'s mother was not home, and H.M. was on Adams's bed watching television. The second incident occurred while H.M. was sitting on Adams's couch in the basement with the television turned off. During the CAC interviews, H.M. also recounted one specific incident when Adams \"licked\" her vaginal area while lying on Adams's bed. And during the CAC interviews, in addition to providing generalized details about Adams's touching her vaginal area with his hand \"more than one time,\" H.M. described one specific incident of hand-to-genital molestation that occurred during the summer while H.M. and Adams watched \"God of Rings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At trial, the State tendered five verdict directors that submitted three counts of statutory sodomy in the first degree, one count of child molestation, and one count of witness tampering. Relevant to this case, the verdict director for Count I (statutory sodomy) required the jury to find Adams \"knowingly had H.M. touch the defendant's penis with H.M.'s hand while inside [ ] [Adams's] residence.\" The verdict director for Count III (statutory sodomy) required the jury to find Adams \"knowingly licked the genitals of H.M.\" and that such conduct \"constituted deviate sexual intercourse.\" The verdict director for Count IV (child molestation) required the jury to find Adams \"touched the genitals of H.M. with [ ] [Adams's] hand.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The jury convicted Adams on all charged counts, including Counts I, III, and IV, which Adams challenges on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court sentenced Adams to twenty-years imprisonment on each count of statutory sodomy (Counts I, II, and III), to be served concurrently; ten-years imprisonment on the count of child molestation (Count IV); and seven-years imprisonment on the count of witness tampering (Count V). The child molestation and witness tampering convictions were to be served concurrently with one another, but consecutively to the concurrent statutory sodomy sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Adams filed this timely appeal, which challenges his convictions on Counts I, III, and IV on the basis of instructional error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Adams raises three points on appeal, each claiming that defective verdict directors violated his constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict. Adams concedes that he failed to object to the verdict directors at trial. Adams requests plain-error review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Rule 30.20\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   provides that \"plain errors affecting substantial rights may be considered in the discretion of the court when the court finds that manifest injustice or miscarriage of justice has resulted therefrom.\" The State urges us to decline plain error review of Adams's claims because Adams submitted converse instructions that mirrored the challenged verdict directors' description of Adams's criminal conduct. The State argues that the converse instructions constituted self-invited error precluding plain error review. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   It is well recognized that \"a defendant cannot complain about an instruction given at his request.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Bolden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315211\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/371/802/#p806\">\n    371 S.W.3d 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 806 (Mo. banc 2012) (citing\n   <em>\n    State v.

Such self-invited error precludes plain error review.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11293529\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/796/875/#p877\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, however, Adams is not complaining about an instruction given at his request. He is complaining about verdict directors submitted by the State. Though it is true that Adams submitted converse instructions which mirrored the State's verdict directors, converse instructions\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     must\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   reflect the language of the verdict director. MAI-CR 308.02, Notes on Use 4(B). The converse instructions do not constitute self-invited error of Adams's own making.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In addition, we find it difficult to distinguish the present case from our Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    State v. Celis-Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7318430\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/344/150/\">\n    344 S.W.3d 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. banc 2011). In\n   <em>\n    Celis-Garcia\n   </em>\n   , the Court rejected the State's waiver argument, and reviewed for plain error an unpreserved claim that verdict directors violated the defendant's constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict, even though the defendant failed to object to the State's verdict directors\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   submitted her own verdict directors that suffered from the same defect challenged on appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7318430\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/344/150/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 154 n. 3. If a defendant's submission of verdict directors suffering the same defect as the State's verdict directors does not waive plain error review, we fail to see how the submission of converse instructions which mirror verdict directors as required waives plain-error review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Accordingly, we review Adams's claims of instructional error for plain error.

In multiple acts cases, special attention to the verdict director is required to avoid asking the jury to consider evidence of several, distinct criminal acts to determine whether to convict on a single, generally submitted charge. To determine whether a case is a multiple acts case,\n   <em>\n    Celis-Garcia\n   </em>\n   held that courts must \"consider the following factors: (1) whether the acts occur at or near the same time; (2) whether the acts occur at the same location; (3) whether there is a causal relationship between the acts, in particular whether there was an intervening event; and (4) whether there is a fresh impulse motivating some of the conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 156 (quoting 75B AM.JUR. 2D\n   <em>\n    Trial\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1511 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Celis-Garcia\n   </em>\n   , a defendant was charged with two counts of statutory sodomy in the first degree, each involving a different victim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 152-53.

The Court concluded that\n   <em>\n    Celis-Garcia\n   </em>\n   was a multiple acts case because the incidents described in the evidence could be differentiated by location, time, and other circumstances relating\n   to the alleged criminal act charged.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 156. Because the verdict director for both counts did not require the jury to find guilt based on a specific incident of statutory sodomy described in the evidence, and instead permitted the jury to find that the defendant committed statutory sodomy by the general act of placing a hand on each victims' genitals, the Court found the defendant's constitutional right to a unanimous verdict had been violated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 158.\n   <em>\n    Celis-Garcia\n   </em>\n   explained that \"a defendant's right to a unanimous verdict would be protected in a multiple acts case by either the state (1) electing the particular criminal act on which it will rely to support the charge or (2) the verdict director specifically describing the separate criminal acts presented to the jury and the jury being instructed that it must agree unanimously that at least one of those acts occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 157.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   With the\n   <em>\n    Celis-Garcia\n   </em>\n   framework in mind, we address each of Adams's points on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    Point One\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Adams's first point on appeal asserts that the trial court plainly erred, in violation of his constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict, when it submitted Instruction No. 5, the verdict director for Count I, because the instruction did not specify a particular incident of statutory sodomy or instruct the jury that it must unanimously agree on the same incident of sodomy though the evidence described multiple acts where Adams directed H.M. to masturbate him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Instruction No. 5, the verdict director for Count I, required the jury to find, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   As to Count I, if you find and believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   First, that on or between April 1, 2015, and August 8, 2015, in the County of Callaway, State of Missouri, the defendant knowingly had H.M. touch the defendant's penis with H.M.'s hand while inside the defendant's residence, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Second, that such conduct constituted deviate sexual intercourse, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Third that at that time H.M. was a child less than fourteen years old,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Then you will find the defendant guilty under Count I of statutory sodomy in the first degree under this instruction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The verdict director thus submitted statutory sodomy described solely by whether Adams made H.M. touch his penis while inside Adams's residence. Adams argues that the evidence described multiple acts of this nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We agree that H.M. described more than one incident where Adams had her masturbate him in his residence. In her CAC interviews, H.M. described at least two incidents that occurred in Adams's bedroom, with one incident occurring on Adams's bed, and the other incident occurring on Adams's couch. In addition, H.M.'s testimony further differentiated these incidents by describing that she was wearing a pink dress with white stripes, and that the television was turned off, at the time of the incident on the couch, while she and Adams were watching television during the incident on the bed. The evidence established multiple, distinct criminal acts, each of which could have served as the basis for finding Adams's guilty pursuant to Instruction No. 5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We are not persuaded by the State's argument that this is not a multiple acts case because this case involves evidence of \"repeated, identical sexual acts committed at the same location and during a short time span,\" rendering it nearly impossible for the victim to sufficiently distinguish among acts.\n   <em>\n    Celis-Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7318430\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/344/150/\">\n    344 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   157 n.8. Although\n   <em>\n    Celis-Garcia\n   </em>\n   acknowledged this category of cases, it declined to address how the constitutional right to a unanimous jury should be protected in such cases.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7318430\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/344/150/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the Missouri Court of Appeals has recently addressed this category of multiple acts cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The State relies on one of these cases,\n   <em>\n    State v.

In analogizing to\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   , the State posits that the verdict director for Count I was purposefully drafted to include the entire charged period and the general conduct of having H.M. masturbate Adams because the State was not proceeding on a single incident, but rather \"urging a conviction on all of the acts of masturbation in the basement.\" (Resp. Br. 19). The State reasons that in proceeding on all of the acts, it assumed a heightened burdened of proof -- a principle discussed in\n   <em>\n    Walker. Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656806\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/549/7/\">\n    549 S.W.3d at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the State assumed a heightened burden of proof when the verdict director required the jury to find that a defendant had sexual intercourse with a victim in his bedroom \"every time\" the victim's mother went to Wal-Mart).

More importantly, the victims in\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   \"testified to repeated, identical sexual acts committed at the same location during a particular time span, ...

In contrast, H.M. was able to differentiate between identical sexual acts. While both incidents of forced masturbations described by H.M. occurred in Adams's basement bedroom, the incidents were distinguished by a more specific description of location on either Adams's bed or his couch. And H.M. described additional distinguishing circumstances during her CAC interviews, including whether the television was on or off, and the clothing she was wearing. Because the evidence differentiated between multiple acts where H.M. was forced to masturbate Adams, this is not a case like\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Because the evidence described multiple, distinct acts of forced masturbation, and because Instruction No. 5, the verdict director for Count I, did not specifically describe which incident was being submitted, the jury could have convicted Adams based on the incident that occurred on Adams's bed, or the incident that occurred on Adams's couch.

Adams's defense at trial on Count I included both an incident-specific argument and a general denial. Adams argued that the incident of masturbation that occurred on his bed could be innocently explained by H.M. jumping on him while he was sleeping, causing him to inadvertently become aroused and ejaculate, transferring semen to H.M.'s pajamas pants. Adams argued that he told H.M. to\n   keep the incident \"a secret\" because he feared the incident would result in criminal charges, and that H.M. exaggerated the incident on the bed. In contrast, Adams offered a general denial regarding the incident on the couch. The combination of two distinct incidents and two distinct defenses increased the likelihood that some jurors convicted Adams because they rejected his general denial of the incident on the couch but accepted his incident-specific explanation of the incident on the bed, while other jurors convicted Adams because they rejected his incident-specific defense and accepted his general denial.

Adams argues that the evidence described multiple, distinct acts that could have supported his conviction pursuant to this verdict director. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   During the CAC interviews, H.M. reported in very general terms that Adams \"licked\" her in her \"bad spot\" on repeated occasions. However, H.M. only provided details about a single specific incident during the CAC interviews, where H.M. said she was lying on Adams's bed while wearing her clothes. At trial, H.M. was cross-examined about this specific incident, and was asked \"how did [Adams] lick you with your clothes on?\" H.M. responded that \"my pants were down.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   On appeal, Adams relies on H.M.'s cross-examination testimony to argue that the evidence established two distinct \"licking\" incidents, differentiated by whether the licking occurred over clothing, or with H.M.'s pants pulled down. We are not persuaded that H.M.'s trial testimony could have been viewed by the jury as describing a second, distinct incident from the specific incident described in the CAC interviews. As such, Instruction No. 17, the verdict director for Count III, did not implicate Adams's right to a unanimous verdict because the evidence did not describe multiple, distinct acts, any one of which could have supported a finding of guilt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Even assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that some jurors might have understood H.M.'s trial testimony to describe a second incident distinct from the one described in the CAC interviews, Adams's point on appeal would still be without merit. Instruction No. 17 also required the jury to find that Adams's act of licking H.M.'s genitals constituted \"deviate sexual intercourse.\" The jury was instructed that \"deviate sexual intercourse\" is defined as \"any act involving the genitals of one person and the hand, mouth, tongue, or anus of another person.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   section 566.010(1). In contrast, the jury was also provided with the definition of \"sexual contact,\" which includes \"any touching of another person with the genitals or any touching of the genitals or anus of another person, or the breast of a female person,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     or such touching through the clothing\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , for the purpose of arousing or gratifying sexual desire of any person.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   section 566.010(3) (emphasis added). \"Deviate sexual intercourse\" has been held not to include sexual touching through clothing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   During her CAC interviews, H.M. generally reported that Adams touched her \"privates\" with his fingers more than one time. She specifically described only one incident, however, where Adams touched her privates while they were sitting on the couch in his basement bedroom with \"God of the Rings\" on the television. At trial, H.M. was cross-examined, and testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Defense Counsel: Do you remember sitting on [Adams's] lap?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   H.M.: Yes.

This testimony does not\n   describe an incident that can be differentiated from the specific incident H.M. described in the CAC interviews. The incident H.M. described where she and Adams were on his couch watching \"God of Rings\" could very well have included the details that H.M. was sitting on Adams's lap while she and Adams were playing crafts. Though the response of \"sometimes\" to the suggestion that H.M. and Adams were playing crafts supports H.M.'s general report during the CAC interviews that Adams touched her more than once, the vague reference to \"sometimes\" playing crafts is not sufficient to describe a distinctly separate incident from the only incident H.M. specifically described in the CAC interviews.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Because the evidence did not describe multiple, distinct incidents where Adams touched H.M.

Seemingly, the State argues that Adams's explanation of the incident on the bed means that incident does not qualify as criminal conduct under the Count I verdict director because it would not have constituted deviate sexual intercourse.
