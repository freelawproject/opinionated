Mercy Hospital also argued that neither \u00a7 537.100 nor Rule 67.02, addressing the effect of voluntary dismissals, could apply to \"re-join the dropped entity to the case later on.\" The trial court granted the motion. This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This appeal does not address the merits of the underlying dispute, but rather, whether Appellants' claim against Mercy Hospital is time-barred by the statute of limitations. The applicable statute of limitations for wrongful death actions based on \u00a7 537.080 is three years. \u00a7 537.100.1. The statute of limitations in this case began running at the moment of Walker's death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State ex rel. Goldsworthy v. Kanatzar,\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656098\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/543/582/#p585\">\n    543 S.W.3d 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 585 (Mo. banc 2018) (\"A wrongful death cause of action accrues at the moment of death.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Missouri law provides for an additional one-year extension of the statute of limitations by \u00a7 537.100's savings clause. This savings clause provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [P]rovided, that if any such action shall have been commenced within the time prescribed in this section,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     and the plaintiff therein take or suffer a non-suit,\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   or after a verdict for him the judgment\n   be arrested, or after a judgment for him the same be reversed on appeal or error,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     such plaintiff may commence a new action from time to time within one year after such nonsuit suffered\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   or such judgment arrested or reversed; and in determining whether such new action has been begun within the period so limited, the time during which such non-resident or absent defendant is so absent from the state shall not be deemed or taken as any part of such period of limitation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00a7 537.100.1 (emphasis added). Insofar as relevant here, the operation of the savings clause has three elements: (1) the commencement of a wrongful death against the defendant within three years after the decedent's death; (2) a voluntary nonsuit of the wrongful death action against that defendant; and (3) the commencement of a new wrongful death action against that defendant within one year after the voluntary nonsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Goldsworthy,\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656098\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/543/582/#p585\">\n    543 S.W.3d at 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Boland v.

In the case at bar, all three requirements were met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Appellants' wrongful death action against Mercy Hospital was timely.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"A civil action is commenced by filing a petition with the court.\" Rule 53.01;\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Ostermueller v. Potter,\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9996385\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/868/110/#p111\">\n    868 S.W.2d 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 111 (Mo. banc 1993). Here, Mercy Hospital was named in the Original Petition, which was timely filed within the three-year statute of limitations under \u00a7 537.100. Mercy Hospital argues, however, that we should ignore the filing of the Original Petition for two reasons, neither of which are persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   First, Mercy Hospital argues that either the First Amended Petition or the Second Amended Petition are the \"original action\" for purposes of the savings clause analysis. Under one theory, Mercy Hospital claims the First Amended Petition (that names Mercy Clinic and Dr. Dodson only) is the correct pleading because it was \"the operative pleading in effect at the time\" when Appellants brought Mercy Hospital back into the case. It follows, Mercy Hospital contends, that since the First Amended Petition was filed on July 11, 2016, over three years after Walker's death, the action against Mercy Hospital was not timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Second, Mercy Hospital argues that because Mercy Hospital was substituted out of the case on July 11, 2016, on the basis of \"mistake\" as found in Rule 55.33(c), the Original Petition filed against it has no legal effect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, \"[t]he effect was as if Mercy Hospital had never been sued by Appellants.\" In other words, Mercy Hospital argues when an amended petition is filed, the former petition is abandoned.

City of Kansas City,\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7303385\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/285/773/\">\n    285 S.W.3d 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo.

Mo. 1983) (addressing abandoned pleadings in context of diversity jurisdiction). These cases were not decided on the basis of any savings clause and we are not persuaded by their applicability to the analysis of \u00a7 537.100. The fact remains that Mercy Hospital was named as a defendant in the Original Petition filed in 2013 and remained\n   a named defendant until the court granted Appellants' Motion to file their First Amended Petition on July 11, 2016. Accordingly, the Original Petition naming Mercy Hospital was timely filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Appellants suffered a nonsuit as to Mercy Hospital when their First Amended Petition was filed.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When the First Amended Petition was filed, Mercy Hospital was dropped from the lawsuit as a defendant. We must determine whether that event constituted a voluntary nonsuit of the wrongful death action against Mercy Hospital.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Boland,\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6838918\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/471/703/#p707\">\n    471 S.W.3d at 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"A nonsuit is a term broadly applied to a variety of terminations of an action which do not adjudicate issues on the merits.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State ex rel.

We agree. Appellants \"suffered a nonsuit\" as to Mercy Hospital when they filed their First Amended Petition because it had the effect of removing Mercy Hospital from the case without an adjudication on the merits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Mercy Hospital argues that \u00a7 537.100's savings clause only applies when an entire action is dismissed, not just a party. We disagree for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   First, to the extent Appellants' wrongful death lawsuit against Dr. Dodson and Mercy Hospital contained two wrongful death actions, one per defendant,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mercy Hospital's separate dismissal did dispose of an entire action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Second, the Supreme Court of Missouri has broadly defined \"nonsuit\" to include various terminations of a cause of action that do not adjudicate the merits of the issues.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Polaris,\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12181379\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/505/370/#p375\">\n    505 S.W.3d at 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, a nonsuit occurred when Mercy Hospital was substituted out of the case because, as to Mercy Hospital, this was an adjudication not on the merits.

Southern Union Co.,\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \"[t]he taking of a nonsuit amounts to, and has the effect of, a dismissal of the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     case as to one or all the defendants.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   It is not a final disposition of the cause of action on the merits, but is a final termination of the particular suit.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7314796\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/364/228/#p232\">\n    364 S.W.3d 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 232 (Mo.

This argument, while relevant to the appropriateness of a Rule 55.33(c) substitution, is not relevant to the application of \u00a7 537.100's savings clause to this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7.\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Appellants argue, in the alternative, that the nonsuit occurred when they filed their voluntary dismissal of Mercy Hospital. In this case, the distinction between these two dates has no practical significance as they both lead to the result that the nonsuit occurred in July 2016. But as between these two dates, the nonsuit occurred when the First Amended Petition was filed because at that moment, Mercy Hospital was no longer a party to the case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8.\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Reese v.
