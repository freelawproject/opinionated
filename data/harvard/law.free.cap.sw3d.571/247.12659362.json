Claimant was on an incline coming out of a truck, and lost control of the dolly. Claimant was trapped between a boom\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the dolly, so he jumped over the dolly to keep it from falling on him. He tripped and fell \"face forward,\" hit his head on the concrete, and passed out. Claimant's hands were under his body when he fell, and he was not able to brace his fall at all. Both of Claimant's knees, along with his whole body, hit the concrete. When he regained consciousness, he was not immediately able to move.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Claimant filed a claim for permanent total disability for injuries to his head, right side of face, right eye, right shoulder, hands, left hip, and left knee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   A hearing was held before an ALJ in which Claimant was the only live witness. The remainder of the evidence at the hearing consisted of deposition testimony and reports from various experts, including Dr. David Volarich (\"Dr. Volarich\") on behalf of Claimant, and Doctors Robert Bernardi and Michael Nogalski on behalf of Employer. The ALJ determined that the work accident was not the prevailing factor in causing the injuries to Claimant's left hip, left knee, back, right shoulder, and right wrist. The ALJ decided that Claimant did not need additional medical care, and did not find the Fund liable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On review, the Commission entered its award, modifying the ALJ's award as to: (1) medical causation; (2) permanent partial and permanent total disability; (3) future medical care; (4) the liability of the Fund; and (5) attorney's fees. The Commission found the testimony of Claimant's medical examiner, Dr. Volarich, to be \"persuasive\" in his findings as to causation. The Commission found Claimant to be permanently partially disabled as a result of the work accident to the extent of:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   5% of the body as a whole referable to the head; 25% of the right upper extremity at the 232 week level (combined shoulder and wrist); 25% of the left lower extremity at the 207 week level (combined hip and knee); and 5% of the body as a whole referable to the low back.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Regarding the Fund's liability, the Commission further relied on the opinion of Dr. Volarich. The Commission concluded that Claimant's preexisting medical conditions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   combined with his current injuries and disabilities rendered Claimant totally disabled. Accordingly, the Commission found the Fund liable for permanent total disability benefits. It also awarded Claimant the costs of future medical care related to the effects of Claimant's work injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Claims by Employer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Each of Employer's four points on appeal allege, for various reasons, that the Commission's award \"is not supported by competent and substantial evidence,\" thus seeking this Court's review under \u00a7 287.495.1(4). The standard of review for this type of challenge requires that Employer engage in a specific analytical process. Employer, as an appellant, must:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   1.

The Fund argues that Claimant's failure to prove he suffered disability as a result of his work accident means that he is not entitled to permanent total disability benefits from the Fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   To its credit, the Fund properly recognizes the applicable analytical process that governs our standard of review. As this Court has noted, this analytical sequence \"hinge[s] on the probative value of the evidence supporting the award of the Commission.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Nichols\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387116\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/528/918/#p922\">\n    528 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   928 n.16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The factual proposition that the Fund disputes is the Commission's following statement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   We find Dr. Volarich persuasive in his findings that the fall on November 2, 2007 was \"the substantial contributing factor as well as the prevailing or primary factor causing the right facial contusion, the right eye traumatic iritis, the right shoulder internal derangement that required two surgical repairs, the aggravation of the right wrist carpal tunnel syndrome that required surgical repair, the left hip bursitis, the left knee internal derangement that required surgical repair, the back pain syndrome secondary to abnormal weight bearing that required conservative treatments.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Next, the Fund states the only evidence supporting the accident as the prevailing factor in Claimant's injuries was Dr. Volarich's opinion. The Fund states that the Commission relied on \"conjecture and its own assumptions\" in making its award, and that the Commission ignored competent and undisputed testimony of unimpeached witnesses. It concludes that \"the contrary evidence overwhelms the supportive evidence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Fund spends the bulk of its argument pointing out the medical evidence that it claims contradicts the Commission's decision, and in doing so, underrepresents the supportive evidence that favors the award. In this manner, the Fund fails to properly consider the legal challenge made on the basis that the award lacks substantial and competent evidence: that it will only succeed \"in the demonstrated\n   <em>\n    absence\n   </em>\n   of sufficient competent substantial evidence; evidence\n   <em>\n    contrary\n   </em>\n   to the award of the Commission, regardless of quantity or quality, is 'irrelevant.' \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Nichols\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387116\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/528/918/#p922\">\n    528 S.W.3d at 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Hornbeck\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315302\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/370/624/#p629\">\n    370 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   629 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Fund points to statements in the Commission's award-that Claimant's increase in symptoms was not \"merely coincidence\" and that it was plausible that an \"unidentified cervical neurological disorder\" may be the cause of \"much\" of Claimant's symptoms-as evidence that the Commission impermissibly imposed its lay opinions in lieu of physicians' conclusions. The Fund's argument, similar to the Employer's argument, reads portions of the Commission's award in isolation and ignores that the Commission's decision was based on Dr. Volarich's \"persuasive\" and \"credible\" opinion, \"corroborated by [his physician's] records and [Claimant's] surgical history.\" When faced with contrary medical opinions, as here, the Commission's decision receives deference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Gonzales v.

In addition to the \"competent and substantial evidence\" of Dr. Volarich's medical opinion, the Commission also heard Claimant's testimony describing his work accident as involving a traumatic fall in which he lost consciousness and was taken to the hospital. The Commission found Claimant to be \"credible in his reports of injury and symptoms despite the limitations of his education and difficulty in ability to relate a precise mechanism of trauma on the date of accident.\" Testimony on facts within a lay person's understanding, such as that given by Claimant, can constitute substantial evidence that supports an award, particularly in combination with other medical evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Treasurer of the State of Mo. v.
