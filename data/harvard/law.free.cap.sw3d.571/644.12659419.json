Cone (\"Cone\") appeals from the Judgment and Decree of Dissolution of Marriage entered by the Circuit Court of Boone County, Missouri (\"trial court\"), on January 5, 2018 (\"Original Judgment\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Cone's notice of appeal was not timely filed, we dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Cone and Mr. Jeffrey A. Kolesiak (\"Kolesiak\") were married on September 17, 2013. One child was born of the marriage on June 21, 2014. Cone filed a petition for dissolution of marriage on January 14, 2015, and Kolesiak filed an answer and counter-petition on February 9, 2015. The trial court heard evidence on September 19, 20, and 26, 2017, and took the cause under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A docket entry dated December 13, 2017, stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Uncontested\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Docket entry attached hereto. (blm)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In a separate unsigned document,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the trial court entered its tentative findings and ordered Kolesiak to submit a proposed judgment by December 27, 2017. Subsequently, on January 5, 2018, the trial court entered the Original Judgment dissolving the marriage between the parties and awarding legal and physical custody of the minor child jointly to the parties pursuant to the court-ordered parenting plan, with Cone paying child support to Kolesiak.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 26, 2018, Kolesiak filed a motion seeking to modify the Original Judgment, specifically pertaining to child custody, and specifically identified post-judgment custodial difficulties between the parents necessitating a custody modification to the Original Judgment. On February 5, 2018, Cone filed her own motion seeking to modify the Original Judgment, also as to child custody issues, and also raising post-judgment custodial issues between the parents necessitating a custody modification to the Original Judgment. The motions to modify were eventually argued to, and taken under advisement by, the trial court on March 22, 2018, after the trial court received new evidence relating to the child custodial issues raised in the motions to modify. A docket entry dated March 26, 2018, stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Judgment Entered\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Court's docket entry made this date. (sc)\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In a separate unsigned document,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the trial court sustained Kolesiak's motion to modify the Original Judgment and awarded him sole legal custody of the minor child (\"Modification Order\"). The trial court directed Kolesiak to provide the court with an amended parenting plan awarding him sole legal custody pursuant to the provisions contained in his proposed parenting plan and the requirements set forth in the Modification Order. On May 4, 2018, Cone filed her notice of appeal from the Original Judgment (dated January 5, 2018), a judgment which did not address the ruling delineated in the Modification Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After Cone's notice of appeal was filed, this court notified the parties by letter of its concern regarding the topic of what judgment or ruling Cone was appealing from and identified related timeliness and judgment finality issues. Thereafter, the parties jointly submitted a proposed amended judgment to the trial court and, on May 22, 2018, the trial court entered its Amended Judgment and Decree of Dissolution of Marriage (\"Modification Judgment\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   sustaining Kolesiak's motion to modify the Original Judgment, making findings regarding the section 452.375.2 statutory factors, awarding Kolesiak sole legal custody of the minor child, and awarding Kolesiak and Cone joint physical custody of the minor child. In the Modification Judgment, the trial court specifically addressed serious custodial issues impacting the minor child's medical and educational needs that had arisen since the Original Judgment, expressly noted the Guardian Ad Litem's opinion that-due to events transpiring after the Original Judgment-the Guardian Ad Litem no longer believed that joint legal custody was in the best interest of the minor child, and the trial court's pronouncement that, since the Original Judgment, the circumstances surrounding the educational and medical needs of the minor child had changed and necessitated a ruling that sole legal custody must be entered in favor of one of the parents-in this case the father, Kolesiak.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Subsequently, this court again notified the parties of continuing concerns about the Notice of Appeal and advised the parties\n   to address these jurisdictional concerns in their appellate briefing. In Cone's sole point on appeal, she asserts that the trial court erred in entering the Modification Judgment because it was without jurisdiction to do so. Hence, though her Notice of Appeal expressly appeals from the\n   <em>\n    Original\n   </em>\n   Judgment, in her prayer for relief, she seeks our determination that the\n   <em>\n    Modification\n   </em>\n   Judgment be deemed a nullity and the\n   <em>\n    Original\n   </em>\n   Judgment be reinstated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   For reasons explained herein, we dismiss the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"In all appeals, this Court is required to examine its jurisdiction\n   <em>\n    sua sponte.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Spicer v.

The Original Judgment dissolved the parties' marriage and awarded the parties joint legal and physical custody of the minor child. Rule 75.01\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   authorizes the trial court to retain control of its judgment for thirty days thereafter. Once the rule's thirty-day window expires, however, the judgment becomes final if a party does not file a timely after-trial motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rule 81.05(a)(1). If a party timely files an authorized after-trial motion, the judgment becomes final for the purposes of appeal at the earlier of either:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (A) Ninety days from the date the last timely motion was filed, on which date all motions not ruled shall be deemed overruled; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (B) If all motions have been ruled, then the date of ruling of the last motion to be ruled or thirty days after entry of judgment, whichever is later.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Rule 81.05(a)(2)(A)-(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As a preliminary matter, we must consider the nature of the motions Kolesiak and Cone filed within the thirty-day period after entry of the Original Judgment. Kolesiak's motion was titled a \"Motion to Vacate, Reopen, Correct, Amend or Modify Judgment and/or for New Trial\" and asserted that the trial court should modify its joint legal custody ruling and order sole legal custody in favor of Kolesiak. Cone's motion was titled a \"Motion for a New Trial, or in the alternative, Motion to Vacate, Reopen, Correct, Amend or Modify Judgment,\" and asserted that the trial court should modify its joint legal custody ruling and order sole legal custody in favor of Cone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"[I]n evaluating whether a pleading is an authorized after-trial motion, we do not concern ourselves with the title of the pleading or with a party's citation to a particular Rule, but we look instead to the substance of the pleading.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Consistent with the notion that these motions constituted independent proceedings, the parties presented\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   evidence at the hearing on the parties' dueling motions to modify the Original Judgment as it related to child custody. And, not so coincidentally, the trial court's Modification Judgment expressly considered and relied upon the new evidence of changed circumstances since the Original Judgment relating to legal custody involving decisions negatively impacting the minor child's educational and medical needs as the trial court did, in fact, modify the Original Judgment as to legal custody of the minor child. Accordingly, neither Kolesiak's motion nor Cone's motion was an \"authorized after-trial motion\" extending the date of the Original Judgment's finality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As in any other civil action, a judgment in a dissolution of marriage action becomes final thirty days after entry.\n   <em>\n    Lacher v.
