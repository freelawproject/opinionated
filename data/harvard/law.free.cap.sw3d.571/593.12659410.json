Brinson argues the circuit court was required to identify the factual basis for its restitution order pursuant to CR\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   52.01. We agree. Accordingly, we vacate the circuit court's order and remand for additional proceedings as explained herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Brinson was indicted for one count of theft by unlawful taking of property valued over $ 500.00 but less than $ 10,000.00. The charge stemmed from her alleged theft of money belonging to her former employer, Once Upon a Child. Specifically, the Commonwealth alleged Brinson entered data into the store computer system falsely indicating payouts to customers, then keeping the amount of the false payout for herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pursuant to an agreement with the Commonwealth, Brinson entered a plea of guilty to the indicted charge. The circuit court imposed a sentence, in accordance with the Commonwealth's recommendation, of one-year imprisonment, diverted for three years, on the condition that Brinson pay restitution. Brinson agreed to pay restitution, but disputed the amount owed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A restitution hearing was held on March 21, 2017. Kimberly Barry was the Commonwealth's only witness. Barry is the regional manager who oversees the Once Upon a Child store at issue along with five other retail stores. Barry testified loss prevention, theft, accounting, and store inventory are all within her purview, and she \"will do anything within the four walls of the store\" in her capacity as a regional manager.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Barry testified that Once Upon a Child stores both buy and sell gently used goods from and to their customers. Customers bring used products, such as clothing, accessories, shoes, and other items, into the store to sell to Once Upon a Child. Store employees review the items and purchase the products from the customer to then sell in the store to other customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Barry explained that the key to the business is data files known as \"Inser\" files. The Inser file accounts for \"every single item that every employee in the store purchases every single day from start to finish 365 days of the year.\" The program allows each item to be sorted by date of purchase, and shows \"how much the customer received, how much we would sell the product for, what the item was,\" and whether the item was sold to a new customer or \"cycled-counted out, which means at the end of the year, when we ran an inventory, it was not there.\" Barry clarified that when purchasing goods from a customer, the customer would be paid out \"immediately.\" She also explained that at the end of the year each store would conduct an\n   inventory. When an item was unsold but not physically in the store to be scanned because it was stolen, missing, or for some other unknown reason, it was \"cycled out.\" Barry clarified that cycle-counted out meant an item was physically missing, as opposed to having been sold to a customer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Brinson's Inser files were collated into a chart with columns.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The chart contained those goods attributed to Brinson that had been \"cycled-counted out.\" Barry clarified that once an employee logs into the store computer system, that employee's initials are automatically and numerically tagged in the Inser files for all subsequent buys. Barry testified that an inspection of the Inser files showed a theft by Brinson of $ 4,699.64. She calculated the amount based on seven months' worth of data and took into account the natural loss of six to seven hundred dollars per year, regardless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The mechanism of theft is \"as simple as filling out a slip that the customer is required to fill out, with fake information, typing the product into the computer system, and then paying herself out for those items.\" An unalterable characteristic of the Inser database is that items purchased from a customer would be listed in numerical order. Barry testified Brinson's Inser files revealed a pattern of groups of eight to ten items in numerical order that were cycle-counted out. She described this as highly unusual. \"Usually, when you're missing something, when it's just a natural loss with shoplifting, or you just randomly miss a tag, you might have one item missing here, one item missing there, you're never going to have 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 items missing in a row.\" Also attributable to Brinson was the loss of ten items per day, whereas a normal employee would have a loss of one to two items per day. Barry testified she had observed several video clips of Brinson engaging in theft but did not bring those clips to the restitution hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Brinson testified in her defense. She admitted she stole approximately $ 600.00, but no more. Brinson stated she would know the figure better than Barry or the Inser file data because she was the one who committed the thefts. She testified she often left herself logged into a computer terminal, a practice Barry stated Once Upon a Child highly discouraged. Brinson testified that she would have only completed a fraudulent transaction for a \"high dollar\" item like a stroller, not several individual transactions each for smaller items and amounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the close of the evidence, Brinson requested the opportunity for argument, either orally on the record or in writing. The circuit court said Brinson was welcome to file a written brief, but its ruling may beat the filing. It then permitted the parties to briefly argue their respective positions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The day after the hearing, the circuit court entered a form restitution order that Brinson pay $ 4,699.64 in restitution, the full amount requested by the Commonwealth. The order stated, \"The Court has found a factual predicate for the payment\n   of restitution as follows: 'Restitution hearing conducted 3-21-17.' \" (R. 24). It also states, \"Defendant's 1[-]year sentence is probated/diverted for a period of 3 years or until restitution is paid in full, whichever is longer\" and \"the Defendant has been informed that it is necessary that [her] probationary period extend beyond the five years until restitution is paid in full.\" (R. 24, 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Brinson filed a CR 59.05 motion to alter or amend the restitution order. She requested that the circuit court provide factual findings to support its decision, argued that the order must be vacated as it was not supported by substantial evidence, and objected to any extension of her diversion period. The circuit court denied the motion. Brinson appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"[T]he issue of restitution [rests] solely within the discretion of the trial court.\"\n   <em>\n    Donovan v.

First, that the circuit court erred in failing to make factual findings in support of the restitution order. Second, that the amount of restitution ordered is not supported by substantial evidence. And, third, that the circuit court erred by unnecessarily extending Brinson's diversion until restitution is paid in full. We find Brinson's first argument dispositive. We need not reach her remaining arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Brinson first contends that the restitution order must be vacated as it violates CR 52.01, which mandates that the circuit court make findings of fact to support its decision.

Thus, adversarial hearings fall within the parameters of an action tried upon the facts with a jury under CR 52.01.\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7318314\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/350/453/\">\n    350 S.W.3d at 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defining \"actions tried upon the facts without a jury\" to mean \"actions in which any factual findings must be made by the\n   <em>\n    court\n   </em>\n   \") (emphasis original). Just as when modifying timesharing or revoking probation, when calculating restitution a record of written or recorded findings as to the evidence relied upon and reason for establishing the amount of restitution is both warranted and necessary to apprise the parties and appellate courts of the basis for the circuit court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Accordingly, we hold that when ordering criminal restitution following an adversarial hearing, the circuit court must expressly set out its findings either on the record or in its written restitution order.\n   <em>\n    R.S. v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6946971\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/423/178/#p190\">\n    423 S.W.3d 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 190 (Ky. 2014) (\"Oral findings on the record when entering a restitution order are sufficient.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In the case before us, the form restitution order used by the circuit court included the following sentence, \"The Court has found a factual predicate for the payment of restitution as follows: ....\" It then leaves space for the circuit court to identify the factual basis for its decision. Here, the circuit court merely wrote \"restitution hearing conducted 3-21-17.\" We think this insufficient. We have also reviewed the adversarial hearing and find no oral findings captured on the record. This is not to say that the circuit court must identify in detailed fashion its factual findings. As in probation revocation hearings, a short statement of the factual basis for the trial court's decision will suffice. This requirement is not unduly burdensome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Accordingly, we vacate the Jefferson Circuit Court's March 22, 2017 restitution order and remand for additional proceedings. On remand, we direct the circuit\n   court to identify the factual basis for the payment of restitution, including the amount of restitution calculated. Whether a supplemental hearing is necessary to satisfy this mandate is left to the discretion of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   LAMBERT, J., JUDGE, CONCURS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   CLAYTON, CHIEF JUDGE, CONCURS IN RESULT ONLY.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Column A contained each unique bar code number given for each item in the store.
