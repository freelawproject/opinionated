PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 49.09(a) (West, Westlaw through 2017 1st C.S.). Arellano filed a motion to suppress. After the trial court conducted a hearing on the matter, it granted Arellano's motion. By four issues,\n   which we have reorganized, the State contends the trial court erred in: (1) concluding the warrant was \"facially invalid\"; (2) concluding the State was barred from invoking the good faith exception; (3) refusing to consider documentary evidence presented by the State; and (4) failing to provide adequate findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Arellano was arrested for the offense of driving while intoxicated.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 49.04 (West, Westlaw through 2017 1st C.S.). Officer Phillip Garcia of the Victoria Police Department obtained a specimen of Arellano's blood after applying for a search warrant. Arellano filed a motion to suppress, alleging that the warrant was facially invalid because it failed to meet the statutory requirements of Article 18.04 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 18.04 (West, Westlaw through 2017 1st C.S.). At the motion to suppress hearing, Arellano offered an eleven-page document entitled \"Affidavit for Search Warrant\" into evidence without objection. The State responded to Arellano's argument by invoking the good faith exception contained within Article 38.23(b) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 38.23 (West, Westlaw through 2017 1st C.S.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The trial court expressed concern about whose signature was on the warrant. The State indicated a willingness to resolve that issue and offered to call in a witness. Instead, the trial court instructed both parties to submit a brief summarizing their arguments. The State submitted several documentary exhibits attached to their brief including a separate affidavit from Officer Garcia where he attested to the identity of the magistrate and the offense report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, the trial court granted Arellano's motion to suppress. In response to the State's request, the trial court made the following findings of fact and conclusions of law to support its ruling:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Findings of Fact\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   g.

During the hearing, neither the Trial Court nor the State could identify the magistrate by the signature on the warrant in this matter. The State offered no evidence on this issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   i. During the hearing, the State called no witnesses.

Warrant Requirements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   By its first issue, the State argues that the trial court erroneously concluded that the warrant was facially invalid in violation of Article 18.04(5) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 18.04.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Applicable Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In September 2015, the Legislature amended Article 18.04 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure by adding a fifth element to the list of requisites for a valid search warrant. This additional requirement requires the warrant to contain the name of the issuing magistrate in clearly legible handwriting or in typewritten form along with the magistrate's signature. HOUSE COMM. ON CRIMINAL JURISPRUDENCE, Bill Analysis, Tex. H.B. 644, 84th Leg. R.S. (2015).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A search warrant shall be sufficient under article 18.04 of the code of criminal procedure if it contains the following requisites:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   1. that it run in the name of \"The State of Texas\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   2. that it identify, as near as may be, that which is to be seized and name or describe, as near as may be, the person, place, or thing to be searched;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   3. that it command any peace officer of the proper county to search forthwith the person, place, or thing named;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   4. that it be dated and signed by the magistrate; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    5. that the magistrate's name appear in clearly legible handwriting or in typewritten form with the magistrate's signature\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 18.04 (emphasis added). A search warrant must be \"clearly sufficiently specific to meet the mandates of the Fourth Amendment, the Texas Constitution, and article 18.04 of the Code.\"\n   <em>\n    Ramirez v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7318880\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/345/631/\">\n    345 S.W.3d 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex.

App.-Corpus Christi 1985, pet. ref'd) (holding that a search warrant lacking any of the required elements of article 18.04 is facially invalid). However, \"[a] warrant that does not contain the basic information required by art. 18.04 can nevertheless be valid so long as the warrant incorporates by reference [an] affidavit\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   said affidavit does contain all of the information required by art. 18.04.\"\n   <em>\n    Turner v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10021633\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/886/859/#p864\">\n    886 S.W.2d 859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 864 (Tex. App.-Beaumont 1994, pet ref'd).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Here, the search warrant was signed by a magistrate; however, the magistrate's name does not appear in clearly legible handwriting or in typewritten form with the magistrate's signature as required by article 18.04(5).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 18.04(5). Moreover, the attached affidavit incorporated in the warrant also lacks the magistrate's name in clearly legible handwriting or typewritten form. Because article 18.04(5) requires that the \"magistrate's name appear in clearly legible handwriting or in typewritten form with the magistrate's signature,\" and the search warrant before us does not meet this requirement, we conclude the warrant does not comply with the requirements of 18.04 and is therefore facially invalid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Turner,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10021633\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/886/859/#p864\">\n    886 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   864 ;\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9971070\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/703/352/\">\n    703 S.W.2d at 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, we overrule the State's first issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Good Faith Exception\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   By its second issue, the State claims that the trial court erred by concluding the State was prevented from invoking the good faith exception of article 38.28 of the code of criminal procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 38.23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Texas good faith statutory exception provides an exception to the exclusion of unlawfully obtained evidence only if the law enforcement officer was acting in good faith reliance upon a warrant.\n   <em>\n    State v. Molden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6812177\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/484/602/#p610\">\n    484 S.W.3d 602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 610 (Tex. App.-Austin 2016, pet ref'd). In executing a warrant, that officer \"act[s] in objective good faith reliance upon\" the warrant, \"as long as the warrant is facially valid.\"\n   <em>\n    McClintock v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655890\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/541/63/\">\n    541 S.W.3d 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 73 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017). In this case, Arellano's blood was obtained as a result of a facially invalid warrant in violation of article 18.04 of the code of criminal procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Molden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6812177\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/484/602/#p610\">\n    484 S.W.3d at 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the \"good faith exception\" requires a facially valid warrant, and here, by contrast, no valid search warrant existed, the \"good faith exception\" is inapplicable to this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6812177\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/484/602/#p610\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 38.23. Accordingly, we conclude\n   that the trial court did not err in applying the exclusionary rule in this case. We overrule the State's second point of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    D. State's Documentary Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   By its third issue, the State contends that it was plain error for the trial court to fail to consider \"any of the documentary evidence offered by the State\" following the motion to suppress hearing. According to the State, \"if [Arellano] is allowed to submit documentary evidence then the State must be allowed to do so as well.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Here, the trial court made it clear that it did not consider the State's documentary evidence when it concluded that the warrant was facially invalid. However, because the warrant was facially invalid, it was unnecessary for the trial court to consider any of the State's evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 18.04(5). Nonetheless, \"a trial judge may use its discretion in deciding what type of information he considers appropriate and reliable in making his pre-trial ruling.\"\n   <em>\n    Ford v.

App. 2009). Accordingly, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion when it rejected the State's documentary evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7298407\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/305/530/#p539\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We therefore overrule the State's third issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Having overruled the State's issues, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    After filing Arellano's brief, on January 28, 2019, Arellano's counsel filed her motion to withdraw, stating that she was sworn in as the Criminal District Attorney of Victoria County, Texas, and is thereby disqualified from representing Arellano in this matter. After considering her motion, we hereby GRANT counsel's motion to withdraw.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    This affidavit is separate from the probable cause affidavit attached to the search warrant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    The amendment \"would add to existing search warrant requirements that the name of the magistrate issuing the warrant appear in clearly legible handwriting or in typewritten form on the warrant\" because \"[a] magistrate's signature on such warrants may not always be clearly legible, which can increase the risk of forgery or inadequately informing individuals of who has authorized the search warrant.\" HOUSE COMM.

(2015).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Additionally, in its fourth issue, the State complains that the trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law are \"wholly inadequate on the potentially dispositive issue in this case\" as the trial court failed to address: (1) whether it believed Officer Garcia's testimony through his affidavit; (2) the offense report; (3) whether it believed the magistrate was a neutral and detached magistrate, or (4) whether the warrant was issued on probable cause. Because we determined that the warrant was facially invalid, this issue is not dispositive.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tex. R. App. P. 47.4.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
