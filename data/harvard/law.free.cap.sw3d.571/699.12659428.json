After we affirmed his convictions on direct appeal, Perdomo-Paz filed a motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 29.15. The motion court denied Perdomo-Paz's motion following an evidentiary hearing. Perdomo-Paz appeals. He argues that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to evidence that, after Perdomo-Paz's arrest, the motor vehicle he was driving on the night of the murders was sold and destroyed. We affirm. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, we have provided an unpublished memorandum to the parties which sets forth the reasons for this order. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
