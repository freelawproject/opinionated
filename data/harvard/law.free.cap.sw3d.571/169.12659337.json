Tillitt argues that the circuit court abused its discretion in allowing the testimony of a forensic interviewer; plainly erred in allowing the State to question the complaining witnesses regarding their truthfulness; plainly erred in allowing the State to question Tillitt and another witness about the veracity of the complaining witnesses; and plainly erred in sentencing him to consecutive terms of imprisonment on all seven counts. We affirm. Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
