Its function is not to hear evidence and, based thereon, to make an original determination. Instead, it provides an opportunity to examine asserted error in the trial court which is of such a nature that the complaining\n   party is entitled to a new trial or outright reversal or some modification of the judgment entered. It is not the function of the appellate court to serve as advocate for any party to an appeal. ... When counsel fail in their duty by filing briefs which are not in conformity with the applicable rules and do not sufficiently advise the court of the contentions asserted and the merit thereof, the court is left with the dilemma of deciding that case (and possibly establishing precedent for future cases) on the basis of inadequate briefing and advocacy or undertaking additional research and briefing to supply the deficiency. Courts should not be asked or expected to assume such a role.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . at 686 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Kline\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11539615\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/998/140/#p141\">\n    998 S.W.2d at 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"An appellate court is not to become an advocate for a party to an appeal.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Marriage of Spears\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11662514\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/995/500/#p503\">\n    995 S.W.2d 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 503 (Mo.

Plaintiff's brief contains a \"Table of Authorities[.]\" This table is deficient because the cases are not arranged alphabetically, and there are no references to the pages of the brief on which the cases are cited. Additionally, Plaintiff's list omits many cases that are cited in his brief. Certain constitutional provisions are listed, again without page references. Only the references to statutes and rules have the required page references.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Plaintiff's \"Jurisdictional Statement\" is deficient because it merely specifies the county and case number of the underlying proceeding and then presents six paragraphs of argument relating to the merits of the trial court's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    3.

App. 2014). According to the trial court's judgment, Plaintiff did not comply with the requirements of Rule 74.04(c)(2), so each numbered paragraph in Defendant's statement of undisputed material facts was deemed admitted. In Plaintiff's Statement of Facts, there is no reference at all to Defendant's motion for summary judgment or the statement of uncontroverted material facts upon which it was based. Because Plaintiff's Statement of Facts provides us with no basis to discern what material facts were established by the trial court's ruling, it preserves nothing for appellate review.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . at 285-86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    4.

There is no description of the applicable standard of review for an appeal from a summary judgment. There is no discussion of why the trial court's judgment was erroneous, based upon the legal principles governing appellate review of a summary judgment as applied to the material facts established by the trial court's ruling. There is not a single page reference to the record on appeal to support the factual assertions in the \"support\" section of Plaintiff's brief.
