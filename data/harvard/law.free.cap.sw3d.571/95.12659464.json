Kuchle filed an objection to the Transportation Cabinet's petition for condemnation on the basis that the Transportation Cabinet failed to comply with federal and state laws and the Transportation Cabinet's policy manual during the condemnation process. The circuit court conducted a hearing and granted the Transportation Cabinet's petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As early as 1986, plans were discussed to improve the intersection of Kyles Lane and Dixie Highway. A drawing depicting a\n   turn lane at the intersection was generated by the Northern Kentucky Area Planning Commission (NKAPC) in 1986 and was part of a broader planning study by the OKI Regional Council of Government,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   referred to as the \"Dixie Fix.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In an email submitted as an exhibit at the hearing, Roger Kuchle, an owner of Kuchle, acknowledged he attended planning meetings at OKI in 2007 and knew some of Kuchle's property would be involved in the Dixie Fix, whatever design was chosen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   With the knowledge that a portion of Kuchle's property would be involved in the intersection project, in 2009-2010 Kuchle sought and obtained zoning approval for the construction of a Walgreens store on Kuchle's property. The approval required that Kuchle design the Walgreens store to comport with the intersection project plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Walgreens subleased the property for a period of seventy-five years from Anchor Kentucky Partners, LLC, which has a ground lease for the property from Kuchle. Under the terms of the lease, if any property is taken by condemnation, the lease can be terminated at Walgreens' discretion upon sixty days' notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2009, the design money for the intersection project was allocated and design began. In January 2014, a set of plans was completed and compensation for condemnation of part of Kuchle's property to facilitate the intersection project was calculated. There was evidence that a Transportation Cabinet representative met with Mr. Kuchle on June 2, 2014, and discussed the plans and that the property to be taken had been valued by the Transportation Cabinet at $23,950 using a Minor Acquisition Review (MAR). The Transportation Cabinet offered that amount and Kuchle rejected the Transportation Cabinet's offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Upon Kuchle's request, the Transportation Cabinet arranged an appraisal by a certified licensed appraiser, Brian Davis, who appraised the property at $41,500 and the Transportation Cabinet offered that amount. Kuchle did not believe the appraisal was an accurate valuation of the property and rejected the Transportation Cabinet's offer. The Transportation Cabinet's record of contacts indicates that in January 2015, the Transportation Cabinet again offered $41,500 and Kuchle counteroffered $66,900. After fourteen months of negotiations failed, on July 7, 2015, the Transportation Cabinet filed a condemnation petition. Kuchle filed an objection to the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In August 2015, Mr. Kuchle sent a list to the Federal Highway Administration alleging twelve instances where the Transportation Cabinet violated federal law in the condemnation process. However, federal funding for the intersection project was not withdrawn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following the hearing, the circuit court found there was no evidence that the Transportation Cabinet acted fraudulently, with bad faith or that it abused its discretion. It also found that the Transportation Cabinet substantially complied with state and federal laws regarding the condemnation of Kuchle's property. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Transportation Cabinet sought to condemn Kuchle's property pursuant to the Eminent Domain Act of Kentucky, Kentucky Revised Statutes (KRS) 416.540\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   KRS 416.550 provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Whenever any condemnor cannot, by agreement with the owner thereof, acquire the property right, privileges or easements needed for any of the uses or purposes for which the condemnor is authorized by law, to exercise its right of eminent domain, the condemnor may condemn such property, property rights, privileges or easements pursuant to the provisions of KRS 416.550 to 416.670.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The authority to condemn is subject to the constitutional restriction that the taking be for \"public use\" and the condemnee receive \"just compensation[.]\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ky.

It argues that because the intersection project is funded in part with federal funds, the Transportation Cabinet's failure to strictly comply with various federal statutes and regulations requires that the condemnation petition be dismissed. Specifically, Kuchle argues that the Transportation Cabinet must comply with the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 embodied in 42 United States Code (U.S.C.) \u00a7 4601,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   and regulations contained in the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.)

The Court aptly explained why noncompliance does not defeat the state's power:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [N]o authority has been cited for refusing the State its sovereign power of eminent domain because it has not complied with a federal statute or regulation limiting the conditions upon which federal funds will be granted to States. Read in context, the statute quoted above recites one of the conditions upon which federal funds are to be granted to states on particular highway projects. If a state does not see fit to comply with this condition, its right to federal funds may be questioned, but its right to proceed within its own borders under its own laws without federal funding is not impaired by the above statute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   The enforcement of [the federal statute] is not the responsibility of a state court in eminent domain proceedings, but rather that of federal agencies disbursing federal funds and, if necessary, that of the federal courts by injunctive control of such agencies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Cty. Highway Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8507976\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tenn-app/61/292/\">\n    61 Tenn.App. at 304-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8507976\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tenn-app/61/292/\">\n    454 S.W.2d at 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The language in the federal and state court opinions is persuasive. The statutes and regulations cited are only guidelines and the failure to follow those guidelines does not affect the power of eminent domain under state law. Moreover, we agree with the trial court that the Transportation Cabinet substantially complied with the federal law and its policy manual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   There was evidence that Kuchle was provided notice of the intersection project when, in 2007, Mr. Kuchle attended public meetings at OKI where the intersection project was discussed. Additionally, when Kuchle obtained a zoning approval in 2009-2010 to construct the Walgreens store, it was directed to design the development with consideration of the intersection project. While Kuchle complains that it was unaware of the specific design that eventually was settled upon in 2014, it is impractical for the Transportation Cabinet to inform interested parties of every change in the design to carry out the project plan. Although Kuchle suggests that the Transportation Cabinet was required to ensure that the Kenton County Transportation Plan included the intersection project, there is no such requirement under federal or state law that requires a county plan to contain a state transportation plan before it can be undertaken by the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   While Kuchle claims there was no appraisal prior to negotiations, that is untrue. The property was valued by the Transportation Cabinet appraiser utilizing a MAR, a simple computation used when the Transportation Cabinet appraiser determines the value will be less than $25,000. In this case, it was determined the value was uncomplicated because there was no damage to the building or remainder. Although Kuchle argues the later appraisal by Davis was invalid because of the method used and the value determined was too low, Kuchle's argument is improper at this stage of the litigation. It will have the opportunity to present evidence to a jury relative to the reliability of Davis's appraisal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Kuchle also argues that Mr. Kuchle was not given the opportunity to accompany Davis on his visit to the property. However, Davis testified he offered to meet Mr. Kuchle at the site and he declined because of a \"do not disturb\" clause in the lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Contrary to Kuchle's assertion, there is no evidence that the Transportation Cabinet took any coercive action to induce an agreement on the price paid for the property. While in September 2014, the Transportation Cabinet informed Kuchle that if its offer was not accepted it would initiate condemnation proceedings, such a statement is not evidence of coercion or the failure to negotiate in good faith. It is merely an accurate statement of the power of eminent domain. The record reveals that the Transportation Cabinet engaged in extensive good-faith negotiations with Kuchle prior to initiating the proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In addition to its findings that the Transportation Cabinet complied with federal and state laws, the trial court found Walgreens did not consider the Transportation Cabinet's condemnation to be material to their leasehold interests. The trial court made this finding based on a series of emails between counsel for Walgreens and Anchor Kentucky Partner, LLC, and counsel for Kuchle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Kuchle complains these emails were not introduced into evidence but contained in\n   the Transportation Cabinet's post hearing brief and were part of confidential settlement negotiations that are inadmissible under Kentucky Rules of Evidence (KRE) 408. Even if Kuchle is correct that the emails were improperly considered by the trial court, whether Walgreens will or will not exercise its option to vacate goes to the ultimate valuation of the property sought to be condemned, not to the Transportation Cabinet's right to take. In this interlocutory appeal, the right to take is the sole issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   There was more than substantial evidence to support the circuit court's finding that the Transportation Cabinet did not engage in any conduct that would require the dismissal of its condemnation petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   For the reasons stated, the order of the Kenton Circuit Court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   ALL CONCUR.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    OKI is a council of local governments and regional groups serving the Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana region around Cincinnati, Ohio.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
