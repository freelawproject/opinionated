The court issued a capias warrant that was still outstanding when Lowe failed to appear for sentencing on October 13. In November, Lowe was apprehended in Texas. The state incurred $611 to return him to Missouri, where he was finally sentenced on December 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Despite Lowe's contrary arguments, \"it would be appropriate to exercise our discretion to dismiss [his] appeal pursuant to the escape rule.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Carter\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385852\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/523/590/#p597\">\n    523 S.W.3d at 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

More than two months later, Thomas was found and the warrant was served. On May 6, 2014, Thomas was sentenced. Thomas displayed no intention of voluntarily returning on her own for sentencing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   By escaping justice for over three months, Thomas demonstrated disregard of the law and disrespect for the court and the criminal justice system. Those who seek the protection of our legal system must be willing to comply with its rules and decisions. Thomas forfeited the protection of the legal system when she escaped justice for more than three months. Thomas's actions caused a capias warrant to be issued and required law enforcement officers to expend resources to track her down, arrest her, and hold her in custody for sentencing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   We would act well within our discretion to dismiss Thomas's appeal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856487\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/466/44/#p47\">\n    466 S.W.3d at 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Carter\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Thomas\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , however, we eschew the escape rule because Lowe's complaint on appeal plainly lacks merit.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Carter\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385852\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/523/590/#p597\">\n    523 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   598 ;\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Thomas\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856487\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/466/44/#p47\">\n    466 S.W.3d at 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Lowe alleges an insufficiency of evidence that he took gas \"without consent\" intending to withhold it from the owner permanently or use it so as to make recovery by the owner unlikely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet his arguments largely ignore our standard of review by citing evidence or inferences that we must ignore in determining sufficiency of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Thomas\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856487\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/466/44/#p47\">\n    466 S.W.3d 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 46 (we deem true all evidence and inferences favoring the state and reject all others).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Indeed, Lowe's brief concedes that \"the jury could have found [Lowe] appropriated gas 'without the consent of White Oak Station' \" on his initial drive-away and that \"placing gas in the tank of his van and consuming it while driving away would seem to use the gas contrary to White Oak Station's recovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   570.010(8)(c).\" Lowe then states that he offered a paper copy of his expired, temporary driver's license to the store clerk, and suggests that the clerk accepted that as satisfactory collateral and gave tacit \"consent\" to Lowe driving away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Even if we could credit this \"license/collateral/consent\" theory under our standard of review, which we cannot, we find no evidence for it in the record. Lowe did not testify or call any witnesses. The only other party to this alleged transaction was the store clerk who, in pertinent part, testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Q. Do you recall what that amount [of gas pumped] was?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   A. $43 and some change, I believe. I think 41 or 43 dollars.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Q. All right. And did Mr. Lowe come in at this point?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A. He did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Q. All right. What happened when Mr. Lowe came in the store?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   A. He come up to the register and he said the pump went over, I was only going to pump $5 and I looked and it was $43 and I said no, you need to pay for this.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Q. Okay. And what did Mr. Lowe do after you told him you need to pay for that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A. He told me, \"I don't have the money, man.\" That is exactly what he said.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Q. And what did you do next?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A. I said well, you need to pay for this somehow. He says I don't have the money. I says well, you have to pay for this. And that's - -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Q. Did he hand you had an expired driver's license?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   A. It was expired and it was a paper driver's license.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Q. Okay. And did he offer any money toward the bill?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   A. He told me he could not pay it and I said well I'm going to have to call the manager, and he said, \"Well, I don't have the money right now, man.\" And so at this point I got on the phone to call the manager.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Q. And who is your manager?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   A. Her name is Laura James.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Q. And what was the purpose of calling your manager, Ms. James?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   A. To ask her what I needed to do about the situation because it was quite a bit of money.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Q. All right. And when you got on the phone with Ms. James, what did Mr. Lowe do at that time?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   A. He walked out of the store and turned around and walked out of the store and proceeded to go to his van and drive off.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Q. How would you describe the drive off? Was it fast, was it slow? Just a normal drive off?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   A. He didn't run. He just casually walked out to the van and I was on the phone and I was looking and watching and I said, \"He just drove off.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Q. All right. And at that time did you call the police?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   A. I asked Laura what she wanted to do about the situation. And told her what the driver's license said and she said yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Q. So did you call the police at the direction of your manager?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   A.
