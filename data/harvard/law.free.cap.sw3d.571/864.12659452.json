To answer that question, we examine and carefully balance the bedrock-and in this case competing-principles of freedom of contract and Texas procedural safeguards in a case of first impression for this court. Trial court plaintiffs L Series, L.L.C., CKDH, L.L.C., VUE, L.L.C., and CKDH Investments, L.L.C. (the Companies) appeal, and alternatively seek mandamus relief, from the trial court's order requiring them to advance to defendant Conrad Holt, a member of all of the Companies, his fees and expenses pending trial of their suit against him. Because the trial court's order is not one for which the legislature has authorized an interlocutory appeal, and because we conclude that mandamus relief is not warranted, we dismiss the appeal and deny the alternative request for mandamus relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Companies Sue Holt, Who Obtains an Order Requiring the Companies to Advance His Fees and Expenses Pending Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The underlying suit arose primarily from Holt's employment as the general manager of a group of Metroplex-area car dealerships-Arlington Saturn, Ltd., Fort Worth Saturn, Ltd., and Hurst Saturn, Ltd. (the Dealerships). Each of the Companies is a general partner of one of those Dealerships: L Series is Hurst Saturn's general partner; CKDH is the general partner and one-percent owner of Fort Worth Saturn; and VUE is the general partner and one-percent owner of Arlington Saturn. CKDH Investments owns and leases the real estate occupied by the Dealerships. Holt has been a member of L Series, CKDH, and VUE since their formation in 2005 and a member of CKDH Investments since 2007. Holt was also a manager of CKDH Investments\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and had served as the president of all of the Companies. As general manager of the Dealerships, Holt supervised salesperson Shawn Andrus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In December 2016, the Companies and Dealerships sued Holt and Andrus,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   claiming that from around 2014-2016, both of them had engaged in numerous types of fraudulent activity and \"financial abuse\" toward the Companies and Dealerships: fraudulently recording sales to receive bonuses from car manufacturers, fraudulently booking sales, making unlicensed insurance sales, and engaging in various kinds of financing fraud, to name a few. The Companies and Dealerships identified their causes of action against Holt as breach of the general manager's contract, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, unjust enrichment, money had and received, aiding and abetting, assisting and participating, and civil conspiracy. Before suing, the\n   Companies and Dealerships terminated Holt's and Andrus's employment and ordered Holt to stay away from the Dealerships' premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Holt answered and counterclaimed for breach of contract against all of the plaintiffs. After the Companies and Dealerships filed an amended petition adding factual allegations and a claim that Holt had breached his fiduciary duty to the Companies \"due to his position as an officer/manager\" of the Companies, Holt filed an amended counterclaim as well as third-party defendant claims not relevant here. In his amended counterclaim, Holt alleged that each of the Companies' Regulations entitle him to advancement of fees and expenses and indemnity for all of the claims against him. He alleged that the Companies had breached the Regulations by failing to provide him advancement and indemnity and refusing to make distributions to him. He also sought statutory indemnity and distributions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%208.051\">\n    Tex. Bus. Orgs. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 8.051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 101.203, 153.208(b). He further pleaded for money had and received and an accounting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Almost a month after filing his amended counterclaim, Holt moved for partial summary judgment seeking a court order requiring the Companies to reimburse him for all fees and expenses he had already incurred in the suit and to pay him for future fees and expenses in the suit, in advance, on a monthly basis, in accordance with the Companies' Regulations. Holt alleged that the Companies and Dealerships had sued him because of his \"position as president, manager, general manager, and/or officer,\" thus triggering the Companies' advancement obligations under the Regulations. According to Holt, that those advancement obligations were \"neither dependent on the merits nor negated by [the Companies'] allegations of wrongdoing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After a nonevidentiary hearing, the trial court granted Holt's motion and ordered the Companies to pay Holt's past \"reasonable attorney fees and expenses\" through November 1, 2017, and his \"future reasonable attorney fees and expenses\" on a monthly basis thereafter upon the submission of \"summary invoices.\" The Companies filed a notice of interlocutory appeal, citing civil practice and remedies code section 51.014(a)(4), which permits an interlocutory appeal of an order granting or denying a temporary injunction.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2051.014\">\n    Tex.

After we questioned our jurisdiction over the appeal, the parties briefed the jurisdictional issue, which we carried with the appeal.

The Companies contend that the trial court's order is a temporary injunction order-albeit an invalid one-appealable under section 51.014(a)(4) because it (1) is immediately effective during the pendency of the underlying litigation\n   and (2) commands the Companies to take certain actions. Although Holt argues that the Companies waived this argument by not raising it in the trial court, we are required to determine whether we have jurisdiction over an appeal and always have jurisdiction to do so.\n   <em>\n    Freedom Commc'ns, Inc. v.

Thus, although the order compels certain conduct during the litigation-the payment of fees and expenses pursuant to Holt's purported contractual right-it does so not as a merely temporary form of relief pending the outcome of the litigation but as complete relief on Holt's advancement breach of contract claim. The order does not contemplate any further action on the merits of that claim, i.e., Holt's entitlement to relief for the Companies' alleged breach of contract.

[Emphasis added.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Thus, to be entitled to advancement, the person must be \"of the type\" entitled to indemnity, but no legal determination as to the person's right to indemnity need be made. We must therefore look to section 8.01 to determine what type of person the Companies may indemnify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Section 8.01 provides that \"each Person who was or is made a party [to a] pending or completed action, suit[,] or proceeding ..., by reason of the fact that he or she ... is or was serving at the request of the Company and an officer, trustee, employee, agent, or similar functionary of the Company shall be indemnified by the Company to the fullest extent permitted by the Act and the TBCA.\" The Companies acknowledge that Holt was serving as a member when they sued him, but they contend their suit is solely for ultra vires acts outside of his capacity as a member;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   therefore, because he would not be entitled to indemnity for such acts under section 8.01, he cannot be entitled to advancement under section 8.02.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Companies' argument is based on this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Ferrant v.

Although it is uncomfortable to cause the corporation to advance millions in fees to a former officer the current board believes engaged in serious misconduct, it does stockholders no service for a board to refuse to do so when the advancement obligation is clear. If the directors in such a situation truly wish to serve the stockholders, they should fix what they\n   can by revising the corporation's advancement obligations on a going-forward basis. To breach a contract because you do not like its terms while refusing to change it when you have the authority to do so is hard to explain as an act of appropriate fiduciary fortitude.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    Barrett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8218475\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/951/735/#p737\">\n    951 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   747 &amp; n.39 (also lamenting as regrettable that in a corporate case with protracted litigation over an official's entitlement to advancement, \"the stockholders get it coming and going because of the corporation's refusal to honor mandatory advancement contracts\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Thus, we conclude that\n   <em>\n    Ferrant\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable and therefore not controlling here, and we find Delaware case law persuasive on this issue in the absence of Texas authority.

The order requires Holt to provide summary invoices for repayment of reasonable fees and expenses incurred through November 1, 2017, and gives the Companies twenty days to either pay those invoices or object to them and request an expedited hearing. For future fees and expenses, the order requires the same procedure on a monthly basis. Although the order provides for an expedited hearing if disputes arise, which could require some trial court involvement, that involvement is necessarily limited to the duration of this suit. Because those proceedings would occur in the same court as the underlying suit, any concern about the potential future \"time and labor\" of the court is overshadowed by the need to effectuate a remedy that would afford Holt the complete relief the Companies agreed to in advance. And the very nature of the relief afforded would militate against the Companies' making such challenges without exceptionally good cause, lest fees and expenses increase even more.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fasciana v.
