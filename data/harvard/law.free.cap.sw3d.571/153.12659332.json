Swinton argues that the trial court plainly erred by not\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   striking a venireperson who had questioned how Swinton could establish self-defense without testifying and by admitting testimony, during the punishment phase of the trial, that Swinton had been associated with a criminal gang. We affirm. Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
