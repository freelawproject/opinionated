The first challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions for attempted sexual abuse and its corresponding conviction of armed criminal action. The second challenges the verdict director for attempted sexual abuse, alleging that it omitted a necessary element. And the third argues that the written judgment fails to accurately reflect\n   the oral pronouncement of Bjorgo's sentence-an error the State concedes. As the only point with merit is Bjorgo's third point on appeal, we remand for the limited purpose of directing the trial court to enter a new judgment that properly reflects the oral pronouncement of Bjorgo's sentence. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Around six o'clock in the evening of May 4, 2015, Spencer Smith (pastor of First United Methodist Church in Kearney, Missouri) met with six other church members, including Victim, to interview candidates for the position of worship leader in the church. The interview took place in the church sanctuary. During a break in the interview, Victim left the sanctuary to use the women's restroom located in the lobby attached to the sanctuary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   When Victim entered the restroom, she went into and used the first stall; it did not appear that anyone else was in the restroom at the time. When she exited the stall, however, she saw a man later identified as Bjorgo standing outside the stall.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Victim did not know Bjorgo and had not heard or seen him enter the restroom. Bjorgo stepped toward Victim and put his hands on her shoulders and neck. Victim initially thought someone was playing a joke on her but quickly realized she was, in fact, in a dangerous situation. The two began to struggle, and Bjorgo gained control over Victim and pushed her into the larger accessible stall at the rear of the restroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Victim continued to struggle, but Bjorgo pushed her to the floor, where he straddled her while she was on her back, blocking the stall exit. Bjorgo pulled a knife from his pocket and extended the blade. Victim continued screaming and began kicking her legs and swinging her arms, while Bjorgo tried to stab her in the stomach and slashed at her neck and arms. Bjorgo repeatedly told Victim to \"shut the fuck up\" and \"shut the fuck up, bitch,\" but he said it in a calm way that troubled Victim even more. Victim continued to resist and fight back, and eventually, Bjorgo stood up and began to leave the restroom. As Bjorgo did so, Victim crawled behind him in hopes of shouting out the door when he opened it, so that someone would hear and come to her aid. Victim was able to get to her feet just before Bjorgo reached the door, but, at that point, he turned and saw her standing and came after her again. The two struggled again, and Bjorgo threw Victim to the ground. Victim kicked at Bjorgo's stomach and groin, at which point, he stood back up and then kicked Victim hard twice in the head before walking out of the restroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After Bjorgo left, Victim ran back to the sanctuary. When Victim reentered the sanctuary, she was screaming and hysterical, repeating, \"he's at the door.\" The pastor and two other men went to the exterior doors of the church, where they saw a\n   dome light turn on inside an unfamiliar car in the parking lot. The men ran to the car and tried to get the occupant out. But the occupant, later identified as Bjorgo, started the car, put it in reverse, and quickly drove away toward a nearby highway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   One of the church members that pursued Bjorgo on foot was able to follow him by car while contacting 9-1-1. The church member pursued Bjorgo's car for several minutes until the Kearney Police arrived and took over the pursuit. The police pursued Bjorgo, with lights and sirens on, for several minutes before he eventually stopped. After Bjorgo stopped, the police took him into custody. During a search incident to arrest, officers found a pocket knife in the left front pocket of Bjorgo's pants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following Bjorgo's apprehension, officers went to the church to speak with Victim. When they arrived, Victim was crying and very distraught, and she had visible injuries to her neck, hands, wrists, earlobe, foot, hip, head, and elbow. Victim was shown a picture of Bjorgo taken upon his apprehension, and Victim immediately said, \"yep, yep, that's him,\" and resumed crying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Once in custody, Bjorgo waived his rights and agreed to answer questions. During the interview, Bjorgo initially denied being at the church, but, after being confronted with evidence, Bjorgo admitted he had been there, hiding behind the women's restroom door. Bjorgo described the knife he used during the attack, and he admitted that his intent was to see and touch Victim's breasts. Bjorgo also wrote an apology letter to Victim, which stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Dear Ma'am, I'm sorry for what happened tonight. This is not the real me. I am very self-conscious about my weight. It also causes physical problems. So I smoked some methamphetamine to help lose weight.

I am so sorry that my stupidity of turning to drugs caused me to traumatize you and cause you pain. I am a very nice person when I'm not on drugs. I am not making excuses.

During trial, the jury was given the following verdict director for attempted first-degree sexual abuse:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   As to Count III, if you find and believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   First, that on or about May 4, 2015, in the County of Clay, State of Missouri, the defendant with the intent to touch the breasts of [Victim], assaulted [Victim] in the women's restroom while displaying a sharp instrument in a threatening manner, and\n   Second, that such conduct was a substantial step toward the commission of the offense of sexual abuse in the first degree of [Victim] at 1000 E.

The State was not required to prove that Bjorgo did anything sexual during the assault; it needed to prove only that the actions he\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   take were for the purpose of committing first-degree sexual abuse and that he took a substantial step to that end. Thus, the only issue before us is whether the State proved that, when assaulting Victim, Bjorgo did so with the intent to commit first-degree sexual abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   A similar issue was addressed by the Southern District of this court in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Highway 92, Kearney, Clay County, Missouri, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Third, that defendant engaged in such conduct for the purpose of committing such sexual abuse in the first degree,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   then you will find the defendant guilty under Count III of an attempt to commit sexual abuse in the first degree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   However, unless you find and believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt each and all of these propositions, you must find the defendant not guilty of that offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   A person commits the crime of sexual abuse in the first degree when ... first, he has sexual contact with [Victim] by touching the breast of [Victim] through the clothing, and second, he does so for the purpose of gratifying his own sexual desire, and third, he does so by use of forcible compulsion, and fourth, in regards to the facts and circumstances submitted in this instruction he acted knowingly, and fifth, ... in the course of this conduct he displays a dangerous instrument in a threatening manner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   As used in this instruction, the term \"substantial step\" means conduct that is strongly corroborative of the firmness of the defendant's purpose to complete the commission of the offense of sexual abuse in the first degree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   This instruction was based on MAI-CR3d 304.06 (the attempt instruction), as modified by MAI-CR3d 320.77 (the first-degree sexual abuse instruction).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Bjorgo complains that the paragraph denominated \"First\" fails to comply with the applicable Notes on Use insofar as it alleges, as the purported substantial step, that Bjorgo \"with the intent to touch the\n   breasts of [Victim], assaulted [Victim] in the women's restroom while displaying a sharp instrument in a threatening manner,\" rather than alleging that Bjorgo \"tried to touch Victim's breasts.\" According to Bjorgo, the conduct the State was required to allege and identify as the purported substantial step toward committing the crime of first-degree sexual abuse had to be that Bjorgo tried to touch Victim's breasts. In making this argument, he relies on the following language from Note on Use 2 for MAI-CR3d 304.06:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   The conduct required for an attempt is a \"substantial step\" toward the commission of the object crime. If the conduct alleged to constitute the substantial step is actually trying to achieve the result of the object crime, it should be described in general terms, such as \"shot at John Doe,\" \"tried to have sexual intercourse with S.D.,\" \"tried to start a fire (in a particular building),\" etc.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   But, as the State correctly points out, Bjorgo ignores the remaining part of Note on Use 2, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   If the conduct is further removed from the result of the object crime, it should be described in general terms such as \"lying in wait for John Doe,\" \"soliciting another person to commit\" the offense, \"assembling equipment to be used in the commission of\" the offense, etc. The victim or property involved should be identified.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9441138\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/68/418/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   As discussed,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \"a defendant's overt act need not be the ultimate step toward, or the last possible act in the consummation of the crime attempted.\"\n   <em>\n    Kendus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9998221\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/904/41/#p43\">\n    904 S.W.2d at 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9929175\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/670/138/#p139\">\n    670 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   139 ). And, as the Notes on Use contemplate, the conduct forming the alleged substantial step could be \"further removed from the result of the object crime.\" Here, the conduct that the State alleged as Bjorgo's substantial step was his act of assaulting Victim in the women's bathroom while displaying a sharp instrument in a threatening manner with the intent to touch her breasts. That allegation fully complies with Note on Use 2 for MAI-CR3d 304.06. As such, the State included all requisite elements, and Bjorgo has failed to demonstrate any error, much less plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Point II is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The written judgment failed to accurately reflect the oral pronouncement of sentence for first-degree assault.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   For his final point, Bjorgo argues that the written sentence and judgment reflects a clerical error insofar as it indicates that his sentence for Count I (first-degree assault) is life without parole, when the sentence pronounced orally by the court during Bjorgo's sentencing hearing was simple life imprisonment. As such, he urges this court to \"remand the case with instructions that the Circuit Court enter a new Judgment\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   , removing the 'without parole' after 'life' in the first part of the judgment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The State concedes error on this point and also urges this court to \"direct the trial court to correct the written judgment via a\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   order to conform to the trial court's oral pronouncement of Defendant's sentences at the time of sentencing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \"Clerical errors in the sentence and judgment in a criminal case may be corrected by an order\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   if the written judgment does not reflect what actually was done.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
