Gibson, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is an appeal from an interpleader action filed by a party who owed funds that were claimed by two other parties. The trial court found that interpleader was appropriate pursuant to Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 22.01 and allowed the disputed funds to be deposited with the court. The two remaining claimants to the funds filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The trial court found that one party was originally owed the funds but that this party owed a debt to the other claimant. As such, the trial court ruled that the funds would be paid to the party who was not originally owed the funds but who had the outstanding claim against the other claimant. We reverse in part, affirm as modified, and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS &amp; PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   C&amp;C North America, Inc. d/b/a Cosentino (\"Cosentino\") is a Delaware corporation that manufactures stone surfacing products. Seven Stone Surface Fabrication, LLC, (\"Seven Stone\") had its principal place of business in Georgia but conducted business in Tennessee pursuant to a \"Fabrication Agreement\" authorizing it to fabricate, market, sell, install, and service Cosentino products. Over time, the parties conducted business in accordance with the Fabrication Agreement, and Cosentino incurred 88 invoices reflecting that it owed Seven Stone $153,008.34. Before this amount was paid, however, Seven Stone was administratively dissolved by the secretary of state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Cosentino and Seven Stone had also conducted business with Natural Stone Distributors, LLC (\"Distributor\"), a Tennessee company with its principal place of business in Shelby County. Pursuant to a separate contract, Distributor was authorized to sell Cosentino products to authorized fabricators. Seven Stone had submitted a credit application to Distributor in order to purchase goods on credit and subsequently made a number of its purchases from Distributor. When Seven Stone was administratively dissolved and owed an outstanding balance on its account, Distributor threatened to file an attachment action against Cosentino in Texas against the funds Cosentino owed to Seven Stone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 27, 2016, Cosentino filed a complaint for interpleader in the chancery court of Shelby County pursuant to Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 22.01, which provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Persons having claims against the plaintiff may be joined as defendants and required to interplead when their claims are such that the plaintiff is or may be exposed to double or multiple liability. It is not ground for objection to the joinder that the claims of the several claimants or the titles on which their claims depend do not have a common origin or are not identical but are adverse to and independent of one another, or that the plaintiff avers that he or she is not liable in whole or in part to any or all of the claimants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Cosentino's complaint for interpleader named as defendants Seven Stone and Distributor. According to the complaint for interpleader, Cosentino was in possession of $150,000 \"that both defendants allege is their property.\" According to the complaint, Distributor alleged that Seven Stone owed it $135,000 plus accumulated charges. The complaint stated that because of the conflicting claims, Cosentino was in doubt as to which of the defendants was entitled to the property and feared that it may be exposed to double or multiple liability. The complaint stated that Cosentino took no position on the issue of ownership of the funds and wished to pay the funds into court so that the defendants could be\n   required to interplead and settle the matter between themselves. Cosentino asked the court to enjoin the defendants from instituting any other action against it for recovery of the funds and to discharge it from liability to either defendant upon transfer of the funds to the court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The following day, before either defendant answered, the trial court entered an order permitting Cosentino to interplead the funds, as it \"appear[ed] to the court that [Cosentino] admits liability for the amount of money forming the subject of this action but is in doubt as to who is entitled thereto.\" The order enjoined the other parties from instituting any other action against Cosentino with regard to the funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Distributor filed an answer and cross-complaint against Seven Stone. Distributor agreed that Consentino should be allowed to pay the funds into court in order to prevent duplicate litigation against it concerning entitlement to the funds. In its cross-complaint against Seven Stone, Distributor alleged that Seven Stone had purchased goods from it on credit and incurred an outstanding balance of $130,665.13, plus accrued finance charges, for a total of $139,310.06 due as of October 31, 2016. Distributor alleged that this sum remained unpaid despite its demand for payment, and it sought the entry of a judgment in its favor for this sum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Seven Stone filed a \"consolidated responsive pleading\" to the complaint for interpleader and Distributor's cross-complaint and also included a counter-claim against Distributor. Seven Stone admitted that Cosentino owed it $150,000 for outstanding invoices and asserted that its interest in the interpleaded funds was superior to any interest asserted by Distributor. Seven Stone asserted a counter-claim for declaratory judgment against Distributor, alleging: \"There exists an actual and justiciable controversy over entitlement to the interpleaded funds.\" Specifically, Seven Stone alleged, \"[t]here exists an actual and justiciable controversy between the parties with respect to whether [Distributor] is an intended third party beneficiary to the Agreement between Cosentino and Seven Stone\" and \"with respect to whether [Distributor] is an affiliate of Cosentino.\" Seven Stone noted that its Fabrication Agreement with Cosentino allowed Cosentino to offset any amounts owed by Cosentino against any amounts owed by Seven Stone to Cosentino \"or its affiliates.\" Seven Stone asserted that Distributor was not an affiliate of Cosentino, as the two entities had no common ownership interest and were not commonly controlled. Seven Stone also argued that the Fabrication Agreement was not intended to benefit Distributor, directly or indirectly. In sum, Seven Stone sought a declaratory judgment that it was entitled to all of the interpleaded funds, and accordingly, it also sought an award of the entire balance of the interpleaded funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Seven Stone filed a motion for partial summary judgment that was limited to its claim for the interpleaded funds deposited\n   with the court. Seven Stone again asserted that it had the exclusive right to the interpleaded funds because Distributor was not a party to the Fabrication Agreement between Seven Stone and Cosentino and was not an \"affiliate\" of Cosentino within the meaning of the contract, and Distributor had not asserted any other legal right to the interpleaded funds. Seven Stone acknowledged its receipt of discovery responses indicating that Cosentino was advised that an attachment action would be filed in Texas against the funds Cosentino owed to Seven Stone. However, Seven Stone argued that its right to the interpleaded funds had no relationship to Distributor's separate cross-claim against Seven Stone for the outstanding balance Seven Stone owed to Distributor and suggested that the latter issue could be \"taken up at a later time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Cosentino filed a motion for discharge, seeking to be relieved of any further participation in the case. Cosentino noted that it had already deposited the sum of $150,000 with the court and reiterated that it had no interest in the deposited funds. Cosentino noted that both defendants had filed answers and that the \"the case [was] at issue.\" Seven Stone filed a response in opposition to Cosentino's motion to be discharged from the case but stated that its opposition was primarily due to Cosentino's request for attorney's fees from the amount deposited with the court. Seven Stone argued that the request for attorney's fees was premature in light of its pending motion for partial summary judgment and also argued that Cosentino should not be entitled to recover its attorney's fees because \"this is an improper interpleader Action.\" Seven Stone argued that attorney's fees are only appropriate when a disinterested stakeholder brings a \"necessary\" interpleader action and suggested that the instant interpleader action was not necessary and was filed in bad faith. The trial court ultimately entered an order granting Cosentino's motion to be relieved of any further participation in the case and reserved a ruling on Cosentino's request for attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Distributor filed a reply to the motion for partial summary judgment filed by Seven Stone along with its own motion for summary judgment, claiming that it was entitled to a judgment for the principal amount owed by Seven Stone in addition to accumulated late fees, totaling $155,941.26. Distributor argued that it was immaterial whether its claim arose out of the same contract as the one giving rise to Seven Stone's rights and that \"the only issue remaining is whether Seven Stone owes anything to [Distributor].\" According to the motion for summary judgment, Seven Stone admitted in its discovery responses that it owed an outstanding balance to Distributor of $129,093.49 as of August 1, 2016, which only differed from Distributor's calculation by 19 cents. Additionally, Distributor argued that \"when contractual late charges are calculated,\" that sum would increase to $155,941.26. Distributor filed a sworn declaration of its employee attesting to these figures with attached accounting documents and emails. As a result, Distributor argued that the trial court should award it the entire balance of $150,000 on deposit with the court. Seven Stone filed a reply in further support of its own motion for partial summary judgment but did not file a response to the motion for summary judgment filed by Distributor or respond to the statement of undisputed material facts submitted by Distributor. Distributor filed an additional reply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After a hearing, the trial court entered an order granting summary judgment to Distributor and denying the motion for partial summary judgment filed by Seven Stone. Because neither party disputed the statement of material facts submitted by\n   the other, the trial court adopted the statements of fact as its factual findings. The trial court noted that Cosentino deposited $150,000 with the court in order to avoid a multiplicity of lawsuits against it for the disputed sum. The trial court noted its previous ruling permitting interpleader and again concluded that \"this is a properly filed interpleader case under Tenn. R. Civ. P. Rule 22.\" The trial court found that Cosentino owed Seven Stone $153,008.34. The trial court found that Seven Stone purchased merchandise from Distributor on an open account and owed Distributor $129,093.49. The trial court rejected Seven Stone's suggestion that Distributor was required to establish a lien or assignment in order to have a claim to the interpleaded funds at issue in this case. The court reasoned that \"once these parties have joined the issue in an interpleader, then it is like any other lawsuit, a lawsuit that has competing claims, one against the other.\" The court found that Seven Stone had a right to the funds it was owed, but at the same time, Seven Stone did not deny that it owed money to Distributor. In sum, the court concluded that Seven Stone was liable for the debt it owed in the amount of $129,093.49, but the trial court added that it found nothing in any of the documents provided by Distributor to confirm that Seven Stone agreed to pay any late fees or interest charges. Consequently, the trial court limited its award to Distributor to $129,093.46 and awarded the remainder to Seven Stone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The issue of attorney's fees with respect to Cosentino was resolved by consent order. Seven Stone timely filed a notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ISSUES PRESENTED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Seven Stone raises the following issues for review on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   1. Whether the chancery court erred in determining that Cosentino's complaint for interpleader was a properly filed interpleader action under Rule 22.01 of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure ; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   2. Whether the chancery court erred in denying Seven Stone's motion for partial summary judgment and granting Distributor's motion for summary judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In its posture as appellee, Distributor raises the following additional issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   1. Did the trial court err in weighing the facts set forth in Distributor's statement of undisputed material facts submitted in support of its motion for summary judgment; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   2. Did the trial court err by not finding\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   that Seven Stone was guilty of unclean hands for failure to comply with statutory requirements for winding up the affairs of an administratively dissolved limited liability company.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   For the following reasons, we reverse the decision of the chancery court in part, affirm as modified, and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Interpleader\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"[I]nterpleader is designed to protect a stakeholder against the vexation of proceedings by two or more doubtful claimants when the whole matter may be settled in a single suit.\"\n   <em>\n    Woodard v.

Interpleader permits a \"stakeholder who has no claim to the money and is willing to release it to the rightful claimant to put the money in dispute into court, withdraw from the proceeding,\n   and leave the claimants to litigate between themselves the ownership of the fund in court.\"\n   <em>\n    Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Marsh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"199888\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/119/415/#p418\">\n    119 F.3d 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 418 (6th Cir. 1997) (internal quotation omitted). The \"stake\" at issue can be a thing, debt, or fund. Lawrence A. Pivnick, 1 Tenn. Cir. Ct. Prac. \u00a7 1:27 (2017). Although \"a limited fund or some specific, identifiable property\" must be involved, \"interpleader seldom will be rendered inappropriate because of the nature of the stake.\" Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, &amp; Mary Kay Kane, 7 Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc. Civ. \u00a7 1704 (3d ed. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Interpleader usually involves a two-stage procedure. Generally, \"the stakeholder initiates the proceedings by filing a petition in which it sets forth the claims of the named defendants to a specified thing or fund in its possession, admits liability, disclaims any interest in the thing or fund, and offers to pay the fund into court.\" Pivnick, 1 Tenn. Cir. Ct. Prac. \u00a7 1:27. Thus, in the first stage of the proceeding, the trial court determines whether the stakeholder has properly invoked interpleader.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"199888\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/119/415/#p418\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If the trial court determines that interpleader is proper, the claimants plead against each other in the second stage if they have not already done so.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"199888\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/119/415/#p418\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Then, the trial court proceeds to determine the claimants' respective rights to the thing or fund.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"199888\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/119/415/#p418\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In the case at bar, Seven Stone argues that the trial court erred in concluding that this was a properly filed interpleader action under Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 22.01. Seven Stone suggests that interpleader should never have been allowed in this case and that all of the trial court's subsequent orders are void as a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   At the outset, we note that the trial court entered its order permitting Cosentino to interplead the funds the day after the petition for interpleader was filed, before either defendant filed an answer, upon finding that \"[Cosentino] admits liability for the amount of money forming the subject of this action but is in doubt as to who is entitled thereto.\" Thereafter, Seven Stone filed an answer and participated in the proceeding but never filed a motion to dismiss the interpleader as improper or sought a hearing on the propriety of the interpleader. Instead, Seven Stone filed a counterclaim for declaratory judgment asserting that \"[t]here exists an actual and justiciable controversy over entitlement to the interpleaded funds.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, Seven Stone now asks this Court to reverse the trial court's order allowing Cosentino to interplead the funds and dismiss the interpleader complaint, when Seven Stone never challenged the order permitting interpleader in the trial court. Objections to interpleader may be waived by going to a hearing on the merits. 48 C.J.S.\n   <em>\n    Interpleader\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 38 (2018) ;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Supreme Lodge Knights of Honor v.

Again, Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 22.01 provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Persons having claims against the plaintiff may be joined as defendants and required to interplead when their claims are such that the plaintiff is or may be exposed to double or multiple liability. It is not ground for objection to the joinder that the claims of the several claimants or the titles on which their claims depend do not have a common origin or are not identical but are adverse to and independent of one another, or that the plaintiff avers that he or she is not liable in whole or in part to any or all of the claimants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Advisory Commission Comment to the Rule generally states that Rule 22.01\"provides for interpleader of persons having claims against the plaintiff.\" Tenn. R. Civ. P. 22.01. The Tennessee Rule is \"identical in substance\" to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 22. Robert Banks, Jr. &amp; June F. Entman, Tennessee Civil Procedure \u00a7 6-8(b) (4th ed. 2015).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The \"modern trend\" has been \"toward increased availability of interpleader and relaxation of the historic restrictions on its use.\" Richard D. Freer, 4\n   <em>\n    Moore's Federal Practice-Civil\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 22.03[1][h] (2018). According to Professors Banks and Entman, interpleader was historically subject to very \"stringent rules that greatly limited the remedy's utility.\" Banks &amp; Entman,\n   <em>\n    Tenn. Civ. Proc.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6-8(b). Two of these stringent rules were an \"identity rule,\" requiring that the adverse claims be \"for the identical thing, debt, or duty in the same amount,\" and a \"privity rule,\" requiring that all of the adverse claims derive from a common source.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8511600\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tenn-app/24/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, these limitations were \"discarded by the adoption of Rule 22.01,\" as the second sentence of the Rule expressly states that it is not ground for objection that the claims do not have a common origin or are not identical but are independent of one another.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8511600\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tenn-app/24/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On appeal, Seven Stone argues that \"a proper interpleader must involve ... the same thing, debt, duty, or stake ...

Seven Stone asserted that Distributor was not an affiliate of Cosentino in the sense that it could offset payments under the Fabrication Agreement. Seven Stone pointed to Distributor's discovery responses indicating that the basis for its claim against the interpleaded funds was simply its intention to file an attachment action in Texas against the funds held by Cosentino. Seven Stone submitted a statement of undisputed material facts, which Distributor did not dispute and the trial court adopted. According to this statement of facts, Cosentino incurred 88 invoices under its Fabrication Agreement with Seven Stone reflecting that Cosentino owed Seven Stone $153,008.34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Notably, the cross-claim asserted by Distributor to the interpleaded funds was simply in the nature of a breach of contract claim, and Distributor did not seek an attachment under Tennessee law, as it had threatened to seek in Texas. Distributor filed its own motion for summary judgment seeking a judgment for the principal amount owed by Seven Stone to Distributor in addition to accrued interest charges. Distributor pointed to Seven Stone's discovery responses admitting that it owed Distributor $129,093.49 as of August 1, 2016. Distributor also filed a statement of undisputed material facts, to which Seven Stone did not respond, and which the trial court adopted. According to these undisputed facts, Seven Stone purchased merchandise from Distributor on open account, owed Distributor an unpaid balance of $129,093.49, agreed to pay finance charges on the aged unpaid balances, and owed Distributor a total of $155,941.26 in principal and finance charges as of June 27, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In support of its claim of sole entitlement to the interpleaded funds, Seven Stone heavily relied on\n   <em>\n    John Weis, Inc. v.

In\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   , a Tennessee corporation brought suit against Ms. Reed and an insurer, seeking an attachment of Ms. Reed's interest in a sum of $800 that she was due under a fire policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 679. The insurer filed an answer and sought a bill of interpleader, admitting that it owed the sum to Mrs. Reed but stating that numerous other creditors had demanded payment from the sum and that it could not safely judge the claims of her creditors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The trial court sustained the cross-bill as a bill of interpleader, entered judgments in favor of various creditors, and ordered distribution of the $800 paid in to court among the various creditors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On appeal, Mrs. Reed argued that the creditors were not entitled to share pro rata in the insurance money.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 680. The Court of Appeals explained that in an interpleader action, the creditor-claimants are \"in the position of a plaintiff in possessory actions, and must recover on the strength of their own title rather than on the weakness of that of the adversary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 681. Ultimately, the Court of Appeals concluded that the defendant-claimants \"had a right to take judgment against Mrs. Reed on their petitions,\" but that the attachment\n   claims should have been dismissed because there was no evidence that Mrs. Reed was about to fraudulently dispose of her property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court of Appeals found that two of the claimants had contractual liens on the proceeds of the insurance policy, but that the others were only entitled to judgments without any liens on the policy proceeds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 682. The Court of Appeals concluded by stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   We think the Chancellor erred in ordering the distribution of the proceeds of the policy among all these creditors, for the reason that they had no liens on the proceeds of the policy, with the exception of the two parties above named. The fact that Mrs. Reed owed them did not give them a right to any interest in the proceeds of the policy unless they had liens thereon, and the Chancellor's decree is therefore modified as herein decreed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In sum, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decree sustaining the cross-bill as a bill of interpleader and ordering the $800 paid into court, dismissed the attachment claim, held that two claimants were entitled to liens to the extent of their respective judgments, and affirmed the decrees awarding the other claimants the respective amounts due.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, the Court of Appeals reversed the decree ordering distribution of the policy proceeds among the various creditors pro rata.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After the two liens were satisfied, the remainder of the policy proceeds would be paid to Mrs. Reed, \"unless retained as a result of further appropriate proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   After a hearing in this case, the trial court granted summary judgment to Distributor and denied the motion for partial summary judgment asserted by Seven Stone. Having concluded that interpleader was proper, the trial court concluded that it was left with the competing claims of Distributor and Seven Stone. The trial court acknowledged the\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   case cited by Seven Stone but said, \"The Court does not agree with Seven Stone that [Distributor] should be required to establish a lien or an assignment in order to establish a claim to the funds as in the insurance cases. See\n   <em>\n    John Weis, Inc. v.

This case is very different from those insurance cases.\" The trial court reasoned that \"once these parties have joined the issue in an interpleader, then it is like any other lawsuit, a lawsuit that has competing claims, one against the other.\" The trial court agreed with Seven Stone's assertion that it had \"a right to the funds\" through its contract with Cosentino. However, the court added, Distributor also had a legitimate claim against Seven Stone for a debt. As a result, the trial court found it appropriate to award Distributor a judgment for the amount it was owed from and against the interpleaded funds. The trial court found that Seven Stone did not deny that it owed $129,093.49 to Distributor for the amount due on its open account. However, the trial court was \"not convinced\" from the documents submitted that Seven Stone agreed to pay any late fee. As such, the trial court limited its award to Distributor to $129,093.46 to be paid from the interpleaded funds, and Seven Stone was awarded the remainder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   We perceive two errors in this disposition. First, we conclude that the trial court erred in ordering the judgment in favor of Distributor to be paid from the interpleaded funds. We find the\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   case analogous rather than distinguishable, even though the underlying facts in that case involved an insurance policy. Like the majority of the creditor-claimants in the\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   case, Distributor had a right to a judgment against Seven Stone, but it did not successfully assert any lien or attachment claim to the interpleaded funds. Being\n   named an interpleader defendant in stage one of the proceeding does not necessarily entitle a claimant to a portion of the interpleaded funds in stage two.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berryman v. Lannom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7016899\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/94/1238/#p1242\">\n    94 So.3d 1238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1242 (Miss. Ct.

Instead, it merely accelerates assertion of a claim[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Moore's Federal Practice\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 22.03[1][e]. At the second stage of the proceeding, \"each claimant has the burden of establishing the right\n   <em>\n    to the fund or property\n   </em>\n   by a preponderance of the evidence.\" Wright, Miller, &amp; Kane, Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc.

Distributor did not establish a right to the interpleaded fund originally held by Cosentino and owed to Seven Stone pursuant to the contract. As in\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   , the fact that Seven Stone owed money to Distributor did not give it \"a right to any interest in the [interpleaded funds]\" in the absence of a lien, attachment, or similar claim.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8511863\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tenn-app/22/90/\">\n    118 S.W.2d at 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the trial court should not have ordered the judgment in favor of Distributor to be paid from the interpleaded funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The second issue we perceive relates to the late fees. As noted above, Seven Stone did not file a response to the statement of undisputed material facts submitted in support of the motion for summary judgment filed by Distributor. \"Generally, 'the material facts set forth in the statement of the moving party may be deemed admitted in the absence of a statement controverting them by the opposing party.' \"\n   <em>\n    SunTrust Bank v.

See Declaration of Valerie Barnes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The attached documents included the sworn declaration of Valerie Barnes and documents maintained in the regular course of business of Distributor, including the account balance statement for Seven Stone. The trial court stated that it was \"not convinced\" that Seven Stone agreed to pay late fees and that this was \"a unilateral statement provided through the documents of [Distributor] to which there does not appear to be any acquiescence on the part of Seven Stone.\" However, the statement of undisputed facts, which the trial court adopted, expressly stated: \"It is undisputed that Seven Stone agreed to pay finance charges on the aged unpaid balances.\" Seven Stone did not submit any evidence to demonstrate that it did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   agree to the finance charges. It did not file a response to the motion for summary judgment, submit any evidence to dispute Distributor's documents, or respond to the\n   statement of undisputed facts in order to dispute its statements. Because the trial court stated that it was adopting the parties' statements of material fact, we conclude that the trial court should have also found that Seven Stone agreed to pay finance charges and owed Distributor $155,941.26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In sum, we conclude that Distributor was entitled to a judgment against Seven Stone for $155,941.26, but we conclude that Distributor was not entitled to payment of this sum from the interpleaded funds. As in\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   , the interpleaded funds must be paid to the party to whom it was owed absent some further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The trial court should have granted the motion for partial summary judgment filed by Seven Stone with respect to its exclusive right to the interpleaded funds, and we reverse the trial court's holding to the contrary. We affirm the trial court's order granting the motion for summary judgment filed by Distributor to the extent that it granted a judgment in favor of Distributor, but we modify the award to a sum of $155,941.26 and further modify the order to reflect that this amount is not to be paid from the interpleaded funds held by the court absent further proceedings in the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Unclean Hands\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Finally, we note Distributor's issue on appeal regarding whether the trial court should have held\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   that Seven Stone was not entitled to any relief in this case on the basis of unclean hands. We cannot say that the trial court erred in failing to apply this doctrine when it was not mentioned in the motion for summary judgment filed by Distributor and no actual evidence (i.e., documentary or testimonial) was submitted to the trial court to prove the facts alleged with regard to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   For the aforementioned reasons, the judgment of the trial court is hereby reversed in part, affirmed as modified, and remanded for further proceedings. Costs of this appeal are taxed equally to the appellant, Seven Stone Surface Fabrication, LLC, and to the appellee, Natural Stone Distributors, LLC, for which execution may issue if necessary.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Rule 22.02 of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure further provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n    Any property or amount involved as to which the party seeking interpleader admits liability may, upon order of the court, be deposited with the court or otherwise preserved, or secured by bond in amount sufficient to assure payment of the liability admitted.
