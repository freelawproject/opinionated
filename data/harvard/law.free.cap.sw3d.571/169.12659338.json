In 2014, King petitioned the Circuit Court of Buchanan County for conditional release pursuant to \u00a7 632.498.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The circuit court held an evidentiary hearing on King's petition. Following the hearing, the court concluded that King was not entitled to a trial on the merits of his petition for conditional release, because King had failed to prove \"by a preponderance of the evidence that [he] no longer suffers from a mental abnormality that makes [him] likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if released.\" \u00a7 632.498.4. King appeals. Because we conclude that the circuit court applied the wrong legal standard in determining whether King was entitled to a merits trial, we reverse, and remand for the circuit court to reevaluate King's evidence under the proper test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On July 1, 2005, King pleaded guilty in the Circuit Court of Buchanan County to one count of sexual abuse in violation of \u00a7 566.100, RSMo 2000, for an incident which occurred in January 2005. Case No. 05BU-CR00091-01. The circuit court sentenced King on August 18, 2005, to serve a sentence of three years' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   King was scheduled for release on January 10, 2008. Prior to his release, the State filed a petition pursuant to \u00a7 632.486 to have King involuntarily committed as a sexually violent predator. Case No. 08BU-PR00012. Following a jury trial, the circuit court ordered King to be committed. We affirmed King's involuntary commitment in\n   <em>\n    In re King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7299606\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/301/591/\">\n    301 S.W.3d 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. App. W.D. 2010) (\n   <em>\n    mem.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 5, 2014, King filed a petition for conditional release pursuant to \u00a7 632.498, alleging that \"he no longer suffers from a mental abnormality that makes him likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if conditionally released.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The circuit court held an evidentiary hearing on King's petition for conditional release on June 29, 2016. King was thirty-one years old on the date of the hearing. He testified that he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment on a charge of sexual abuse for acts committed when he was nineteen years old, and that he had been committed at the Sexual Offender Rehabilitation and Treatment Center (\"SORTS\") in Farmington since completing his sentence in 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In support of his petition, King offered testimony from forensic psychologist Dr. Luis Rosell. Dr. Rosell began working with King in 2011. Dr. Rosell offered his opinion, to a reasonable degree of psychological certainty, that King was \"not more likely than not to re-offend\" if conditionally released. Dr. Rosell testified that, in formulating his opinion, he considered the conditions for release described in \u00a7 632.505.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The State presented the testimony of Dr. Kimberly Bye, a psychologist at the Southeast Missouri Mental Health Center, who evaluated King in April 2016. Dr. Bye\n   testified that King had made improvements in some areas. She opined to a reasonable degree of psychological certainty \"that there is evidence that, since his commitment, Mr. King's mental abnormality has changed.\" Dr. Bye testified, however, that in her opinion King was not \"safe to be at large,\" because he had not fully addressed all factors that put him at risk of re-offending, and needed to further develop his risk management plan. Dr. Bye testified that she did not consider any of the conditions for release specified in \u00a7 632.505 in conducting her evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The State also submitted the deposition testimony of Dr. Sujatha Ramesh, who wrote an annual review of King in June 2015 while she was employed by the Department of Mental Health. Dr. Ramesh concluded that, while King had \"made some treatment progress,\" in her opinion he had \"not yet addressed his most relevant dynamic risk factors enough that there's a change in his risk.\" The dynamic risk factors which King had failed to address included \"his deviant sexual interest [in nonconsensual sex] and his grievance and hostility thinking,\" which Dr. Ramesh characterized as \"pivotal critical issues when it comes to his risk.\" Dr. Ramesh testified that she had not factored the statutory release conditions described in \u00a7 632.505 into her risk assessment, because in her view King's \"deviant sexual interest and grievance and hostility are not going to be sufficiently managed just by looking at the condition[s].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Under \u00a7 632.498.4, an involuntarily committed individual is entitled to a merits trial on his or her petition for conditional release \"[i]f the court at the hearing determines by a preponderance of the evidence that the person no longer suffers from a mental abnormality that makes the person likely to engage in acts of sexual violence\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     if released\n    </em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.) During the hearing, the parties disputed the meaning of the statutory phrase \"if released.\" The State argued that, even though King was petitioning for\n   <em>\n    conditional\n   </em>\n   release, the court was required to consider whether he presented a risk of committing future acts of sexual violence if released into the community\n   <em>\n    without restrictions.\n   </em>\n   King's counsel argued, to the contrary, that under the relevant statutes, King was only entitled to be released under the conditions specified in \u00a7 632.505, and that the court must evaluate his risk of re-offense in light of those conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing, the circuit court indicated its agreement with the State's interpretation of the relevant statutes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-19\">\n   I think it's pretty apparent from reviewing the statutes that he would go on a conditional release, but that's not the standard for the jury to consider or for me to make a determination of whether or not the jury trial is ... scheduled....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [T]he law ... states that the standard to be applied is if released. And then if I - if that finding is made, is not likely to commit acts of sexual violence if released, the Court shall place the person on conditional release. That's how I read it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   When King's counsel argued that \"Dr. Rosell [wa]s entitled to consider the conditions of [King's] release in formulating his opinion,\" the court responded that \"that's not the standard in [\u00a7] 632.498.\" The court agreed with counsel for the State that \"Dr. Rosell used the wrong legal standard in evaluating Mr. King.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After the court entered its judgment denying King's petition for conditional release, King filed this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   King argues that the circuit court applied the wrong legal standard in assessing whether he was entitled to a merits trial on his petition for conditional release. The circuit court evaluated King's dangerousness on the assumption that he would be released without restrictions or supervision. King argues, on the contrary, that his risk of re-offense must be assessed in light of the conditions which \u00a7 632.505 requires the court to impose on released offenders.

Section 632.498.1 requires the Director of the Department of Mental Health, on an annual basis, to conduct an examination of the mental health of every involuntarily committed sexually violent predator who has not been conditionally released. If the Director determines in that annual review \"that the person's mental abnormality has so changed that the person is not likely to commit acts of sexual violence if released, the director shall authorize the person to petition the court for release.\" \u00a7 632.501.

During the first trial, the burden of proof is on the offender to prove \"by a preponderance of the evidence that the person no longer suffers from a mental abnormality that makes the person likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if released.\" \u00a7 632.498.4. If the court determines that the offender has satisfied this initial burden, then the second, merits trial is held. Section 632.498.5(3) specifies that \"[t]he burden of proof at the trial shall be upon the state to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the committed person's mental abnormality remains such that the person is not safe to be at large and if released is likely to engage in acts of sexual violence.\"\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Unless otherwise indicated, statutory citations refer to the 2016 edition of the Revised Statutes of Missouri, updated through the 2018 Cumulative Supplement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Section 632.498.5(4) specifies the different outcomes which can result from the merits trial:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n    If the court or jury finds that the person's mental abnormality remains such that the person is not safe to be at large and if released is likely to engage in acts of sexual violence, the person shall remain in the custody of the department of mental health in a secure facility designated by the director of the department of mental health.

The current sexually violent predator statutes use the terms \"release\" and \"conditional release\" interchangeably. Thus, the statutes on multiple occasions refer to a committed person's right to \"petition for release\" (\u00a7\u00a7 632.498.2, 632.501, 632.504), to \"the jurisdiction into which the committed person is to be released\" (\u00a7\u00a7 632.498.3, 632.501), and to \"postponement of release\" (\u00a7 632.507.2). These statutory provisions can only be read to refer to an offender's release\n    <em>\n     under the conditions specified in \u00a7 632.505\n    </em>\n    , since that is the only form of \"release\" which currently exists under the statutes.

That form of unconditional \"discharge\" no longer exists, however. As the Supreme Court has explained, following the 2006 amendments to the relevant statutes \"[a]n offender released under the amended version of section 632.498 remains committed to custody,\" and is only entitled to \"be 'conditionally released as provided in section 632.505.' \"\n    <em>\n     State ex rel.

The circuit court erred in evaluating the evidence under a release scenario which will not, and cannot, ever exist under the current version of the sexually violent predator statutes.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    As we explained in a case involving the commitment of persons found not guilty of a crime by reason of mental disease or defect,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n    Conditional and unconditional releases are not the same.

The legislature created the different forms of release, conditional release and unconditional release, recognizing the value of tailoring the release program to the individual case. The factors to be considered in an unconditional release case differ from those to be considered in conditional release cases.... [\u00b6] The different standards for release are designed to balance the committed person's right to freedom from confinement against the community's interest in safety.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    <em>\n     State v. Weekly\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9111592,9111550\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/107/340/\">\n     107 S.W.3d 340\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 349 (Mo. App. W.D. 2003). The circuit court in this case erred by applying standards applicable to unconditional release in a case in\n    which King was only eligible for, and was only seeking, conditional release.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    As King points out, the circuit court's interpretation of \"if released\" also creates potential constitutional problems. According to the circuit court's interpretation, to be entitled to\n    <em>\n     conditional\n    </em>\n    release, King was required to prove that he \"no longer suffers from a mental abnormality that makes him likely to engage in acts of sexual violence\" if he was released\n    <em>\n     without condition\n    </em>\n    , and without supervision. Having proved that he did not present a danger if given his unrestricted freedom, however, King would\n    <em>\n     then\n    </em>\n    be subject to release under the highly intrusive and restrictive conditions listed in \u00a7 632.505.3, and other conditions imposed by the court. As the Missouri Supreme Court has explained, however, even if an individual's involuntary commitment was\n    <em>\n     originally\n    </em>\n    justified, \" 'it could not constitutionally continue after a basis no longer existed.' \"\n    <em>\n     Murrell\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8329118\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/215/96/#p104\">\n     215 S.W.3d at 104\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     O'Connor\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9560\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/563/#p575\">\n     422 U.S. at 575\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9560\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/563/#p575\">\n     95 S.Ct. 2486\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ).

If King were able to satisfy the circuit court's standard, and prove that he presents no threat of reoffending if released\n    <em>\n     without restriction\n    </em>\n    , we question whether there would then be a constitutionally sufficient basis to subject him to the restrictions found in \u00a7 632.505.3.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    The phrase \"if released\" in \u00a7 632.498.4 must be read to refer to the type of release King was seeking, and the only type of release that was available to him: namely, release subject to the conditions specified in \u00a7 632.505.3. The testimony of King's expert witness, Dr. Rosell, did not apply an incorrect legal standard by referencing the release conditions mandated by \u00a7 632.505.3, and his testimony should not have been disregarded by the circuit court on that basis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    King argues that, if this Court concludes that the circuit court applied an incorrect legal standard, this Court should determine on its own that King is entitled to a trial on the merits of his petition for conditional release. We decline to assess the evidence in the first instance on appeal. Section 632.498.4 provides that an offender is entitled to a merits trial only \"[i]f the court at the hearing determines by a preponderance of the evidence that the person no longer suffers from a mental abnormality that makes the person likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if released.\" The Supreme Court has explained that \"[t]he preponderance of the evidence standard is a weighing standard, where the fact-finder must consider whether the greater weight of the evidence supports release.\"\n    <em>\n     Coffman\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8305248\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/225/439/#p442\">\n     225 S.W.3d at 444\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Court distinguished the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard from the \"probable cause\" standard in an earlier version of \u00a7 632.498, which \"d[id] not require the fact-finder to weigh conflicting evidence.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8305248\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/225/439/#p442\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Because the standard in \u00a7 632.498.4 requires the circuit court to weigh conflicting evidence to determine whether the offender has proven his lack of dangerousness by the greater weight of the evidence, this determination is appropriately made by the circuit court under the correct legal standards, not by this Court on appeal. We therefore remand this case to the circuit court to determine whether King satisfied the standard of \u00a7 632.498.4 (interpreted consistently with this opinion), and whether he is therefore entitled to a merits trial on his petition for conditional release.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The judgment of the circuit court is reversed, and the case is remanded for\n    further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    All concur.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
