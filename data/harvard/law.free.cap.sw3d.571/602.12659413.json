KCPS contends the circuit court, 1) erred in denying KCPS's motions for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict, arguing that most of KCPS's alleged retaliatory acts occurred before Plaintiffs filed complaints of discrimination, and the remaining alleged retaliatory acts were not supported by substantial evidence, 2) erred in denying KCPS's motion for new trial for instructional error, arguing that the verdict directors on Plaintiffs' retaliation claims included a disjunctive list of alleged retaliatory acts, some or all of which were non-actionable events occurring before Plaintiffs engaged in protected activity or were not supported by substantial evidence, and 3) erred in awarding attorneys' fees to Plaintiffs in the requested amount because the factors for determining an appropriate fee award did not support Plaintiffs' request. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background and Procedural Information\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the light most favorable to the jury verdicts, the evidence at trial showed:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   KCPS employed Danny Holmes beginning in November 2013; he was forty-six years old at the time of trial. KCPS employed Paul White beginning in 1994; he was fifty years old at the time of trial. Both men were hired as patrol officers in the security department of KCPS and worked the midnight shift, also referred to as \"watch one\" or \"dog watch.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2014, KCPS had approximately sixty officers on staff. Major Marcus Harris was the Security Director responsible for operating KCPS's security department. Sergeant Robert Vick was a first line patrol supervisor and the direct supervisor of Holmes and White.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2013, Sergeant Kevin LaBranche was assigned by Major Harris to the patrol division of the security department. Beginning in 2013, White became concerned with Sergeant LaBranche's behavior toward him. At that time, White had worked for KCPS nineteen years. Although LaBranche was the day shift supervisor, not White's direct supervisor, he was present when White's shifts ended. White believed LaBranche was singling him out daily and unjustifiably scrutinizing White's log sheets, while not subjecting others to such scrutiny. In June 2013, White initiated a meeting with Major Harris who had an open door policy for reporting complaints. White expressed concern he was being targeted because of his age and was concerned he could lose his job. Harris reassured White that Harris had heard nothing to that effect and told him not to worry, White would not lose his job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   One year later, White received a low rating on the \"Teamwork\" portion of a June 2014 performance evaluation, in part for having made the complaint to Harris. Sergeant Vick stated in the evaluation: \"Officer White had issues with his work activities being scrutinized by another first line supervisor.\" Sergeant Vick confirmed at trial that White made this complaint after Sergeant LaBranche suggested to Major Harris that LeBranche be allowed to review the activity logs of outgoing officers to \"see where they've been and what they had done, if their reports were complete and proper.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Also justifying White's low \"teamwork\" rating was that \"Officer White also had issues with working mandatory overtime during the last two weeks of school to comply with a mandate issued by the superintendent to provide extra security at the high schools.\" This comment stemmed from White complaining to a Union representative in April 2014 that overtime was being improperly assigned. Fellow officer, Holmes, had reported to Sergeant Vick the same concerns; dog shift officers were required to perform mandatory overtime and day shift was exempt. When Holmes's concerns were not taken seriously, Holmes and other officers, including White, spoke with the Union. Immediately thereafter, Sergeant Vick advised them that anyone complaining to the Union would \"be severely dealt with.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The mandatory overtime continued until the end of the school year. Hamburg, a younger officer, received the same mandate for the shift ending just before Plaintiffs' shift (evening shift). Hamburg testified that when he complained, the rule changed the following day to allow voluntary assignments prior to mandatory overtime being enforced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In August 2014, White was interviewed regarding a formal age discrimination complaint Holmes filed with the human resources department of KCPS. White reported in that interview that the first day he was held over for mandatory overtime, Holmes told him that Sergeant LaBranche apologized for holding Holmes over, but that was the only way they could get White to work due to White's seniority, and they were \"trying to get rid of the old regime.\" White reported a belief that officers were being harassed because of their age and seniority; he believed the \"older regime\" was being terminated. He reported that he \"had witnessed ... how the younger officers were getting better treated.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   LaBranche was also the sergeant Holmes answered to when he completed his shifts. Prior to mandatory overtime starting, Holmes testified that his first meeting with LaBranche regarded a report Holmes completed during a shift he worked with White. During that shift, Holmes and White assisted with getting three young males out of a vacant school that was considered a dangerous building. After accomplishing this, White made a telephone notification to Sergeant Vick. Holmes told White that he would complete the written report because Holmes was more familiar with those types of reports and already knew the names of several of the assisting Kansas City police officers. When Holmes gave the report to LaBranche, LaBranche told him, \"Don't let the older guys take advantage of you\" and wanted to know why White did not complete the report; Holmes told LaBranche that he volunteered. LaBranche told Holmes, \"Well, we're trying to get rid of the old regime; don't let them take advantage of you.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In May 2014, Holmes reported concerns to KCPS's Human Relations Department; it can be inferred that these concerns included allegations of age discrimination because the Employee and Labor Relations Specialist for KCPS, Marilyn Overton, mailed Holmes a \"Discrimination-Harassment Complaint Form\" on May 29, 2014. The completed form included allegations of age discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Like White, on June 13, 2014, Holmes received a low rating in the area of \"teamwork\" on his performance evaluation completed by Sergeant Vick. Sergeant Vick supported the low rating by stating Holmes \"became upset during the last two weeks of school when the superintendent issued a mandate requiring extra security personnel in the high schools. He was required to work overtime as a result of the mandate along with other officers as well as management.\" This was the only low rating Holmes received.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Holmes returned his completed \"Discrimination-Harassment Complaint Form\" on July 31, 2014. Therein he alleged that supervisors were scheduling overtime in a discriminatory pattern based on age. He alleged that supervisors attempted to sow discontent between the shifts and bully and harass members of the union. Officers were told that anyone going to the Union with their complaints would be \"dealt with\" and \"terminated.\" Among other complaints, Holmes reported that Sergeant Vick told him he had to work overtime because the \"old regime knew the policy.\" Officers were told they would be forced to work over every day and there was nothing they could do about it. Holmes alleged that the conduct was targeted only against the older members of staff and that the supervisors had made repeated comments to Holmes and others that they were \"getting rid of the old guard.\" Holmes asked KCPS to investigate, train supervisors on the proper policy regarding mandatory overtime, and instruct regarding the illegality\n   of implementing action based on age or seniority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   KCPS's Employee and Labor Relations Specialist, Overton, investigated Holmes's formal complaint by interviewing LaBranche and Vick as the persons allegedly responsible for the discrimination, as well as witnesses identified by Holmes, including White. When interviewed by Overton, Holmes repeated the concerns raised in his formal complaint and gave additional examples supporting his allegations. Holmes reported that in his work evaluation, he was given a low score for \"teamwork\" and believed it was because he complained about the overtime issues. Holmes stated that an employee demoted from a supervisory position told him that supervisors would discuss terminating tenured employees during meetings. When asked about this, Sergeant LaBranche stated that during supervisory meetings the work performance of veteran officers would sometimes be discussed as well as \"how the older officers don't like to change.\" When White was interviewed, he affirmed his belief that officers were being harassed because of age and seniority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Officer William Hamburg was interviewed by Overton. He told Overton that Sergeant Vick told him to be careful who he was associating with. He believed Vick referenced the older officers who did not want to \"convert to the new ways of doing things.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Upon completing her investigation Overton concluded that the overtime procedure was not being properly followed. She found no evidence of age discrimination, however, because officers younger than forty were also subject to the overtime procedure. Security Director Harris issued a \"Letter of Reprimand\" in October 2014 to Sergeant Vick for his role in not following established overtime policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The improper application of overtime ended in May 2014 when the school year ended, and began again in August 2014 when the new school year began. The August overtime lasted approximately three weeks. After the school year was underway and the need for extra coverage faded out, the overtime ended. Almost immediately thereafter and effective September 9, 2014, however, the shift schedule for patrol officers changed. As officers on the midnight shift, Holmes's and White's schedules changed in the following manner: before the shift change, Holmes and White started their shifts at 10:00 p.m. and ended their shifts at 6:30 a.m., before students arrived at school. After the shift change, Holmes and White started their shifts at 11:30 p.m. and ended their shifts at 8:00 a.m. This required Holmes and White to conduct intake of students at the end of their shifts. The shift change reduced the number of officers on duty during intake, one of the most crucial times of the school day in terms of safety. It replaced fresh, morning officers with night shift officers who had worked all night and were already weary. In deposition testimony, Sergeant Vick stated that the shift change was made as punishment for officers' complaints. At trial, Vick testified that his prior testimony was a mistake; he meant to say that, in response to officers' complaints regarding overtime, the new schedule was designed to help them by reducing overtime. According to Vick's testimony, however, the need for overtime had already ended when the schedule change was implemented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   KCPS's internal investigation into Holmes's complaints concluded in October 2014. Holmes and White filed charges of discrimination with the Missouri Commission on Human Rights that same month. On June 29, 2015, after receiving notices of right to sue, Holmes and White filed suit against KCPS alleging discrimination and retaliation under the MHRA. On December\n   9, 2016, a jury returned verdicts in favor of KCPS on Plaintiffs' discrimination claims and in favor of Plaintiffs on their retaliation claims. The jury awarded Holmes and White $3,000 each in compensatory damages. The court entered judgment on the verdicts January 24, 2017. Plaintiffs filed a motion to amend the judgment to award attorneys' fees and costs, and KCPS filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) or new trial. On May 5, 2017, the trial court granted Plaintiffs' motion for attorneys' fees and costs and denied KCPS's motion for JNOV and new trial. This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    Point I - Motions for Directed Verdict and JNOV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In its first point on appeal, KCPS contends the circuit court erred in denying its motions for directed verdict and JNOV, arguing Plaintiffs failed to make submissible claims for retaliation under the MHRA because most of the alleged retaliatory acts occurred before Plaintiffs filed their complaints of discrimination, and the remaining alleged retaliatory acts were not supported by substantial evidence of adverse employment action resulting from protected activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   To withstand a motion for JNOV, Plaintiffs needed to offer substantial evidence to support every fact essential to liability.\n   <em>\n    Soto v.

To determine whether the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict, an appellate court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.

App. 2016) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We find the grounds specified in KCPS's motion for directed verdict significantly different than those argued on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   At trial, KCPS argued three grounds for Plaintiffs' alleged failure to make submissible claims of retaliation under the MHRA: (1) insufficient evidence to support a reasonable, good faith belief that age discrimination had occurred when Plaintiffs' pre-May 2014 complaints were made, (2) insufficient evidence Plaintiffs were subject to any adverse employment action, and (3) insufficient evidence of a causal connection between complaints of discrimination and the alleged adverse employment actions. On appeal, KCPS asserts the following grounds for Plaintiffs' alleged failure to make submissible claims of retaliation: (1) most of the alleged retaliatory acts occurred before Plaintiffs filed their complaints of discrimination, and (2) for the remaining alleged retaliatory acts, there was insufficient evidence of adverse employment action taken as a result of protected activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We find that KCPS's first claim regarding timing was not articulated to the trial court. We disagree with KCPS's contention that it sufficiently preserved this issue by generally alleging Plaintiffs had not presented sufficient evidence of adverse action prompted by protected activity. In KCPS's motion for JNOV, KCPS essentially conceded Plaintiffs made complaints of discrimination prior to the alleged retaliatory acts. KCPS argued: \"Plaintiff's retaliation claims are predicated on complaints of age discrimination\n   <em>\n    made prior to May of 2014\n   </em>\n   .... The evidence at trial, however, conclusively showed a complete lack of good faith or reasonable belief that age discrimination had occurred\n   <em>\n    when Plaintiffs made these complaints.\n   </em>\n   \" Lack of\n   a reasonable belief age discrimination had occurred at the time a complaint was made is a distinct issue from whether a complaint was actually made at a given time and could be linked to retaliation thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Where KCPS acknowledged complaints of age discrimination were made prior to May 2014 and argued other grounds for believing Plaintiffs failed to make a submissible case of retaliation in relation to those complaints, KCPS failed to put its timing claim before the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"We will not convict a trial court of error on an issue that it had no chance to decide.\"\n   <em>\n    Reed v.

App. 2016) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). KCPS, therefore, waived the timing argument it makes for the first time on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   What remains of KCPS's first point is its contention that, for the\n   <em>\n    remaining alleged retaliatory acts\n   </em>\n   , there was insufficient evidence of adverse employment action taken as a result of protected activity. Specifically, KCPS argues that the only alleged retaliatory act occurring after Plaintiffs' complaints was the September 2014 shift change which delayed shift beginning/ending times by ninety minutes. KCPS argues the shift change cannot be considered retaliatory as a matter of law because it was applied \"across the board\" and, further, Plaintiffs were not damaged by it. Yet, because KCPS failed to preserve its claims regarding all alleged acts of retaliation, and does not dispute that proof of at least some of those acts (post-complaint) would justify submitting the case to the jury, review of KCPS's shift change argument can bring no relief on this point.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the requisite elements for submitting a retaliation claim to the jury were arguably met with proof of other alleged acts of retaliation for which KCPS failed to preserve error, KCPS's entire point fails.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The Schumacher Group, Ltd. v.

App. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Moreover, we note that, while KCPS focuses on the sufficiency of the evidence related to how the jury was instructed, submissibility does not hinge on jury instruction. KCPS's motion for directed verdict was made prior to instruction discussions. The court, therefore, did not consider the evidence as applied to specific instructions; the court considered the evidence in light of the elements required to support each claim.\n   <em>\n    Dodson v.

Likewise, Holmes presented sufficient evidence that: (1) In April 2014 Holmes complained to his Union representative about the improper assignment of overtime, and the Union representative discussed this complaint with KCPS management. It can be reasonably inferred that this complaint encompassed allegations of age discrimination and/or Holmes himself made a direct, contemporaneous age discrimination complaint to KCPS because KCPS mailed an \"Employee Discrimination-Harassment Complaint Form\" to Holmes on May 29, 2014. Holmes's completed form included allegations that the improper assignment of overtime was age related; (2) thereafter Holmes received a low rating on the \"Teamwork\" portion of a performance evaluation, was subjected to overtime other officers were not subjected to, and was punished with a schedule change after complaining about the improper assignment of overtime; (3) a causal relationship existed between the complaints and the adverse action, and; (4) Holmes was thereby damaged. Additionally, if believed by the jury, other adverse employment actions made after White's and Holmes's complaints included the continuation of mandatory overtime in violation of policy, threats that Plaintiffs would be severely dealt with for making grievances, management instructing younger employees to disassociate from Plaintiffs, and denial of time off/vacation time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   KCPS's first point on appeal is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    Point II - Instructional Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In its second point on appeal, KCPS contends that the circuit court erred by erroneously instructing the jury on Plaintiffs' retaliation claims by including a disjunctive list of alleged retaliatory acts, some or all of which were non-actionable events occurring before Plaintiffs engaged in protected activity or were not supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Whether a jury was properly instructed is a question of law this Court reviews\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   This Court reviews the record in the light most favorable to submission of the instruction.

First, the verdict directors misdirected the jury because the events constituting retaliation were erroneously listed disjunctively because all listed events were not independently actionable in that: 1) Assignment of mandatory overtime was not actionable because there was no substantial evidence showing Plaintiffs were targeted for overtime assignments, 2) The shift change was not actionable because it applied across the board to all employees, and 3) The other events were not actionable because they were \"petty slights and annoyances\" not rising to the level of adverse employment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Second, KCPS contended the verdict directors were erroneous because the retaliation verdict director should have been presented under a hostile work environment theory due to the age discrimination claim being presented on a hostile work environment theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Third, KCPS contended the verdict directors should have specified the complaints at issue and tied those complaints to specific events alleged to have occurred in retaliation. KCPS argued,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   [T]he record included evidence that both formal and informal complaints had been made a various times between May and October of 2014. Without specifying the complaints at issue and tying those complaints to specific events alleged to have occurred in retaliation, the verdict directors create a propensity for mismatch between protected activity and the acts of reprisal that are necessary to sustain a retaliation claim under the MHRA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   On appeal, KCPS first contends the verdict directors were erroneous because the disjunctive list of alleged retaliatory acts contained events occurring before Plaintiffs engaged in protected activity; KCPS argues Holmes first engaged in protected activity in July 2014 by filing a complaint with KCPS's Human\n   Resources, and White first engaged in protected activity in October 2014\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   by filing a charge with the Missouri Commission on Human Rights.

As such, they are waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Likewise, KCPS argues for the first time on appeal that, while both Holmes and White made complaints in April 2014 to the Union, these were not protected acts under the MHRA because they were not complaints about age discrimination. Yet, as discussed above, in its motion for new trial KCPS stated that, \"Plaintiff's retaliation claims are predicated on complaints of age discrimination\n   <em>\n    made prior to May of 2014\n   </em>\n   .... The evidence at trial, however, conclusively showed a complete lack of good faith or reasonable belief that age discrimination had occurred\n   <em>\n    when Plaintiffs made these complaints.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The only complaints made prior to May 2014 were White's age discrimination complaint in June 2013 and Plaintiffs' Union complaints in April 2014. We note that, both Holmes's and White's verdict directors include as an adverse employment action \"that Management threatened Plaintiff that if he went to the Union\n   <em>\n    about his Age Discrimination Complaint\n   </em>\n   'he would be severely dealt with.' \" The evidence at trial showed that this threat was made immediately after Plaintiffs' April 2014 meeting with the Union. If KCPS believed the Union complaint did not include age discrimination, KCPS should have directed the court's attention to this assumption within the verdict directors. KCPS did not and has waived this argument on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Additionally, KCPS did not argue, either at trial or in its motion for new trial, that there was no evidence White was denied requested time off or vacation. This argument is also waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The claims remaining under KCPS's second point on appeal are: 1) management's instruction to a younger employee to not to talk to Plaintiffs was improperly included in the verdict directors as this was mere \"snubbing\" which is not an adverse action sufficient to support a retaliation claim, and there was no evidence Plaintiffs were damaged, and 2) the shift change was not actionable because it applied to both young and old officers and caused no damage to Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The lack of damages arguments were never articulated to the trial court at trial or in KCPS's motion for new trial. They are, therefore, waived. Although the remaining contentions were not articulated at trial, they were, however, included in some form in KCPS's motion for new trial. Even if KCPS's inclusion of these claims in its motion for new trial sufficiently preserved these arguments, we find them meritless nonetheless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Holmes testified at trial that the working conditions during the shift change in the fall of 2014 were \"a little rough\" because some of the officers Holmes trained had been told not to talk to him. When Overton investigated Holmes's complaint of discrimination she interviewed Travis Hamburg, a younger officer, who told her that Sergeant Vick told him to be careful who he was associating with. Hamburg believed Vick was referencing older employees who \"did not convert to new ways of doing things.\" Sergeant Vick gave both Holmes and White poor performance ratings in the area of teamwork for their \"attitude,\" stemming from Vick's belief\n   they were \"poisoning the department\" and \"hurting the morale of the department\" by discussing their concerns among fellow employees. He testified that Holmes was an experienced officer who other officers looked up to. He expressed that new officers could be poisoned by someone with a bad attitude and that could \"spread among the ranks.\" He testified that White had also been involved in such \"break room talk\" and these discussions among the newer officers prompted this low rating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Hamburg, who worked the shift prior to Plaintiff's shift, was also advised that officers on his shift would be required to report to work four hours early, and that the overnight shift would stay four hours late every day. Hamburg complained to a Union representative regarding his shift change and testified that the following day his shift was able to first volunteer for overtime before it became mandatory. The same did not occur for Plaintiffs' shift after Plaintiffs complained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Here, KCPS relies on the expertise of senior officers to train and mentor new officers, who must then work in partnership to complete tasks and protect each other. We cannot conclude that instructing fledgling officers to avoid, not talk to, and shun the advice of a senior officer because that officer made an age discrimination complaint cannot be considered retaliatory in the context of the MHRA. The amount of damages Plaintiffs sustained as a result of this behavior was a question most appropriately left to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   With regard to the August 2014 shift change, Sergeant Vick testified in a deposition that it was implemented as punishment for officers' complaints. The fact that the shift change was applied to all officers on that shift, including younger officers, does not negate the possibility that it was done in retaliation for Holmes's and White's complaints of age discrimination and in further pursuit of encouraging older officers (who management perceived to dislike change) to voluntarily remove themselves from employment. The shift change added substantial new duties to the end of Plaintiffs' shift.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Point two is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    Point III - Attorneys' Fees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In its third point on appeal, KCPS contends the circuit court abused its discretion in awarding attorneys' fees to Plaintiffs in the requested amount of $226,562 because the factors for determining an appropriate fee award did not support Plaintiffs' request. KCPS argues Plaintiffs achieved only a nominal degree of success, failed to provide a proper lodestar calculation of counsel's fees, and did not identify any countervailing factors that would otherwise justify the fee award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \"We review the trial court's award of reasonable attorney's fees for an abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Hill v.

KCPS contends that, because the court made no reduction in the fee award, the trial court failed to consider the degree of\n   success obtained. Yet, degree of success in civil rights claims is not wholly measured by monetary damages and, as noted above, one of the reasons for authorizing attorneys' fees under the MHRA is \"to deflect that discrimination\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   may result in nominal or small monetary damages.\"\n   <em>\n    DeWalt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6901596,6901541\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/449/401/\">\n    449 S.W.3d at 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While KCPS characterizes the $6,000 compensatory award as \"a compromise verdict that does not truly reflect a determination of liability or damages based on the evidence, but suggests only that the jury made the award for collective appeasement,\" this is contrary to our presumption that the jury followed the trial court's instructions.\n   <em>\n    Dieser v. St. Anthony's Medical Center\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187661\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/498/419/#p435\">\n    498 S.W.3d 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 435 (Mo. banc 2016). The jury was instructed that it could only award damages if retaliation had occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   KCPS argued to the jury that Plaintiffs were attempting a \"shake down\" and entitled to nothing: \"So [Holmes is] thinking, you know what, I don't want to work the overtime, but I'll sue them and try to get a jury to give me some money. This is a shake down.\" KCPS asked Holmes on cross-examination, \"Mr. Holmes, you're here asking for money, aren't you?\" Holmes replied, \"I just want some resolution, I want some closure, and I understand that monetary award, whatever my lawyers present, that's - you know, that's not - I'm not, you know, asking for any set dollar amount. I just want some closure and I want everything to be fixed.\" Holmes testified that because the investigation into his concerns had been handled exclusively by KCPS, he filed a complaint with the Missouri Human Rights Commission so \"[a]t least they would give an independent stand on what's actually going on based on the evidence.\" Holmes testified that he very much liked his job but wanted KCPS to \"go by the rules\" and not selectively enforce rules or use overtime as a means of punishment. Plaintiff White was never asked at trial about seeking monetary damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Given that neither Holmes nor White testified to quantifiable damages, and Holmes testified that monetary damages were insignificant compared to his desire for resolution and closure, the $6,000 compensatory award does not necessarily represent a low degree of \"success\" in this matter or that liability was not truly determined.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, allegations of retaliation under the MHRA necessarily involve claims that Plaintiffs attempted to resolve an issue of concern by bringing attention to that concern, only to be retaliated against. While damages are a necessary part of litigating such a claim, it does not follow that every plaintiff filing suit is seeking vindication solely through the recovery of monetary damages. While this jury may have only had authority to award monetary damages, we cannot agree with KCPS that the $6,000 award of compensatory\n   damages cheapens the ultimate conclusion reached by this jury - KCPS violated the MHRA by retaliating against Holmes and White after they complained of discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   KCPS further contends the trial court erred in its award of fees because \"Plaintiffs have filed run-of-the-mill MHRA claims with no special import or significance on the development of civil rights law in Missouri or elsewhere.\" KCPS relies heavily on\n   <em>\n    DeWalt v.

As we and other courts have stated, the degree of success is crucial. That success is partially measured by how much of the plaintiff's requested relief he actually recovered. But courts must keep in mind that even small verdicts in MHRA cases may still reflect a high degree of success when properly considered in light of the nature and importance of the subject matter in the particular case. We note that not all civil rights claims are of the same nature or of equal importance. Therefore, the consideration of this factor, and the others, as well as the ultimate determination of fees requires a case-specific analysis.
