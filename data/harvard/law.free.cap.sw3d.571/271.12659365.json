Old American had insisted on receiving a final, complete death certificate that specified the insured's cause of death before paying the benefits, which it paid during the pendency of the litigation; Lincoln Factoring had insisted on receiving the benefits upon proof of the insured's death. Proceeding under a theory that Old American paid the benefits eight months too late, Lincoln Factoring pleaded claims for violations of chapters 541 and 542 of the Texas Insurance Code, violations of the Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act (DTPA), breach of contract, and breach of the common law duty of good faith and fair dealing. Resolving opposing motions for summary judgment, the trial court's final judgment awarded Lincoln Factoring treble damages, attorney's fees, and interest-but no actual damages-for Old American's failure to promptly pay the benefits. On grounds of legal insufficiency and standing, we conclude that as a matter of law, Lincoln Factoring cannot recover damages on the\n   claims it pleaded. We therefore reverse the trial court's judgment and render a take-nothing judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Rebecca Barnes bought a life insurance policy from Old American in 2011. The policy carried a general benefit of $10,000 upon her death and an additional $10,000 benefit upon proof that her death was \"accidental\" as defined by the policy. Old American agreed to pay the death benefit when it received proof of Barnes's \"covered death.\" The policy did not contain a homicide exclusion-no language expressly precluded the payment of benefits to a beneficiary who killed the insured. While the policy excluded coverage if Barnes committed suicide within two years of the policy's effective date, she was still living two years after she bought the policy, and this exclusion therefore became inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Barnes died on September 28, 2014. Her original, incomplete death certificate, issued by the District of Columbia, where she resided at the time of her death, stated that the manner of her death was pending investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 12, 2014, Frank Howard-Barnes's fianc\u00e9 and the policy's sole beneficiary-assigned his entitlement to $4,725 of the proceeds to Payne Support Services, a funeral home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Howard authorized Payne Support Services or its assigns to act for him \"with full power to make collection of, compromise, settle[,] and [receive] ... the proceeds\" of Barnes's policy. On the same day, Payne Support Services assigned its entitlement to the $4,725 in proceeds to Lincoln Factoring. Lincoln Factoring sent the notarized assignments and the claim form to Old American. Howard also assigned the entitlement to $1,884.75 of the proceeds to Heritage Memorial Cemetery, which reassigned that entitlement to American Capital Funding, LLC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 21, 2014, Lincoln Factoring sent Old American a letter purporting to confirm a verbal representation that Old American would recognize the partial assignment of the right to benefits to Lincoln Factoring and that Old American would \"remit [a] check in payment of the proceeds.\" Two days later, Old American acknowledged receipt of the claim but stated in a letter that it \"need[ed] a copy of the death certificate\" to pay it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In December 2014, Lincoln Factoring sent a demand letter to Old American. Lincoln Factoring asserted that Old American's decision to wait for a final determination of the cause of death before paying the policy's proceeds was an \"out of contract demand [that Old American had] no basis to make.\" Lincoln Factoring's letter stated in part,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Your company has no right to demand of the claimant under a policy more information concerning the death of the insured than is called for by the terms of the contract or is required by the known and established uses of the insurance business....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   A PENDING DEATH CERTIFICATE is proof of death sufficient for your company to pay the proceeds....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Under Texas [law], you have a duty to conduct an investigation which includes a phone call to the local police department to determine if the cause of death will be ruled a homicide and if it is, is the beneficiary a suspect.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   If the beneficiary is not a suspect[,] you have no basis to hold the claim up.... I will make only one demand for payment. If your payment is not forthcoming and if no arrangements are made to satisfy the debt, I will proceed to file a lawsuit immediately against you to collect this debt by all lawful means.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Approximately two weeks later, on December 30, 2014, Old American informed Lincoln Factoring that it was still delaying payment of the benefits. Old American's letter to Lincoln Factoring stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Thank you for providing the death certificate for this claim. However, because the cause of death is listed as still being \"under investigation,\" we cannot conclude our claim investigation at this time. The policy has an accidental death benefit rider and the cause of death is required information to determine if the [accidental death benefit] claim is payable. Further, the underlying life claim may be affected if the cause of death is homicide or suicide.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Please provide a death certificate with the cause of death determined ... as soon as that investigation is concluded.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A little more than a week later, Old American sent a letter to Lincoln Factoring stating that Old American still had not received a completed death certificate and that once Old American received the certificate, it would \"proceed with [Lincoln Factoring's] request for benefits.\" Old American sent similar letters to Lincoln Factoring in February 2015, March 2015, and April 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In March 2015, in a justice court, Lincoln Factoring sued Old American. Lincoln Factoring asserted that in Old American's delay of paying the benefits, it had violated several provisions within chapters 541 and 542 of the Texas Insurance Code; had committed actionable misrepresentations; had acted negligently; had violated the DTPA;\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   had breached the insurance policy; had committed conversion; had breached the common law duty of good faith and fair dealing; and had tortiously and negligently interfered with property rights. Lincoln Factoring asked for damages of $4,725, the amount of proceeds due under the partial assignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Old American received Barnes's final death certificate in June 2015. The certificate described her cause of death as hypertensive cardiovascular disease. Within days of receiving the final certificate, Old American paid all benefits under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Lincoln Factoring amended its pleading. In the amended pleading, Lincoln Factoring conceded that Old American had paid the benefits but still asserted claims for the recovery of \"the interest due, legal fees[,] and money for [Old American's]\" alleged breach of the insurance policy; its alleged violation of the DTPA; its alleged\n   breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing; and its alleged violations of the Texas Insurance Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After a trial, the justice court signed a judgment decreeing that Lincoln Factoring take nothing. Lincoln Factoring perfected a de novo appeal to the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In the trial court, Lincoln Factoring again amended its petition. In Lincoln Factoring's second amended petition-its final pleading-it alleged that Old American had delayed payment of benefits \"based on terms that ... were not in the life insurance policy[,] were not defined in the ... policy[,] and were adverse to state statutes. In addition, [Old American] failed to reasonably investigate the life insurance claim and made misrepresentations to delay payment.\" Lincoln Factoring pleaded claims for breach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and violations of the DTPA and of several provisions of chapters 541 and 542 of the Texas Insurance Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Each party filed a motion for summary judgment. Lincoln Factoring argued that its lawsuit was\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   about an insurance company who delayed payment of a life insurance policy for eight months based on terms that ... were not in the life insurance policy; were not defined in the life insurance policy; and were adverse to state statutes. In addition, the insurance company failed to reasonably investigate the life insurance claim and made misrepresentations about the life insurance policy to delay payment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   After considering the motions and responses to the motions, the trial court granted Lincoln Factoring's motion and denied Old American's motion. The court ordered that \"judgment be entered in favor of Lincoln Factoring ... for all its claims.\" In its judgment, the trial court did not award Lincoln Factoring any actual damages. But the court ordered Old American to pay Lincoln Factoring $9,450 in \"treble damages,\" $1,050 in \"interest,\" attorney's fees of $12,000, and costs. Old American brought this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    As a Matter of Law, Lincoln Factoring Is Not Entitled to Relief on the Claims it Pleaded\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On appeal from the trial court's judgment, Old American raises several issues that relate to Lincoln Factoring's standing, the merits of Lincoln Factoring's claims, and the relief that the trial court awarded on those claims. Old American asserts that we should render a take-nothing judgment because Lincoln Factoring has \"no right of recovery ... on any claim in its pleadings.\" For the reasons that we explain below, we agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    Lincoln Factoring's claims under chapter 541 and for violation of the common law duty of good faith and fair dealing\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In its briefing on appeal, Old American contends that we should render a take-nothing judgment because, among other reasons, Lincoln Factoring did not sustain any actual damages as a result of Old American's acts or omissions related to its chapter 541 and good-faith-and-fair-dealing claims, and without an award of actual damages, Lincoln Factoring could not obtain treble damages or other relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We hold, as explained below, that with respect to Lincoln Factoring's claims under chapter 541 and for violation of the common law duty of good faith and fair dealing, (1) the trial court\n   <em>\n    did not\n   </em>\n   award actual damages; (2) under the evidence in this case, the trial court\n   <em>\n    could not\n   </em>\n   award actual damages; and (3) without an award of actual damages, the trial court could not award treble damages or other relief, including attorney's fees. We therefore conclude that the trial court erred as a matter of law by granting relief to Lincoln Factoring on these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Section 541.151 of the insurance code allows a person \"\n   <em>\n    who sustains actual damages\n   </em>\n   \" from a defendant's unfair or deceptive insurance practice\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   to bring an action \"for those damages.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20541.151\">\n    Tex.
