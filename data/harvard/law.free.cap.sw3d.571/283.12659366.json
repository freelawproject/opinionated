CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN . art. 38.14 (West 2005). Because we find that the State sufficiently corroborated the accomplice-witness testimony, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On June 10, 2017, Valerie Thompson and her husband, Michael Thompson, received a Facebook message from Mannette to purchase marihuana from the Thompsons. The Thompsons made arrangements to meet Mannette and Jordan at Mannette's house in New Boston. When the Thompsons arrived at Mannette's house, Jordan and Valerie met in the backyard to consummate the purchase while Michael and Mannette remained in the front yard. As Jordan was examining the marihuana, a man ran up and pointed a gun in Valerie's face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The gun-wielding man, described by Valerie as a short, \"stocky-ish\" black man who was wearing a mask, threatened to shoot Valerie if she said anything. When Valerie screamed, the man shot the ground next to her feet. Valerie testified that there was a second shot, but she could not recall exactly when that happened. The man never pointed the gun at Jordan and did not shoot in her direction. His actions were only directed at Valerie. Valerie ran from the backyard to the neighbor's house without retrieving her marihuana from Jordan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The neighbor-now aware of the disturbance-called the police. Valerie, although quite \"shook up,\" gave a short statement to the police in which she identified Mannette. She could not, however, identify the man who threatened her with a gun or the others involved in the robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   When Valerie was asked at trial if she could identify Turner-the man seated at the defense counsel table-as the gunman, she stated that she could not identify him \"from the face.\" Turner was then asked to stand next to the counsel table. At that point, Valerie testified that Turner matched the physical description of the man who threatened her. She testified that Turner is a black male who is short and stocky-as was the man who threatened her with the gun. Valerie cried as she gave her testimony, explaining, \"[H]e just scares me.\" Nevertheless, Valerie was unable to positively identify Turner as the man who threatened her with a gun. Michael's version of these events and the description of the gunman was much the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   According to Michael, he and Mannette waited in front of the house while the sale was supposed to be taking place. When Michael heard the gunshot, he ran to the back of the house where he saw Jordan and Dakota Firth-a white male-jump in the ravine. Michael gave chase and was able to catch Jordan. At that point, \"a short, stocky black man in a red, white and blue mask\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   emerged from the bushes and started circling Michael with a gun pointed at his leg. The man fired three or four\n   shots at the ground by Michael's foot. Michael asked the gunman if he had hurt Valerie. The gunman responded that he had not and that Michael should go check on her. Jordan, Mannette, Firth, and the gunman then took off running. The gunman was the only individual wearing a mask. Consequently, Michael's identification of the gunman was based on his body type and the mask he wore during the robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At trial, Michael was able to view Turner as Turner stood at the counsel table. He testified that Turner had the same short, stocky body type as the individual with the gun. In earlier statements to the police, Michael only described the gunman as a black man, as he was never asked for a full description. He was also shaken up by the entire incident and had not previously seen or met any of the individuals he encountered on the day of the robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Later, Michael and Valerie researched Facebook, hoping to discover the identities of the other individuals involved in the robbery. Utilizing this tool, they were able to identify Jordan and Firth as two of the individuals involved in the incident. Valerie also located Turner on Facebook-a person who matched the description of the individual who fired the weapon. She subsequently questioned law enforcement about Turner's involvement in the robbery. Jordan's and Mannette's trial testimony, however, established that Turner was the gunman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Jordan testified that she had pled guilty to the June 10, 2017, aggravated robbery involving Valerie and Michael. According to Jordan, she met with Turner, Firth, and Mannette in her apartment on June 10 to set up a drug buy that culminated in aggravated robbery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plan was to meet Michael and Valerie and to rob Valerie of the marihuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The four traveled in Turner's car from Jordan's apartment to Mannette's parents' house, where the marihuana purchase was to take place. Turner was carrying a black handgun and Mannette had a BB gun. Turner, who was driving the car, parked some distance away from the house, so nobody would see the getaway car. Jordan and Mannette then walked to his parents' house. Jordan proceeded to speak with Valerie behind the house. According to the plan, Jordan was supposed to take the marihuana from Valerie and run off with it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Before Jordan was able to \"run off\" with the marihuana, Turner emerged from the bushes wearing a red, white, and blue mask\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and carrying a gun. Turner told Valerie that if she screamed, he would shoot her. When she screamed, Turner shot twice at Valerie's feet. Jordan and Turner then ran through a field in the direction of the car. Michael chased the two and was able to catch Jordan, at which time Turner shot at Michael. She testified that Firth was not carrying a gun and that Turner was the only black male with Jordan. After Turner shot at Michael, the four escaped in Turner's car and returned to Jordan's apartment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Like Jordan, Mannette testified that he pled guilty to aggravated robbery and was a co-defendant in the case. His testimony mirrored that of Jordan in most key areas. He testified of the meeting in Jordan's apartment with Jordan, Firth, and Turner, the plan to steal the marihuana, Turner firing a pistol at Valerie's feet while wearing a red, white, and blue mask, and later firing the pistol at Michael's feet before he, Jordan, Firth, and Turner sped away in Turner's car. He did not know what Turner did with the gun and the mask, as neither was discovered by the police.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Finally, New Boston police officer Brandon Harbison testified that he assisted in a traffic stop approximately two to three weeks prior to the robbery. During that traffic stop, Officer Harbison observed Turner and Jordan together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Accomplice-Witness Testimony Was Sufficiently Corroborated\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Turner maintains that the accomplice-witness testimony of Jordan and Mannette was not sufficiently corroborated to satisfy the \"accomplice-witness rule\" found in Article 38.14 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Article 38.14 states, \"A conviction cannot be had upon the testimony of an accomplice unless corroborated by other evidence tending to connect the defendant with the offense committed; and the corroboration is not sufficient if it merely shows the commission of the offense.\" TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN . art. 38.14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   When evaluating the sufficiency of corroborating evidence under Article 38.14, we \"eliminate the accomplice testimony from consideration and then examine the remaining portions of the record to see if there is any evidence that tends to connect the accused with the commission of the crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Solomon v.

While the accused's mere presence in the company of the accomplice before, during, and after the commission of the offense is insufficient by itself to corroborate accomplice testimony, evidence of such presence, coupled with other suspicious circumstances, may tend to connect the accused to the offense. Even apparently insignificant incriminating circumstances may sometimes afford satisfactory evidence of corroboration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Dowthitt v.

In determining whether the non-accomplice evidence tends to connect the defendant to the commission of the offense, \"we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , 270 S.W.3d at 567.

Here, the non-accomplice evidence tends to connect Turner with the offense. Although Valerie and Michael could not positively identify Turner as the gunman because he was wearing a mask, both testified that Turner looked like the gunman based on his build and skin color. Michael further identified Turner based on his height.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cooper v.

Even before she confronted Turner at trial, Valerie had identified Turner as the man she believed to be the gunman based on her Facebook research. In addition, Harbison's non-accomplice testimony revealed that Jordan and Turner knew each other prior to the robbery, and Valerie's non-accomplice testimony revealed that the gunman never threatened Jordan during the robbery. Finally, Valerie's emotional reaction to seeing Turner at trial could have been interpreted by the jury as supportive of the identification testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We conclude that, based on the totality of the non-accomplice testimony, a rational juror could find that this evidence tends to connect Turner to the offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed v.

The majority affirms Turner's conviction because it concludes there is independent evidence that \"tends to connect\" Turner to the offense. Specifically, the majority identifies (1) the testimony of Officer Harbison that approximately two or three weeks before the robbery, he was present at a traffic stop involving Turner and Jordan; (2) Valerie and Thompson both described the gunman as a short, stocky, black man; (3) only one of the participants in the robbery was a black man; (4) Valerie and Thompson both testified at trial that Turner matched the physical description of the gunman in that he was a short, stocky, black man, and (5) Valerie identified Turner on Facebook as the person she believed to be the gunman\n   prior to the time of trial.

Valerie's and Thompson's testimony that they identified Turner on Facebook as the gunman does nothing to strengthen the corroborative force of the evidence regarding the gunman's general physical description and Turner's presence with Jordan weeks before the robbery. The entirety of Valerie's testimony in this regard was that, when she gave the police a second statement, she went \"into more detail about the information that [she] either knew or discovered through talking with [her] husband and looking on Facebook.\" Thompson's testimony in this regard was:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Q All right.

If testimony that the gunman was a short, stocky, black man and that Turner matched that description, is sufficient corroboration to satisfy the accomplice-witness rule, then it is difficult to imagine what evidence would be insufficient.
