(Appellant) appeals the circuit court's grant of judgment on the pleadings in favor of Jon D. Knipp and Linda Miller (Respondents collectively), thereby dismissing Appellant's Petition for Accounting. Appellant asserts that the trial court erred in granting Respondents' motion because Appellant's petition complied with all pleading requirements and stated a valid claim under Section 461.300,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant had standing to bring the action, the action was brought in the proper forum, and Appellant had not waived its claims. We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Walter Knipp was a resident of Jackson County, Missouri. He had three adult children, Jon Knipp, Robin Choudhury, and Linda Miller. In August 2008, Walter Knipp became the subject of a guardianship and conservatorship proceeding. Competing petitions were filed in the Probate Division of the Circuit Court of Jackson County seeking the appointment of a guardian and conservator, one filed by Jon Knipp and the other filed by Robin Choudhury. On May 5, 2009, Choudhury was appointed as guardian of the person and conservator of the estate of Walter Knipp, an incapacitated and disabled person, and letters of guardianship and conservatorship were issued to Choudhury on June 11, 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Walter Knipp died testate June 8, 2011. On July 8, 2011, a decedent's estate was opened in the Probate Division of the Circuit Court of Jackson County. Jon Knipp was thereafter granted Letters Testamentary in the decedent's estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Shortly before Walter Knipp's death it was discovered he owned certain financial assets that had not been included in the original inventory for his conservatorship. Those assets included U.S. Savings Bonds titled in Walter Knipp's name with pay on death designations to certain of Walter Knipp's children, U.S. Savings Bonds titled in Walter Knipp's name jointly with certain of Walter Knipp's children, stock certificates titled in Walter Knipp's name jointly with his son, Jon Knipp, and certificates of deposit titled in Walter Knipp's name jointly with his two daughters. In the first \"annual settlement filing\" filed after Walter Knipp's death (spanning June 12, 2010 to April 5, 2012) Choudhury amended the conservatorship inventory to include these assets. The assets were never physically turned over to Choudhury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 27, 2012, Appellant filed a claim against the decedent's estate \"for professional services rendered\" in association with administration of decedent's guardianship and conservatorship estate. Appellant represented Choudhury from August 12, 2008, to approximately February 21, 2012, in the guardianship proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 24, 2012, Appellant filed in the decedent's estate a demand for recovery of nonprobate assets, demanding pursuant to Section 461.300 that the personal representative, Jon Knipp, recover for the estate and creditors all recoverable transfers of decedent's property sufficient to satisfy claims of creditors and expenses of\n   administration of the probate estate. Appellant demanded, in the alternative, that the personal representative bring an action for accounting against the recipients of all property of decedent transferred other than from the administration of the decedent's probate estate. Appellant also demanded that the personal representative provide knowledge related to the identity of recipients of recoverable transfers. Jon Knipp did not commence an action on behalf of the estate but filed a \"Response\" to Appellant's demand addressing Appellant as \"Claimant,\" not disputing Appellant's right to make the demand under Section 461.300, and providing four and a half pages of information regarding the identity of alleged recipients of recoverable transfers and/or property belonging to and withheld from decedent's estate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 6, 2012, Appellant filed a Petition for Accounting in the decedent's estate against Respondents and Robin Choudhury alleging that these individuals possessed property owned by Walter Knipp immediately before his death, or were recipients of recoverable transfers of decedent's property as defined in Section 461.300, and should be required to deliver those assets so that claims and expenses of administration of the conservatorship could be paid. Jon Knipp and Linda Miller filed answers in February of 2013 denying Appellant was entitled to relief, primarily arguing that Appellant inadequately performed its duties as attorney in the conservatorship and sought unreasonable fees for that service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 6, 2012, Appellant also filed an Application for Allowance of Compensation to Attorneys for Guardian and Conservator (\"Application\") in the conservatorship, seeking $28,578.43, for the period from August 12, 2008 through February 21, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 29, 2013, Choudhury filed a Final Settlement and Revised Third Amended Inventory of Property in the conservatorship. The revised inventory continued to list the stock, insurance proceeds, savings bonds, and certificates of deposit as personal property of the estate. The Final Settlement also noted that causes of action against the recipients of those items were being pursued in the decedent's estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 17, 2013, Jon Knipp filed Objections to Petition for Approval of Final Settlement, Final Settlement and Inventory. He objected, in part, to the inclusion of the stock, insurance proceedings, savings bonds, and certificates of deposit in the inventory of the conservatorship estate. Additionally, he objected to causes of action against the recipients of those items. Jon Knipp then resigned as personal representative of the decedent's estate and on April 18, 2013, the court issued Letters of Administration\n   <em>\n    De Bonis Non\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   appointing Robin Choudhury personal representative\n   <em>\n    de bonis non.\n   </em>\n   On December 24,\n   2014, the court dismissed Jon Knipp's objections, holding that Jon Knipp had no vested property interest in the decedent's estate because the decedent's will named the decedent's wife as the sole beneficiary of his estate. The court determined that Jon Knipp, therefore, had no standing to object to the settlement of the conservatorship estate because he had no vested property interest in the decedent's estate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court further stated that, even if Jon Knipp had standing to object to the final settlement, \"[t]he Objections seek to litigate title to various assets which Objector alleges belonged to persons other than Walter. Such claims are the proper subject of a discovery of assets proceeding in the Decedent's Estate under \u00a7 473.340 RSMo., and may not be adjudicated via the procedure of ruling on objections to a final settlement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On May 6, 2015, Appellant filed a Second Amended Application for Allowance of Compensation to Attorneys for Guardian and Conservator in the conservatorship. The probate court heard evidence on the Second Amended Application on August 27, 2015. On September 2, 2015, the court awarded Appellant's requested total of $20,578.43, as a class 2 claim pursuant to Section 475.211.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 29, 2016, Choudhury filed an Amended Final Settlement in the conservatorship case. Among the cash distributions noted in the \"Paidout/Credit\" column in the spreadsheet attached to the Amended Final Settlement was an entry dated 12/28/2015 described as \"Proportionate amount of Legal Fees Paid to Blackwood, Langworthy, &amp; Tyson\" (sic), in the amount of $3,912.04. Other credits listed in the same spreadsheet included various causes of action against Jon Knipp and Linda Miller for alleged wrongful disposition of assets noted as \"Being Pursued in the Decedent's Estate.\" (At the time of the final settlement, Choudhury was also personal representative of the decedent estate.) On March 7, 2016, Jon Knipp filed an objection to the Amended Final Settlement. The court issued a \"Judgment Dismissing Objections to Amended Final Settlement\" stating that nothing had changed since the court entered its Judgment regarding Jon Knipp's earlier objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The circuit court entered judgment approving the conservator's Amended Final Settlement on April 1, 2016, and entered an Order of Discharge on April 5, 2016, declaring \"all assets have been distributed during the administration of the estate.\" The court further ordered \"the conservator and the sureties on the conservator's bond if any be hereby discharged.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On November 21, 2016, Respondents filed their Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings in the decedent's estate to dispose of the issues raised by Appellant's Petition for Accounting. They raised two grounds for dismissal: 1) that the remedy of \"accounting\" the Petition sought was not available under the statute, only a money judgment, and 2) there was no basis to pursue recoverable transfers for the payment of administrative expenses. Respondents' motion acknowledged Appellant claimed to be a \"qualified claimant\" of the deceased's estate and did not challenge this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Appellant responded with Suggestions in Opposition to Respondents' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. In a Reply in support of their motion, Respondents argued that Appellant was not a \"creditor\" of Walter Knipp or his decedent's estate, but\n   of Choudhury in her personal capacity or capacity as conservator, and she had been discharged from any liability as conservator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The trial court granted Respondents' motion for judgment on the pleadings on June 30, 2017, ruling that the \"primary argument of Movant is that Petitioner is not a creditor of the estate of Decedent, and therefore cannot bring an action for accounting under \u00a7 461.300 RSMo.\" The court further ruled that, although Appellant had obtained a judgment from the court in the guardianship and conservatorship estate, that claim did not automatically carry over to the decedent estate. The court additionally found: 1) The amounts due Appellants were not debts of Walter Knipp or his decedent's estate, nor liabilities of Walter Knipp arising in contract, tort, or otherwise; 2) The fees were incurred during the administration of Walter Knipp's guardianship and conservatorship estate, and not incurred by Walter Knipp himself; 3) Appellant was not a \"qualified claimant\" as defined by Section 461.300 and therefore had no standing to bring an action for accounting; 4) Appellant's proper recourse would have been to object to the final settlement in the guardianship and conservatorship estate; and 5) Appellant's failure to object to the final settlement in Walter Knipp's guardianship and conservatorship estate constituted waiver of its claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We review a court's grant of judgment on the pleadings\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Seay v.

Respondents contend the court correctly determined that Appellant was not a \"qualified claimant\" as defined by Section 461.300.10(3) and therefore lacked standing to pursue recoverable transfers in the decedent's estate. Respondents argue that Appellant's only recovery was in the conservatorship estate and its claim was released or satisfied as a matter of law upon discharge of the conservator. Further, Respondents contend Appellant's petition failed to state a cause of action because it sought equitable relief or a traditional accounting rather than the sole remedy contemplated by Section 461.300, a money judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We first note that nothing within the record or the court's judgment suggests that the court converted Respondents' Rule 55.27 motion for judgment on the pleadings to a motion for summary judgment, and neither party makes this claim. The court's Judgment states that it reviewed only \"the Motion and Response filed by Petitioner, as well as oral argument from the attorneys.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The circuit court granted Respondents' motion for judgment on the pleadings on the grounds that Appellant had no standing to bring the action because Appellant was not a \"qualified claimant\" under Section 461.300(2). Under Section 461.300(2), only a personal representative or qualified claimant may bring an action for accounting, and a qualified claimant may only do so after making a written demand of the personal representative who thereafter fails to initiate such action. \"A party has standing to sue when it has an interest in the subject matter of the suit that gives it a right to recovery, if validated.\"\n   <em>\n    Portfolio Recovery Assocs., LLC v.

Appellant alleged it made a written demand of the personal representative who failed to initiate the requested action. Respondents filed answers in February of 2013 generally denying all substantive\n   allegations in the petition and contending Appellant ineffectively represented the conservatorship and requested excessive fees, but made no specific contentions that Appellant had no standing to bring the action for want of being a \"qualified claimant.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On November 21, 2016, nearly four years after the Petition for Accounting was filed, Respondents filed their Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings raising only two grounds for dismissal of Appellant's petition - 1) that only a money judgment was available under the statute, not the remedy of \"accounting\" the Petition sought, and 2) there was no basis to pursue recoverable transfers for the payment of administrative expenses. Respondents' motion acknowledged Appellant's averment that it was a \"qualified claimant\" of the decedent's estate and did not challenge this claim; similarly, Respondents' motion did not dispute that Appellant had a pending \"Claim\" against the decedent's estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We find that the Petition filed by Appellants alleged standing as a \"qualified claimant,\" and neither Respondent's answer to that petition or motion for judgment on the pleadings disproved this claim.

The court determined that Appellant was not a \"qualified claimant\" and had no standing to bring an action for accounting under Section 461.300 because: 1) The amounts due Appellants were not debts of Walter Knipp or his decedent's estate, nor liabilities of Walter Knipp arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, and 2) the fees were incurred during the administration of Walter Knipp's guardianship and conservatorship estate, and not incurred by Walter Knipp himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   A \"qualified claimant\" pursuant to Section 461.300.10(3) includes a \"creditor, surviving spouse, dependent child, or a person acting for a dependent child of the decedent.\" A \"creditor\" is \"any person to whom the decedent is liable, which liability survives whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, and any person to whom the decedent's estate is liable for funeral expenses and the reasonable cost of a tombstone.\" \u00a7 461.300.10(1). Under Section 461.300.1, each recipient of a recoverable transfer of a decedent's property \"\n   <em>\n    shall be liable\n   </em>\n   \" to account for a pro rata share of the value of all such property received, to the extent necessary to discharge, among other things, \"claims remaining unpaid after application of the decedent's estate.\" \"Claims\" is defined in Section 472.010(3) as including \"liabilities of the decedent which survive whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, funeral expenses, the expense of a tombstone, and costs and expenses of administration.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The statutes do not define precisely what constitutes debts or liabilities of a decedent. Nevertheless, we find instances within the statutes supporting Appellant's claim that services provided to a conservatorship constitute debts and/or liabilities of the decedent surviving final settlement of the conservatorship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Section 475.320\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Section 475.320 contemplates expenses incurred during a conservatorship surviving as claims against a decedent's estate. Here, Walter Knipp died testate. If a protectee in a conservatorship dies with no will, and has only funeral/burial expenses, estate taxes, obligations incurred by the conservator, and expenses of administration of the conservatorship, a court \"may\" order that no letters of administration be granted upon his estate and \"may\" order those expenses paid out of the estate by the conservator. \u00a7 475.320.1. Where there is a will or \"protectee dies leaving debts,\n   <em>\n    other than those payable by the conservator under subsection 1 hereof\n   </em>\n   for which his estate would be liable in an action\" ... \"letters testamentary\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   be granted on the estate of the deceased protectee[.]\" \u00a7 475.320.2 (Emphasis added). Those subsection 1 debts of the protectee include \"obligations of the protectee incurred by the conservator, as well as expenses of administration\" of the conservatorship. \u00a7 475.320.1. The legislature's reference to a protectee \"leaving debts, other than those payable by the conservator under subsection 1\" suggests our legislature considers administrative expenses of the conservatorship to be \"debts\" of the decedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Where there is a will, such as in Walter Knipp's case, there is no provision that the conservator pay those subsection 1 debts; the only statutory requirement is that letters testamentary be granted on the estate of the deceased protectee. Although contracting for funeral and burial expenses is allowed with court approval when a conservator's authority terminates upon the death of the protectee (if no person other than the estate of the ward or protectee is liable for those expenses),\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   there is no requirement the conservator must pay that contracted debt at final settlement.

Is it the gross assets in the hands of the guardian at the time of death, or is it the net property left after the guardianship has been properly closed? We are of the opinion that the logical answer is that the estate of the decedent consists of whatever assets remain after the legal claims arising by virtue of the guardianship have been properly satisfied. If this were not true, there would be endless confusion created by contests between guardians on the one hand and executors or administrators on the other. The guardian might have created an indebtedness which, according to the law, was a proper and prior claim against the estate of the incompetent, and yet, by the sudden death of his ward, such claim might be utterly defeated by proceedings in the estate of the decedent. In the absence of a statute expressly declaring so unjust a rule, we are of the opinion that all debts legally incurred by the estate of an incompetent during the course of guardianship are just as much liens upon such estate as are formal mortgages thereon, and that the administrator takes the estate subject thereto.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    Estate of Livingston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9977435\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/627/673/\">\n    627 S.W.2d 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 679 n.2 (Mo.

Pursuant to Section 475.130, the conservator of the estate takes possession of all of the protectee's property. The conservator of the estate must make an inventory and appraisement of the estate of all the property of the protectee which comes to the possession\n   <em>\n    or knowledge\n   </em>\n   of the conservator. \u00a7\u00a7 475.145, 473.233 (emphasis added). \"The inventory shall include property as to which the protectee is a joint tenant or tenant by the entirety[.]\" \u00a7 475.145.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   If, after making the first inventory and appraisement, any other real or personal estate comes to the possession \"\n   <em>\n    or knowledge\n   </em>\n   \" of the conservator, an additional inventory \"shall\" be filed. \u00a7\u00a7 475.145, 473.240 (emphasis added). Subject to a conservator's right to possession, \"the title to all such estate, and to the increment and proceeds thereof, is in the protectee and not the conservator.\" \u00a7 475.130.2. The conservator must protect, preserve and manage the estate, apply it as provided in the probate code, perform all other duties required by law, and at the termination of the conservatorship, deliver the assets of the protectee to the persons entitled thereto. \u00a7 475.130.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The law is clear that a conservator has no authority to act as administrator or executor of a deceased protectee's estate unless appointed to do so. \"[T]he death of the protectee does not convert the administration of the guardianship of the estate into an administration of a decedent's estate.\"\n   <em>\n    Summers v.

Where, as here, assets of an estate become known just prior to the death of a protectee, ninety days may not be sufficient for a conservator to physically acquire those assets such that they might be physically delivered to the personal representative upon closing the conservatorship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no requirement that such be physically delivered to an executor, however, as the conservator may upon final settlement turn over any \"\n   <em>\n    rights or credits\n   </em>\n   belonging to the protectee.\" \u00a7 475.300. Here, in the estate inventory the conservator listed as \"credits\" assets belonging to the protectee prior to his death that were alleged to be improperly withheld.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   The conservator also noted that\n   \"causes of action\" were being pursued in the decedent's estate to secure possession of those assets. This was true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   We disagree that Appellant waived its pending claim within the decedent's estate by accepting partial payment in the final settlement of the conservator, and there is no indication in the record that at the time of final settlement the court, or anyone else, considered Appellant's claim expunged. The terms of the final settlement were not adverse to Appellant. The conservator only had authority to pay claims with assets then on hand and was required to promptly wind up her administration. Responsibility for collection of additional assets belonging to the estate was turned over to the executor; the court approved this settlement and the executor accepted the settlement on these terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Notably,\n   <em>\n    Respondents\n   </em>\n   never appealed the final settlement which included the disputed property as assets of the estate. Although Jon Knipp objected to the conservator's inclusion of those assets in the final settlement, he never sought to determine title under Section 475.160 when the conservatorship was still open. (He also did not appeal the court's Judgment dismissing his objections for lack of standing.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under Section 475.160, \"[a]ny conservator, protectee, creditor or other person, including a person interested in expectancy, reversion or otherwise who claims an interest in property which is claimed to be an asset of the estate of a protectee or which is claimed should be an asset of such an estate, may file a verified petition in any court having jurisdiction of such estate seeking determination of the title and right of possession thereto.\" Section 475.160 mirrors the discovery of assets procedure in decedent's estates under Section 473.340 and the court is to proceed on a Section 475.160 petition \"in accordance with the provisions of section 473.340.\" \"In a discovery of assets proceeding, the court's role is to determine whether specific property has been adversely withheld\n   <em>\n    or claimed.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Ryan v.

Hence, the conservator's claim to the disputed property as estate assets was\n   <em>\n    never challenged\n   </em>\n   under Section 475.160 although four years\n   elapsed between the time the property was first included in the estate inventory and the conservatorship closed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \"Every executor or administrator ... shall take possession of all the personal property of the decedent....\" \u00a7 473.263. Because the disputed property was considered part of the estate released to the executor by the conservator, the executor had a duty to take possession of that property. Section 461.300 provides a means to recover money from that property that can pay estate debts. If this disputed property consists of recoverable transfers, defined as \"a nonprobate transfer of a decedent's property ... and any other transfer of a decedent's property ... that was subject to satisfaction of the decedent's debts immediately prior to the decedent's death,\" Section 461.300 mandates that each recipient of such property \"shall be liable\" to account for a pro rata share of the value of all such property received to the extent necessary to, among other things, discharge estate claims remaining unpaid after application of the decedent's estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   At the time of the conservator's final settlement, Appellant had filed a claim in the decedent's estate for recovery of the balance of the Judgment not paid during the conservatorship. Appellant had also filed as a \"qualified claimant\" a petition for accounting to recover transfers that might expunge that claim. At the time of the final settlement, no party disputed Appellant's status as a qualified claimant.
