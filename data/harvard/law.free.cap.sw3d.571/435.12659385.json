The evidence shows that Officer John Mitchell with the Fort Worth Police Department stopped appellant about 2:00 a.m. after seeing appellant driving his car on Mark IV Parkway with no headlights or taillights on. Appellant had bloodshot and watery eyes, and Officer Mitchell could smell alcohol \"coming from [appellant's] person or the vehicle.\" When Officer Mitchell asked appellant if he had drunk any alcohol, appellant responded that he had drunk two drinks at Buck's, a nearby bar. Officer Mitchell performed standard field sobriety tests; appellant demonstrated six of six possible intoxication clues on the nystagmus test, six of eight possible clues for the walk-and-turn test, and one of two clues on the one-leg stand test. Accordingly, Officer Mitchell arrested appellant, read him the statutory DIC-24 warning\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   -pursuant to which appellant agreed to give a breath sample-and drove him to the downtown Fort Worth jail, where appellant gave a breath sample. The two tested samples showed a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.161 and 0.150. A jury found appellant guilty of driving while intoxicated, and the trial judge assessed his punishment at 80 days' confinement and a $1,250 fine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Breath-Test Results Admissible\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In his first point, appellant contends that the trial court erred by admitting the results of his breath test because the State failed to prove that the intoxilyzer operator observed appellant for at least fifteen minutes before beginning the test; therefore, the trial court should have excluded the results as both unreliable and illegally obtained.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2002, pet. ref'd).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The State offered its exhibit 6, the \"test record analytical report\" from the breathalyzer, through Sara Skiles, a senior toxicologist for the Tarrant County Medical Examiner's office. Although the exhibit itself noted, \"Fifteen minute waiting period completed - YES,\" Skiles did not have personal knowledge of the observation because she did not perform the test. The operator listed on exhibit 6 is Christian Paschal-Hamilton, who also testified at trial. After Skiles agreed on voir dire questioning that a breathalyzer test is not valid unless the fifteen-minute observation period occurred, appellant objected to admission of the breath-test results \"on the basis of insufficient proof of observation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Officer Mitchell testified that according to his police report, he arrived at the jail with appellant at 2:48 a.m. The first time recorded on the intoxilyzer was 3:09 a.m.-the \"operational system check.\" The machine recorded appellant's first test result at 3:11 CST and his second at 3:14 CST. Thus, assuming Officer Mitchell and the machine were keeping the same time, at least twenty-one minutes elapsed from the time appellant arrived at the jail to the time the machine began recording.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Officer Mitchell testified that when he arrives at the jail with an arrestee, he turns the person \"over to the booking officers or the ... jailers. They handle it from there. And then from them, he's turned over to the intoxilyzer.\" Officer Mitchell could not recall the time appellant was turned over to the breath-test operator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Paschal-Hamilton, the breath-test operator, could not recall appellant's specific test because he performs so many. And appellant's test was not recorded on video because the testing room does not have a camera system. But Paschal-Hamilton remained adamant throughout his testimony that he had waited the requisite fifteen minutes because that is his routine and a \"mandatory requirement\" of his job. When the prosecutor asked Paschal-Hamilton if he had been in appellant's presence for \"at least ... 15 minutes continuous\" before performing the test, he answered, \"I always do a 15 minute observation.\" Paschal-Hamilton further testified that he does \"all\n   of [his] transactions the same way\" and that he has \"very clear instructions to do this. I do it every single time the same way, 15-minute observation, no errors, every time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Paschal-Hamilton also described the testing process for the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   ... [A] person will be generally brought to me, and the arresting officer will generally say I have read the specified document, DIC-24, or I have not. If they have not, we'll do that at that time. If they have, I'll begin a 15-minute waiting period. Once we're verified that, yes, the document has been read and then approval for the breath test has -- has started. 15-minute observation period. We check for -- to make sure that they don't have any gum, tobacco, anything in their mouth, foreign object of any kind.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   During that period I'll give an instruction phase. Show them the instrumentation, show them the mouth pieces that we use. It's a clear plastic. Give clear instructions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The machine would ask whether the fifteen-minute observation period occurred, and Paschal-Hamilton would have to click on the yes option. After that, the machine begins the start-up process, which involves drawing air through the mouthpiece to ensure that there is no interference with foreign substances inside the machine. After that, the machine will prompt the operator to have the test subject exhale into the mouthpiece.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   According to Paschal-Hamilton, the booking desk is \"[a]pproximately 25 paces\" from the testing device, and booking takes \"six to seven minutes, maybe. Perhaps.\" The booking officer does not bring the test subject to him; either the arresting officer does, or Paschal-Hamilton goes to meet the arresting officer. When asked if he knew when the \"waiting period\" starts, Paschal-Hamilton answered, \"[o]nce I verify things and I'm in their presence.\" He uses the timer on his own wristwatch to calculate the fifteen minutes, but he does not record the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Paschal-Hamilton agreed that the time on his wristwatch could have differed from both the time Officer Mitchell used to record his arrival at the jail with appellant and the time on the intoxilyzer. He also agreed that the purpose of the observation is for the test subject's benefit, to ensure that he does not burp, ingest any other substances, or do anything that could cause the breath-test results to be \"artificially high.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Appellant argues that the evidence shows it would have been impossible for Paschal-Hamilton to have waited the required fifteen minutes because appellant arrived in the jail's sally port at 2:48 a.m., stayed in booking for at least six to seven minutes, walked into the intoxilyzer room, and was tested beginning at 3:09 a.m.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   But appellant's argument assumes Officer Mitchell recorded as the jail arrival time the time he pulled into the sally port, not the time he arrived inside the jail; rigidly applies Paschal-Hamilton's general estimation that booking usually takes six to seven minutes, \"[p]erhaps\"; fails to take into account that the timing devices might not have been synchronized; and fails to consider Paschal-Hamilton's testimony that he sometimes meets the arresting officer at the front of the jail when the arrestee is brought in. Contrary to appellant's assertion, the evidence does not show that it was impossible for Paschal-Hamilton to have observed appellant for fifteen minutes\n   before the test; thus, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by admitting exhibit 6.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Patel v.
