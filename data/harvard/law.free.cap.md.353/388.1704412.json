Specifically, we are called upon to determine whether the phrase \u201ccontinues to be wholly dependent,\u201d as found in Maryland Code (1991 Repl.Vol.), Labor and Employment Article, \u00a7 9-681 (d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> refers to an ongoing dependency on the deceased worker\u2019s wages or the generally lesser amount of workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Patricia Martin (Petitioner) contends that in ongoing dependency determinations, \u201ccontinues to be wholly dependent\u201d refers to the standard of living the claimant experienced while the deceased spouse was alive; thus, she has a continued dependency on her husband\u2019s income at the time of his death. Beverage Capital Corporation (Beverage Capital), Sun Dun, Inc. (Sun Dun), and Great Distribution and Warehousing, Inc. (Great Distribution) (Respondents)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> argue, in accordance with the Court of Special Appeals, that this phrase refers to the surviving spouse\u2019s continued dependency on the workers\u2019 compensation death benefits initially granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">For the reasons set forth below, we reverse the judgment of the- Court of Special Appeals and affirm the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission\u2019s (Commission) finding that Petitioner continued to be wholly dependent on her deceased husband within the meaning of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. In accordance with the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the statute and its findings of total dependency on the part of Petitioner, we hold that \u201ccontinues to be wholly dependent\u201d as found in \u00a7 9\u2014681(d) refers to the surviving spouse remaining wholly dependent on the deceased spouse\u2019s income at the time of his or her death, and not the generally lesser amount of workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Thus, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>making ongoing dependency determinations, the amount earned by the deceased worker at the time of death must be compared with the amount the claimant earns after the initial $45,000 has been received. In this case, Mr. Martin, the deceased spouse, earned an average of $200,000 per year prior to his accident. In stark contrast is the average salary of Mrs. Martin, the surviving spouse, of approximately $15,000 per year. After Mrs. Martin received the initial $45,000, she was still earning approximately $15,000 per year; therefore, she \u201ccontinues to be wholly dependent\u201d if her circumstances have not changed since the initial dependency \u25a0 determination was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">In the instant case, we need not attempt to define the exact point at which a claimant becomes either wholly or partially self-supporting after the initial $45,000 has been paid out. We leave to the legislature and future cases the task of determining the percentage or amount of the deceased spouse\u2019s average weekly income the claimant must earn in order to be found either wholly or partially self-supporting. With this holding we are adopting the Commission\u2019s interpretation and administration of the Act, which directs that Petitioner\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation death benefits will not suddenly cease when some specific point in time is reached, but will instead continue so long as her dependency remains; that is, until she remarries, dies, or the Commission decides that she has become wholly or partially self-supporting.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The facts of this case are undisputed. On January 15,1992, Chester Martin was operating a helicopter in the course of his employment with Beverage Capital, Sun Dun, and Great Distribution when it malfunctioned and he was tragically killed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>At the time of his death, Mr. Martin held various executive positions with Beverage Capital, Sun Dun, and Great Distribution. He was President and a shareholder of Beverage Capital, the sole owner of Sun Dun, and President of Great Distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Mr. Martin was survived by Mrs. Martin. The Martins were married on July 2, 1976, and no children were born of the marriage. At the time of the marriage, Mrs. Martin was employed with Giant Food, earning approximately $18,000 per year. In June 1987, Mrs. Martin resigned her job with Giant Food because Mr. Martin wanted her to stay home and not work anymore. So that she would not have to work outside the home, the Martins agreed that Mr. Martin would pay Mrs. Martin a salary from Sun Dun, but that she would not have to actually do any work for the company. In 1991, Mrs. Martin began a sideline business selling business forms. Most of her customers were either businesses owned by her husband or accounts that he helped her obtain. Mrs. Martin received a salary from Sun Dun until January 15, 1992, the date of Mr. Martin\u2019s death. After this date, the salary payments stopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">For the two years prior to Mr. Martin\u2019s death, the Martins\u2019 finances were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">1990 \u2014 Chester Martin Income $151,504</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Arq\">Patricia Martin Income 38,895 (Sun Dun)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azj\">Total Family Income 190,399 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AgE\">1991 \u2014 Chester Martin Income $187,240</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AG7\">Patricia Martin Income 38,852 (Sun Dun)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvH\">4,246 (Her job selling forms)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3l\">Total Family Income 230,338</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-19\">A few months after Mr. Martin was killed, Mrs. Martin filed a dependency claim with the Commission stating that she was \u201cwholly dependent\u201d on her husband at the time of his death. A hearing was held on January 21, 1994, and on February 1, 1994, the Commission found Mrs. Martin to be \u201cwholly depen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>dent\u201d on her deceased husband. Pursuant to Md.Code (1991 RepLVoL, 1998 Supp.), Labor and Employment Art., \u00a7 9-602 (\u201cAverage weekly wage\u201d) and Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 14.09.01.07, the Commission determined that Mr. Martin\u2019s average weekly wage was $2,850 per week ($148,200 per year). In accordance with the established formula, the Commission awarded Mrs. Martin $475 for 94.736 weeks as the weekly death benefit, retroactive to January 15, 1992.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Respondents filed an appeal of the Commission\u2019s order to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, challenging the finding of Mrs. Martin\u2019s total dependency. The appeal was decided through cross motions for summary judgment, and on February 3, 1995, the court granted Mrs. Martin\u2019s summary judgment motion finding that she was \u201cwholly dependent\u201d on her husband at the time of his death. Respondents did not appeal this ruling. In accordance with the Commission\u2019s award, by the end of January 1994, Respondents had made total payments to Mrs. Martin of $45,000, the maximum initial award of compensation under \u00a7 9-681(c)(2). They then discontinued the benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">At this point, the issue became whether Mrs. Martin continued to be wholly dependent after she received the initial maximum benefits under \u00a7 9-681(d). Since 1993, Mrs. Martin has been working as an independent contractor, brokering products for Canada Dry Corporation to Giant Food. Her job is low paying with sporadic, non-established hours. Mrs. Martin has earned the following since Mr. Martin\u2019s death in January 1992: 1993\u2014$11,249.50; 1994\u20149,651.00; and 1995\u2014 $15,879.00.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mrs. Martin filed issues with the Commission, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>claiming that she continued to be \u201cwholly dependent\u201d and seeking resumption of the weekly death benefit payments. On March 7,1995, there was a hearing before the Commission and on August 22, 1995, it ruled that Mrs. Martin continued \u201cto be wholly dependent on her deceased husband,\u201d and Respondents were ordered to continue paying the weekly benefits. On the same day as the ruling, the Respondents filed another appeal to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, which was also decided through cross motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">On November 26, 1996, the circuit court granted Mrs. Martin\u2019s motion for summary judgment, affirming the Commission\u2019s order and mandating the continuation of benefits. Respondents appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, and on February 25,1998, the court reversed the Commission\u2019s order. The Court of Special Appeals held that Mrs. Martin was \u201cpartially self-supporting and not \u2018wholly dependent\u2019 <em>upon Workers\u2019 Compensation benefits </em>within the meaning of LE \u00a7 9-681(d).\u201d <em>Beverage Capital v. Martin, </em>119 Md.App. 662, 683, 705 A.2d 1175, 1186 (1998)(emphasis added). The court stated that when analyzing whether a dependent is entitled to continue to receive workers\u2019 compensation death benefits following the initial award of $45,000, a determination must be made as to whether there is an ongoing dependency on the <em>benefits, </em>as opposed to an ongoing dependency on the <em>deceased worker\u2019s salary </em>at the time of his or her death. <em>Martin, </em>119 Md.App. at 672-75, 705 A.2d at 1181-82. The court went on to hold that because Mrs. Martin\u2019s employment was not temporary, occasional, or minor, and that her salary constituted approximately fifty percent of the workers\u2019 compensation death benefits, she was no longer \u201cwholly dependent.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>119 Md.App. at 682-83, 705 A.2d at 1185-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Mrs. Martin filed a petition for certiorari in April, 1998, appealing the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 ruling on the issue of whether she remains wholly dependent. We granted certiorari. Specifically, we are asked to determine whether \u201ccontinues to be wholly dependent\u201d in \u00a7 9\u2014681(d), as it pertains to a surviving spouse who has already received the maximum initial workers\u2019 compensation death benefits of $45,000, refers to a continued dependency on the standard of living, in the form of the deceased worker\u2019s salary, at the time of the fatal injury or on the generally lesser workers\u2019 compensation death benefits. As the Court of Special Appeals acknowledged, \u201c[t]he statute does not explicitly say upon what the surviving spouse must continue to be dependent.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>119 Md.App. at 671, 705 A.2d at 1180.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">We reverse the Court of Special Appeals and hold that a spouse \u201ccontinues to be wholly dependent,\u201d and therefore eligible for continuing workers\u2019 compensation death benefits, when he or she has an ongoing dependency on the deceased worker\u2019s salary at the time of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">II. DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"Axz\">A. Statutory Interpretation</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Maryland\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the Act), which has been in existence for over eighty years, is intended to protect workers and their families from the various hardships that result from employment-related injuries. <em>Queen v. Agger, </em>287 Md. 342, 343, 412 A.2d 733, 734 (1980). Specifically, \u201cit is designed to provide workers with compensation for loss of earning capacity resulting from accidental injury, disease or death arising out of and in the course of employment, to provide vocational rehabilitation, and to provide adequate medical services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, as we stated in <em>Beth.-Fair. Shipyard v. Rosenthal, </em>185 Md. 416, 45 A.2d 79 (1945):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">\u201cThe Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is essentially social legislation and the provisions thereof are to be liberally construed. It must be interpreted to effectuate its general purpose and not strictly construed. Where there is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>conflict in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation law, questions of construction should be resolved in favor of the claimant.\u201d (Citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">185 Md. at 425, 45 A.2d at 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">When we interpret a statute in order to effectuate its goal, our primary concern is to ascertain the intent of the legislature. <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 35, 660 A.2d 423, 429 (1995). Regarding this task, we have previously stated: \u201cThe search for legislative intent begins, and ordinarily ends, with the words of the statute under review.\u201d <em>Schuman, Kane v. Aluisi, </em>341 Md. 115, 119, 668 A.2d 929, 931 (1995). A statute may contain ambiguous language, requiring us to look beyond its plain language to discern intent. Where the statutory language is unambiguous and expresses a plain and definite meaning, however, we need not look beyond the words of the statute itself to determine legislative intent. <em>Marriott Employees v. MVA </em>346 Md. 437, 445, 697 A.2d 455, 458 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">In determining legislative intent, we must never lose sight of the overriding purpose and goal of the statute. As we observed in <em>Kaczorowski v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 525 A.2d 628 (1987), the search for legislative intent is most accurately characterized \u201cas an effort to \u2018seek to discern some general purpose, aim, or policy reflected in the statute.\u2019 \u201d 309 Md. at 513, 525 A.2d at 632 (quoting Melvin J. Sykes, <em>A Modest Proposal for a Change in Maryland\u2019s Statutes Quo, </em>43 Md. Law Rev. 647, 653 (1984)). In addition, when interpreting a statute and determining legislative intent, \u201cthe entire statutory scheme [must be examined], as opposed to scrutinizing parts of a statute in isolation.\u201d <em>Williams v. State, </em>329 Md. 1, 15-16, 616 A.2d 1275, 1282 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">Once we determine that the statutory language at issue is in accordance with the legislature\u2019s intended purpose in enacting the statute, our task of interpretation is complete. <em>See Gargliano v. State, </em>334 Md. 428, 435, 639 A.2d 675, 678 (1994)(\u201cIf the language of the statute is plain and clear and expresses a meaning consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>purpose, no further analysis is ordinarily required.\u201d); <em>Dickerson v. State, </em>324 Md. 163, 171-72, 596 A.2d 648, 652 (1991)(\u201cWhen the language is clearly consistent with the apparent purpose of the statute and the result is not absurd, no further research is required.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Thus, in interpreting and determining legislative intent, we must look to the plain language of the enactment, while keeping in mind its overall purpose and aim. Only when both of these tasks are done concurrently do we obtain an accurate interpretation of the statute. In light of these guiding principles of statutory interpretation, we now proceed to a discussion of the Maryland law that is pertinent to our analysis of \u00a7 9\u2014681(d). As we do so, we must be keenly aware that \u201c[t]he Workers\u2019 Compensation statute should be liberally construed so that any ambiguity, uncertainty or conflict is resolved in favor of the claimant, in order to effect the statute\u2019s benevolent purposes.\u201d <em>Linder Crane Service Co. v. Hogan, </em>86 Md.App. 438, 443, 586 A.2d 1290, 1292 (1991)(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">B. Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Law .</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\n<em>1. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">In Maryland, there is a two-step process for determining the initial receipt and continuation of workers\u2019 compensation death benefits. The first step is to determine whether the surviving spouse is entitled to receive benefits up to the $45,000 maximum. Step one is undertaken pursuant to \u00a7 9-679, \u201cDetermination of dependency,\u201d which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2V\">\u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this subtitle, the Commission shall determine all questions of partial or total dependency in accordance with the facts of each case that existed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdX\">(1) at the time of the occurrence of the accidental personal injury that caused the death of the covered employee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIU\"><em>See also </em>\u00a7 9-681(a), (b), and (c). The second step comes into play after the initial $45,000 has been paid out. If the claimant petitions for further benefits, step two requires the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>surviving spouse to prove that he or she \u201ccontinues to be wholly dependent\u201d under \u00a7 9-681(d). In general, \u00a7 9-681, \u201cWholly dependent individuals,\u201d governs the payment of benefits to dependents following the death of a worker in the course of his or her employment. In particular, \u00a7 9-681(d) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-4\">\u201cIf a surviving spouse who was wholly dependent at the time of death continues to be wholly dependent after $45,-000 has been paid, the employer or its insurer shall continue to make payments to the surviving spouse at the same weekly rate during the total dependency of the surviving spouse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The instant case concerns step two; specifically, whether the phrase \u201ccontinues to be wholly dependent\u201d refers to an ongoing dependency on the salary of the deceased worker at the time of his or her fatal injury (in essence, the standard of living experienced by the surviving spouse while the deceased employee was alive) or on the generally lesser workers\u2019 compensation death benefits. Most of this State\u2019s case law regarding this two-step process concerns step one, the determination of initial dependency. Only two reported Maryland appellate cases have looked at this second step of determining whether a claimant \u201ccontinues to be wholly dependent.\u201d <em>See Martin, supra, </em>and <em>Linder Crane, supra. </em>While the \u201cstep one\u201d cases are not directly on point with the particular issue in this appeal, they provide important guidance as to whether \u201ccontinues to be wholly dependent\u201d in \u00a7 9-681(d), step two, refers to an ongoing dependency on the deceased spouse\u2019s salary or on the benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The standard of review for workers\u2019 compensation proceedings is found in \u00a7 9-745, \u201cConduct of appeal proceedings.\u201d It provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">\u201c(b) <em>Presumption and burden of </em>proof.\u2014In each court proceeding under this title:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">(1) <em>the decision of the Commission is presumed to be prima facie correct; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>(2) the party challenging the decision has the burden of proof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-4\">(c) <em>Determination by </em>court.\u2014The court shall determine whether the Commission:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">(1) justly considered all of the facts about the accidental personal injury ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">(2) exceeded the powers granted to it under this title; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">(3) misconstrued the law and facts applicable in the case decided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\">(e) Disposition.\u2014(1) If the court determines that the Commission acted within its powers and correctly construed the law and facts, the court shall confirm the decision of the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-9\">(2) If the court determines that the Commission did not act within its powers or did not correctly construe the law and facts, the court shall reverse or modify the decision or remand the case to the Commission for further proceedings.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">Beyond the statutory language, further guidance of the standard of review may be found in <em>Frank v. Baltimore County, </em>284 Md. 655, 399 A.2d 250 (1979), in which we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6T\">\u201cIn reviewing this ruling we, as was the circuit court, are to be guided by the general statutory command that \u2018the decision[s] of the Commission [are] entitled to prima facie correctness.\u2019 A court, therefore, may reverse a commission ruling only upon a finding that its action was based upon an erroneous construction of the law or facts.... \u201d (Citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">284 Md. at 658, 399 A.2d at 252 (quoting in part <em>Md. Bureau of Mines v. Powers, </em>258 Md. 379, 382, 265 A.2d 860, 862 (1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">\n<em>2. \u201cStep One\u201d Cases</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">Unfortunately, the Act does not define \u201ctotal dependency\u201d or \u201cwholly dependent.\u201d Until June 1, 1947, when Chapter 895 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>of the Acts of 1947 took effect, the law presumed that a wife was wholly dependent on her husband. <em>Meyler v. Mayor and City Council, </em>179 Md. 211, 215, 17 A.2d 762, 764 (1941). The 1947 amendments removed the presumptions of dependency and placed all matters of dependency within the discretion of the Commission. \u00a7 9-679. We have often stated, in accordance with \u00a7 9-679, that \u201cthe question of dependency is one primarily of fact to be decided in every case upon the facts of that case.\u201d <em>Rosenthal, </em>185 Md. at 420, 45 A.2d at 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">In 1941, this Court stated that the test of dependency is \u201cnot whether a claimant was capable of supporting himself without the earnings of the workman, but whether he did in fact rely upon such earnings for his livelihood, in whole or in part, under circumstances indicating an intent on the part of the workman to furnish such support.\u201d <em>Meyler, </em>179 Md. at 217, 17 A.2d at 765. In 1958, we defined a \u201cdependent\u201d within the meaning of the Act as \u201cone who relies wholly or in part upon a workman for the reasonable necessities of life at the time of his accidental injury. A legal or moral obligation to support some one does not create dependency <em>in the absence of actual support.\u201d Mario Anello v. Dunn, </em>217 Md. 177, 180, 141 A.2d 731, 733 (1958)(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\"><em>Meyler, supra, </em>was one of our early cases in which we examined the issue of dependency in the workers\u2019 compensation death benefits context. In <em>Meyler, </em>the claimant, who was the stepdaughter of the deceased, and her stepfather agreed that she would stay home and take care of her invalid mother and the home. 179 Md. at 213, 17 A.2d at 763. Even though the claimant had previously held a factory job and was capable of supporting herself, we held that \u201cthere is no provision in the statute requiring that a person must be incapable of supporting himself before he can be dependent, and there is no reason to hold that dependency should be so restricted in its meaning.\u201d <em>Meyler, </em>179 Md. at 217, 17 A.2d at 765. We further stated that the \u201cmere ability to earn a livelihood does not necessarily preclude a person from being a dependent.\u201d <em>Id. See also Superior Builders, Inc. v. Brawn, 208 </em>Md. 539, 543, 119 A.2d 376, 378 (1956)(\u201c[I]n construing the Act, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>courts do not demand that a claimant must show destitution to obtain an award as a total dependent.\u201d). We held that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that the claimant was either totally or partially dependent on the deceased and ordered a new trial. <em>Meyler, </em>179 Md. at 219, 17 A.2d at 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">In the 1944 case of <em>Larkin v. Smith, </em>we examined the words \u201cwholly dependent\u201d as delineated in the Act. 183 Md. 274, 37 A.2d 340 (1944). In this case, the claimant alleged that she was dependent on her son for financial support, even though she sometimes sold eggs from her hens, ate occasional free meals at the restaurant where she previously worked, and intermittently received clothing from her former employer. <em>Larkin, </em>183 Md. at 276-77, 37 A.2d at 341. The employer/insurer (appellants) maintained that the jury should be instructed that \u201cif they should believe from the evidence \u2018that the claimant received <em>any support from any source other than from [her son] at the time of his injury </em>\u2019 \u201d then the claimant could not be found wholly dependent on her deceased son. <em>Larkin, </em>183 Md. at 278, 37 A.2d at 342 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">In finding the claimant to be \u201cwholly dependent\u201d on her deceased son, we noted that while these words were not precisely defined under the Act, other jurisdictions had adopted what appeared to be the following universal rule as to their meaning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">\u201c\u2018Total dependency exists where the dependent subsists entirely on the earnings of the workman; but in applying this rule courts have not deprived claimants of the rights of total dependents, when otherwise entitled thereto, <em>on account of temporary gratuitous services rendered them by others, or on account of occasional financial assistance received from other sources, </em>or on account of other minor considerations or benefits which do not substantially modify or change the general rule as above stated.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-7\"><em>Larkin, </em>183 Md. at 280, 37 A.2d at 343 (quoting <em>Bloomington-Bedford Stone Company v.

In examining the particular facts of the case, as we are required to do pursuant to \u00a7 9-679, we found that the claimant was working outside the home \u201cbecause her boy was in the Navy and she was worried and wanted to occupy her mind ... until her son came home____\u201d <em>Rosenthal, </em>185 Md. at 423, 45</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">A.2d at 82. Therefore, we held that \u201cthe claimant\u2019s work was only temporary or occasional, and that <em>her intention was to depend solely on her husband\u2019s income in the future as she had in the past. </em>So finding, the jury could decide that there was total dependency within the meaning of the Act.\u201d <em>Rosenthal, </em>185 Md. at 426, 45 A.2d at 84 (emphasis added). <em>See also Harvey v. Roche &amp; Son, </em>148 Md. 363, 129 A. 359 (1925) (recognizing that claimant, who though separated from her spouse at the time of his death but received monthly support money from him, could be found a total dependent even though she collected weekly rent from a boarder).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Thus, as the above cases illustrate, a claimant can be found totally dependent even though he or she has received occasional financial aid or benefits from sources other than the deceased employee. Later cases somewhat restricted the above holdings, however, with the development of the \u201cconsequential contribution\u201d test, under which total dependency status may be denied to dependents who make a \u201cconsequential contribution\u201d to their own support. Specifically, this test states that while a wholly dependent claimant \u201cmay receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>temporary gratuitous services, occasional financial assistance or other minor benefits from sources other than the deceased workman ... <em>he must not have had a consequential source or means of maintenance in addition to what is received out of the earnings of the deceased.\u201d Mullan Construction Co. v.

In <em>Mario Anello, </em>Mrs. Dunn, the claimant, had pooled her significant earnings with that of her husband\u2019s for several years and used them to support the family. 217 Md. at 180, 141 A.2d at 733. In finding Mrs. Dunn to be partially dependent, we held that we were \u201cunable to say that a jury could properly find, or infer, that her earnings were not a consequential part of her maintenance; therefore she was not wholly dependent upon her husband.\u201d 217 Md. at 183, 141 A.2d at 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\"><em>Mullan Construction, supra, </em>following on the heels of <em>Mario Anello, supra, </em>also involved a wife pooling her earnings with her deceased husband. As in <em>Mario Anello, </em>we found that Mrs. Day was partially, not totally, dependent on her deceased husband, as she made almost fifty percent of her husband\u2019s salary. <em>Mullan Construction, </em>218 Md. at 588, 590, 147 A.2d at 760, 761. We held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">\u201c[W]here the earnings of [Mrs. Day] were substantial, where she did not subsist solely out of the earnings of her husband, and where she either could not or would not account for more than half of her net earnings, she cannot establish the status of a total dependent by merely claiming she did not pool her earnings with those of her husband.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ayi\"><em>Mullan Construction, </em>218 Md. at 589,147 A.2d at 760.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">In yet another pooled income case, <em>Toadvine v. Luffman </em>examined whether the deceased employee\u2019s two minor chil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>dren were totally dependent on him at the time of his death. 14 Md.App. 333, 286 A.2d 790 (1972). The court applied the consequential contribution test and found that because the \u201cmother\u2019s contributions were a substantial source, about 40%, of the total funds,\u201d the children were not totally dependent on their deceased father. <em>Toadvine, </em>14 Md.App. at 346-47, 286 A.2d at 797. The court stated that \u201c[t]he mother\u2019s contributions were regular as distinguished from occasional, permanent as distinguished from temporary, <em>substantial as distinguished from minor.\u201d Toadvine, </em>14 Md.App. at 346, 286 A.2d at 797 (emphasis added). <em>See also Simmons v. B &amp; E Landscaping Co., </em>256 Md. 13, 15, 259 A.2d 314, 316 (1969)(up-holding the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201c \u2018the mother\u2019s contribution to this family [cannot] be deemed either occasional or inconsequential. She ... was and is the bulk of the support of her children.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Thus, as these \u201cstep one\u201d cases demonstrate, a claimant can be found a total dependent even though he or she has received occasional financial aid or benefits from sources other than the deceased worker. However, if these additional benefits constitute a consequential contribution to the claimant\u2019s own support, then a finding of total dependency -will be defeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\n<em>3. \u201cStep Two\u201d Cases</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">As mentioned, only two reported appellate cases have examined the issue of whether a claimant \u201ccontinues to be wholly dependent\u201d after the sum of $45,000 has been paid. <em>See Martin, supra, </em>and <em>Linder Crane, supra. Linder Crane </em>does not fully address the specific issue posed in the instant case, and we need not determine whether we would adopt all aspects of its holding. <em>Linder Crane, </em>however, does lend support to our, and the Commission\u2019s, interpretation of \u00a7 9-681(d), which is that \u201ccontinues to be wholly dependent\u201d refers to the claimant continuing to be dependent on the salary of the deceased worker at the time of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>In <em>Linder Crane </em>the claimant was the surviving spouse of the deceased employee, who was killed in an automobile accident during the course of his employment. 86 Md.App. at 440, 586 A.2d at 1291. During their twenty-year marriage, Mr. Hogan supported the family and Mrs. Hogan was a homemaker. <em>Id. </em>Mrs. Hogan began a paying job two months after her husband\u2019s death, due to financial necessity brought on by a dispute as to death benefit compensability. <em>Linder Crane, </em>86 Md.App. at 440-41, 586 A.2d at 1291. Eventually, Mrs. Hogan was determined to be wholly dependent on her husband and was awarded the maximum initial workers\u2019 compensation death benefits. <em>Linder Crane, </em>86 Md.App. at 441, 586 A.2d at 1291. She quit her job approximately two weeks after receiving the $45,000. <em>Id. </em>The benefit payments were stopped after the $45,000 had been paid, so Mrs. Hogan filed a claim to have the benefits reinstated. <em>Id. </em>The Commission reinstated her benefits and the circuit court affirmed, holding: \u201c[I]t was undisputed that appellee was not working at the time the Commission continued her benefits and that she did not work during her marriage.\u201d <em>Linder Crane, </em>86 Md.App. at 442, 586 A.2d at 1292. Appeal was then made to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the circuit court\u2019s holding that Mrs. Hogan\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation death benefits should be reinstated. <em>Linder Crane, </em>86 Md.App. at 447, 586 A.2d at 1294. After finding that Mrs. Hogan was wholly dependent on Mr. Hogan for the twenty years prior to his fatal accident, and that she only worked after his death for thirty-three months due to financial necessity, the court held that Mrs. Hogan remained wholly dependent on Mr. Hogan. <em>Linder Crane, </em>86 Md.App. at 448-45, 586 A.2d at 1292-94. In examining the issue of Mrs. Hogan\u2019s ability to earn money outside of the home, the court referenced <em>Meyler </em>for the proposition that simply because a \u201cclaimant has the ability to be self-supporting does not preclude her from being wholly dependent.\u201d <em>Linder Crane, </em>86 Md.App. at 444, 586 A.2d at 1293. In support of its finding of Mrs. Hogan\u2019s total dependency, the court focused on the private marital agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>between the Hogans, stating: \u201c[Mrs. Hogan] and Joseph agreed that she should ... stay home ... while he supported the family. <em>This was the arrangement at the time of Joseph\u2019s death.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). Basing its holding on a \u201cbenevolent reading\u201d of the statute, the court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-4\">\u201cFrances\u2019 ability to work will not prevent her from being wholly dependent. Moreover, the fact that Frances actually earned a salary for thirty-three months will not prevent her from continuing to be deemed wholly dependent, once she terminated her employment. The courts have been reluctant to deprive a claimant of the rights of a wholly dependent, when otherwise entitled thereto, on account of temporary employment which <em>was not intended to alter the dependency of the claimant on the worker.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-5\"><em>Linder Crane, </em>86 Md.App. at 444, 446, 586 A.2d at 1293, 1294. The court further held that Mrs. Hogan\u2019s pressure to obtain outside employment due to necessity did not \u201calter the arrangement that existed prior to Joseph\u2019s death\u2014that he supported the family and she maintained the home.\u201d <em>Linder Crane, </em>86 Md.App. at 446, 586 A.2d at 1294.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">In ordering the continuation of benefits to Mrs. Hogan, the <em>Linder </em>court did not state explicitly what the surviving spouse continued to be dependent on\u2014the workers\u2019 compensation death benefits or Mr. Hogan\u2019s salary at the time of his fatal accident. We question, however, the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 statement in <em>Martin </em>that \u201c[t]he <em>Linder Crane </em>Court looked to the income Mrs. Hogan received from Workers\u2019 Compensation benefits to determine whether she continued to be totally dependent after the amount of $45,000 had been paid.\u201d 119 Md.App. at 677, 705 A.2d at 1183. On the contrary, we can readily infer from the court\u2019s emphasis on the agreement between the Hogans that existed during their lengthy marriage, along with our prior case law and the need for a liberal construction of the Act favoring the claimant, that the <em>Linder Crane </em>court found Mrs. Hogan \u201ccontinued to be wholly dependent\u201d on the salary of Mr. Hogan at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>C. The Law as Applied to This Case</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">In applying the Maryland law discussed <em>supra, </em>while concurrently reading the Act liberally in order to effectuate its benevolent purpose of compensating injured workers and their families, we hold that Mrs. Martin \u201ccontinues to be wholly dependent\u201d under \u00a7 9-681(d) on Mr. Martin\u2019s income at the time of his fatal accident. For the reasons discussed below, we find that the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that Mrs. Martin could only continue to receive compensation if she had an ongoing dependency on the death benefits. As we will elaborate <em>infra, </em>Mr. Martin, the deceased spouse, earned an average of $200,000 per year while he was alive. In stark contrast is the average salary of Mrs. Martin, the surviving spouse, of approximately $15,000 per year. After Mrs. Martin received the initial $45,000, she was still earning approximately $15,000 per year; therefore, she \u201ccontinues to be wholly dependent\u201d if her circumstances have not changed since the initial dependency determination was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Respondents assert that \u00a7 9-681(d) is ambiguous as to the identity of the payment source upon which the surviving spouse must continue to be dependent, but we find no ambiguity in the statute. Indeed, the plain language of \u00a7 9-681(d) itself states \u201cat the time of death\u201d when discussing the initial determination of dependency. Therefore, if the Act makes the awarding of initial benefits dependent on the salary of the deceased spouse at the time of death <em>(see </em>\u00a7 9\u2014681(b)), then it is only logical and consistent that determinations of ongoing dependency under \u00a7 9\u2014681(d) should also depend on the salary of the deceased spouse. In addition, even if we did find ambiguity in the language of \u00a7 9-681(d), we must resolve all such ambiguities in favor of the claimant, Mrs. Martin, as it was the intent of the legislature that the Act be liberally construed to effect its broad remedial goal. As such, we must also examine \u00a7 9\u2014681(d) in context of the Act\u2019s overall remedial scheme, not in isolation. For example, \u00a7 9-681(a), which empowers the Commission to decide whether the claimant is wholly or partially dependent on the deceased employee after the worker\u2019s death, provides: \u201cIf there are <em>individuals who </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number><em>were wholly dependent on a deceased covered employee at the time of death </em>resulting from an accidental personal injury or occupational disease, the employer or its insurer shall pay death benefits in accordance with this section.\u201d (Emphasis added). Section 9-681(c), which governs the duration of benefits, states that death benefits are to be paid \u201c(1) <em>for the period of total dependency; </em>or (2) until $45,000 has been paid.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Thus, when subsection (d) is read within the overall context of \u00a7 9-681, there is no language to indicate that the issue of total dependency after the $45,000 has been paid should focus on a continued dependency \u201con the benefits.\u201d To the contrary, if subsection (a) is read as a preamble to the rest of the section, including subsection (d), it plainly states that the test for determining total dependency is \u201cindividuals who were wholly dependent on a deceased covered employee at the time of death.\u201d The logical inference from this reading is that for a claimant to continue to be wholly dependent, he or she must have an ongoing dependency on the deceased worker\u2019s salary <em>at the time of death.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">In the instant case, pursuant to \u00a7 9-679, Mrs. Martin\u2019s dependency was determined at the time of her husband\u2019s death, which was the same time as the accident. In the recent case of <em>Meadowood v. Keller, </em>353 Md. 171, 725 A.2d 563 (1999), we also construed dependency in the Act to turn on the timing of the event giving rise to the benefit. Mrs. Keller was injured in a job-related accident and later died of an unrelated cause. At the time of the accident, her son was not financially dependent on her, but he later became so after he left his job to live with and take care of her. Using \u00a7 9-679, which covers death benefits, as a guide in construing Md.Code (1991 Repl.Vol., 1998 Supp.), Labor and Employment Art., \u00a7 9-632, which deals with permanent partial disability benefits, we held that the dependency of Mrs. Keller\u2019s son turned on his circumstances at the time of her accident and not at the time of her death. <em>Keller, </em>353 Md. at 185, 725 A.2d at 571. We noted that \u00a7 9-679 mandates application of the facts existing at the time of the accident that caused the death of the employee in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>dependency determinations and held that dependency for the purposes of \u00a7 9-632 must also be determined as of the date of the accident. <em>Keller, </em>353 Md. at 176-78, 725 A.2d at 566-67. This Court stated: \u201c[W]e are unable to discern any evidence that the Legislature desired to have the term \u2018dependent\u2019 mean one thing for purposes of the death benefits and another for purposes of the survived benefit, nor have we been able to determine any compelling reason why it would have wanted to have different standards apply.\u201d <em>Keller, </em>353 Md. at 187, 725 A.2d at 571. Like we held in <em>Keller, </em>we believe that \u00a7 9-681(d) should be construed to turn on the timing of the event giving rise to the benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Respondents further propose that, in determining whether Mrs. Martin \u201ccontinues to be wholly dependent,\u201d we should look at Mrs. Martin\u2019s current income and compare it to the maximum benefits available under the statewide average weekly wage pursuant to Md.Code (1991 Repl.Vol., 1998 Supp.), Labor and Employment Art., \u00a7 9-602 and COMAR 14.09.01.07. Respondents maintain that if Mrs. Martin\u2019s current income constitutes a significant percentage of the statewide average weekly wage, then she is no longer dependent on the workers\u2019 compensation death benefits and is therefore not wholly dependent. We decline to adopt Respondents\u2019 proposed formula for calculating whether a claimant \u201ccontinues to be wholly dependent\u201d under \u00a7 9-681(d). Rather, the correct formula to apply in making ongoing dependency determinations is to compare the amount earned by the worker at the time of death with the amount the surviving spouse earns after the $45,000 has been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">In <em>Martin, </em>the court based its holding in part on a detailed hypothetical regarding two surviving spouses whose deceased spouses made very differing salaries when they were alive, resulting in a more frequent finding of \u201ccontinues to be wholly dependent\u201d on the part of the wealthier surviving spouse.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>\u201cIf we were to adopt [Mrs. Martin\u2019s] reading of [] \u00a7 9-681(d), persons whose spouses earn huge incomes would be more likely to be able to convince the Commission that they continue to be wholly dependent than those with modest income. This would produce an illogical and unjust result and one at odds with the purpose of the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-5\"><em>Martin, </em>119 Md.App. at 673, 705 A.2d at 1181.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">We do not feel it necessary to refute the court\u2019s hypothetical point-by-point, but instead rely on four safeguards to demonstrate the hypothetical\u2019s fallacious reasoning. Before we discuss the safeguards, however, we want to first view the hypothetical from a different perspective. The hypothetical can easily be seen as penalizing the spouse whose husband earned more money, in that she will receive only eight percent of her deceased husband\u2019s average weekly wage in workers\u2019 compensation death benefits as compared to the spouse with the more modest income, who will be awarded sixty-two percent of her husband\u2019s salary. In examining the instant case, it was found that two-thirds of Mr. Martin\u2019s average weekly wage of $2,850 at the time of his death was $1,881. Therefore, Mrs. Martin\u2019s weekly death benefit was $475, which was the maximum permitted under the Act in 1992. <em>See </em>footnote 5, <em>supra. </em>As such, Mrs. Martin was only receiving seventeen percent of her husband\u2019s full weekly salary in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation death benefits; a figure nowhere near her husband\u2019s average weekly wage at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">At this juncture, we wish to emphasize that we are not determining a specific income percentage or amount at which a surviving spouse achieves a self-supporting status. We simply use percentages in this opinion to illustrate the major income disparity between Mrs. Martin\u2019s current financial situation and what her lifestyle was when Mr. Martin was alive. In accordance with the Act and the manner in which the Commission administers it, we maintain that Mrs. Martin\u2019s dependent status, either total or partial, will not abruptly end at a particular point in time, say after she has received death benefits for a certain number of days, weeks, months, or years. Instead, she will continue to receive benefits so long as her dependency on her deceased husband\u2019s salary remains. Under the current schema, Mrs. Martin\u2019s benefits will continue until she remarries, dies, or the Commission determines that she has become either wholly or partially self-supporting.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">We now turn to the safeguards that protect against the unjust awards predicted in the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 hypothetical by our adoption of an interpretation of \u00a7 9-681(d) based on the deceased worker\u2019s salary. The first safeguard is the statutory cap on compensation. The cap obviates the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 concern that a wealthy claimant will reap an unjust award. Under \u00a7 9-681(b), the weekly benefit may not \u201cexceed the State average weekly wage.\u201d We need look no further than the instant case to see the curative effect of this safeguard. Mr. Martin\u2019s average weekly wage was found to be $1,881 (two-thirds of $2,850), yet Mrs. Martin was only receiving the statewide average weekly wage of $475, which is the maximum allowed under the statute. Therefore, Mrs. Martin\u2019s average weekly income was reduced by $1,406, a seventy-five percent reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The second safeguard is \u00a7 9-679, which requires that initial dependency determinations be based on the particular facts of each case. Section 9-679\u2019s mandate, that the Commission must examine each case on its own unique set of facts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>prevents the perceived unfairness and injustice that Respondent, and the Court of Special Appeals, maintains would result if we determine that \u201ccontinues to be wholly dependent\u201d refers to an ongoing dependency on the deceased worker\u2019s salary rather than the benefits. The particular facts and circumstances include the wide range of salaries that may be involved from case to case. For this reason, it would be inappropriate for us to adopt a specific percentage under which a dependent can earn income, relative to the deceased worker\u2019s salary, and still be found \u201cwholly dependent\u201d by the Commission. In this case, Mrs. Martin earns approximately eight percent of Mr. Martin\u2019s yearly income at the time of his death. On its own, Mrs. Martin\u2019s approximately $15,000 annual salary is insufficient to compensate her as contemplated by the legislature in enacting the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Modifying the facts of the instant case and applying them to our own hypothetical, say that Mr. Martin was earning $500,-000 at the time of his death. If we take eight percent of $500,000, Mrs. Martin\u2019s annual salary would be $40,000 per year. Now when we apply \u00a7 9-679 and examine the particular facts and circumstances of this hypothetical, we observe that the Commission could well determine that Mrs. Martin is not wholly dependent, even though her $40,000 salary would also constitute a mere eight percent of Mr. Martin\u2019s annual salary at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">The third safeguard is the consequential contribution test, discussed in Part II.B.2. <em>supra, </em>which ensures that total dependency will not be found if the claimant makes a substantial contribution to his or her own support. In applying the consequential contribution test to this case, it is clear that Mrs. Martin\u2019s earnings with Canada Dry do not constitute a \u201cconsequential contribution\u201d to the family income. First, when we apply the correct formula, detailed <em>supra </em>in this section, and compare Mrs. Martin\u2019s current income against Mr. Martin\u2019s salary at the time of his death, it is obvious that the percentage of Mrs. Martin\u2019s earnings when compared to Mr. Martin\u2019s does not rise to the level of those found in the <em>Mario Anello, Mullan Construction, </em>and <em>Toadvine </em>cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>discussed <em>swpra, </em>so as to constitute a consequential, substantial contribution. As mentioned, Mr. Martin\u2019s weekly wage was $2,850. After business expenses were deducted, Mrs. Martin\u2019s approximate weekly wages from her Canada Dry job were as follows for the three years after her husband\u2019s fatal injury: 1993\u2014$216 ($11,249.50 divided by 52); 1994\u2014$186 ($9,651 divided by 52); and 1995\u2014$305 ($15,879 divided by 52). Thus, in 1993, Mrs. Martin earned eight percent of Mr. Martin\u2019s full weekly wage; in 1994, she earned seven percent; and in 1995, she earned eleven percent. Second, even if we apply the formula that the Court of Special Appeals adopted and compare Mrs. Martin\u2019s current income to the statewide average weekly wage, we see that her weekly income is significantly less than the statewide average weekly wage of $475 in 1992, a figure that increases every year and thus makes the disparity even greater today. From the above weekly wage calculations, it is apparent that Mrs. Martin is not earning more than the average worker in Maryland, nor anywhere close to this average weekly wage. Moreover, there has been little change in Mrs. Martin\u2019s financial circumstances since the time when the Commission initially found her to be \u201cwholly dependent\u201d on Mr. Martin in its initial death benefit compensation award of February 1, 1994. Her personal income remains fairly static.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The final safeguard that exists to curb unfair award determinations is found in \u00a7 9-681(j). It states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-L\">\u201c(j) Continuing jurisdiction of commission.\u2014The Commission has continuing jurisdiction to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">(1) determine whether a surviving spouse or child has become wholly or partly self-supporting;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">(2) suspend or terminate payments of compensation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJ6\">Therefore, should Mrs. Martin\u2019s financial circumstances change down the road and she becomes either wholly or partially self-supporting, the Commission has the authority to reduce or eliminate her benefits as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">In many cases there may well be a discrepancy in the amount of ultimate benefits awarded to a person who is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>wealthy and a person who is not. In general, workers\u2019 compensation benefits are based on the worker\u2019s income, so there will naturally be a variable in how much claimants receive. However, the unfairness the court says will result if we adopt an interpretation of continued dependency based on the deceased worker\u2019s salary, rather than on the death benefits, is negated by application of the above four safeguards. The (1) built-in protection of the statutory cap; (2) the analysis of dependency determinations on a case-by-case basis pursuant to \u00a7 9-679; (3) the application of the \u201cconsequential contribution\u201d test after the initial $45,000 has been paid; and (4) the exercise of Commission jurisdiction under \u00a7 9\u2014681(j), as necessary, all will result in findings that are consistent and in accordance with the benevolent purpose of the Act. Finally, any unfairness that results which is beyond the reach of these safeguards is for the legislature to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">We now turn to a discussion of <em>Linder Crane, </em>which the Respondents misconstrue. In finding that Mrs. Martin continues to be wholly dependent on Mr. Martin\u2019s income at the time of his death, we note that the Martins, like the Hogans in <em>Linder Crane, </em>had a private marital agreement that she would not work outside the home. This <em>agreement was </em>in place for the last several years of their marriage, including at the time of Mr. Martin\u2019s death; thus, it is clear that he intended to provide indefinite financial support for his wife while she took care of the household. Like Mrs. Hogan in <em>Linder Crane, </em>Mrs. Martin sought employment due to the financial circumstances brought about by her husband\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Respondents point to the \u201ctemporary employment\u201d language found in <em>Linder Crane </em>and maintain that because Mrs. Martin\u2019s present job with Canada Dry is not temporary, as Mrs. Hogan\u2019s was found to be, she cannot continue to be wholly dependent on Mr. Martin. While it is true that Mrs. Martin\u2019s position with Canada Dry may not be temporary or occasional, it is undisputed that her income, which has never exceeded $16,000, is a mere fraction of what the Martin family income was when her husband was alive. Any contributions Mrs. Martin made to the family income, both while Mr. Martin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>was alive and also after his death, were minor, insubstantial contributions. Mrs. Martin\u2019s job selling business forms, which she had while Mr. Martin was alive, was purely a sideline business that yielded no substantial income ($4,246 in 1991). Moreover, her clients for this sideline business derived almost exclusively from her husband\u2019s business contacts. In addition, the salary she received from Sun Dun was purely gratuitous and did not in any way alter her dependent status on her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Therefore, we can analogize the \u201ctemporary employment\u201d scenario in <em>Linder Crane </em>to the major disparity that exists between Mrs. Martin\u2019s current income and what it was before Mr. Martin died. In so doing, it is obvious that Mrs. Martin\u2019s low-paying job with Canada Dry, with its sporadic, non-established hours, was \u201cnot intended to alter [her] dependency ... on [Mr. Martin].\u201d <em>See Linder Crane, </em>86 Md.App. at 444, 586 A.2d at 1293. \u201cEven total dependency is consistent with the receipt of some other income, <em>if unsubstantial, </em>or sporadic.\u201d 2A Arthur Larson, Larson\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7 63.13, at 11-134 (1989)(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">On a policy level, if we were to adopt Respondent\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 9-681(d) there would be a disincentive for a surviving spouse, or any dependent, to work and be a productive member of society; instead, he or she could earn more money by not working and staying home. At the present time, Mrs. Martin is not earning more than the benefits, so if she had simply quit her job prior to the second workers\u2019 compensation hearing, she would have unquestionably been granted continuing death benefits. Perhaps this \u201call or nothing\u201d facet of the Act is something that the legislature should address, but until it does should we tell people in Mrs. Martin\u2019s situation to simply quit their jobs in order to retain their benefits? Rather than being punished by having her benefits discontinued, Mrs. Martin should be commended for working. Efforts toward self-sufficiency should be encouraged, not discouraged.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>We agree with Judge Wolffs factual finding, and the Commission\u2019s finding and interpretation of the statute, that Mrs. Martin\u2019s current income level is \u201cnot sufficient to provide her with the basic necessities contemplated by the Workers\u2019 Compensation statute.\u201d While it may appear unfair to some, the reality of our capitalist system is that people earn vastly different amounts of money depending on their education, training, background, and level of industriousness, among other factors. That reality is reflected in the Act\u2019s recognition that even with the application of the safeguards discussed <em>supra, </em>employers/insurers must still pay higher benefits to those employees, or their dependents, for whom they have elected to compensate at a higher salary.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The fact is that Mrs. Martin\u2019s husband earned a high wage, and as a result she grew accustomed to a higher standard of living than many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>experience. While she should naturally expect a diminution in income after her husband\u2019s death, the disparity should not be so great that she is subsisting solely on the income from her job as an independent contractor, which is less than ten percent of the previous family income. The Act clearly considers a claimant\u2019s standard of living when making benefit determinations; indeed, \u00a7 9\u2014681(b) contemplates the socioeconomic status of the dependent in making an initial award of benefits when it mandates that the average weekly wage of the deceased be considered in any benefit determination.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>2A Arthur Larson, Larson\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7 63.11(b), at 11-109 (1989)(stating that \u201c[a] showing of actual dependency does not require proof that, without decedent\u2019s contributions, claimant would have lacked the necessities of life, but only that <em>decedent\u2019s contributions were relied on by claimant to maintain claimant\u2019s accustomed mode of living </em>\u201d)(emphasis added)(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">We also may be affronted by the particulars of the arrangement the Martins made; specifically, the fact that in accepting a gratuitous salary from Sun Dun, Mrs. Martin was \u201cgetting something for doing nothing.\u201d No matter what our personal biases are, we must not penalize Mrs. Martin because Mr. Martin was professionally successful and financially able to make this special arrangement with his wife. We are still obligated to look at the facts of each case and make not only our initial dependency determinations based on her deceased husband\u2019s salary, but also any continuing dependency determinations on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Thus, when we look at the plain language of the statute in the context of its benevolent purpose, we hold that Mrs. Martin \u201ccontinues to be wholly dependent\u201d on Mr. Martin\u2019s income at the time of his fatal accident. We further hold that the correct formula to apply in determining whether a claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>ant continues to be wholly dependent under \u00a7 9-681(d) is to compare the amount earned by the worker at the time of death with the amount the surviving spouse earns after the $45,000 has been paid. If we adopt the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 interpretation, that for compensation to be continued the claimant must have an ongoing dependency on the death benefits, untold numbers of people may be unable to continue to receive the support they need to live. Nothing in our case law, or the wording of the statute itself, points to such a strict rule of construction; in fact, legislative intent tells us that we must avoid such a narrow reading of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">Furthermore, pursuant to \u00a7 9-745(b)(l), the decision of the Commission is presumed to be prima facie correct. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the Commission did not fairly consider all of the facts regarding Mr. Martin\u2019s accidental death or that it exceeded its powers or misconstrued the law and facts of the case. <em>See </em>\u00a7 9-745(c)(l)-(3). Therefore, in accordance with \u00a7 9-745(e)(l), we shall affirm the decision of the Commission and uphold the order of reinstatement of Mrs. Martin\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation death benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">For the reasons stated, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and hold that the phrase \u201ccontinues to be wholly dependent,\u201d as found in \u00a7 9-681(d), refers to a continued dependency on the deceased spouse\u2019s income at the time of his or her death. In making ongoing dependency determinations, the amount earned by the deceased employee at the time of death must be compared with the amount the claimant earns after the initial maximum $45,000 has been paid. In deference to the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the statute and its findings, we affirm its August 22, 1995, order, which found that Petitioner continued to be \u201cwholly dependent on her deceased husband.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

If, after the insurer has paid $45,000 in death benefits to both Spouse 1 and Spouse 2, both get a job paying $15,000 per year, Spouse 2, under [Mrs. Martin\u2019s] formulation, would have a much more difficult time convincing the Commission that she continues to be wholly dependent because her $15,000 annual income is 37.5 percent of the amount that her husband earned when he lived. On the other hand, Spouse 1, whose husband made eight times as much as Spouse 2's husband, could argue that her current income is only 5 percent of her husband's former salary\u2014and thus, in comparison, minuscule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-H\"><em>Martin, </em>119 Md.App. at 673, 705 A.2d at 1181.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b471-4\">. We observe that our nation\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation laws were designed to eliminate a worker's right to recover in tort from his or her employer by providing them with guaranteed compensation. The <em>quid pro quo </em>is that the employer is insulated from tort liability, while the employee is guaranteed compensation, albeit, at a potentially lower rate. <em>See </em>1 Arthur Larson, Larson's Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7 1.20, at 2 (1990)(\"[T]he employee and his dependents, in exchange for these modest but assured [workers\u2019 compensation] benefits, give up their common-law right to sue the employer for damages for any injury covered by the act.\u201d) As such, in any given case, this tradeoff may work to either the employer or employee's advantage. In the instant case, Mrs. Martin had no right to recover in tort because Mr. Martin was killed in the course of his employment. If Mrs. Martin had been allowed to sue in tort and had a valid claim, she would have been able to recover not only her full pecuniary loss but other damages as well. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1998 Repl.VoL), Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Art., \u00a7 3-904(d), which states, in pertinent part, that damages awarded under a wrongful death action</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">\"are not limited or restricted by the 'pecuniary loss' or \u2018pecuniary benefit\u2019 rule but may include damages for mental anguish, emotional pain and suffering, loss of society, companionship, comfort, protection, marital care, parental care, filial care, attention, advice, counsel, training, guidance, or education....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The workers\u2019 compensation laws, by accounting for the injured or deceased worker\u2019s income level, therefore retain elements of the tort system that the laws were intended to replace.
