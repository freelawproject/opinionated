This Court granted certiorari to answer the question of whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in affirming the judgments despite the error of the trial court in permitting the State to cross-examine the co-defendant Robert Brown with statements made by Brown\u2019s counsel during plea negotiations which directly incriminated Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">On February 1, 1996, Petitioner David Allen Elmer was a passenger in a car driven by Robert Brown. The car entered the neighborhood of Winding Brook and swerved toward four pedestrians standing close to a bridge near the side of the road. The four people then walked to a nearby basketball court and told others of the swerving incident. The Brown car drove to the basketball court, which is when several of the people started throwing large rocks at the car, causing damage to the windshield, windows, and body of the car. The car again swerved toward some of the participants and then quickly departed, returning a third time, to find several of the pedestrians brandishing more rocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Rocks began bouncing off the car again, and Petitioner put a shotgun outside the passenger window. A shot was fired, and the shot struck Robert Earl, a bystander uninvolved in the rock throwing incident. Three pellets struck him in his head, two more in his nose, and one in his left' eye. The victim suffered irreparable damage to his eye and now wears a replacement prosthesis.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">In a joint trial, Brown and Elmer proceeded to trial before a jury. A significant issue developed at trial as to which person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>in the car actually fired the shotgun\u2014Brown or Elmer. Elmer did not testify. Several witnesses testified that they saw the shotgun through the passenger\u2019s side and that Elmer fired the shot that struck Mr. Earl. Brown testified that he reached over and pulled the trigger as one of the bystanders was aiming a large chunk of granite at the car window and that Elmer was trying to avoid being hit with it. Brown\u2019s testimony that he pulled the trigger, and not Elmer, led the prosecutor to inquire of Brown on cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-5\">THE STATE: Mr. Brown, did you ever make the statement that when you came down around the curve ... your attention was drawn to the people that were running from your left, and that at that point in time Allen Elmer put that gun out the window, pulled the trigger, the gun boomed, and the first thing you said to him is what the F did you do? Did you ever make that statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">[COUNSEL FOR BROWN]: Objection. May we approach the bench?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">THE STATE: Did you ever make that statement, Mr. Brown?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-8\">[COUNSEL FOR BROWN]: Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-9\">THE COURT: It\u2019s cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-10\">THE STATE: Did you ever make that statement? [COUNSEL FOR BROWN]: Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-11\">THE COURT: Just a minute. Come on up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-12\">The following discussion took place at the bench.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-13\">THE COURT: What is your objection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-14\">[COUNSEL FOR BROWN]: I am trying to make sure that [the prosecutor] is not trying to get into attorney/client privilege. The attorney who he was making the statement to\u2014clarify that, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-15\">THE COURT: Well, if he made it to you, how would he know about it? If he made it to you, how would [the prosecutor] know about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-16\">[COUNSEL FOR ELMER]: I object. Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>[COUNSEL FOR BROWN]: My objection is I want him to clarify who he made the statement to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">THE STATE: All I have to ask him is if he ever made that statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">THE COURT: You\u2019re overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">The bench conference concluded and the prosecutor continued before the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-8\">THE STATE: Mr. Brown, I think you heard the question, but I will ask you again. Did you ever make the statement, Mr. Brown, that\u2014when you came down around this curve that your attention was drawn to the people who were coming from your left, and you\u2019re looking out there, out the driver\u2019s side toward those people on the left as you heard\u2014 don\u2019t look at [counsel for Brown].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-9\">[COUNSEL FOR BROWN]: I am making the objections. He is looking at me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-10\">THE COURT: I am overruling you. You are looking at the attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-11\">[COUNSEL FOR BROWN]: Your Honor, we need to approach the bench again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-12\">THE COURT: No, no, you are not approaching the bench. He is asking questions. I\u2019ve already ruled on this. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-13\">[COUNSEL FOR BROWN]: Your Honor, it\u2019s on a separate matter. I need to approach the bench for the record, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-14\">THE COURT: Come on up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-15\">The following discussion took place at the bench.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-16\">[COUNSEL FOR BROWN]: Your Honor, [the prosecutor] asked in settlement negotiations what would my client testify to, and during settlement negotiations I told him what my client would testify to. I never told him my client said that. That was part of the settlement negotiations for\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqb\">[COUNSEL FOR ELMER]: In all fairness, good conscience, fairness, he can\u2019t use something like that now when negotiations\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>THE COURT: Is that what you are using now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">THE STATE: Yes, I am. Let me tell you how this went though. This is\u2014[counsel for Brown] came to me, and said his client was willing to plead guilty to reckless endangerment, and his client wanted to testify in my prosecution of this defendant; and his client would testify just exactly the same that I am asking right now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">[COUNSEL FOR BROWN]: No. When I said\u2014he asked, what do you expect your client to say. I said, I would expect my client to testify\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">THE STATE: And he continually said that\u2019s what the witness had said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">[COUNSEL FOR BROWN]: I never intentionally asked my client what he did or not what he did until ten minutes before yesterday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-9\">THE COURT: What you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-10\">[COUNSEL FOR BROWN]: He asked what I expect him to testify to. I never\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-11\">THE COURT: You are overruled. You have your objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-12\">[COUNSEL FOR BROWN]: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-13\">Before the jury, the prosecutor again inquired:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-14\">THE STATE: Mr. Brown, you made the statement, didn\u2019t you, that when you came around this curve on Willow Drive that your attention was drawn to the people over on your left hand side, and that you were driving, and you are watching them when you heard the boom of a shotgun; and you looked over at Mr. Elmer and said, what the F did you do that for; and Mr. Elmer said to you, I shot the car. Didn\u2019t you make that statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-15\">BROWN: No, I did not make that statement. That was how it was stated in newspapers and stuff; and at that time no one had given me a chance to tell my side of the story, what happened down there that day. I was never given a chance to explain what happened or anything like that. And in my charging documents that was what had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>said. So that is what I had went along with to try to get those charges filed against the attackers who admitted to attacking, which you have let go; and that\u2019s so they can get away with attacking people. That\u2019s\u2014I mean, I know it is a terrible shame that somebody got hurt in this incident. That could have easily been me and Allen on that stretcher flying to Shock Trauma. Does that give them the right to attack us?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-5\">THE STATE: Mr. Brown, didn\u2019t you say that you would testify to just that in the prosecution of Mr. Elmer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am\">BROWN: No, I did not. That was never said, no. I never said I was going to testify. I am saying that now here. I am right now sitting here finally\u2014finally after a year and six months in jail, free of all this terror and nervousness and pain and everything that me and my family has had to suffer. I\u2019m here now finally getting to tell the truth, and what really happened in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">THE STATE: Did you ever communicate to me that you were going to testify, or you\u2019d be willing to testify in the prosecution of Mr. Elmer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">[COUNSEL FOR ELMER]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-8\">[COUNSEL FOR BROWN]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-9\">THE COURT: Sustained. It\u2019s already been asked and answered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">Counsel again approached the bench and the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-11\">[COUNSEL FOR ELMER]: I want to formally object for the record that Your Honor permitted the state\u2019s attorney to ask questions about plea negotiations, or questions after it was plea negotiations, preliminary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-12\">THE COURT: This was already objected to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-13\">[COUNSEL FOR ELMER]: But you permitted him to continue. That\u2019s totally wrong for a state\u2019s attorney\u2014 THE COURT: You\u2019ve already got your objection. What are you bringing it up again for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-14\">[COUNSEL FOR ELMER]: Because we\u2014for the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>THE COURT: You got it for the record the first time. You have it on the record, gentlemen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Elmer filed a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate court affirmed, noting that Elmer based his entire appeal on a violation of Maryland Rule 5-410. <em>Elmer, </em>119 Md.App. at 219, 704 A.2d at 517.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court held that Rule 5-410 \u201cbars the introduction of evidence and no evidence was introduced in the instant case regarding any plea bargaining statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 214, 704 A.2d at 515. The court further held that Rule 5-410 applies only to one who is a party to the plea negotiations. <em>Id. </em>at 216, 704 A.2d at 516. Because Brown or his counsel, and not Elmer, participated in plea discussions, Elmer could not complain that the rule was violated and that any statements made by Brown were inadmissible as to him. <em>Id. </em>at 216, 704 A.2d at 516. We granted Elmer\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Petitioner argues that the statements of Brown or Brown\u2019s lawyer were inadmissible against him because the statements violated the rules against hearsay and the confrontation clauses of the Sixth Amendment and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Petitioner maintains that as to Brown, Maryland Rule 5-410 excludes statements of both Brown and his lawyer made during plea negotiations. Petitioner contends that, despite Brown\u2019s denial of the statement at issue, Petitioner was prejudiced by the repeated asking of the question. Simply because Brown denied making the statements attributed to him by the prosecutor does not end the inquiry and the prosecutor, through his questioning of Brown, informed the jury that the statements had, in fact, been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>The State counters that Elmer cannot complain that Brown\u2019s statements were offered to impeach Brown because Rule 5-410 applies only to the defendant who made the plea or was a participant in the plea discussions. In any case, no such evidence was admitted against Elmer because Brown denied making the statement that Brown pulled the trigger. The State\u2019s final position is in the nature of a harmless error argument\u2014that since Brown denied the statement, Elmer was not unfairly prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">A;</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Maryland Rule 5-410 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq9\">(a) <em>Generally. </em>Except as otherwise provided in this Rule, evidence of the following is not admissible against the defendant who made the plea or was a participant in the plea discussions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-8\">jfc :fc <em>% </em>sH</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-9\">(4) any statement made in the course of plea discussions with an attorney for the prosecuting authority which do not result in a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or which result in a plea of guilty or nolo contendere which was not accepted or was later withdrawn or vacated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">The plain language of the rule provides that statements made in the course of plea negotiations with an attorney for the State are inadmissible against the defendant who participated in those negotiations. Because Elmer did not participate in Brown\u2019s plea negotiations, the Rule does not proscribe the State\u2019s use of the statement as to Elmer.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">Maryland Rule 5-410 was derived from Federal Rule of Evidence 410 (also known as Rule 11(e)(6) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure) and is virtually identical with its federal counterpart. Like the Maryland rule, the federal rule provides that statements made in the course of plea negotiations with a government attorney are inadmissible against a defendant who participated in those negotiations. Participation in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>the negotiations is a requisite. <em>United States v. Testa, </em>33 F.3d 747, 751 (7th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The purpose behind both rules is to encourage plea bargaining and the open and candid discussions between prosecuting authorities and defendants. As the Court of Special Appeals pointed out, this reasoning finds support in the Advisory Committee Note to Federal Rule of Evidence 410. <em>Elmer, </em>119 Md.App. at 216, 704 A.2d at 516; <em>see Jackson v. State, </em>340 Md. 705, 716, 668 A.2d 8, 13-14 (1995) (noting that when federal rule of evidence contains same language as Maryland rule of evidence, court may look to former when interpreting latter). The Advisory Committee Note indicates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar\">Limiting the exclusionary rale to use against the accused is consistent with the purpose of the rale, since the possibility of use for or against other persons will not impair the effectiveness of withdrawing pleas or the freedom of discussion which the rule is designed to foster.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The purpose of the rale would not be furthered by extending its application to include defendants who were not a party to the plea negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Our inquiry does not end, however, with the determination that the issue is not governed by Rule 5-410. The inapplicability of Rule 5-410 to Petitioner does not transform evidence inadmissible under Rule 5-410 against Brown and otherwise inadmissible against Petitioner into admissible evidence. The State does not argue that the questioning of Brown as to his statements to his lawyer or his lawyer\u2019s statements to the prosecutor were admissible as to Brown.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The evidence was likewise inadmissible against Elmer, albeit on different grounds. As to Elmer, the statement which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>prosecutor attempted to elicit from Brown constituted inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Keeping in mind that the evidence which the prosecutor was attempting to elicit was inadmissible evidence as to both Elmer and Brown, we now turn to the conduct of the prosecutor during questioning. We must determine if the prosecutor\u2019s questions were improper, and if so, \u201cwe look at the remarks in the context of the entire record and determine whether the defendants were deprived of fair trials.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>8 F.3d 398, 415 (7th Cir.1993). Indeed, the Court of Special Appeals discussed the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct in repeatedly pursuing the line of inquiry.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-6\">The prosecutor here exhibited temerity in the face of these principles by asking the question of Brown. He could not prove that Brown made the statement alleged, and the entire area of inquiry was infused with the clienVattomey privilege, the inadmissibility of plea bargaining discussions, and perhaps even <em>Bruton [v. U.S., </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968)7 problems. We assume in the prosecutor\u2019s defense that Brown\u2019s confession on the stand came as a surprise, since Brown\u2019s counsel had apparently indicated to the prosecutor prior to trial that Brown would be willing to testify in appellant\u2019s trial. Once Brown\u2019s counsel explained at sidebar that his client had never made the statement, however, the prosecutor had no business maintaining this line of inquiry and should have withdrawn the question. By repeating the question in verbatim detail, even down to editing out the \u201cF\u201d word for the benefit of propriety, the prosecutor only exacerbated the potential for the question to mislead the jury into treating the question itself as actual evidence. In posing the question a third time, he asked whether Brown, a co-defendant, had said he would testify against appellant, which placed before the jury the additional inference that Brown had engaged in plea negotiations____ When the prosecutor asked his fourth and final question (which went unanswered), he even went so far as to ask, \u2018Did you ever <em>communicate to me </em>that you were going to testify____\u2019 This gave the jury the clear impres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>sion that the prosecutor\u2019s entire line of questions regarding Brown\u2019s prior inconsistent statement was based on personal knowledge and derived from Brown himself. Not only did the prosecutor have no ability to prove this, it was actually known by him to be false. Attempting to give the jury a knowingly false impression presses the limits of judicial tolerance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-5\"><em>Elmer, </em>119 Md.App. at 218-19, 704 A.2d at 517 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">It is misconduct for a lawyer to inject inadmissible matters before a jury by asking a question that suggests its own otherwise inadmissible answer, \u201choping that the jury will draw the intended meaning from the question itself____\u201d C. Wolfram, Modern Legal Ethics, \u00a7 12.1.2, at 623 (1986). As to prosecutors, a prosecutor may not ask a question \u201cwhich implies a factual predicate which the examiner knows he cannot support by evidence____\u201d <em>United States v. Elizondo, </em>920 F.2d 1308, 1313 (7th Cir.1990) (quoting <em>United States v. Harris, </em>542 F.2d 1283, 1307 (7th Cir.1976)); <em>United States v. Meeker, </em>558 F.2d 387, 389 (7th Cir.1977); <em>see also, </em>National Prosecution Standards \u00a7 77.2, at 211 (2d. ed. 1991) (hereinafter Prosecution Standards) (\u201cCounsel should not ask a question which implies the existence of a factual predicate which he knows to be untrue or has no reasonable objective basis for believing is true.\u201d); American Bar Association Standards for Criminal Justice, Prosecution Function, Standard 3-5.7(d), at 103 (3d. ed. 1993) (hereinafter ABA Standards) (\u201cA prosecutor should not ask a question which implies the existence of a factual predicate for which a good faith belief is lacking.\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>\u201cA lawyer who has no reason to believe that a matter is subject to proof may not, by pursuing the matter in examining a witness ... attempt to create the impression that the matter is factual.\u201d Wolfram, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 12.1.2, at 628. The problem is that whether the question is answered or not, the jury has been alerted to the fact which the question assumes. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">In <em>United States v. Meeker, </em>558 F.2d 387 (7th Cir.1977), the prosecutor asked witnesses four improper questions. The first question alluded to matters that the prosecutor had no reason to believe would be supported by admissible evidence, the second question left the jury with a false impression of defendant\u2019s prior criminal activity, the third question contained \u201can implication that the defendant was guilty of engaging in the conduct for which he was on trial,\u201d and the final question asked for inadmissible opinion evidence which was irrelevant to the case. <em>Id. </em>at 388-89. The court reversed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">[T]he questions invited the jury to convict [the defendant] on facts outside the record, some of which were patently untrue, and others of which were not admissible at trial. \u2018The prejudice to a defendant of inviting conviction on facts\u2014if they be such\u2014dehors the record is counter to the basic concept of fairness.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">... [C]oming from the mouth of the representative of the United States, of whom the average jury expects fairness and impartiality ..., such prejudicial questions \u2018carry much weight against the accused when they should properly carry none.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 390 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">This is exactly what happened in this case. As we have noted, the prosecutor\u2019s questions suggested the existence of facts which he could not prove, and indeed, after the bench conference, he <em>knew </em>he could not prove. Following the bench conference where defense counsel articulated the source of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>information, the prosecutor lacked a good faith belief in the factual predicate implied in the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">In addition to conveying the impression to the jury that he had superior information of facts not in evidence before the jury, the prosecutor\u2019s questions were improper because they implied his personal opinion concerning Brown\u2019s truthfulness. A prosecutor may not express or imply his or her personal opinion concerning a witness\u2019s truthfulness. <em>Robinson, </em>8 F.3d at 415; <em>see also United States v. Hartmann, </em>958 F.2d 774, 786 (7th Cir.1992). Because the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry was highly prejudicial and inadmissible as to both Brown and Petitioner, the trial court should have precluded the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">We now turn to the State\u2019s contention that notwithstanding the improper inquiry, Petitioner was not prejudiced and thus, the error was harmless. The State argues that Petitioner was not prejudiced because Brown denied making the statement and also provided a detailed and plausible explanation for the origin of the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">It would be folly to suggest that questions alone cannot impeach. This notion was well-stated by then Chief Judge Wilner, now a member of this Court, writing for the intermediate appellate court in <em>Craig v. State, </em>76 Md.App. 250, 292, 544 A.2d 784, 805, (1988), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>316 Md. 551, 560 A.2d 1120 (1989), <em>jdgmt. vacated on other grounds, </em>497 U.S. 836, 110 S.Ct. 3157, 111 L.Ed.2d 666 (1990):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-9\">Questions alone <em>can </em>impeach. Apart from their mere wording, through voice inflections and other mannerisms of the examiner\u2014things that cannot be discerned from the printed record\u2014they can insinuate; they can suggest; they can accuse; they can create an aura in the courtroom that the trial judge can sense but about which we could only speculate. The most persistent denials, even from articulate adult witnesses, may not suffice to overcome the suspicion they can engender....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Other courts also have recognized that \u201c[a]n improper incriminating question or series of questions may constitute reversible error in certain cases.\u201d <em>United States v. Arambula-Ruiz, </em>987 F.2d 599, 606 (9th Cir.1993) (citing <em>Douglas v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 415, 419, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 1077, 13 L.Ed.2d 934 (1965)). In <em>Douglas, </em>the defendant and an alleged accomplice were tried separately in state court for assault with intent to murder. <em>Id. </em>at 416, 85 S.Ct. at 1075. The state called the alleged accomplice as a state\u2019s witness, who repeatedly refused to testify on self-incrimination grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 416, 85 S.Ct. at 1075. The prosecutor read his alleged confession to him, asking him \u201cDid you make that statement?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 416, 85 S.Ct. at 1075. The statement incriminated Douglas by naming him as the person who fired the shotgun blast which wounded the victim. <em>Id. </em>at 417, 85 S.Ct. at 1076. Although the alleged co-conspirator\u2019s refusals to answer were not technically testimony, the Supreme Court held that the questioning was reversible error because \u201cthe [prosecutor\u2019s] reading may well have been the equivalent in the jury\u2019s mind of testimony that [the co-conspirator] in fact made the statement____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 419, 85 S.Ct. at 1077. <em>See </em>ABA Standard 3-5.8 commentary, at 107 (\u201cAssertions of fact not proven amount to unsworn testimony of the advocate and are not subject to cross-examination.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">The attempted impeachment of Brown with his alleged prior inconsistent statement that Petitioner was the shooter necessarily increased the possibility that Petitioner might be convicted on the basis of this unsworn evidence.

Several witnesses testified that Brown and Elmer had left the development after the initial rock-throwing incident. Witnesses also testified that after returning to the development, Elmer pointed a shotgun out of the window of the car. The jury rationally could have inferred that Brown and Elmer left the development to retrieve this shotgun. Several witnesses testified that Elmer fired the shotgun; he also had nine shotgun shells in his pockets when he was arrested. There was sufficient evidence for the jury to infer that Brown and Elmer left the development to retrieve a shotgun, and that Elmer fired the shotgun in retaliation for the earlier rock-throwing incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Assuming that the jury believed that Brown, and not Elmer, was the shooter, there was sufficient evidence for a rational jury to infer that Elmer was at least an aider and abettor to the shooting. The jury could have inferred that Elmer was actively involved in a plan to retrieve a shotgun, return to the development, and retaliate against the rock-throwers. Accordingly, we shall reverse the judgment and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED, CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CECIL COUNTY, AND REMAND CASE TO THAT COURT FOR NEW TRIAL.

First, the majority reaches out to reverse on an issue not properly before the Court and not decided by the Court of Special Appeals in its review of the instant conviction. The intermediate appellate court refused to decide the issue upon which this Court reverses because that issue was not raised on appeal, and Elmer\u2019s petition for certiorari does not challenge the intermediate appellate court\u2019s decision that the issue was not properly preserved for appeal. Second, the Court reverses a conviction, not because there was any improperly admitted testimony, but solely because of questions asked by the prosecutor. Third, when the witness denied making any prior inconsistent statement, the witness\u2019s denial of the statement apparently satisfied trial counsel, and there was no request for a curative instruction and no request for a mistrial. If counsel believed that mere questions alone constituted incurable prejudicial error, then it ought to be incumbent on counsel to request a mistrial, not to wait to see if the verdict is unfavorable.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">THE ISSUE BEFORE THIS COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">We must keep in mind that co-defendant Brown\u2019s conviction was reversed because Brown was cross-examined about statements his attorney made to the State\u2019s Attorney during plea bargaining discussions in violation of Md. Rule 5-410. The Court of Special Appeals held, and this Court agrees, that Petitioner Elmer is not entitled to have his conviction reversed on this ground. Elmer\u2019s case must be viewed separately from Brown\u2019s case. Brown was, in effect, testifying as a defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>witness for Elmer because his testimony inculpated himself and exculpated Elmer. Even though the physical evidence and the witness testimony was consistent with the passenger, Elmer, being the person who fired the shotgun, Brown took the stand and testified that it was he, and not Elmer, who fired the gun. That testimony exculpating Elmer was what triggered the cross-examination at issue. The majority decides that a witness, not called by the State, who testifies that he, not the defendant, fired the shots, cannot be cross-examined by the State as to whether he made any prior inconsistent statements, even though the prosecutor was told by the witness\u2019s attorney that the witness would testify that the defendant fired the shots.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The only evidentiary issue presented to and decided by the Court of Special Appeals in the instant case was whether Elmer could object because the prosecutor\u2019s questioning of Brown violated the Maryland rule prohibiting evidence of statements made during plea discussions. Md. Rule 5-410(a)(4).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The majority recognizes that the Court of Special Appeals held, \u201cElmer based his entire appeal on a violation of Maryland Rule 5-410.\u201d 353 Md. 1, 9, 724 A.2d 625, 628 (1999). The intermediate appellate court had concerns about the prosecutor\u2019s questions but did not reach that issue, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">\u201cIn spite of all our concerns regarding the propriety of the prosecutor\u2019s conduct, <em>the appellant has based his appeal entirely upon Rule 5-kl0(a)(h) and its policies, </em>and Brown\u2019s case must be addressed separately. We find no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>error with regard to appellant arising out of Rule 5-410(a)(4) or its policies.\u201d (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-5\"><em>Elmer v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 205, 219, 704 A.2d 511, 517 (1998). The evidentiary issue in the petition of writ of certiorari also seemed to address only the issue of whether the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s cross-examination of Brown violated Md. Rule 5-410. The issue in Elmer\u2019s petition for certiorari was framed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">\u201cWhether the Court of Special Appeals erred in affirming the judgments despite the error of the trial court in permitting the prosecutor to cross-examine the co-defendant Robert Brown with statements made by his counsel during plea negotiations, statements <em>inadmissible against him under Maryland Rule lt,10(a)(k) </em>and which directly incriminated Mr. Elmer.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">This Court, as did the Court of Special Appeals, holds that the State\u2019s cross-examination of Brown concerning statements made during his plea bargaining was not inadmissible under Md. Rule 5-410(a)(4) because: \u201cThe purpose of [Md. Rule 5-410] would not be furthered by extending its application to include defendants who were not a party to the plea negotiations.\u201d 353 Md. at 11, 724 A.2d at 630; <em>Elmer, </em>119 Md.App. at 219, 704 A.2d at 517. Thus, on the only evidentiary issue decided by the Court of Special Appeals, this Court agrees with the intermediate appellate court that there was no violation of Md. Rule 5-410 because the rule\u2019s prohibition does not apply to a co-defendant who was not involved in the plea negotiations. Since this Court concurs with the intermediate appellate court on the only evidentiary issue before either appellate court, we should not reach, let alone reverse on, the issue of whether a new trial is necessary because questions asked by the prosecutor, not answers given by the witness, constituted prejudicial error, even if Md. Rule 5-410 was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">WERE THE PROSECUTOR\u2019S QUESTIONS IMPROPER?</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">Robert Brown was a co-defendant on trial with David Elmer. He testified as a defense witness. Unquestionably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>the prosecutor has a right to cross-examine any defense witness about a prior inconsistent statement when the prosecutor has a good faith belief the prior inconsistent statement was made by the witness. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-613(a). Why then was the mere question about a prior inconsistent statement so improper that, even though the witness denies making the statement, the mere asking of the question requires a new trial? Brown\u2019s counsel acknowledged that he came to the prosecutor and told the prosecutor that his client was willing to plead guilty to reckless endangerment and that he \u201cexpect[ed] my client to testify [that Elmer was the shooter].\u201d The trial judge also apparently accepted the prosecutor\u2019s representation that defense counsel said that Brown <em>\u201cwanted to testify </em>in my prosecution\u201d of Elmer and \u201chis client would testify just exactly the same as I am asking right now.\u201d The State\u2019s Attorney and the trial judge could conclude that Brown\u2019s attorney was authorized to make those representations about how Brown would testify, and because they were intended by Brown to be conveyed to a third party, <em>i.e., </em>the prosecutor, they were no longer privileged. It is well recognized that information a client gives to an attorney to be conveyed to a third person is not privileged. <em>See </em>John W. Strong, McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 91, at 333 (4th ed. 1992) (\u201cWherever the matters communicated to the attorney are intended by the client to be made public or revealed to third persons, obviously the element of confidentiality is wanting.\u201d). The trial judge could quite properly conclude the prosecutor had a good faith belief that Brown\u2019s counsel was repeating what he was told by his client and that defense counsel was not offering perjury or merely guessing when he informed the prosecutor that Brown would testify Elmer was the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">It is noteworthy that, in all of the questions where the judge overruled Elmer\u2019s objections, the prosecutor\u2019s questions were not based on prior inconsistent statements made directly to the prosecutor, but simply were \u201cdid you ever make the statement____\u201d When Brown denied making the inconsistent statements, the only evidence before the jury was Brown\u2019s denial, and up to that point there was no suggestion by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>prosecutor that any of the inconsistent statements were made or even relayed to him. It was not a matter of the prosecutor\u2019s credibility being weighed against the defendant\u2019s credibility; Brown was simply asked whether he made any inconsistent statements to anyone and he denied having done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The questions that the Court seems to find most offensive were asked after Brown denied making any inconsistent statement. Faced with Brown\u2019s denial of ever telling anyone that Elmer was the shooter and reasonably believing Brown sent a messenger, his attorney, to the prosecutor with the message that, in fact, Brown would testify that Elmer was the shooter, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">\u201cTHE STATE: Mr. Brown, didn\u2019t you say that you would testify to just that in the prosecution of Mr. Elmer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af\">BROWN: No, I did not. That was never said, no. I never said I was going to testify. I am saying that now here. I am right now sitting here finally\u2014finally after a year and six months in jail, free of all this terror and nervousness and pain and everything that me and my family has had to suffer. I\u2019m here now finally getting to tell the truth, and what really happened in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">THE STATE: Did you ever communicate to me that you were going to testify, or you\u2019d be willing to testify in the prosecution of Mr. Elmer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-8\">[COUNSEL FOR ELMER]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-9\">[COUNSEL FOR BROWN]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-10\">THE COURT: Sustained. It\u2019s already been asked and answered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">The first and most important question of this colloquy was not even objected to, perhaps because Brown\u2019s defense counsel knew it was accurate and based on his conversations with the State. The follow-up question was objected to, and the objection was sustained because the question was repetitious of the previous question that was asked and answered without objection. These were the only questions that in any way indicated statements were made to the prosecutor and that implicated the prosecutor\u2019s credibility. One was not objected to, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>follow-up repetitious question was objected to and the objection was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">In addition, these questions were based on the fact that Brown\u2019s attorney acknowledged to the trial judge that, acting as Brown\u2019s agent, he told the State\u2019s Attorney that Brown would testify that Elmer was the shooter. It really is difficult to understand what the prosecutor did that justifies reversing Elmer\u2019s conviction based solely on these cross-examination questions, even if the issue was properly before this Court. The State\u2019s Attorney simply used a leading question to cross-examine a defense witness about a prior inconsistent statement he had reason to believe the witness made to an agent to be conveyed to the State\u2019s Attorney. Maryland Rule 5\u2014611(c) permits leading questions and Md. Rule 5-613(a) permits examining a witness about a prior inconsistent statement. Both appellate courts held the question does not violate Md. Rule 5-410 prohibiting questions about statements made during plea discussions. There is no suggestion, let alone any valid claim, that the questions violated the attorney-client privilege because the questions related to Brown\u2019s proposed testimony, which Brown apparently intended to be communicated to the State\u2019s Attorney via his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">How does the majority justify reversing this conviction? At one point the majority tells us: \u201cAs to Elmer, the statement which the prosecutor attempted to elicit from Brown constituted inadmissible hearsay.\u201d 353 Md. at 11-12, 724 A.2d at 630. If the majority is really suggesting that impeaching an adverse witness with the witness\u2019s own prior inconsistent statements constitutes inadmissible hearsay, this radical departure from Md. Rule 5-613, which covers prior statements by a witness, should be more fully explained. Another reason given by the majority for its reversal apparently involves an appellate fact finding that is simply not justified by the record. The majority says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">\u201c[T'jhe prosecutor\u2019s questions suggested the existence of facts which he could not prove, and indeed, after the bench conference, he <em>knew </em>he could not prove. Following the bench conference where defense counsel articulated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>source of the information, the prosecutor lacked a good faith belief in the factual predicate implied in the question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Amq\">353 Md. at 14-15, 724 A.2d at 631 (1999). The trial judge had a hearing at the bench and obviously concluded that the prosecutor had a good faith belief that Brown told his attorney Elmer was the shooter and/or he would testify Elmer was the shooter. There was a dispute about what the defense attorney said, and the trial judge was entitled to accept the State\u2019s version, but even accepting only the defense version, the judge could still find a good faith basis for the prosecutor\u2019s questions. Defense counsel said to the judge, \u201cI told him what my client would testify to. I never told him my client said that.\u201d That clarification at the bench after the colloquy began does not negate the prosecutor\u2019s good faith belief that defense counsel\u2019s representation about what his client would say under oath was based on what his client told him, even if defense counsel did not expressly so state. If an attorney represents to another member of the bar \u201cthis is what my client would testify to,\u201d then it could be reasonably assumed that this was not merely a wild guess, but that the attorney was authorized by the client to so state or, at least, that the client led the attorney to believe that would be the client\u2019s testimony. It is reasonable to assume that attorneys, unless they have express authorization or a sound basis for doing so, would not make representations about how their clients would testify. Because Brown\u2019s attorney expressly stated to the State\u2019s Attorney, \u201cthis is what my client will testify to,\u201d the State\u2019s Attorney is entitled to assume that is what the client said and need not assume that the attorney was just making this up or offering to have his client testify any way the State wanted him to.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Let us look at another example of the same issue. A witness\u2019s attorney comes to a plaintiff in a civil case and says \u201cmy client, John, wants to testify in your case and will testify the defendant\u2019s light was red.\u201d Months later when the case comes to trial, John is called by the defendant and testifies the defendant\u2019s light was green. A trial judge ought to be able to conclude that there is a good faith basis for the plaintiff to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>cross-examine John about whether he ever told anyone that the light was red, or told his lawyer that he would testify that the light was red. Posing those questions in cross-examination based on what the plaintiff was told by the witness\u2019s attorney should not be deemed to be bad faith and reversible error. These are analogous to the cross-examination questions asked by the State\u2019s Attorney in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The few cases cited by the majority for their language about a prosecutor\u2019s duty are really not relevant. I agree there should be a reversal when the prosecutor acting in bad faith attempts to get inferences not based on evidence before the jury in the question, or where the fact assumed to be true in the prosecutor\u2019s question was inadmissible and prejudicial, or perhaps even where the fact improperly assumed to be true in the question was not denied by the witness and thus might be assumed to be true by the jury. None of the cases cited by the majority reversed a conviction where the question was based on a good faith belief that the fact asserted as part of the question was true and where the question sought to elicit an admissible prior inconsistent statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">FAILURE TO REQUEST A MISTRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">A final troubling aspect of the majority\u2019s decision is that the Court finds that the prosecutor\u2019s questions were so prejudicial as to require a new trial, but the defense attorney did not think the questions were prejudicial enough to ask for a mistrial. There was no inadmissible evidence in the instant case; at most there were improper questions. When the questions were asked defense counsel merely objected but he did not request a mistrial. After the questions objected to were answered and Brown denied ever making any statement inconsistent with his trial testimony that he, not Elmer, was the shooter, counsel seemed quite willing to let the trial continue. When the final, and perhaps most damaging, question was asked about whether Brown communicated a prior inconsistent statement to the prosecutor, there was not even an objection until the question was again asked, and then defense counsel\u2019s objection was sustained and again, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>there was a colloquy at the bench, there was no motion for mistrial or curative instruction. Does the majority really believe the benefits to Elmer from Brown\u2019s testimony that he, not Elmer, was the shooter were nullified by the questions concerning Brown\u2019s prior inconsistent statement, especially when he denied making the statements? The reason why Elmer\u2019s attorney did not make any motion for a mistrial seems obvious; defense counsel did not believe the cross-examination questions, especially when the inconsistent statements were denied, were so prejudicial that the trial should be aborted. Had Elmer\u2019s counsel requested and received a mistrial, there was a good chance that at any subsequent trial co-defendant Brown might not be available or willing to assume culpability for the shooting and exonerate Elmer. A new trial, possibly without co-defendant Brown\u2019s exculpatory testimony, would not be as advantageous as the present trial with Brown\u2019s exculpatory testimony, regardless of any inference that Brown may have made a prior inconsistent statement to the prosecutor. A mistrial may not have been requested by Elmer\u2019s attorney because it would not have been advantageous to his client at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">When an improper question is asked and there is an objection, the attorney is saying the question should not be answered, and if the judge sustains the objection, there is no reversible error unless the attorney asks for and is denied a mistrial. When the question is not answered or the answer the witness gives is favorable to the objecting party, that ought to be treated the same as the judge sustaining the objection. An objection is, in effect, a statement that the question as phrased should not be answered. It is not a statement that the question is so prejudicial that the trial must immediately be aborted even if the objection is sustained, the witness does not give any response or any damaging response. If a question is objected to and either the question is not answered or the answer is favorable to the objecting party, then the question objected to should be considered moot, and if the attorney makes no further request, then there should be no reversible error. When an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>attorney believes the opponent\u2019s question is so prejudicial that nothing will cure the prejudice regardless of whether the objection is sustained, the question is not answered, or the answer is favorable, then it should be incumbent on the attorney not to merely object, but to request a mistrial. If there is a mere objection to a question and not a motion for mistrial, the question becomes harmless by the objection being sustained, the witness not answering the question, or the question being answered in a manner clearly favorable to the objecting party. In the absence of a motion for mistrial, merely objecting to a question that evokes no answer or a favorable answer should not justify a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">An attorney must make clear and explicit any request for a mistrial. In this case, after Elmer\u2019s counsel\u2019s objection had already been sustained, he approached the bench and made another formal objection. When the court responded, \u201cYou\u2019ve already got your objection. What are you bringing it up again for?\u201d Elmer\u2019s counsel replied the objection was being made \u201cfor the record.\u201d At this point, if the attorney really felt so prejudiced that the trial should be aborted, counsel should have requested a mistrial. If the court granted a mistrial in the absence of a clear request, as the majority requires, it might impair prospects for a new trial due to the defendant\u2019s double jeopardy rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In all of the cases cited by the majority where a prosecutor\u2019s question justified a new trial, there were defense requests for mistrial and the reversible error was in not granting the mistrial. <em>See Douglas v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 415, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 13 L.Ed.2d 934 (1965); <em>United States v. Meeker, </em>558 F.2d 387 (7th Cir.1977). The majority cites no case, and I have found no cases, where merely objecting to a question that ultimately produces an answer favorable to the objecting party justified a new trial in the absence of a motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">The type of questioning that the majority decides must require a new trial, even in the absence of a harmful answer or a motion for mistrial, occurs not infrequently during cross-examination. Usually, when leading questions that imply the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>existence of a fact or statement known to the cross-examiner are denied by the witness, the situation is dealt with by a curative instruction or an instruction routinely given to the jury at the end of the case. For example, 1 Modern Federal Jury Instructions \u00b6 5.01, at 5-12 (1998), instruction 5-3, Questions, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">\u201cLet me emphasize that a lawyer\u2019s question is not evidence. At times, a lawyer on cross-examination may have incorporated into a question a statement which assumed certain facts to be true and asked the witness if the statement was true. If the witness denies the truth of a statement, and if there is no evidence in the record proving that the assumed fact is true, then you may not consider the fact to be true simply because it was contained in the lawyer\u2019s question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-6\"><em>See also </em>1 Federal Jury Practice and Instructions, Civil and Criminal \u00a7 12.08, at 347 (4th ed. 1992) (\u201cThe questions asked by a lawyer for either party to this case are not evidence. If a lawyer asks a question of a witness which contains an assertion of fact, therefore, you may not consider the assertion by the lawyer as any evidence of that fact. Only the answers are evidence.\u201d). Had Elmer\u2019s attorney requested such an instruction in the instant case and had the judge refused, then there would have been cause for reversal. The obligation should be on counsel who believes a client is prejudiced by a mere cross-examination question, even though it is answered by the witness in a manner favorable to the client, to either request a curative instruction or a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">HARMLESS ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">A primary issue raised by the State in the Court of Special Appeals and an issue that is always before this Court pursuant to Md. Rule 8-131(b) is harmless error. Since the intermediate appellate court affirmed Elmer\u2019s conviction, that court did not decide the harmless error issue. It is difficult to imagine a case better suited to the application of the harmless error doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>The instant case involved a drive-by shooting with racial overtones. Two white males drove into a predominantly African-American housing development and swerved toward a group of African-American youngsters, narrowly missing one of them. The teenagers walked to a nearby basketball court and told two people there what had just occurred. When the same two men driving the same car returned to the area, people threw rocks at the car. The car again swerved toward the crowd and drove into the basketball area.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">A short time later the car returned for a third time, and Elmer, the passenger, was brandishing a loaded shotgun. The gun belonged to Elmer, and he had nine additional shotgun shells in his pocket. The shotgun was discharged, wounding an innocent bystander. Based on the evidence and the jury\u2019s findings, the issue of who actually pulled the trigger is simply irrelevant. The jury quite properly found both men conspired to commit an assault with intent to disable and both were joint participants in shooting with intent to disable. The evidence more than justified both of these guilty verdicts as to both of these participants. Since Brown and Elmer were joint conspirators and joint participants, it is irrelevant who pulled the trigger. Even if the question posed to Brown erroneously implied a prior inconsistent statement that Elmer was the shooter, that error was harmless beyond any reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Appellate courts should be very cautious in reversing any judgment where there was no inadmissible evidence presented to the trier of fact. Reversal in the absence of a motion for mistrial should not occur merely because of a cross-examination question that contained an assertion of fact and especially after, as in the instant case, the asserted fact is denied by the witness. I respectfully dissent from the portion of the Court\u2019s opinion reversing Elmer\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Judge RODOWSKY has authorized me to state that he joins in the views expressed in this concurring and dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b71-7\">.
