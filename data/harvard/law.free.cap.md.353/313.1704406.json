We hold that sovereign immunity does not preclude such an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">This case had its genesis in an automobile accident, in July 1989, in which David Kim, a 15 year old summer school student, was seriously injured. His parents, Joseph and Hoon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Kim, (the \u201cappellees\u201d), as next friends, filed a negligence action in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County against, among others, the State Highway Administration of the Department of Transportation (\u201cSHA\u201d), the appellant, and the Board of Education of Prince George\u2019s County (\u201cBOE\u201d). The case was tried to a jury, which, at the conclusion of the trial, returned a verdict awarding the appellees. $650,000 in damages. Pursuant to Maryland Code (1985, 1988 Repl.Vol., 1989 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 9-105<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the State Finance &amp; Proc. Article and COMAR 25.02.01.01(B)(1) (1984, Supp. 3 1989),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> with respect to the SHA, and pursuant to Maryland Code (1978, 1989 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 4-105<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Education Article, with respect to the BOE, the trial court reduced the award to $50,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>and $100,000, respectively, and judgment was entered accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">Both the SHA and the BOE noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. In an unreported opinion, that court affirmed the judgments. After the intermediate appellate court issued its mandate, the SHA tendered to the appellees, in payment of the judgment, its check for $50,000. It rejected, however, the appellees\u2019 demand for post-judgment interest on that judgment, from the date of its entry. Consequently, the appellees filed, in the circuit court, a motion for appropriate relief, in which they asked the court to award post-judgment interest on the SHA judgment. The court granted the appellees\u2019 motion, prompting the SHA\u2019s appeal. This Court, on its own motion, granted certiorari, before the Court of Special Appeals considered the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The appellant\u2019s argument proceeds from the premises that \u201c[t]he sovereign immunity of the State may only be waived if the General Assembly has authorized suits for damages and has provided for the payment of the resulting judgments or settlements[,] <em>Kee v. State Highway Administration, </em>313 Md. 445, 455, 545 A.2d 1312, 1317 (1988); <em>see Katz v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, </em>284 Md. 503, 508, 397 A.2d 1027, 1030 (1979)\u201d and that the Maryland Tort Claims Act does not authorize payments for injury, loss, or damage, in excess of $50,000 in situations arising under the Act. From <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>those premises, the appellant argues that, by awarding the appellees post-judgment interest on a judgment, for the maximum amount for which the State\u2019s sovereign immunity has been waived and for which provision has been made for payment, the circuit court, in effect, expanded the waiver of sovereign immunity beyond the contemplation of the General Assembly, to claims in excess of $50,000. The Legislature has neither authorized nor provided funds to pay post-judgment interest in that circumstance, it asserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The appellees argue, on the other hand, that the court quite properly awarded post-judgment interest on the judgment. The authority for doing so may be found, they maintain, by reading the Maryland Tort Claims Act in conjunction with Maryland Code (1974, 1989 Repl.Vol., 1989 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 11-107(a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article and Maryland Rule 2-604(b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because the State\u2019s sovereign immunity may be waived either directly or by implication and the right to post-judgment interest arises, not as a consequence of any damage their son suffered in the accident on July 25, 1989, but, instead, arises from the State\u2019s failure timely to pay the judgment rendered against it in February 1996, the appellees ask this Court to affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">As indicated, the issue we are asked to resolve is whether the State\u2019s sovereign immunity applies to post-judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>ment interest, where the judgment is for the maximum amount of damages permitted by the Maryland Tort Claims Act. We answer that question in the negative, concluding that the statute plainly and unambiguously does not so provide. We also recognize both that sovereign immunity bars the recovery of damages and that the award of post-judgment interest is not an award of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">By 1981 Md. Laws, Chap. 298, effective July 1, 1982, the General Assembly enacted the Maryland Tort Claims Act. Codified at Maryland Code (1974, 1980 Repl.Vol., 1983 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 5-401 through 5-408 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, this legislation waived the tort immunity of the State under specified conditions and, thus, \u201cafforded a remedy for individuals injured by tortious conduct attributable to the State.\u201d <em>Condon v. State, </em>332 Md. 481, 492, 632 A.2d 753, 758 (1993). Section 5-403(a) set forth the scope of the waiver: in six specified tort actions to recover damages,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201c to the extent and in the amount that the State is covered by a program of insurance.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Because it was but \u201ca cautious beginning in the effort to abolish the sovereign immunity doctrine,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> there were several enumerated instances in which the State\u2019s immunity was not waived. One such instance was when pre-judgment interest was sought. \u00a7 5-403(b).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In 1984, the Maryland Tort Claims Act was moved from Title 5, Subtitle 4, of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, to its present location in the State Government Article. <em>See </em>1984 Md. Laws, Chap. 284. The waiver of immunity provision, other than adding a tort action, <em>see </em>\u00a7 12-104(a), as well as the provision prescribing exceptions to the waiver, <em>see </em>\u00a7 12-104(b), remained substantially identical until they were amended in 1985. <em>See </em>1985 Md. Laws, Chap. 538, \u00a7 2. Those amendments deleted the specified categories for which immunity was waived, <em>see Clea v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>312 Md. 662, 671 n. 6, 541 A.2d 1303, 1307 n. 6 (1988), and, with regard to those for which immunity was not waived, the reference to the dollar amount of the claim. Section 12-104(b) was also amended to exclude from the waiver, acts and omissions committed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>malice or gross negligence, or outside the scope of the State employee\u2019s public duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Thus, from its inception, the Maryland Tort Claims Act has exempted pre-judgment interest from the waiver of the State\u2019s sovereign immunity. At the same time, noticeable by its absence from that legislation, and, in particular, its \u201cExclusions and limitations\u201d provision, is any mention of post-judgment interest. This difference in the treatment of pre-judgment and post-judgment interest is quite significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">a.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The allowance of interest on a judgment, at law, is of ancient lineage; the Maryland Legislature, very early in the history of the State, enacted legislation providing for the payment of interest on judgments. That legislation did not differentiate between debtors or in any way exempt the State from its reach, thereby, arguably demonstrating the legislature\u2019s desire that everyone, even the State, pay interest on judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">As early as 1802,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> among the Laws of Maryland was a statute mandating that an administrator or an executor of an estate pay not only verdicts meted out by juries, but also \u201cinterest thereon from the time of rendering the said judgment.\u201d See Ch. 101, \u00a7 1 of the Acts of 1802,1. Dorsey\u2019s Laws of Maryland (1840), at 471^72. A short time later, in Ch. 153, \u00a7 4 of the Acts of 1809, a statute of more general operation was enacted. It provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>\u201cAnd be it enacted, That in all cases where a verdict shall be given in any court of this state, the court before whom such verdict shall be given, shall and they are hereby authorized to enter such judgment upon the verdict as will carry an interest on the same until the payment of the damages assessed by the jury giving such verdict, in the same manner as is now used and practiced in the cases of a confession of judgment in said court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">I. Dorsey\u2019s Laws of Maryland (1840), at 590. Subsequently, a provision requiring the payment of post-judgment interest in respect of judgments by default was added to the laws of Maryland. <em>See </em>Ch. 161, \u00a7 5 of the Acts of 1811, I. Dorsey\u2019s Laws of Maryland (1840), at 605. That provision provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzL\">\u201cSec. 5. And be it enacted, That all judgments by default hereafter to be entered, shall carry .interest in the same manner that judgments entered upon a finding of a jury now do; Provided always, that nothing contained in this act, except so far as the same relates to judgments by default and appeals, shall extend or be construed to extend to any case now brought or pending in any of the courts of this state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The provision pertaining to post-judgment interest appearing in Maryland Code: Public General Laws (1888), Art. 26, \u00a7 16, addressed judgments generally.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It read simply: \u201c[a]ll judgments by confession, on verdict, or by default, shall be so entered as to carry interest from the time they are rendered.\u201d Although the provision in the 1914 Code was phrased somewhat differently,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the payment of post-judgment interest re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>mained a statutory requirement until Maryland Code (1951), Art. 26, \u00a7 17,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> was repealed in 1957 Md. Laws, Chap. 399, \u00a7 1, effective June 1, 1957, in favor of a rule on the subject, promulgated by this Court, pursuant to Art. IV, \u00a7 18A of the Maryland Constitution,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and upon the recommendation of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">That rule, Maryland Rule 642, (present Maryland Rule 2-604), was adopted July 18,1956, effective January 1,1957, as a part of the \u201ccodification of the rules and procedural statutes of Maryland with respect to normal law and equity actions, including appeals to the Court of Appeals.\u201d <em>See </em>Twelfth Report of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure (1956). Largely mirroring the language of the statute it was to replace, Maryland Code (1951), Art. 26, \u00a7 17, it provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">\u201cRule 642. Interest on Judgment .... Law</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-3\">A judgment by confession or by default shall be so entered as to carry interest from the time the judgment was rendered. A judgment on verdict shall be so entered as to carry interest from the date on which the verdict was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>rendered. A judgment <em>nisi </em>entered by the court following a special verdict pursuant to Rule 560 (Special Verdict) or trial by the court without a jury pursuant to Rule 564 (Trial by the Court) shall be so entered as to carry interest from the date of the entry of judgment nisi.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">The rule was \u201clegislative in nature,\u201d <em>see Ginnavan v. Silverstone, </em>246 Md. 500, 504-05, 229 A.2d 124, 126 (1967), and, like the antecedent statute, was applicable only to judgments at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">As this history demonstrates, the allowance of interest on a judgment is deep rooted in Maryland law. Both the statute codifying the practice and its successor Maryland Rule<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> predated the Maryland Tort Claims Act. Neither made an exception for the State. Moreover, when the Legislature enacted the Tort Claims Act, it did not include post-judgment interest in the list of exclusions from the waiver of sovereign immunity, even though pre-judgment interest was such an exclusion. The failure specifically to reserve the state\u2019s immunity with respect to post-judgment interest by including post-judgment interest in \u00a7 12-104(b) of the Act is evidence that it did so intentionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">We have stated on prior occasions that, when the Legislature acts, it \u201cis presumed to be aware of its own enactments,\u201d <em>State v. Hernandez, </em>344 Md. 721, 727, 690 A.2d 526, 529 (1997) (citing <em>GEICO v. Insurance Comm\u2019r, </em>332 Md. 124, 132, 630 A.2d 713, 717 (1993)), that it does so \u201cwith respect to, full knowledge and information as to prior and existing law and legislation on the subject of the statute and the policy of the prior law.\u201d <em>Bd. of Educ. of Garrett County v. Lendo, </em>295 Md. 55, 63, 453 A.2d 1185, 1189 (1982); <em>Harden v. Mass Transit Adm., </em>277 Md. 399, 406-07, 354 A.2d 817, 821 (1976). As one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>appellate court, addressing the issue <em>sub judice, </em>has put it, we know the Legislature \u201cwas well aware of [the] previously enacted definitions of interest,\u201d <em>Austin v. State, </em>831 S.W.2d 789, 791 (Tenn.App.1991), and of the ordinary meanings of pre-judgment and post-judgment interest; thus, if the Legislature had intended to place a limit on the award of post-judgment interest it would have stated as much.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">Moreover, it is well settled that, in determining legislative intent, we consider the language of a statute in its natural and ordinary signification, <em>see Whack v. State, </em>338 Md. 665, 672, 659 A.2d 1347, 1350 (1995); <em>Jones v. State, </em>336 Md. 255, 261, 647 A.2d 1204, 1206-7 (1994); <em>Parrison v. State, </em>335 Md. 554, 559, 644 A.2d 537, 539 (1994), and where the language is neither ambiguous nor obscure, the language itself is dispositive. <em>See Gardner v. State, </em>344 Md. 642, 648, 689 A.2d 610, 613 (1997); <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Jameson, </em>332 Md. 723, 732-33, 633 A.2d 93, 94 (1993). Section 12-104(b) is clear, it excludes from the State\u2019s waiver of immunity only those items specifically enumerated. Post-judgment interest is not one of the enumerated items.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">b.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Pre-judgment interest, as we have seen, is specifically included among the types of recoveries that are still subject to sovereign immunity, as provided in \u00a7 12-104(b). When the nature and purpose of pre-judgment interest is considered, in relation to the other items included in subsection (b), and contrasted to the nature and purpose of post-judgment interest, it becomes clear that the Legislature\u2019s exclusion of the latter was intentional. The common thread connecting the items listed in subsection (b) is that they are either elements of damages or claims or acts for which damages are recoverable. Post-judgment interest does not share that attribute, which explains why it was not included in the exclusions from the waiver of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Although pre-judgment interest ordinarily is not allowed in Maryland for bodily harm, emotional distress, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>other types of damages not capable of being precisely measured, <em>see Pine Street Trading v. Farrell Lines, </em>278 Md. 363, 377, 364 A.2d 1103, 1112 (1976), we stated in <em>I.W. Berman Prop. v. Porter Bros., </em>276 Md. 1, 16-17, 344 A.2d 65, 75 (1975):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABW\">\u201cGenerally, interest is not an inseparable and invariable incident of claims for money or unliquidated accounts, <em>City Pass. Rwy. Co. v. Sewell, </em>37 Md. 443, 452 (1873), it is recoverable as a matter of right under contracts in writing to pay money on a day certain, such as bills of exchange or promissory notes, <em>Isle of Thye Land Co. v. Whisman, </em>262 Md. 682, 708-09, 279 A.2d 484, 498 (1971); <em>Robt. C. Herd &amp; Co., Inc. v. Krawill Mach.

Settles, </em>322 Md. 555, 564, 588 A.2d 803, 807 (1991); <em>see also David Sloane, Inc. v. Stanley G.

And when allowed in those instances, the interest serves a compensatory function, to compensate an injured party for the harm that he or she suffered or prospectively will suffer, <em>see Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Armstrong, </em>326 Md. 107, 127, 604 A.2d 47, 56 (1992), and to make the plaintiff whole. <em>See Huppman v. Tighe, </em>100 Md.App. 655, 670, 642 A.2d 309, 317 (1994); <em>Exxon Corp. v. Yarema, </em>69 Md.App. 124, 137, 516 A.2d 990, 997 (1986). Consequently, pre-judgment interest is in the nature of an element of damages. <em>See Austin v. State, </em>831 S.W.2d 789, 792 (Tenn.App.1991) (It is a part of \u201cthe pecuniary consequences which the law imposes for the breach of some duty or violation of some right\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Post-judgment interest, on the other hand, serves to \u201ccompensate the judgment creditor for the loss of the monies due and owing to him by the judgment debtor from the time the judgment is entered until it is paid.\u201d <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Kelso Corp., </em>294 Md. 267, 271, 449 A.2d 406, 408 (1982). Otherwise stated, it \u201ccompensate^ the successful suitor for the .. .loss of the use of the monies represented by the judgment in its favor, and the loss of income thereon, between the time of the entry of the judgment ... -when there is a judicial determination of the monies owed it\u2014and the satisfaction of the judgment by payment.\u201d <em>I.W. Berman Properties v. Porter Bros., Inc., </em>276 Md. 1, 24, 344 A.2d 65, 79 (1975). Thus, there is a \u201cdistinct difference between pre-judgment interest which is a part of damages and interest on a judgment which does not constitute part of the damages.\u201d <em>Austin, supra, </em>831 S.W.2d at 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">As we have already observed, in Maryland, there has never been any attempt to treat the State differently from other litigants insofar as the payment of post-judgment interest is concerned. The Supreme Court of Minnesota has articulated a rationale for not doing so: \u201c[requiring the State to reim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>burse the expenses of litigation and to pay interest on the amount for which it has been adjudged liable imposes on the State the same financial pressure which encourages private persons to avoid litigation and to pay judgments promptly.\u201d <em>Lienhard v. State, </em>431 N.W.2d 861, 866 (Minn.1988).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>See also University of Texas Medical Branch v. York, </em>808 S.W.2d 106, 112 (Tex.App.1991), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>871 S.W.2d 175 ( 1994), in which the court, addressing a situation similar to the one under discussion, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-4\">\u201c[P]ost judgment interest is compensation allowed by law for the use of detention of money computed from the date of the rendition of a judgment until the date of its satisfaction. Interest as interest in such a situation is an incident of debt, and to be payable it requires an obligation binding on one person to pay money to another. Once the debt is established, unless there is an agreement as to when it is to be satisfied, the obligation to pay is immediate. Failure of the obligor to promptly pay deprives the obligee of the right to invest and earn interest on his money. The obligor benefits from the use of the money while the obligee does not. Thus, the award of interest on money owed is the only compensation available to the obligee who cannot enjoy the benefits of his own money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">The Texas Tort Claims Act limits the amount of damages one can recover from a governmental unit for a personal injury claim. Once the claim is proven and damages established, so long as the damages do not exceed the maximum authorized by statute, the obligation to pay is the same as that of any other debtor. The Act does not permit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>sovereign to withhold payment once the debt is established____ To deny this request [for post judgment interest] is to allow [the State] to keep control of the money for however long it desires, depriving the [plaintiffs], who have no recourse, the benefit and use of what is now their money. In other words, there is no incentive for [the state] to pay the [plaintiffs] the money that belongs to them. Because post-judgment interest is not considered to be damages, it does not affect the statutory amount controlled by the Tort Claims Act. Thus, we can find no reason why post judgment interest should not be awarded.\u201d ( citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">We agree with these authorities. Had the State paid the judgment on the date the verdict was rendered, its responsibility for the payment of interest would not have arisen. <em>See King v. State Roads Com\u2019n of State Highway Admin., </em>298 Md. 80, 85, 467 A.2d 1032, 1034 (1983); <em>Cook v. Toney, </em>245 Md. 42, 224 A.2d 857 (1966) ( A litigant is entitled to \u201cpost-judgment interest on the award at the legal rate from the date of entry of the judgment ... to the date the award is actually paid\u201d). <em>See also I.W. Berman Properties v. Porter Bros. Inc., </em>276 Md. at 21, 344 A.2d at 77. Having failed to do so, it must be held accountable for the payment of post-judgment interest. Otherwise, the State would be treated differently than other debtors, even though the applicable Rule and the statutes that preceded it drew no such distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Other States have considered the issue we address today,\u2014 whether, where there is both a statute waiving the defense of sovereign immunity as to certain causes of action and a statute imposing interest on judgments, the Legislature intended that the state pay post-judgment interest, reaching different results. The court in <em>Wilmer v. Board of County Commissioners of Leavenworth Kansas, </em>916 F.Supp. 1079, 1080-81 (D. Kan.1996), noting that the Kansas Tort Claims Act<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> explicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>prohibited the payment of pre-judgment interest over its statutory cap, while failing to address post-judgment interest, held that the latter was not subject to the statutory cap. <em>See id. </em>From the fact that the statute providing for an award of post-judgment interest was enacted six years before the Tort Claims Act, it concluded, \u201cif the legislature had intended for the cap to include within its limits interest..., it had an opportunity to draft the statute to reflect that intention.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1080. Similarly, in <em>Lienhard v. State, </em>431 N.W.2d 861, 862 (1988), the Minnesota Supreme Court held that post-judgment interest could be paid above the State\u2019s cap on tort damages, embodied in Minnesota\u2019s Tort Claims statute. In that case, the issue was whether the cap encompassed post-judgment interest, when the statute waiving the State\u2019s sovereign immunity contained no specific reference to the payment of interest. The Court was persuaded by the distinction drawn between pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, the former being an element of damages and the latter being \u201ccompensation for the loss of the use of money as a result of the nonpayment of a liquidated sum, for which liability has already been determined, not compensation for the injury giving rise to liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 865. Using similar reasoning, the Tennessee Court of Appeals concluded that a cap placed on a tort litigant\u2019s recovery by a Tennessee statute limiting the State\u2019s liability for tort claims<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> applied only to damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>awarded and not to post-judgment interest, awarded pursuant to a general statute imposing interest on judgments. <em>See Austin v. State, </em>831 S.W.2d 789, 791 (Tenn.App.1991). Examining the legislative history of the statute and noting that the Tennessee Legislature limited the award of \u201cdamages,\u201d rather than \u201cinterest,\u201d the court opined that since post-judgment interest does not constitute \u201cdamages,\u201d it is not subject to the cap on the award of damages. <em>See id </em>at 792. <em>See also University of Texas Medical Branch v. York, supra, </em>808 S.W.2d at 112 (where, under the Texas Tort Claims Act, prejudgment interest is recoverable as an element of damages, award of post-judgment interest in a personal injury case is not limited by the cap on damages, it not being an element of damages.); <em>Montgomery Hospital v. Medical Professional Liability Catastrophe Loss Fund, </em>668 A.2d 221, 223 (1995) (\u201ca Commonwealth party is liable for post-judgment interest even though payment of such interest would require the Commonwealth party to pay in excess of the statutory limit\u201d). <em>See also Folz v. State, </em>115 N.M. 639, 857 P.2d 39, 42 (App.1993) (noting that the post-judgment interest statute predated the Tort Claims Act, which prohibited pre-judgment interest, leading to the conclusion that the Legislature intended to award post-judgment interest); <em>See Gribben v. Kirk, </em>197 W.Va. 20, 475 S.E.2d 20, 26 (1996) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has reached a contrary result in <em>Onofrio v. Dept. of Mental Health, </em>411 Mass. 657, 584 N.E.2d 619 (1992). There, the Court reasoned that because \u201cthe Legislature provided for the recovery of damages from [the State of Massachusetts]... does not lead necessarily to the conclusion that the statute allows for the recovery of costs as well, because costs are an ancillary matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>to the underlying concern of liability for damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 620 (quoting <em>Ware v. Commonwealth, </em>409 Mass. 89, 564 N.E.2d 998, 999 (1981)). For similar reasons, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island has also declined to award post-judgment interest, noting that the Legislature had explicitly authorized only the award of damages, which did not include the payment of post or pre-judgment interest. <em>See Mulvaney v. Napolitano, </em>671 A.2d 312, 313 (R.I.1995); <em>see also Belletini v. Oklahoma, </em>920 P.2d 1067, 1071 (Okla.Ct.App.1996).

The ancient doctrine, which is still firmly embedded in the law of Maryland, <em>see Katz v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, </em>284 Md. 503, 507, 397 A.2d 1027, 1030 (1979), serves many purposes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Today, it continues to protect the State \u201cfrom burdensome interference with its governmental functions and [preserve] its control over State agencies and funds.\u201d <em>Katz v.

County Comm\u2019rs of St. Mary\u2019s County, </em>256 Md. 326, 334, 260 A.2d 295, 299 (1970).

Rather, we are cognizant of the fact that the Legislature did not choose to exclude expressly the payment of post-judgment interest from the waiver of sovereign immunity, as it has done with respect to pre-judgment interest. In any event, we do not believe that the goals of sovereign immunity are frustrated by requiring the State to pay post-judgment interest, since, as we have explained, such interest is not a measure of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY AFFIRMED.

The statute at issue in that case was the Kansas Tort Claims Act, K.S.A. 75-6105, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">\"(a) Subject to the provisions of K.S.A. 75-6111 and amendments thereto, the liability for claims within the scope of this act shall not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>exceed $500,000 for any number of claims arising out of a single occurrence or accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">\u201c(c) A governmental entity shall not be liable for punitive or exemplary damages or for interest prior to judgment. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b382-7\">. The Tennessee Code Annotated (Supp.1991), \u00a7 9-8-307, as relevant, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">\"(d) The state will be liable for actual damages only. No award shall be made unless the facts found by the commission would entitle the claimant to a judgment in an action at law if the state had been a private individual. The state will not be liable for punitive damages and the costs of litigation other than court costs. The state will not be liable for willful, malicious, or criminal acts by state employees, or for acts on the part of state employees done for personal gain.... If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>the claimant is successful with any claim filed with the claims commission after January 1, 1985, the state shall pay such interest as the commissioner may determine to be proper, not exceeding the legal rate as provided in \u00a7 47-14-121....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">\u201c(e) For causes of action arising in tort, the state shall only be liable for damages up to the sum of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) per claimant and one million dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence....\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b384-6\">. Several rationales have been offered over time to justify the doctrine, including the idea the crown can do no wrong, the impracticality of suing the sovereign, the preservation of public assets, and the government\u2019s need for efficiency and control. <em>See Sovereign Immunity from Statutes of Limitation in Maryland </em>46 Md.
