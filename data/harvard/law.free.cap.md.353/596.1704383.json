We conclude that carjacking is not a specific intent crime, and accordingly, we shall affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">We shall briefly state the facts. On November 26, 1996, Timothy Harris, Jack Tipton and several other Mends were playing cards and drinking alcohol at a Mend\u2019s house. Tipton offered to drive Harris home. Tipton testified that Harris became angry when Tipton refused to go to the District of Columbia, and that Harris forcibly removed Tipton from the car and drove away. Tipton reported the car as stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Appellant was indicted by the Grand Jury for Prince George\u2019s County with the crimes of carjacking in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 348A, unlawful taking of a motor vehicle in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 342A, and second degree assault in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 12A. At trial, Harris\u2019s defense was voluntary intoxication. He testified that he had consumed alcohol and smoked marijuana throughout the evening, and that he \u201cblacked out\u201d after leaving the get-together.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Appellant requested a jury instruction on voluntary intoxication, arguing that he was too intoxicated from drugs and alcohol to form the specific intent required for the offenses of carjacking and unlawful taking of a motor vehicle. The court declined to instruct the jury that carjacking required specific intent. The trial court instructed the jury that when charged with an offense requmng specific intent, a defendant cannot be guilty if he was so intoxicated by drugs and/or alcohol that he was unable to form the necessary intent. The court further instructed the jury that the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle was the only offense that required specific intent. As to the offense of carjacking, the trial court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">An individual is guilty of carjacking when that individual obtains unauthorized possession or control of a motor vehicle from another individual in actual possession by force or violence, or by putting that individual in fear through intimidation or threat of force or violence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">The jury found Harris not guilty of the crime of unauthorized taking of a motor vehicle, and guilty of carjacking and assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Appellant noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. We granted certiorari on our own motion to address the issue of whether specific intent is an element of the crime of carjacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Maryland\u2019s carjacking statute, Art. 27, \u00a7 348A reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">(b) <em>Elements of </em>offense.\u2014(1) An individual commits the offense of carjacking when the individual obtains unauthorized possession or control of a motor vehicle from another individual in actual possession by force or violence, or by putting that individual in fear through intimidation or threat of force or violence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-8\">(c) <em>Penalty\u2014In </em>general.\u2014An individual convicted of carjacking ... is guilty of a felony and shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than 30 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-9\">(d) <em>Same\u2014Additional to other </em>offenses.\u2014The sentence imposed under this section may be imposed separate from and consecutive to a sentence for any other offense arising from the conduct underlying the offenses of carjacking or armed carjacking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-10\">(e) Defenses.\u2014It is not a defense to the offense of carjacking or armed carjacking that the defendant did not intend to permanently deprive the owner of the motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">The State argues that the plain language of \u00a7 348A clearly establishes that carjacking is not a specific intent crime. The State observes that the trial court\u2019s carjacking instruction tracked the language of \u00a7 348A(b)(l). According to the State, the Legislature\u2019s failure to include language which would ordinarily indicate a specific intent requirement refutes Harris\u2019s claim that carjacking requires a specific intent to deprive without regard to duration. Rather, the Legislature clearly intended that the offense is committed without any additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>deliberate and conscious purpose or design to accomplish a specific and more remote result.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Appellant argues that carjacking requires specific intent \u201cwithout regard to the intended duration of the deprivation.\u201d He argues that carjacking is a type of robbery without the need to prove a specific intent to deprive permanently. Alternatively, he argues that carjacking is the equivalent of an unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, preceded by an assault, battery, or an aggravated assault, and as such, requires the State to prove a specific intent to deprive, without regard to the duration of the intended deprivation. In particular, Appellant argues that carjacking is little more than robbery without the need to prove specific intent to <em>permanently </em>deprive, and the equivalent of unauthorized use preceded by an assault, battery, or an aggravated assault. Appellant maintains that the intent requirement of carjacking is like that of unauthorized use\u2014that an intent to deprive <em>temporarily </em>is the specific intent requirement. Noting that the standard for specific intent is \u201cwhether, in addition to the general intent to do the immediate act, it embraces some additional purpose or design to be accomplished beyond that immediate act,\u201d Appellant reasons that \u201c[cjarjacking requires that, through force or violence, or a threat of force or violence (the immediate act), a person obtains unauthorized possession or control of a motor vehicle (the purpose beyond the immediate act).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Generally there are two aspects of every crime\u2014the <em>actus reus </em>or guilty act and the <em>mens rea </em>or the culpable mental state accompanying the forbidden act. <em>Garnett v. State, </em>332 Md. 571, 577-78, 632 A.2d 797, 800 (1993). Maryland continues to observe the distinction between general and specific intent crimes. <em>Shell v. State, </em>307 Md. 46, 65, 512 A.2d 358, 366-67 (1986). The distinction is particularly significant when a defendant claims that his voluntary intoxication prevents him from forming the requisite intent to commit a crime. <em>See id. </em>at 65, 512 A.2d at 367 (noting that the distinction \u201cdoes serve to reconcile fairness to the accused with the need to protect the public from intoxicated offenders and to deter such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>persons\u201d); <em>Wieland v. State, </em>101 Md.App. 1, 35, 643 A.2d 446, 463 (1994) (\u201cIt is a distinction that takes on critical importance most frequently in assessing the effect of voluntary intoxication on a defendant\u2019s capacity to entertain a certain <em>mem rea.\u201d). </em>It has long been the law in Maryland that while voluntary intoxication is a defense to a specific intent crime, it is not a defense to a general intent crime. <em>See Shell, </em>307 Md. at 58, 512 A.2d at 367 (conducting extensive review of Maryland cases addressing asserted defense of voluntary intoxication and specific intent generally).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Specific intent has been defined as not simply the intent to do an. immediate act, but the \u201cadditional deliberate and conscious purpose or design of accomplishing a very specific and more remote result.\u201d <em>Shell, </em>307 Md. at 63, 512 A.2d at 366 (quoting <em>Smith v. State, </em>41 Md.App. 277, 305, 398 A.2d 426, 443 (1979)); <em>see also In re Taka C., </em>331 Md. 80, 84, 626 A.2d 366, 368-69 (1993); <em>Ford v. State, </em>330 Md. 682, 702, 625 A.2d 984, 993 (1993); <em>State v. Gover, </em>267 Md. 602, 606, 298 A.2d 378, 381 (1973). In <em>Shell, </em>we quoted with approval the explanation of specific intent by Judge Moylan, writing for the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Smith v. State, </em>41 Md.App. at 305-06, 398 A.2d at 442-43:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">A specific intent is not simply the intent to do the immediate act but embraces the requirement that the mind be conscious of a more remote purpose or design which shall eventuate from the doing of the immediate act. Though assault implies only the general intent to strike the blow, assault with intent to murder, rob, rape, or maim requires a fully formed and conscious purpose that those further consequences shall flow from the doing of the immediate act. To break and enter requires a mere general intent but to commit burglary requires the additional specific intent of committing a felony after the entry has been made. A trespassory taking requires a mere general intent but larceny (or robbery) requires the specific <em>animus furandi </em>or deliberate purpose of depriving the owner permanently of the stolen goods. <em>This is why even voluntary intoxication may negate a specific intent thou,gh it will not negate a mere general intent.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>The larger class \u2018specific intent\u2019 includes such other members as 1) assault with intent to murder, 2) assault with intent to rape, 3) assault with intent to rob, 4) assault with intent to maim, 5) burglary, 6) larceny, 7) robbery and 8) the specific-intent-to-inflict-grievous-bodily-harm variety of murder.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] Each of these requires not simply the general intent to do the immediate act with no particular, clear or undifferentiated end in mind, but the additional deliberate and conscious purpose or design of accomplishing a very specific and more remote result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">307 Md. at 62-63, 512 A.2d at 366 (emphasis added). Chief Justice Traynor, writing for the Supreme Court of California, explained the difference between specific intent and general intent crimes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">When the definition of a crime consists of only the description of a particular act, without reference to intent to do a further act or achieve a future consequence, we ask whether the defendant intended to do the proscribed act. This intention is deemed to be a general criminal intent. When the definition refers to defendant\u2019s intent to do some further act or achieve some additional consequence, the crime is deemed to be one of specific intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-7\"><em>People v. Hood, </em>1 Cal.3d 444, 82 Cal.Rptr. 618, 462 P.2d 370, 378 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">By way of example, the Court of Special Appeals has held that the common law crime of assault of the intent to frighten variety is a specific intent crime. <em>Wieland, </em>101 Md.App. at 38, 643 A.2d at 464. That crime has been defined as \u201cthe doing of an act that places the victim in apprehension <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>of immediate bodily harm <em>with the intent to cause such apprehension.\u201d Id., </em>643 A.2d at 464. The general intent is the intent to commit the immediate act, i.e., the intent to make the threatening gesture. <em>Id., </em>643 A.2d at 464. An additional requirement is that there be a specific intent for that immediate act to place the victim in fear of imminent bodily harm. <em>Id., </em>643 A.2d at 464. The court noted, by way of contrast, that an assault of the attempted battery type is a general intent crime requiring no specific intent. <em>Id., </em>643 A.2d at 464. Judge Moylan, writing for the court, noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-4\">Accurately employed, the term \u2018specific intent\u2019 designates some specific mental element or intended purpose above and beyond the mental state required for the mere <em>actus reus </em>of the crime itself. Were it not so, every intentional crime would be deemed a specific intent crime and there would no longer even be such a category as that of general intent crimes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 39, 643 A.2d at 464-65. Each crime must be reviewed on an <em>ad hoc </em>basis. <em>Id. </em>at 37-38, 643 A.2d at 464. Distilled to its essence, to determine whether a particular crime requires a necessary specific intent, \u201cwe must inquire whether, in addition to the general intent to do the immediate act, it embraces some additional purpose or design to be accomplished beyond that immediate act.\u201d <em>Id., </em>643 A.2d at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Along these same lines, Judge Orth, writing for the Court in <em>McBurney v. State, </em>280 Md. 21, 29, 371 A.2d 129, 133 (1977), observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">A general <em>mens rea </em>or intent \u2018includes those consequences which (a) represent the very purpose for which an act is done (regardless of likelihood of occurrence), or (b) are known to be substantially certain to result (regardless of desire).\u2019 [R. Perkins, Criminal Law (2 nd. ed.1969) at 747]. In some crimes, however, a specific intent is an essential ingredient. Clark <em>&amp; </em>Marshall, A Treatise on the Law of Crimes (7 th ed.1987) \u00a7 5.06. \u2018A specific intent, when an element of the <em>mens rea </em>of a particular offense, is some intent other than to do the <em>actus reus </em>thereof which is specifically required for guilt.\u2019 [Perkins at 762].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">We have consistently stated that the cardinal rule in statutory construction is to effectuate the Legislature\u2019s broad goal or purpose. <em>Gargliano v. State, </em>334 Md. 428, 435 639 A.2d 675, 678 (1994). The primary source of legislative intent is the text of the statute itself. <em>Rose v. Fox Pool Corp., </em>335 Md. 351, 359, 643 A.2d 906, 909 (1994). To determine if a criminal statute requires specific intent, we look first to the language of the statute. <em>See Richmond v. State, </em>326 Md. 257, 262, 604 A.2d 483, 485 (1992); <em>Shell, </em>307 Md. at 69, 512 A.2d at 370 (stating that particular language and purpose of each statute must be considered). If the language alone does not provide sufficient information as to the Legislature\u2019s intent, we look to other sources to discern the Legislature\u2019s purpose. <em>See Jones v. State, </em>336 Md. 255, 261, 647 A.2d 1204, 1206-07 (1994). In determining legislative intent,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">the key is the purpose of the legislation, determined in the light of the statute\u2019s language and context. \u2018[W]e look at statutory language in context; we consider legislative history when it is available____ Our endeavor always is to construe a statute so as to implement the legislative goal, not to frustrate it.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-8\"><em>Warfield v. State, </em>315 Md. 474, 499, 554 A.2d 1238, 1251 (1989) (alteration in original) (citation omitted) (quoting <em>NCR Corp. v. Comptroller, </em>313 Md. 118, 145-46, 544 A.2d 764, 777 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">Viewing the statute as a whole, the language of the carjacking statute does not evidence an intent on the part of the General Assembly to create a specific intent crime. Words such as \u201cwith intent to\u201d are conspicuously absent from the statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cWhen a statute does not contain any reference to intent, general intent is ordinarily implied.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>49 F.3d 1398, 1401 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>The legislative history as well as the plain language of the statute make clear that the General Assembly intended to create a new criminal offense known as carjacking. <em>See </em>Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, Floor Report for Senate Bill 389, at 1 (1993) (\u201cThis bill creates and defines the crimes of carjacking and armed carjacking.\u201d); <em>cf. Pixley v. United States, </em>692 A.2d 438, 439 (D.C.1997) (carjacking is a new criminal offense). The Legislature created a new offense that does not require any additional deliberate or conscious purpose beyond that of obtaining unauthorized possession or control of a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">We look initially to the plain language of the statute. First, the Legislature clearly and unequivocally provided that any sentence imposed for carjacking may be separate from and consecutive to a sentence for any other offense arising from the conduct underlying the offenses of carjacking or armed carjacking. Art. 27, \u00a7 348A(d). Second, the Legislature clearly focused on specific intent when it explicitly provided that it is not a defense that the defendant did not intend to permanently deprive the owner of the motor vehicle, and failed to substitute an intent requirement. <em>See </em>Art. 27, \u00a7 348A(e). In eliminating the specific intent to permanently deprive, the Legislature could have included a different intent if it chose to do so. All that the statute requires is the intent to do the proscribed act; no further purpose or intent to achieve some additional consequence is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">We turn next to the legislative history. In 1991, a new offense, coined \u201ccarjacking\u201d, was on the rise nationally. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>G. Wing, <em>Putting the Brakes on Carjacking or Accelerating It? The Anti Car Theft Act of 1992, </em>28 U. Rich L.Rev. 385 (1994). In response, Congress passed the Anti Car Theft Act of 1992, and many state legislatures, sparked by the violent death of Dr. Pamela Basu in Howard County, Maryland, followed the federal lead and enacted legislation to address this new twist to car thefts. <em>See infra </em>statutes cited p. 611-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">In response to the Basu carjacking, Senate Bill 339 and House Bill 415 were introduced in the Maryland General Assembly as emergency measures by Governor William Donald Schaefer in January, 1993. As emergency legislation, the Maryland General Assembly enacted Art. 27, \u00a7 348A, chapter 69, Acts of 1993, on April 26, 1993, effective upon enactment. <em>See </em>Bill File for House Bill 415 (1993); Bill File for Senate Bill 339 (1993) (reflecting that emergency legislation was necessary for the immediate preservation of the public health and safety). The intent of the Legislature \u201cwas to proscribe actions which although already crimest[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>], i.e., robbery, were deemed to be of such an aggravated nature as to require specific legislation and punishment.\u201d <em>Price v. State, </em>111 Md. App. 487, 497, 681 A.2d 1206, 1211 (1996). Testifying before the Senate Judicial Proceeding Committee on Senate Bill 339, Steven B. Larsen of the Governor\u2019s Legislative Office said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A03\">While the separate acts that constitute a carjacking technically fall within current chargeable offenses, the existing penalties are wholly inadequate for the gravity of the offense. This legislation provides prosecutors with additional tools needed to place carjackers behind bars, and sends a strong signal to carjackers that the penalties for carjacking are severe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-6\"><em>See </em>Bill File for Senate Bill 339 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">It is clear that the broad aim of the statute was to enhance the penalties applicable to individuals who use force or threat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>of force or intimidation to obtain possession or control of a motor vehicle<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and to make it easier for prosecutors to obtain convictions for carjacking.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> By looking at the statute as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>whole, including the enhanced penalties applicable to carj ackers over and above those penalties for the underlying conduct, as well as the explicit rejection of the specific intent to permanently deprive, it is clear that the Legislature did not intend to require a specific intent to achieve some additional consequence beyond the immediate act of taking the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Finally, we find no support in the nature of carjacking itself to indicate that it is a specific intent crime. Carjacking requires the general intent to commit the act of obtaining unauthorized possession or control of a motor vehicle from another individual in actual possession by force or violence, or by putting that individual in fear through intimidation or threat of force or violence. The temporary deprivation of the property is substantially certain to result, regardless of the desire of the actor. The General Assembly gave no indication that \u201cthe mind [of the perpetrator] be conscious of a more remote purpose or design which shall eventuate from the doing of the immediate act.\u201d <em>Shell, </em>307 Md. at 62, 512 A.2d at 366 (quoting <em>Smith, </em>41 Md.App. at 305, 398 A.2d at 442). We agree with the State that the Legislature\u2019s clear intent was that, without any additional deliberate and conscious purpose or design of accomplishing a very specific and more remote result, the offense is committed. Simply stated, \u201c[t]he mens rea ... is implicit in the intentional doing of the act.\u201d <em>State v. Yanez, </em>716 A.2d 759, 767 (R.I.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">We hold that the intent element of carjacking is satisfied by proof that the defendant possessed the general criminal intent to commit the act, <em>ie., </em>general intent to obtain unauthorized possession or control from a person in actual possession by force, intimidation or threat of force. Thus, the trial court properly refused to instruct the jury on voluntary intoxication as requested by Appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Many of our sister states, as well as the federal government, have enacted carjacking statutes. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C \u00a7 2119, Anti Car Theft Act of 1992; Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 215 (West 1998 Supp.); D.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 22-2903 (1996 <em>&amp; </em>1998 Supp.); Del.

(Michie 1996 &amp; 1998 Supp.). Several states have also determined that statutory carjacking is a general intent crime. For example, in <em>People v. Davenport, </em>230 Mich.App. 577, 583 N.W.2d 919 (1998), the Court of Appeals of Michigan considered whether the trial court erred in refusing to give a specific intent instruction where the defendant was charged with carjacking in violation of Michigan Compiled Laws \u00a7 750.529a.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court held that the statute required only a general intent or <em>mens rea </em>and not a specific intent. <em>Id. </em>583 N.W.2d at 920. Following a review of the legislative history, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\">[I]t seems clear that the Legislature purposely omitted any element of specific intent in the crime of carjacking in order to make it simpler to convict offenders. Reading a specific intent element into the statute would negate that objective.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-8\">A person who by force or violence, or by threat of force or violence, or by putting in fear robs, steals, or takes a motor vehicle as defined in [M.C.L. \u00a7 750.412; M.S.A. \u00a7 28.644] from another person, in the presence of that person or the presence of a passenger or in the presence of any other person in lawful possession of the motor vehicle, is guilty of carjacking, a felony punishable by imprisonment of life or for any term of years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>The clear language of the carjacking statute indicates that no intent is required beyond the intent to do the act itself, that is, using force, threats, or putting in fear in order to take a vehicle from a person in lawful possession and in that person\u2019s presence.

The statute was amended, and the present version, incorporating the 1994 amendments, requires the \u201cintent to cause death or serious bodily harm.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The intent phrase was substituted for the \u201cpossessing a firearm\u201d language. <em>See </em>Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, \u00a7 60003(a)(14), Pub.L.

His argument that carjacking is simply another type of robbery or unauthorized use of vehicle lacks merit. Carjacking is not a necessarily included offense of robbery, or vice versa. Maryland applies an \u201celements test\u201d to determine whether one offense is a lesser included offense of another\u2014this test asks whether all of the elements of the lesser offense must be included in the greater offense. <em>See State v. Bowers, </em>349 Md. 710, 722, 709 A.2d 1255, 1260 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">The elements of carjacking differ from the elements of robbery and each offense can be committed without committing the other offense. Robbery is the felonious taking and carrying away of personal property from the person of another, accomplished by force or fear. <em>State v. Gover, </em>267 Md. 602, 606, 298 A.2d 378, 380-81 (1973). Robbery requires asportation of the property. <em>Ball v. State, </em>347 Md. 156, 184, 699 A.2d 1170, 1183 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 118 S.Ct. 866, 139 L.Ed.2d 763 (1998). Although reference to the intent requirement begs the question before the Court, we note that robbery is a specific intent crime, and that the specific intent required is the intent to permanently deprive the person of the property. <em>Gover, </em>267 Md. at 606, 298 A.2d at 381. Carjacking requires that (1) the defendant obtain unauthorized possession or control of a motor vehicle; (2) that the motor vehicle was in the actual possession of another person at that time; and (3) that the defendant used force or violence against that person, or put that person in fear through intimidation or threat of force or violence, in order to obtain the motor vehicle. Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction MPJI 4:28A: Carjacking. An essential element of carjacking, unlike robbery, is the taking of a specific type of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>property, <em>ie. </em>a motor vehicle. Unlike robbery, the carjacking statute requires no movement or asportation, only unauthorized possession or control.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Simply put, robbery can be accomplished without committing carjacking, and carjacking can be accomplished without committing robbery. <em>Cf. People v. Parker, </em>230 Mich.App. 337, 584 N.W.2d 336, 340 (1998); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number><em>Pixley v. United States, </em>692 A.2d 438, 440 (D.C.1997); <em>People v. Green, </em>58 Cal.Rptr.2d 259, 263, 50 Cal.App.4th 1076, 1084 (Cal.Ct.App.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">We also reject Appellant\u2019s argument that carjacking is the equivalent of an unauthorized use preceded by an assault, battery, or an aggravated assault. Art. 27, \u00a7 349. Unauthorized use of vehicle, like robbery, requires that the vehicle be taken and carried away. <em>See Shope v. State, </em>18 Md.App. 472, 476, 307 A.2d 730, 733 (1973). Actual movement of the vehicle, however slight, is required. Otherwise said, asportation is required. As we have pointed out, not so for carjacking. Carjacking also requires force, violence, intimidation, or threat of force or violence. Hence, each offense can be accomplished without committing the other offense.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Allen v. United States, </em>697 A.2d 1, 2 (D.C.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">In sum, there is nothing in the language of the statute, the legislative history, or the nature of the crime itself to suggest that the Legislature intended to make carjacking a specific intent crime. Because carjacking is not a specific intent crime, voluntary intoxication is not a defense. The trial court properly refused to give an instruction that voluntary intoxication may negate the intent element of carjacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY AFFIRMED.

The General Assembly has created specific intent crimes, using explicit language to indicate the required specific intent. It is evident that when the Legislature desires to create a specific intent crime, it knows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>how to do so. <em>See, e.g., </em>Burglary in first degree, Art. 27, \u00a7 29(a) (A person may not break and enter the dwelling of another with the intent to commit theft or a crime of violence); Burglary in second degree, Art. 27, \u00a7 30(a)- (A person may not break and enter the storehouse of another with the intent to commit theft, a crime of violence, or arson in the second degree); Burglary in third degree, Art. 27, \u00a7 31 (A person may not break and enter the dwelling of another with the intent to commit any crime). These offenses are specific intent crimes. <em>Cf. Warfield v.

Other states have likewise concluded that their legislatures intended to make it easier, not more difficult, to obtain convictions for carjacking. In <em>People v. Davenport, </em>230 Mich.App. 577, 583 N.W.2d 919, 921 (1998), the Court of Appeals of Michigan concluded, based on the legislative history of the Michigan carjacking statute, that, unlike with robbery or assault offenses, \u201cthe Legislature did not intend that carjacking prosecutions include the burden of proving specific intent.\" In particular, the court relied on the Senate Fiscal Agency Bill Analysis, SB 773, February 17, 1994, which read in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">The bill would make it easier for prosecutors to try carjackers and to show that an offender committed a felony. Robbery and assault offenses typically include elements of intent that can make it difficult to prosecute individuals on those charges. As a result, many of those initially charged with armed assault or robbery enter into plea bargain agreements and, consequently, are punished for less serious offenses.... Carjacking charges would more likely be tried on their merits rather than plea bargained, because the elements of the proposed offense would be easier to prove than those of robbery or assault.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">The Court of Appeal, Fifth District, in California concluded that the California legislature created a new crime of carjacking, and not just a form of robbery. <em>People v. Medina, </em>39 Cal.App.4th 643, 647-48, 46 Cal.Rptr.2d 112, 113-14 (1995). The court recounted the reason for the creation of the new crime as explained in the legislative history:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-10\">[T]here has been considerable increase in the number of persons who have been abducted, many have been subjected to the violent taking of their automobile and some have had a gun used in the taking of the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-11\">This relatively 'new' crime appears to be as much thrill-seeking as theft of a car. If all the thief wanted was the car, it would be simpler to hot-wire the automobile without running the risk of confronting the driver. People have been killed, seriously injured, and placed in great fear, and this calls for a strong message to discourage these crimes. Additionally, law enforcement is reporting this new crime is becoming the initiating rite for aspiring gang members and the incidents are drastically increasing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-12\">Under current law there is no carjacking crime per se and many carjackings cannot be charged as robbery because it is difficult to prove the intent required of a robbery offense (to permanently deprive one of the car) since [many] of these gang carjackings are thrill seeking thefts. There is a need to prosecute this crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number><em>Id., </em>46 Cal.Rptr.2d at 113-14 (quoting Assem.

As support for finding a specific intent requirement, the dissent reads an asportation aspect into the statute where none exists. Dissenting op. at 624. In the dissent's view:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">It is inconceivable that, having gone so far as to accost the victim for the purpose of taking his or her car and having to take control of it to complete the crime or realize the goal, a defendant would not, or even that a legislature would contemplate the possibility that he or she would not, move the car. Moreover, why would anyone who had even a general intent to take a car, order a person out of the car and then not move it? The absurdity of this example supports a <em>common </em>sense reading of the carjacking statute as creating a specific intent offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Contrary to the dissent's assertions, it is not absurd to believe that the Legislature intended that the perpetrator need not actually move the car to be guilty of carjacking. Although it may be slight, asportation is a required element of other offenses. <em>See </em>Art. 27 \u00a7 337 (kidnapping); <em>Beard v. State, </em>42 Md.App. 276, 281 n. 1, 399 A.2d 1383, 1386 n. 1 (1979) (robbery). Without some movement, these offenses simply are not committed. <em>See Beard, </em>42 Md.App. at 281 n. 1, 399 A.2d at 1386 n. 1. This is not true of carjacking. Asportation is not a required element under the carjacking statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">It is not \"inconceivable,\" as the dissent suggests, that a legislature would contemplate <em>the </em>possibility that the perpetrator would not move the car. The Legislature consciously chose to use the language \"obtains unauthorized possession or control\u201d instead of language that would have added an asportation element to the statute. Omitting an asportation requirement does expand the scope of criminal conduct encompassed by the carjacking statute. Several examples illustrate this point. Take, for example, a perpetrator who approaches an open driver\u2019s window, displays a knife, grabs a driver, and orders him out of the car. As the driver leaves the vehicle, he hits an ignition \"kill'' switch hidden under the dash with his knee, and the perpetrator is unable to move the motor vehicle. One can readily imagine other scenarios involving anti-theft devices, or cases where the perpetrator has difficulty operating the vehicle. Another scenario that might arise is where a perpetrator ejects a person by force and gains control over the car, but the victim, or bystanders who witnessed the events, intercede and prevent the person from driving away. The dissent\u2019s criticism that the perpetrator would not <em>choose </em>to move the car after gaining control over it fails to take into account those circumstances where an asportation requirement, or lack thereof, could be the dispositive factor in conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b668-7\">.

Maryland Code (1957, 1996 RepLVoL, 1997 Cum.Supp.) Art. 27 \u00a7 348A (c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This is a greater penalty than that of the already existing similar offenses\u2014theft, robbery and armed robbery.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, the statute made carjacking an aggravating circumstance for the purpose of the death penalty sentencing procedure. \u00a7 413(d)(10).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Further, the statutes classifying \u201ccrimes of violence,\u201d <em>see </em>\u00a7 441(e)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>\u00a7 643(B)(a)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 1997 Cum.Supp.) Art. 41 \u00a7 4-501(12)(XII),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> were amended to include carjacking and armed carjacking.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>\"The term \u2018crime of violence\u2019 means abduction; ar son; burglary; including common-law and all statutory and storehouse forms of burglary offenses; escape; housebreaking; kidnapping; manslaugh<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>ter; excepting involuntary manslaughter; mayhem; murder; rape; robbery; robbery with a deadly weapon; carjacking or armed carjacking; sexual offense in the first degree; and sodomy; or an attempt to commit any of the aforesaid offenses; or assault with intent to commit any other offense punishable for imprisonment for more than one year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">To be sure, the General Assembly did address, to some extent, the intent element of carjacking; by providing that proof of an intent permanently to deprive the owner of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>vehicle is not a defense to carjacking, \u00a7 848A (e), the Legislature did not define carjacking to be the identical offense as robbery or theft. That is the only indication of the Legislature\u2019s awareness of the intent issue. As we have seen, by contrast, the Legislature spent a considerable amount of time debating the proper penalty and collateral impact of enacting a carjacking statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">But negating the intent permanently to deprive as a defense does not equate to eliminating altogether the requirement to prove the specific intent to deprive the owner temporarily of the vehicle. In point of fact, the opposite would appear to be the case\u2014by specifying the specific intent that is not a defense, the Legislature inferentially recognized that another, lesser specific intent may be a defense. The fact that the Legislature specifically noted that the State was not required to prove intent to deprive <em>permanently </em>implies that some proof of intent to deprive, even if the intended deprivation is temporary, is necessary. Had the Legislature intended to relieve the State of the burden of proving intent to deprive for any period of time, it could have, and I submit would have, refrained from using the qualifying word, \u201cpermanently,\u201d in subsection (e). To interpret the statute, on that basis, as not requiring proof of any specific intent to deprive, would render the word \u201cpermanently\u201d superfluous. It is well settled that, \u201cabsent a clear intent to the contrary, a statute is to be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory.\u201d <em>Montgomery County v. Buckman, </em>333 Md. 516, 523-24, 636 A.2d 448, 452 (1994). <em>See Hyle v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>348 Md. 143, 149, 702 A.2d 760, 763 (1997); <em>Blondell v. Baltimore Police, </em>341 Md. 680, 691, 672 A.2d 639, 645 (1996); <em>Warsame v. State, </em>338 Md. 513, 519, 659 A.2d 1271, 1273 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">In any event, subsection (e) is at best ambiguous; it certainly is not clear and unambiguous. When dealing with a criminal statute that is ambiguous, the Rule of Lenity applies, entitling the defendant to the benefit of the ambiguity. <em>See Gardner v. State, </em>344 Md. 642, 651, 689 A.2d 610, 614 (1997), in which this Court stated: \u201cLenity expressly prohibits a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>from interpreting a criminal statute to increase the penalty it places on a defendant \u201cwhen such an interpretation can be based on no more than a guess as to what [the Legislature] intended,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Monoker v. State, </em>321 Md. 214, 222, 582 A.2d 525, 529 (1990), which in turn quotes <em>Ladner v. United States, </em>358 U.S. 169, 178, 79 S.Ct. 209, 214, 3 L.Ed.2d 199, 205 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The majority cites a number of federal cases interpreting the federal carjacking statute, as originally enacted in 1992<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>, to support its conclusion that the Maryland statute prescribes a general intent crime. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Payne, </em>83 F.3d 346, 347 (10th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>49 F.3d 1398, 1401 (9 th Cir.1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 1065, 116 S.Ct. 749, 133 L.Ed.2d 696 (1996); <em>United States v. Oliver, </em>60 F.3d 547, 551 (9th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>25 F.3d 1275, 1279-80 (5th Cir.1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 978, 115 S.Ct. 458, 130 L.Ed.2d 366 (1994). These cases, as I will explain, actually support my position.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\"><em>Martinez </em>provides insight into why the courts interpreted the federal carjacking statute as a general intent crime. There, the 9th Circuit pointed out that the structure, language, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>and legislative history of the carjacking statute indicated that the offense of carjacking was analogous to robbery. <em>See Martinez, </em>49 F.3d at 1401. It referenced H.R.Rep. No. 102\u2014 851(1), 102 nd Cong., 2d Sess. 13-17, <em>reprinted in </em>1992 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2829, 2833, a House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Report which stated that \u201cthe definition of [carjacking] tracks the language used in other federal robbery statutes.\u201d The court then stated, \u201c[w]e see no reason to distinguish between the bank robbery and carjacking statutes with respect to intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is significant that Federal bank robbery is a general intent offense. <em>See United States v. Darby, </em>857 F.2d 623, 626 (9th Cir.1988) (citing <em>United States v. Hartfield, </em>513 F.2d 254 (9 th Cir.1975)). The court reasoned that since robbery, under federal law, is a general intent offense, it follows that carjacking should be as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">In Maryland, robbery is a common law offense, <em>Jupiter v. State, </em>328 Md. 635, 643, 616 A.2d 412, 416 (1992); <em>West v. State, </em>312 Md. 197, 202, 539 A.2d 231, 233 (1988), requiring proof of a specific intent to steal. <em>Jupiter, </em>328 Md. at 639, 616 A.2d at 414. If that rationale were applied in the instant case, it would follow that, since robbery under Maryland law is a specific intent offense and the carjacking statute negates only the intent permanently to deprive, carjacking requires proof of specific intent as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Also cited by the majority in support of its position is a recent Michigan Court of Appeals decision, <em>People v. Davenport, </em>230 Mich.App. 577, 583 N.W.2d 919 (1998). In that case, the court construed the Michigan carjacking statute as requiring proof of only general intent.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In stark contrast to the legislative history of Maryland\u2019s carjacking statute, the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>tive history of the Michigan carjacking statute confirms that construction. A review of that legislative history reveals that the Michigan Legislature intended, by enactment of the carjacking statute, to make it easier for a prosecutor to obtain a carjacking conviction; the bill analysis leaves no doubt that the Legislature, by passing that act, intended to lower the State\u2019s burden of proof.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, it had an entirely different intent than did the Maryland Legislature. The Michigan Court of Appeals concluded, \u201cit seems clear that the Legislature purposely omitted any element of specific intent in the crime of carjacking in order to make it simpler to. convict offenders. Reading a specific intent element into the statute would negate that objective.\u201d 230 Mich.App. 577, 583 N.W.2d 919, 921.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number><em>\u201cA </em>person who by force or violence, or by threat of force or violence, or by putting in fear robs, steals, or takes a motor vehicle!] from another person, in the presence of that person or the presence of a passenger or in the presence of any oilier person in lawful possession of the motor vehicle, is guilty of carjacking, a felony punishable by imprisonment of life or for any term of years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Neither is the majority\u2019s reliance upon <em>Pixley v. United States, </em>692 A.2d 438 (D.C.App.1997) persuasive. <em>Pixley </em>is easily distinguishable from the instant case because the language of the District of Columbia carjacking statute explicitly and specifically contains an intent requirement.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As the District of Columbia Court of Appeals pointed out, \u201ccarjacking requires only that the taking be performed \u2018recklessly\u2019[therefore][a]n utterly heedless [perhaps alcohol induced] mistaken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>belief in ownership accompanying a forcible demand for possession would thus satisfy the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 440. Unlike the instant case, the statute, in <em>Pixley, </em>is not ambiguous.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">When looking at the carjacking statute\u2019s intent and penalty element, together with those crimes related to carjacking, the majority\u2019s interpretation of the intent requirement produces an anomalous result. Unauthorized use of an automobile is a specific intent offense. Under the statute, in order to be convicted of unauthorized use of an automobile, the State is required to prove that the car was taken with the specific intent to deprive the owner of the automobile, although not permanently. <em>See In Re Lakeysha P. </em>106 Md.App. 401, 425, 665 A.2d 264, 275 (1995), <em>cert. granted, </em>341 Md. 522, 671 A.2d 500, <em>dismissed as improvidently granted, </em>343 Md. 627, 684 A.2d 5 (1996).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Unauthorized use carries a minimum penalty of six months and a maximum penalty of four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Theft, as defined in Art. 27, \u00a7 342, may be committed in several different ways. <em>See Cicoria v. State, </em>332 Md. 21, 30, 629 A.2d 742, 746 (1993)(\u201cThe theft statute prescribes five ways in which the crime of theft can be committed.\u201d) However it is committed, it is a specific intent crime. \u00a7 341; <em>See Jones v. State, </em>303 Md. 323, 493 A.2d 1062 (1985); <em>Brown v. State, </em>236 Md. 505, 204 A.2d 532 (1964); <em>Fletcher v. State, </em>231 Md. 190, 189 A.2d 641 (1963); <em>Putinski v. State, </em>223 Md. 1, 161 A.2d 117 (1960). A person convicted of theft where the value of the goods or services is under $300.00, may be imprisoned for up to 18 months, \u00a7 342(f)(2), while if the conviction is for felony theft, where the value of the property or services is greater than $300, he or she may be imprisoned for up to 15 years. \u00a7 342(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The crime of theft, coupled with the use of violence or intimidation, creates the offense of robbery. Once again, for conviction, the State is required to prove that the defendant had a specific intent, the intent to steal. <em>State v. Gover, </em>267 Md. 602, 606, 298 A.2d 378, 381 (1973). A person convicted of robbery may be sentenced to imprisonment for up to fifteen years. \u00a7 486. A person convicted of armed robbery may be sentenced to imprisonment for up to twenty years. \u00a7 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Carjacking obviously has been deemed by the Legislature to be the most serious of the offenses. Accordingly and logically, it is punishable by up to 30 years. Under the majority\u2019s interpretation, however, the state is required only to prove general intent, withofit the Legislature clearly evidencing its intention that it be so; it is also much easier to prove.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>This statutory scheme evidences that the majority\u2019s decision produces an anomalous result. A defendant prosecuted for unauthorized use, theft, or robbery faces a less severe punishment than a defendant charged with carjacking and, in those cases, the State must prove, in addition to the act itself, the intent with which the defendant acted, <em>i.e. </em>to deprive the owner of the property either temporarily or permanently. The result of the majority\u2019s decision is to require the prosecutor to prove less even though the potential punishment and other consequences are greater, when there is no clear intent expressed by the Legislature that it desired that result. This result is fundamentally unfair, defies logic and common sense, and is violative of the Rule of Lenity. Since we have adopted the principle that \u201cunreasonableness of the result produced by one among alternative possible interpretations of the statute is reason for rejecting that interpretation in favor of another which would produce a reasonable result,\u201d <em>D&amp;Y, Inc. v. Winston, </em>320 Md. 534, 538, 578 A.2d 1177, 1179-80, (quoting 2 A <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction, </em>\u00a7 45.12 (4th Ed.1984)), carjacking should be interpreted as requiring proof of the specific intent, at least temporarily, to deprive the owner of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Judges ELDRIDGE and CHASONOW share the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b669-11\">.

It is inconceivable that, having gone so far as to accost the victim for the purpose of taking his or her car and having to take control of it to complete the crime or realize the goal, a defendant would not, or even that a legislature would contemplate the possibility that he or she would not, move the car. Moreover, why would anyone who had even a general intent to take a car, order a person out of the car and then not move it? The absurdity of this example supports a common sense reading of the carjacking statute as creating a specific intent offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b677-7\">. There is no requirement that the state prove the exact duration of the intended deprivation. As Judge Moylan, speaking for the Court of Special Appeals put it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-8\">\"It follows that, when the Legislature enacted the Unauthorized Use law, it simply eliminated the <em>animus furandi </em>of larceny so that it could handle not only one but a number of circumstances in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>the mens rea of the culprit might somehow be in question: 1) the situation in which it is clearly established that the intended deprivation was only temporary, <em>2) </em>the situation in which the intended deprivation was probably permanent but where there is a failure to carry the burden of persuasion in that regard, 3) the situation in which the fact finder is actually persuaded that the intended deprivation was still of uncertain and undetermined duration in the mind of the culprit, and 4) the situation in which there was simply no evidence at all bearing on the duration of the intended deprivation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Alk\"><em>In Re Lakeysha P., </em>106 Md.App. 401, 425, 665 A.2d 264, 275 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b678-8\">. I am, of course, aware that the proof of the offense of carjacking and the related offenses will be circumstantial, consisting of proving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>circumstances rather than the offer of direct evidence of how long the defendant intended to keep the car. The difference is more than semantics, however. If the State\u2019s burden is to prove a specific intent, the defendant would be entitled to a jury instruction to that effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
