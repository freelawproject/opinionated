We shall hold that manslaughter by automobile is not such a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">The relevant facts and procedural history of this case, gleaned primarily from the parties\u2019 stipulation in the habeas corpus proceeding which gave rise to Petitioner\u2019s appeal, are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b140-12\">Respondent was convicted of manslaughter by automobile pursuant to Maryland Code (1957,1996 Repl.Vol., 1998 Suppl.) Article 27, \u00a7 388.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In September, 1995, the Circuit Court for Frederick County sentenced Respondent to a term of incarceration of ten years, seven years suspended. Prior to March, 1997, the Division of Correction (D.O.C.) had considered \u00a7 388 offenses to be <em>excluded </em>from the list of offenses enumerated as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in \u00a7 643B(a) and cross-referenced under \u00a7 700(d)(2), dealing with \u201cGood Conduct Deductions\u201d for prison inmates. In accordance with this interpretation, upon Respondent\u2019s entry into prison in September, 1995, the D.O.C. awarded him ten \u201cgood conduct credits\u201d per month as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>prescribed by \u00a7 700(d)(3). This calculation established April 3,1997 as Respondent\u2019s \u201cmandatory supervision\u201d release date, pursuant to Maryland Code (1957, 1997 Repl.VoL, 1998 Supp.) Article 41, \u00a7\u00a7 4-501(13) and 4-612, provided he comply with the requirements of the good conduct award. There is no dispute that Respondent maintained himself accordingly; he did nothing during the course of his incarceration to warrant removal or deduction of his good conduct credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">In March, 1997 the D.O.C. reconsidered its interpretation of \u00a7 643B(a), and from that time forward has classified \u00a7 388 offenses as <em>included, </em>within the definition of \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d thus calculating the good conduct credits for \u00a7 388 offenders at the rate of only five days per month of incarceration, pursuant to \u00a7 700(d)(2). Consequently, the D.O.C. recalculated Respondent\u2019s good conduct award and established his mandatory supervision release date as September, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Respondent filed a petition for habeas corpus, challenging the D.O.C.\u2019s re-interpretation of \u00a7 643B(a) as it applied to the crime of manslaughter by automobile under \u00a7 388, and as it affected the calculation of his good conduct credits under \u00a7 700(d). The Circuit Court for Washington County determined after a hearing that manslaughter by automobile is not included as a crime of violence under the list of \u00a7 643B(a) offenses and, consequently, that good conduct credits were to be awarded Respondent at the rate of ten days per month in accordance with \u00a7 700(d)(3). The circuit court further ordered, on April 18, 1997, that Respondent \u201cbe released under mandatory supervision forthwith.\u201d The State filed a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals which affirmed the circuit court in a reported opinion. <em>See Sacchet v. Blan, </em>120 Md.App. 154, 706 A.2d 620 (1998). The State thereafter filed a timely petition for writ of certiorari which we granted in order to address the important issue presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Manslaughter by automobile is a statutory offense in Maryland. The statute currently reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>\u00a7 388. Manslaughter by automobile, vessel, etc____</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-4\">Every person causing the death of another as the result of the driving, operation or control of an automobile, motor vehicle, locomotive, engine, car, streetcar, train, vessel, or other vehicle in a grossly negligent manner, shall be guilty of a felony to be known as \u201cmanslaughter by automobile, motor vehicle, locomotive, engine, car, streetcar, train, vessel, or other vehicle,\u201d and the person so convicted shall be sentenced to jail or the house of correction for not more than 10 years, or be fined not more than $5,000 or be both fined and imprisoned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">When the General Assembly originally enacted this legislation in 1941,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a violation of the statute constituted a misdemeanor offense and carried a maximum term of imprisonment of three years. Several amendments followed. In 1982, the Legislature increased the maximum term of imprisonment to five years, <em>see </em>Laws of Maryland, 1982, Ch. 92, and then again, in 1989, to ten years, <em>see </em>Laws of Maryland, 1989, Ch. 515. In 1997, violation of \u00a7 388 was reclassified as a felony. \u25a0 <em>See </em>Laws of Maryland, 1997, Chs. 372, 373. Importantly, none of these changes had occurred prior to 1975, the year of \u00a7 643B\u2019s enactment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Manslaughter by automobile had thus comprised a criminal offense under Maryland\u2019s statutory law for thirty-four years when the General Assembly designated certain offenses as \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d under \u00a7 643B(a). That statute provides, in its current form and in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\u00a7 643B. Mandatory sentences for crimes of violence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>(a) <em>Crime of violence defined </em>... \u2014As used in this section, the term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d means abduction; arson in the first degree; kidnapping; <em>manslaughter, except involuntary manslaughter; </em>mayhem and maiming, as previously proscribed under \u00a7\u00a7 384, 385, and 386 of this article; murder; rape; robbery; robbery with a deadly weapon; carjacking or armed carjacking; sexual offense in the first degree; sexual offense in the second degree; use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or other crime of violence; an attempt to commit any of the aforesaid offenses; assault in the first degree; and assault with intent to murder, assault with intent to rape, assault with intent to rob, assault with intent to commit a sexual offense in the first degree, and assault with intent to commit a sexual offense in the second degree, as these crimes were previously proscribed under former \u00a7 12 of this article. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The calculation rate for the number of good conduct credits an inmate is to receive during the period of incarceration for a particular crime depends upon whether the crime is included within \u00a7 643B(a)\u2019s definition of \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d The bifurcated classification system, established by the General Assembly in 1992, provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\u00a7 700. Diminution of term of confinement of prisoner.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">(d) <em>Good conduct </em>deduction.\u2014(1) An inmate shall be allowed a deduction in advance from the inmate\u2019s term of confinement, subject to the inmate\u2019s future good conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">(2) For an inmate whose term of confinement includes a consecutive or concurrent sentence for either a crime of violence as defined in Article 27, \u00a7 643B of the Code or a crime of manufacturing, distributing, dispensing, or possessing a controlled dangerous substance as provided under Article 27, \u00a7 286 of the Code, this deduction shall be calculated at the rate of 5 days for each calendar month, and on a prorated basis for any portion of a calendar month, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>from the first day of commitment to the custody of the Commissioner through the last day of the inmate\u2019s maximum term of confinement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">(3) For all other inmates, this deduction shall be calculated at the rate of 10 days for each calendar month, and on a prorated basis for any portion of a calendar month, from the first day of commitment to the custody of the Commissioner through the last day of the inmate\u2019s maximum term of confinement.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The issue we are called upon to resolve in this case is whether \u201cmanslaughter by automobile\u201d in \u00a7 388 is included within the \u201ccrime of violence\u201d of \u201cmanslaughter\u201d in \u00a7 643B(a). Our answer in turn will determine the rate of good conduct credits under \u00a7 700 that should apply to an inmate convicted of an offense in violation of \u00a7 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">As this Court has often declared, the cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the true legislative intent that lies behind the statutory enactment itself. <em>See, e.g., Catonsville Nursing v. Loveman, </em>349 Md. 560, 570, 709 A.2d 749, 753 (1998); <em>Jones v. State, </em>311 Md. 398, 405, 535 A.2d 471, 474 (1988). The primary indication of legislative intent is found in the plain language of the statute, with the words given their ordinary and natural meanings. <em>See Whack v. State, </em>338 Md. 665, 672, 659 A.2d 1347, 1350 (1995); <em>Parrison v. State, </em>335 Md. 554, 559, 644 A.2d 537, 539 (1994). Both parties before this Court, and indeed before the circuit court and Court of Special Appeals, have argued that the plain language of the key statutory provision in question, \u00a7 643B(a), favors the opposite interpretation, and outcome, each respectively seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>The State asserts that the clear legislative intent embedded in the phrase \u201cmanslaughter, except involuntary manslaughter\u201d was to include <em>all forms </em>of manslaughter, including \u00a7 388\u2019s manslaughter by automobile, within the enumeration of crimes of violence, except for common law involuntary manslaughter. Had the General Assembly intended to include only common law voluntary manslaughter it would have employed that term alone rather than use the formulation it did. Moreover, if the Legislature had desired to except manslaughter by automobile from the enumerated offenses, it easily could have done so but purposefully chose not to. Respondent retorts that \u201cmanslaughter, except involuntary manslaughter\u201d plainly indicates, instead, that only the two common law varieties of manslaughter were being contemplated by the drafters of \u00a7 643B(a): the phrase simply provides that voluntary manslaughter is included within the list of crimes of violence, involuntary manslaughter excluded. Furthermore, had the General Assembly wanted to include manslaughter by automobile as a crime of violence, it easily could have done so but purposefully elected not to. The plain meaning of \u00a7 643B(a) thus appears plainly different to the two parties at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Respondent similarly propounds that the General Assembly\u2019s failure to modify the manslaughter phrase in \u00a7 643B(a) is proof that manslaughter by automobile is not a crime of violence thereunder. This is so, he argues, because the Legislature has several times revised other phrases within the same subsection in order to add to or clarify the list of crimes of violence. Especially instructive is the 1981 amendment to \u00a7 643B(a) which appended to the common law crime of \u201crobbery\u201d the statutory offense of \u201crobbery with a deadly weapon,\u201d under \u00a7 488. <em>See </em>Laws of Maryland, 1981, Ch. 353. Moreover, the Legislature\u2019s inaction with respect to the manslaughter language is particularly revealing, if \u00a7 388 offenses were originally meant to be included in 1975, in light of the fact that until the D.O.C.\u2019s re-interpretation of \u00a7 643B(a) in 1997, the \u201cprosecutors and the courts ... [and] the Division of Correction\u201d had essentially \u201cthwarted\u201d the intent of the Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>eral Assembly for twenty-two years without any legislative correction. The Court of Special Appeals found this purported decision by the Legislature not to amend the manslaughter language in \u00a7 643B(a) dispositive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\">[Sections 388 and 643B] have been revisited several times by a legislature that meets at least annually, and at no time has the legislature included manslaughter by automobile as a crime of violence.' They could have done so easily but they did not. The only interpretation is that the omission was deliberate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-6\"><em>Sacchet v. Blan, </em>120 Md.App. 154, 157, 706 A.2d 620, 621 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The State might have responded before this Court that the reason for this supposedly purposeful inaction by the General Assembly was the legislators\u2019 contentment, with the \u201cfact\u201d that manslaughter by automobile was already included within the enumerated offenses, which contention of fact the State continues to press. The State\u2019s counter argument is different, however. The State insists that \u201cno conclusion can be drawn from [the] historical application\u201d of \u00a7 643B because it is only since the Legislature\u2019s 1992 bifurcation of the distribution of good conduct credits between crimes of violence and other crimes that the inclusion <em>vel non </em>of \u00a7 388 as a crime of violence has become relevant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>We conclude that the answer to the question before us lies neither in any supposed plain meaning of the phrase \u201cmanslaughter, except involuntary manslaughter\u201d as enacted by the 1975 General Assembly nor in any purported inaction with respect to the same language by the successive Legislatures. Resolution of this case does not require us to rely upon what the Legislature could have done or upon what it has not done. As we have seen, and as is almost always the case, each of these factors is subject to arguably equally plausible interpretations, if all we look to is the single, contested phrase as if in a vacuum. It is for this reason that viewing statutory language in isolation is a method of construction which this Court eschews. <em>See In re Douglas P., </em>333 Md. 387, 393, 635 A.2d 427, 430 (1994); <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 514-15, 525 A.2d 628, 632-33 (1987). Instead, we construe the statute as a whole, <em>Blondell v. Baltimore Police, </em>341 Md. 680, 691, 672 A.2d 639, 645 (1996); examine the language of the statute in the context in which it was adopted, <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Mohler, </em>318 Md. 219, 225, 567 A.2d 929, 932 (1990); and consider the general purpose, aim, or policy behind the statute, <em>C.S. v. P.G. County Social Services, </em>343 Md. 14, 24, 680 A.2d 470, 475 (1996). Applying these principles of statutory interpretation, we conclude that the list of crimes expressly included under \u00a7 643B(a) makes clear that the General Assembly intended not to include manslaughter by automobile as a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">A strong factor in leading us to conclude that manslaughter by automobile is excluded from \u00a7 643B(a) is that, unlike all other included offenses, a conviction under \u00a7 388 does not require proof of any criminal intent on the part of the offender but only a showing of gross negligence. <em>See Connor v. State, </em>225 Md. 543, 558, 171 A.2d 699, 707 (1961)(Section 388 \u201cadopted the common-law standard of gross negligence as the minimum requirement to convict a defendant for an unintentional killing in the course of doing a lawful act in an unlawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>manner____\u201d). <em>See also Faulcon v. State, </em>211 Md. 249, 257, 126 A.2d 858, 862 (1956); <em>Hughes v. State, </em>198 Md. 424, 431, 84 A.2d 419, 422 (1951). Moreover, as Respondent aptly points out, \u201c[t]he only other offense mentioned in \u00a7 643B(a) which does not require intent is involuntary manslaughter,\u201d the singular offense explicitly excluded by the General Assembly from the listed crimes of violence. It would be anomalous for the Legislature to see fit that all enumerated crimes of violence but one, which warrant distinct treatment of the offender by the courts and prisons of this State, incorporate the requirement that the offender have acted intentionally, while at the same time expressly excepting a crime whose conviction necessitates no proof of intent. It has long been the prerogative and practice of this Court to avoid interpretation of a statute that effects an unreasonable or illogical result or one that is inconsistent with common sense. <em>See, e.g., Condon v. State, </em>332 Md. 481, 491-92, 632 A.2d 753, 758 (1993); <em>Curtis v. State, </em>284 Md. 132, 149, 395 A.2d 464, 474 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Further indicative of \u00a7 388\u2019s exclusion from the roster of violent crimes under \u00a7 643B(a) is another untenable legal inconsistency that would result from adopting the opposite interpretation. After setting out the initial list of crimes of violence, in which appears the crime of \u201cmanslaughter, except involuntary manslaughter,\u201d \u00a7 643B(a) stipulates that also included is \u201can attempt to commit any of the aforesaid offenses.\u201d As this Court announced in <em>Cox v. State, </em>311 Md. 326, 534 A.2d 1333 (1988):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">There is an exception ... to the general rule that attempt applies to all offenses. Crimes that do not involve intent to do a criminal act generally fall outside the scope of the crime of attempt. If there is no intent to do a wrongful act, then usually there is no crime of attempt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 331, 534 A.2d at 1335. In addition, we stated, \u201c[S]o long as the crime of attempt is deemed to require an intent-type of mental state, there can be no such thing as an attempt to commit criminal negligence involuntary manslaughter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 332, 534 A.2d at 1336 (quoting 2 W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 6.2, at 27 (1986) (brackets in original)). By the same token, whereas manslaughter by automobile, like involuntary manslaughter, requires only proof of gross negligence and not of criminal intent, it would stand to reason that there does not exist in Maryland the crime of attempt to commit manslaughter by automobile. Were a violation of \u00a7 388 included as a crime of violence within \u00a7 643B(a), the latter statute arguably would recognize a non-offense and accord harsher treatment to those who, impossibly, \u201ccommit\u201d it. We could not countenance such an anomaly.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Another possible interpretation is that the attempt language is simply ineffective as it relates to the allegedly included offense of manslaughter by automobile. We have, however, repeatedly applied the principle of statutory construction that an interpretation of one provision of a statute that negates another should be avoided. <em>See In re Wallace W., </em>333 Md. 186, 192, 634 A.2d 53, 56-57 (1993) (restating the basic rule of statutory construction that no word, clause, sentence or phrase should be rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory.) <em>See also Montgomery County v. Buckman, </em>333 Md. 516, 523-24, 636 A.2d 448, 452 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The earlier penalty provisions and crime classification of \u00a7 388, in effect at the time of the Legislature\u2019s enactment of \u00a7 643B, also demonstrate the legislative intent not to include manslaughter by automobile as a crime of violence. In 1975, manslaughter by automobile was classified as a misdemeanor offense and a conviction under \u00a7 388 allowed for a maximum term of imprisonment of three years. Meanwhile, a conviction of the felony offense of involuntary manslaughter\u2014again, a crime expressly excluded by the General Assembly from the category of crimes of violence\u2014provided for a period of incarceration of up to ten years, in accordance with \u00a7 387. It hardly makes sense that the General Assembly, within the singular phrase \u201cmanslaughter, except involuntary manslaughter,\u201d intended to include manslaughter by automobile within \u00a7 643B(a) so as to treat \u00a7 388 offenders more harshly than involuntary manslaughter offenders by subjecting them to long-term mandatory sentencing for subsequent convictions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>a crime of violence, yet punish those same \u00a7 388 offenders less severely in terms of potential maximum sentences for a \u00a7 388 conviction not subject to repeat offender treatment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The State\u2019s reliance on this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Forbes v. State, </em>324 Md. 335, 597 A.2d 427 (1991) is misplaced. There we held that the conduct of a person who unintentionally causes a death as a result of grossly negligent operation of a motor vehicle cannot be the basis for a conviction of common law involuntary manslaughter, yet such conduct may support a conviction of statutory manslaughter by automobile. <em>See id. </em>at 336, 597 A.2d at 428.. That the two offenses are thus \u201cseparate and distinct crimes,\u201d as the State describes them, does not necessitate that they be treated differently under \u00a7 643B(a) any more than the status of arson and murder as separate and distinct crimes would require that they be treated differently. Indeed, arson and murder are accorded identical treatment under \u00a7 643B(a), as each is expressly included as a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Finally, the State has argued that this Court\u2019s interpretation of the generic term \u201crape\u201d in \u00a7 643B(a) as embracing both common law and statutory varieties of the offense warrants a similar interpretation of the word \u201cmanslaughter.\u201d In <em>Blandon v. State, </em>304 Md. 316, 498 A.2d 1195 (1985), we held that the statutory offense of rape in the second degree is a crime of violence under \u00a7 643B(a) where the General Assembly employed only the term \u201crape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 322, 498 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>1198. The State misapprehends the rationale underlying our decision in that case. The reason second degree rape is a crime of violence under \u00a7 643B(a), despite its not being expressly included, is that it shares \u201cvirtually identical ... elements <em>and potential penalties </em>\u201d with second degree sexual offense, an explicit crime of violence. <em>Id. </em>at 320, 498 A.2d at 1197 (emphasis added). As Respondent argues, to the extent that <em>Bland\u00f3n </em>stands for the proposition that two crimes virtually identical with respect to their elements and potential penalties should be treated equally for purposes of interpreting \u00a7 643B(a), this principle favors treating manslaughter by automobile the same as involuntary manslaughter. Again, the General Assembly has now equated the potential maximum penalty for \u00a7 388 offenses with that allowed for a conviction of voluntary manslaughter or involuntary manslaughter, under \u00a7 387. Yet manslaughter by automobile is certainly more akin to involuntary manslaughter by virtue of the two offenses\u2019 shared prerequisite of gross negligence, than it is to voluntary manslaughter with its requirement of criminal intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Because manslaughter by automobile is not included as a crime of violence under \u00a7 643B(a), the circuit court appropriately granted the petition for writ of habeas corpus and properly ordered that Respondent be awarded good conduct credits at the rate of ten days per month of his confinement in accordance with \u00a7 700(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

Thereafter, it appeared as \u00a7 455 of Article 27 of the 1951 Code. Finally, in 1957, the statute was re-codified as \u00a7 388 of Article 27.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b142-8\">. Section 388 had also been amended prior to 1975, first in 1949, <em>see </em>Laws of Maryland, 1949, Ch. 5, \u00a7 436A, and again in 1972, <em>see </em>Laws of Maryland, 1972, Ch.181, \u00a7 28. These changes, however, do not affect our analysis of the issues presented in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b144-9\">. Prior to October 1, 1992, \u00a7 700 had provided that all inmates be assigned good conduct credits at the rate of five days per month; there was no distinction between \"crimes of violence\u201d and all other crimes. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol.) Article 27, \u00a7 700(d)(l)-(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b146-8\">. According to the State, \"automobile manslaughter historically has not been utilized as a predicate conviction for a repeat offender sentence\u201d under \u00a7 643B(b)-(d). Accepting this assertion to be true, we note that the reason for such practice may not be one of pure prosecutorial discretion but rather the recognition by the prosecutorial arm of the State that manslaughter by automobile is excepted from \u00a7 643B(a) altogether. For, certainly, the State cannot reasonably argue that a \u00a7 388 offense is a crime of violence for one or more purposes, e.g. calculation of good conduct credits, under \u00a7 700(d), and enablement of crime victims to request that a parole hearing be open to the public, under Article 41, \u00a7 4-507(c), but not for another purpose, utilization as a predicate conviction for repeat offender sentencing, under \u00a7 643B(b)-(d). Indeed, as discussed in Part I, <em>supra, </em>the D.O.C. itself had for nearly five years considered \u00a7 388 offenses to be excluded from the \u00a7 643B(a) enumeration of crimes of violence for purposes of applying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>\u00a7 700(d). We presume that the same interpretation was used for purposes of applying Article 41, \u00a7 4-507(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b150-6\">. As originally enacted, \u00a7 643B(b) requires that a person convicted for a fourth time of a crime of violence be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, so long as that person has served three separate terms of confinement on the three previous convictions. The original statute contained only subsections (a) and (b). <em>See </em>Laws of Maryland, 1975, Ch. 253. The Legislature added subsection (c) in 1977, which mandates that a sentence of at least twenty-five years of imprisonment be imposed for a third conviction of a crime of violence, so long as the defendant has served at least one term of confinement as a result of a conviction of a crime of violence. <em>See </em>Laws of Maryland, 1977, Ch. 678, \u00a7 1. Current subsection (d), added in 1994, directs that a person convicted of a crime of violence for a second time, after having been incarcerated for the first offense, be confined to prison for not less than ten years. <em>See </em>Laws of Maryland, 1994, Chs. 716, \u00a7 1; 717, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
