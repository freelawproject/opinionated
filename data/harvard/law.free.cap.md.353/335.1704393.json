Vol., 1998 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 13-101 through 13-501 of the Commercial Law Article (CL).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time of the violations of the Act alleged by the Agency, the petitioner, Luskin\u2019s, Inc. (Luskin\u2019s), was a retailer of electronic and household goods and services throughout Maryland, in Virginia, and perhaps elsewhere. In the summer of 1992, Luskin\u2019s advertised and conducted a conditional gift promotional program which the Agency found to be deceptive. Principal among the multiple issues raised by the parties are the standard for determining deceptive advertising, particularly advertising that something is \u201cfree\u201d and the scope of relief that the Agency may order.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">I. The Promotion</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Vacation Ventures, Inc. (WI), a Florida corporation, markets vacation packages. It sells certificates for these packages to retailers who distribute them to consumers as part of sales promotions. The certificates allow consumers to start a process to obtain WTs vacation packages, which are subject to various conditions and qualifications. After investigating the experiences that certain retailers in other areas of the United States had had with WI, Luskin\u2019s purchased 14,600 WI travel certificates for $78,180.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Luskin\u2019s advertised the promotion by newspaper ads and on television. Set forth below is the text of the newspaper ad. The reproduction is not to scale. In brackets behind a line of text is the measured height of the lettering in the actual newspaper ad.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b392-15\">Also set forth in the ad were pictures and descriptions of color televisions, air conditioners, camcorders, a dehumidifier, a cellular telephone, a display pager, a sound system, and computers. In the television advertisements of the promotion the audio portion stated the minimum purchases required for free airfare to the particular destinations, but only a written text, briefly appearing visually on the screen, advised \u201cMinimum hotel stay required. See store for details.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-16\">The Agency found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-17\">\u201c[pjrior to making a purchase at Luskin\u2019s, the consumer knew from the advertisements that: (1) free airfare was contingent upon the purchase of the requisite dollar amount of goods; (2) the airfare was offered through WI which is not affiliated with Luskin\u2019s; (3) applicable taxes applied; and (4) a minimum hotel stay was required.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-18\">The details of how the \u201cfree airfare\u201d could be obtained were set forth in a threefold, color brochure, purchased by Luskin\u2019s from WI. It described the vacation packages, identified the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>hotels, stated the room rates, set forth a page of \u201cterms and conditions,\u201d and included a reservation request form. As found by the Agency,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-4\">\u201c[t]he WI brochure discloses that the consumer is required to pay the following costs: (1) a $15.00 per person nonrefundable processing fee; (2) seven [for Florida] to twelve [for Hawaii] nights hotel accommodations at the non-discounted or \u2018rack\u2019 rate; (3) three meals at $25.00 per person on the \u2018Discovery Cruise\u2019 (if the Bahamas vacation were chosen); (4) airfare between islands at rates set by WI (if the Hawaiian vacation were chosen); (5) air tax; (6) fuel surcharges; (7) airport departure tax; (8) hotel tax; (9) port and service charges; (10) U.S. Government cruise passenger user fee; (11) Bahamian departure tax; and (12) hotel service charge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The brochure further advises that the consumer must state first, second, and third preferences for departure dates for the vacation destination selected, that WI must have forty-five days notice in advance of the first choice departure date, and that the succeeding choices must each be fifteen days apart. No requested vacation date was guaranteed, and all dates were subject to availability. There were also dates when travel was not available at all, including major holidays.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The reservation request form portion of the WI brochure was referred to by the parties as the travel certificate. Each certificate bore a separate, preprinted, inventory control number which presumably identified it as one of the certificates sold to Luskin\u2019s. It was necessary for Luskin\u2019s to countersign and date a certificate when it was delivered to a buyer. Buyers who were interested in pursuing the promotion furnished WI identifying information, three choices of dates, and a \u201cnon-refundable processing fee of $15.00 per person.\u201d If WI confirmed availability of one of the dates, the consumer had to make a down payment, or payment in full, to WI within , ten days, at the risk of additional costs or of loss of monies previously paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>The record does not reflect the total number of travel certificates issued to customers of Luskin\u2019s out of the 14,600 certificates purchased by Luskin\u2019s from WI. Only 128 travel certificates were completed and sent to WI and, of these, only eleven certificates were actually used for one of the vacations described in the WI brochure.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">The Agency found that the brochure, with the included travel certificate, was not furnished by Luskin\u2019s to a buyer until delivery of the goods that had been purchased. The president of Luskin\u2019s testified that a sample of the brochure was available in each of the Luskin\u2019s stores for review by customers. Through the Agency\u2019s own advertising, it located four customer witnesses who testified at the hearing. None of them saw a sample of the WI brochure on display at the stores where they made their purchases. Nor did the salespersons volunteer details to those customer witnesses and, when asked, generally did not explain the promotion beyond the information presented in the Luskin\u2019s advertisements. Luskin\u2019s, however, did prepare a computer printout that listed the principal requirements for utilizing the WI vacation package. This printout was affixed to the sales ticket at the time of purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Thus, it appears that all customers who made purchases from Luskin\u2019s in the minimum required amount as set forth in Luskin\u2019s advertisements received a brochure, including a valid travel certificate, whether those customers were aware of the promotion or not. No customer, however, received the brochure prior to consummating the required minimum purchase. Those customers who took delivery at the point of sale received the brochure at that time, and those customers who had Luskin\u2019s make delivery did not receive the certificate until that delivery was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">II. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">On July 27, 1992, the Agency notified Luskin\u2019s that the free airfare ad violated \u00a7 13-305 of the Act. Section 13\u2014305(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>\u201cA person may not notify any other person by any means, as part of an advertising scheme or plan, that the other person has won a prize, received an award, or has been selected or is eligible to receive anything of value if the other person is required to purchase goods or services, pay any money to participate in, or submit to a sales promotion effort.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">The Agency ordered Luskin\u2019s to discontinue the promotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Luskin\u2019s disagreed that the ad violated the Act, but the Agency advised Luskin\u2019s that if it did not discontinue its current free airfare advertisements, the Agency would bring an enforcement action. Luskin\u2019s discontinued the ad and immediately began to work on a new ad. Luskin\u2019s then presented a proposed second ad to the Agency for its review and approval. The Agency advised Luskin\u2019s that the second ad also would violate \u00a7 13-305.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">On September 11, 1992, Luskin\u2019s filed an action in the Circuit Court for Harford County, seeking a judgment declaring that the second proposed ad complied with the Act. On September 28, 1992, the Agency brought an administrative enforcement action, charging Luskin\u2019s, by having publicized the first ad, with violating the general deceptive trade practice prohibition in \u00a7 13-303 of the Act by engaging in the deceptive trade practices described in \u00a7 13-301(1), (3), and (9) of the Act. The action also reiterated the charge of violating \u00a7 13-305.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Under \u00a7 13-301(1), a \u201c[f]alse, falsely disparaging, or misleading oral or written statement, visual description, or other representation of any kind which has the capacity, tendency, or effect of deceiving or misleading consumers\u201d is a deceptive trade practice. Similarly, a \u201c[fjailure to state a material fact if the failure deceives or tends to deceive\u201d is a deceptive practice under \u00a7 13-301(3). Likewise, \u00a7 13-301(9) proscribes \u201c[d]eception, fraud, false pretense, false premise, misrepresentation, or knowing concealment, suppression, or omission of any material fact with the intent that a consumer rely on the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>in connection with ... [t]he promotion or sale of any consumer goods----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Luskin\u2019s obtained a favorable declaratory judgment from the circuit court as to the second, proposed ad, but that judgment was vacated by the Court of Special Appeals under the primary jurisdiction doctrine, and the action was dismissed. <em>Consumer Protection Div. v. Luskin\u2019s, Inc., </em>100 Md.App. 104, 115, 640 A.2d 217, 222 (1994). We affirmed. <em>Luskin\u2019s Inc. v. Consumer Protection Div., </em>338 Md. 188, 657 A.2d 788 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The enforcement action as to the published, first ad that is now before us was tried before an administrative law judge (ALJ), who concluded in May 1993 that Luskin\u2019s had committed all of the violations that had been charged. In ruling on exceptions the Agency made immaterial modifications to the ALJ\u2019s opinion and issued its decision and final order in September 1993, adopting the ALJ\u2019s proposed opinion, as modified. The Agency ordered the relief and the establishment of a claims administration procedure that are more fully described in Parts VIII and IX, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Luskin\u2019s sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Harford County. In December 1996, the circuit court reversed. That court determined that it owed no deference to the conclusions of the Agency inasmuch as the issues presented \u201ccommon sense kinds of questions\u201d and disagreed with the Agency\u2019s findings on all counts. The circuit court held that Luskin\u2019s had violated neither \u00a7 13-303 nor \u00a7 13-305, that there had been an accord and satisfaction between Luskin\u2019s and the Agency, and that the enforcement action was retaliatory and selective, and, thus, unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">The Court of Special Appeals reversed. <em>Consumer Protection Div. v. Luskin\u2019s, Inc., </em>120 Md.App. 1, 706 A.2d 102 (1998). That court held that a court in a judicial review action did owe deference to the Agency\u2019s findings, that the Agency\u2019s final decision and order were based upon substantial evidence, and that the Agency correctly interpreted the law. Luskin\u2019s petitioned for a writ of certiorari, which we granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>III. The Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">In its petition for certiorari Luskin\u2019s raised eight issues which we rephrase and consolidate as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">1. What is the standard to be applied by the Agency in determining whether a practice is deceptive and how is it to be applied here?</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">2. Does \u00a7 13-301(9) require an intent to misrepresent?</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">3. Does \u00a7 13-305 apply to the \u201cfree airfare\u201d promotion by Luskin\u2019s?</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">4. Was the circuit court obliged to give deference to the Agency\u2019s determinations, particularly its determinations concerning the defenses of accord and satisfaction and of retaliatory enforcement?</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">5. Is the Agency\u2019s cease and desist order overly broad?</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">6. Does the Agency\u2019s restitution order exceed its powers?</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">IY. The Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">In answer to the issue concerning the proper standard to be applied by the Agency, the parties argue over whether an ad is adjudged deceptive by a reasonable person standard or by an \u201cunsophisticated\u201d person standard. The latter standard seemingly is equated by the Agency with acting unreasonably. Luskin\u2019s contends that the reasonable person standard is the one that has been applied by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for at least fifteen years and that, if that standard were properly applied in the instant matter, the free airfare advertisements would not be deceptive. The Agency contends, citing principally <em>Golt v. Phillips, </em>308 Md. 1, 517 A.2d 328 (1986), that Maryland follows the \u201cunsophisticated\u201d consumer test under which the free airfare ads are clearly deceptive, and, alternatively, that the ads also would be deceptive if the reasonable person standard is applied. As we explain below, semantics accounts for a large part of the gulf between the positions of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-13\">The debate between the parties also embraces the degree of materiality of an allegedly deceptive advertisement. Contend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>ing that its position is supported by FTC law, Luskin\u2019s submits that, in order to establish a violation, the Agency must prove that consumers would not have purchased goods from Luskin\u2019s during the period of the free airfare promotion <em>but for </em>that promotion. We address materiality and reliance in Part IV.C, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">The ALJ-based, final decision of the Agency considered there to be two distinct standards for determining deception, but held that the free airfare advertisement was a deceptive practice under both. The final decision in part reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">\u201cThe total impression left with the consumer by both the newspaper and television advertisements is that Luskin\u2019s was offering free airfare for two, conditioned upon the requisite dollar-amount purchase from the store. The disclaimer used in the advertisements does not dispel this impression and was not seen by any of the consumer witnesses. Even had it been seen, its terms reasonably could be expected to lead consumers to erroneous conclusions about the true terms of the offer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">\u201cLuskin\u2019s actually provided consumers with a WI brochure and a redeemable vacation certificate. Luskin\u2019s, in fact, never provided free airfare to the consumer. At the conclusion of the purchase, upon delivery of the goods, the consumer was given a WI brochure that included a redeemable certificate. Redemption required the consumer to expend hundreds to thousands of dollars. While it is true, that the airfare was \u2018free\u2019 upon the payment of these funds and satisfaction of the terms and conditions imposed by WI, that cannot be interpreted by a reasonable consumer as the provision of \u2018free airfare for two.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">\u201cThe consumer could reasonably have believed that airline tickets or vouchers would be provided by Luskin\u2019s. Luskin\u2019s chose bold typeface to notify the consumer in the advertisement that \u2018tickets must be used within one year ask for details.\u2019 In fact, no tickets were provided. Luskin\u2019s focused on free airfare and tickets rather than on the vacation certificate. By doing so, it led the re\u00e1sonable consumer to believe that the airfare primarily was condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>tioned upon the purchase of consumer goods at Luskin\u2019s and that any further condition or requirement would be secondary. However, the purchase of consumer goods is a secondary cost when compared with the cost of redeeming the travel certificate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">\u201cIn sum, under the FTC statements of policy and cases construing the FTC Act, the standard for measuring the overall impression of an advertisement is the total impression left upon the reasonable consumer. It is notable that the Court of Appeals of Maryland still applies a stricter \u2018unsophisticated consumer\u2019 standard in construing the Maryland Consumer Protection Act. Neither standard measures the effect upon the most sophisticated, skeptical consumer. The ordinary consumer, whether \u2018reasonable\u2019 or \u2018unsophisticated\u2019, is not expected to scrutinize, analyze and research an advertisement.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">(Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Thus, we disagree with the Court of Special Appeals when it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">\u201cThe Agency permissibly chose not to apply the more modern FTC standard on deception but instead applied the law as stated by the Court of Appeals in <em>Golt, i.e., </em>by implicitly using a measure less stringent than the reasonable consumer standard, and by not adding a \u2018but for\u2019 materiality element.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-9\"><em>Luskin\u2019s, </em>120 Md.App. at 32-33, 706 A.2d at 117.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">A. The FTC Approach</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">Understanding the debate requires a review of the evolving approach by the FTC to determinations of what is deceptive. In its brief here the Agency has staked out a position under an approach utilized by the FTC in some cases prior to its decision in <em>Cliffdale Associates, Inc., </em>103 F.T.C. 110 (1984). To that decision the FTC appended a copy of a letter dated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>October 14, 1983, to the United States House of Representatives, describing the FTC\u2019s enforcement policy in deception cases (the FTC Policy).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Writing in 1964, one observer of FTC enforcement against false advertising described \u201cthe level of consumer intelligence\u201d selected by the FTC \u201cagainst which it will consider\u201d an advertisement. I.M. Millstein, <em>The Federal Trade Commission and False Advertising, </em>64 Colum. L.Rev. 439, 458 (1964) (Millstein). \u201cIt may be said,\u201d concluded Millstein, \u201cthat the FTC has selected an extremely low intelligence level, and that the courts have not significantly disturbed the [FTC\u2019s] determinations in this respect.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Illustrating Millstein\u2019s conclusion is <em>Gelb v. FTC, </em>144 F.2d 580 (2d Cir.1944). There a divided panel sustained an order prohibiting the manufacturer of Clairol from representing that the product\u2019s effect on coloring hair was permanent. \u201cThere [was] no dispute that [Clairol] imparts a permanent coloration to the hair to which it is applied, but the [FTC] found that it has \u2018no effect upon new hair,\u2019 and hence concluded that the representation as to permanence was misleading.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 582. Referring to <em>Gelb </em>as a \u201cfarfetched conclusion[ ],\u201d a former director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau <em>of </em>Consumer Protection has observed that \u201c[p]ast [FTCs] occasionally have carried to astonishing lengths their mandate to protect the credulous against deception.\u201d R. Pitofsky, <em>Beyond Nader: Consumer Protection and the Regulation of Advertising, </em>90 Harv. L.Rev. 661, 676 n. 58 (1977). <em>See also Charles of the Ritz Distribs. Corp. v. FTC, </em>143 F.2d 676, 679-80 (2d Cir.1944) (prohibiting use of the trademark \u201cRejuvenescence\u201d for a foundation make-up cream because \u201cthe average woman ... might take \u2018rejuvenescence\u2019 to mean that this \u2018is one of the modern miracles\u2019 and is \u2018something which would actually cause her youth to be restored.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting testimony of FTC\u2019s expert).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>The foregoing cases are not entirely representative of the pre-1984 body of false advertising law, even in the Second Circuit. In <em>FTC v. Sterling Drug, Inc., </em>317 F.2d 669 (2d Cir.1963), the court affirmed the refusal by a district court to issue an injunction enforcing an FTC order against the manufacturer of Bayer aspirin. Funded by an FTC grant, an independent medical team had conducted a comparative study of five proprietary analgesic compounds, including Bayer aspirin. The conclusions of the study were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association and were quite favorable to Bayer aspirin. Its advertisement in print media began by stating \u201c \u2018Government-Supported Medical Team Compares Bayer Aspirin and Four Other Popular Pain Relievers.\u2019\u2014\u2018Findings Reported In The Highly Authoritative Journal Of The American Medical Association Reveal____\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 673. The FTC contended that these portions of the ad deceptively implied that Bayer aspirin was endorsed by the federal government and by the American Medical Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The <em>Sterling Drug </em>court restated certain well-established rules. \u201c[Advertising falls within [the FTC Act\u2019s] proscription not only when there is proof of actual deception but also when the representations made have a capacity or tendency to deceive, i.e., when there is a likelihood or fair probability that the reader will be misled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 674. The court further said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">\u201cthe cardinal factor is the probable effect which the advertiser\u2019s handiwork will have upon the eye and mind of the reader. It is therefore necessary in these cases to consider the advertisement in its entirety and not to engage in disputatious dissection. The entire mosaic should be viewed rather than each tile separately.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-7\"><em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>With respect to a reader of the ad, the <em>Sterling Drug </em>court said that \u201c[u]nlike that abiding faith which the law has in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>the \u2018reasonable man,\u2019 it has very little faith indeed in the intellectual acuity of the \u2018ordinary purchaser\u2019 who is the object of the advertising campaign.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Nevertheless, the court held that \u201cour hypothetical, sub-intelligent, less-than-careful reader\u201d would not be led to believe that the Government endorsed the product itself, as opposed to having supported the study. <em>Id. </em>at 675. The court further held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">\u201cTo assert that the ordinary reader would conclude from the use of the word \u2018authoritative\u2019 that the study was endorsed by the Journal and the Association is to attribute to him not only a careless and imperceptive mind but also a propensity for unbounded flights of fancy. This we are not yet prepared to do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">The FTC decision in <em>Heinz W. Kirchner t/a Universe Co., </em>63 F.T.C. 1282 (1963), also forms part of the pre-FTC Policy history. The product involved there, \u201cSwim-Ezy,\u201d was a flat, inflatable rubber bladder connected to a plastic tube. The Swim-Ezy was to be worn under a bathing suit or trunks and inflated after the wearer had entered the water, thus theoretically preventing others from realizing that the wearer could not swim. Advertising referred to the product as an \u201cinvisible\u201d swim aid. On that aspect of the case the FTC found no violation, on the following rationale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-9\">\u201cTo be sure, \u2018Swim-Ezy\u2019 is not invisible or impalpable or dimensionless, and to anyone who so understood the representation, it would be false. It is not likely, however, that many prospective purchasers would take the representation thus in its literal sense. True, as has been reiterated many times, the [FTC\u2019s] responsibility is to prevent deception of the gullible and credulous, as well as the cautious and knowledgeable (see e.g., <em>Charles of the Ritz Dist. Corp. v. F.T.C., </em>143 F.2d 676 (2d Cir.1944)). This principle loses its validity, however, if it is applied uncritically or pushed to an absurd extreme. An advertiser cannot be charged with liability in respect of every conceivable misconception, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>ever outlandish, to which his representations might be subject among the foolish or feebleminded. Some people, because of ignorance or incomprehension, may be misled by even a scrupulously honest claim. Perhaps a few misguided souls believe, for example, that all \u2018Danish pastry\u2019 is made in Denmark. Is it, therefore, an actionable deception to advertise \u2018Danish pastry\u2019 when it is made in this country? Of course not. A representation does not become \u2018false and deceptive\u2019 merely because it will be unreasonably misunderstood by an insignificant and unrepresentative segment of the class of persons to whom the representation is addressed. If, however, advertising is aimed at a specially susceptible group of people (e.g., children), its truthfulness must be measured by the impact it will make on them, not others to whom it is not primarily directed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1289-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\"><em>Heinz W.

Significant to the case before us is that the FTC utilized <em>Cliffdale Associates </em>as the vehicle for applying the Policy to decide an actual case.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The FTC said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">\u201cConsistent with its Policy Statement on Deception, issued on October 14, 1983, the [FTC] will find an act or practice deceptive if, first, there is a representation, omission, or practice that, second, is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances, and third, the representation, omission, or practice is material. These elements articulate the factors actually used in most earlier [FTC] cases identifying whether or not an act or practice was deceptive, even though the language used in those cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>was often couched in such terms as \u2018a tendency and capacity to deceive\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-4\">\u201cThe requirement that an act or practice be \u2018likely to mislead\u2019, for example, reflects the long established principle that the [FTC] need not find <em>actual </em>deception to hold that a violation of Section 5 has occurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 164-65 (footnotes omitted). Further explaining the second element, the FTC said that \u201c[v]irtually all representations, even those that are true, can be misunderstood by some consumers,\u201d <em>id., </em>and that it had \u201clong recognized that the law should not be applied in such a way as to find that honest representations are deceptive simply because they are misunderstood by a few.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The standard for deception applied by the FTC in <em>Clijfdale Associates </em>and succeeding cases is the standard for determining deception now applied by the federal courts. <em>See FTC v.

Section 13-105</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">The parties are also at odds over the effect on the instant matter of \u00a7 13-105. In part it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-9\">\u201cIt is the intent of the General Assembly that in construing the term \u2018unfair or deceptive trade practices\u2019, due consideration and weight be given to the interpretations of \u00a7 5(a)(1) of the [FTC] Act by the [FTC] and the federal courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axi\">The Court of Special Appeals concluded that \u201c[t]he Agency is not required to apply federal law, only to give it due consideration and weight.\u201d <em>Luskin\u2019s, </em>120 Md.App. at 32, 706 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>117. That court concluded that the Agency\u2019s discussion of the FTC standard satisfied the directive of \u00a7 13-105 and that the Agency permissively chose to apply pre-FTC Policy law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">The origins of \u00a7 13-105 trace to Maryland\u2019s first Consumer Protection Act, enacted by Chapter 388 of the Acts of 1967 and codified in Maryland Code (1957, 1969 Repl.Vol.) as Article 83, \u00a7\u00a7 19 through 27. Former Article 83, \u00a7 21 provided \u201cthat nothing herein contained shall apply to any <em>advertisement </em>which is subject to and complies with the rules and regulations of, and the statutes administered by the [FTC].\u201d (Emphasis added). False advertising was also subject to a civil penalty, on action of the Attorney General, by Chapter 337 of the Acts of 1966, codified as Maryland Code (1957,1967 Repl.Vol.), Article 27, \u00a7 195A.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">In 1974 the Consumer Protection Act was considerably enlarged by Chapter 609 of the Acts of that year. For example, Chapter 609 added a list of the types of conduct, such as that now found in \u00a7 13-301, that constituted an unfair or deceptive trade practice. Chapter 609 repealed former Article 83, \u00a7 21 and enacted a new Article 83, \u00a7 20A which provided in relevant part that \u201c[i]t is the intent of the General Assembly that in construing unlawful and deceptive <em>practices </em>as defined in this subheading due consideration and weight shall be given to the interpretation of the [FTC] and. the federal courts relative to\u201d the FTC Act. (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Thus, under former Article 83, \u00a7 21, the Agency, in effect, would be required to apply federal law if the defense of compliance with the FTC Act were asserted to a false advertising claim. When the Maryland Act was expanded in 1974 the scope of the Act\u2019s reference to the FTC was expanded to apply to all allegedly deceptive acts and practices. Further, in lieu of possibly having the Agency interpret and apply the FTC Act in a matter of first impression, the General Assembly announced its intent that the Agency give \u201cdue consideration and weight\u201d to actual interpretations by the FTC and by the federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>With respect to the civil penalty provision for false advertising, former Article 27, \u00a7 195A is now CL \u00a7 11-706. It reads: \u201cIn any action brought under this subtitle, it is a defense that the advertisement ... is subject to and complies with the rules and regulations of and the statutes administered by the [FTC] or any unit of the State government.\u201d Both former Article 27, \u00a7 195A and former Article 83, \u00a7 20A were revised and re-enacted at the same time in the adoption of the Commercial Law Article by Chapter 49 of the Acts of 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Against the foregoing background we hold, for a number of reasons, that the Agency did not comply with \u00a7 13-105 when, at least in the view of the Court of Special Appeals, it rejected the FTC Policy. The legislature\u2019s reference to FTC and federal court interpretations of the federal act contemplates a growing and developing body of law. That legislative intent is disregarded if the Agency essentially freezes the standard for determining a deceptive practice to FTC and federal court interpretations rendered prior to the FTC Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">One purpose underlying \u00a7 13-105 is to achieve a fair comparability between what the FTC and the Agency consider to be unfair or deceptive, absent some clear Maryland policy that dictates a different conclusion. Fair comparability seemingly is most important in the area of advertising. The General Assembly certainly was aware of the fact that Maryland merchants advertise interstate, particularly Maryland merchants in the metropolitan Washington, D.C. area. Maryland merchants who disseminate in the District of Columbia and Northern Virginia ads that are considered lawful by the FTC ordinarily should be permitted to publish the same ad in Maryland without violating the Act. Reinforcing this conclusion is CL \u00a7 11-706 which makes FTC compliance defensive in a penalty action for alleged false advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">More fundamental is the public policy purpose of not granting to the Agency an unbridled discretion to determine what is \u201cunfair\u201d or \u201cdeceptive.\u201d The legislative intent is demonstrated by the prohibited practices enumerated in subsections of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>\u00a7 13-301, some of which are quite specific. The subsections of \u00a7 13-301, however, cannot exhaust the ingenuity of those disposed to deceive or unfairly to treat consumers. Hence the necessity for the general subsections, (1), (3), and (9), that are charged here. When charges by the Agency range beyond the more specific of the \u00a7 13-301 violations, the obvious place to look for precedent is the body of law developed under \u00a7 5 of the FTC Act. It is one way in which to test if the Agency has exceeded its delegated discretion. Thus, \u00a7 13-105\u2019s expression of intent to give \u201cdue consideration and weight\u201d to FTC law is more precatory than hortatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">In Haskell v. <em>Time, Inc., </em>857 F.Supp. 1392 (E.D.Cal.1994), the federal district court for the Eastern District of California determined whether deceptive trade practices under the California Business Practices Act should be judged by an \u201cunwary\u201d consumer test or by a \u201creasonable\u201d consumer test. Allegedly deceptive were statements made in soliciting magazine subscriptions through a promotion that included \u201csweepstakes\u201d entries. <em>Id. </em>at 1399. The California statute was silent on the relevance of the law under the FTC Act. For a number of reasons the court applied the reasonable consumer test. It was the FTC standard, and the California statute was a \u201clittle\u201d FTC Act. The court was further persuaded by the use of the reasonable person standard under the Lanham Act and in actions for securities fraud, deceit and misrepresentation, and common law unfair competition (citing a California state decision). <em>Id. </em>at 1398.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The Agency urges that we reject the FTC Policy by reliance on <em>Golt v. Phillips, </em>308 Md. 1, 517 A.2d 328. <em>Golt </em>was a private action brought under the Act by a tenant against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>landlord of a property in Baltimore City. The tenant had responded to an ad to lease the property but had not been advised that the premises was not licensed as required by a Baltimore City multiple-family-dwelling ordinance. <em>Id. </em>at 9, 517 A.2d at 332. We held this to be a violation of the Act, concluding that lack of proper licensing was a material fact. <em>Id. </em>at 10, 517 A.2d at 332. The Agency here relies on a sentence from <em>Golt </em>reading: \u201cAn omission is considered material if a significant number of unsophisticated consumers would attach importance to the information in determining a choice of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We cited <em>Charles of the Ritz, </em>143 F.2d at 679-80, and <em>Gulf Oil Corp. v. FTC, </em>150 F.2d 106, 109 (5th Cir.1945), with a signal to compare those cases with Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 538 (1977), adopting a reasonable person standard for materiality in common law dec\u00e9it. We then held: \u201cIn our view, the lack of proper licensing for an apartment under most circumstances is a material fact that <em>any </em>tenant would find important in his determination of whether to sign a lease agreement and move into the premises.\u201d <em>Golt, </em>308 Md. at 10, 517 A.2d at 332 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Neither the FTC Policy nor the 1984 FTC decision in <em>Cliffdale Associates </em>was argued to this Court in <em>Golt, </em>and this Court was not asked to make a choice between competing standards. Nor did this Court make a choice. Inasmuch as \u201cany\u201d tenant would have been deceived, the holding in <em>Golt </em>happens to satisfy both standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">More important is the premise underlying the opinions of the Agency and of the Court of Special Appeals to the effect that the \u201creasonable\u201d consumer and the \u201cunsophisticated\u201d consumer are antithetical concepts. The logical conclusion from such a premise is that the standard for measuring a deceptive ad is its impression on an unreasonable consumer. That view is erroneous. A consumer may be both reasonable and unsophisticated. Sophistication relates to the consumer\u2019s expertise in a particular area, not to that person\u2019s reasonableness. In the case of alleged deceptive advertising, the product or service advertised and the target audience of the ad are of critical importance. For example, in <em>Golt </em>the target audience <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>for the advertisement was all persons seeking basic housing in an apartment in Baltimore City. A person who is inexperienced in the rental real estate market in Baltimore City and does not know of the licensing requirements or know where and how to obtain that information is not thereby unreasonable. Indeed, it would seem that even a sophisticated consumer who read the ad in <em>Golt </em>for an apartment in the multiple-family dwelling and who knew of the licensing requirement could reasonably rely on the landlord\u2019s having complied with that law.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">Although not using the reasonable versus unsophisticated terminology, a good illustration of the difference between the unsophisticated, the reasonable, and the sophisticated is found in <em>Standard Oil Co. v. FTC, </em>577 F.2d 653 (9th Cir.1978). The product advertised there was a gasoline additive called \u201cF-310\u201d that was marketed as an anti-pollutant. For example, one television ad utilized a clear balloon that was affixed to the tailpipe of an automobile and the engine started. In the \u201cbefore\u201d depiction, the balloon filled with dark gases while in the \u201cafter\u201d depiction, the balloon inflated but was clear. An FTC examiner found that the ads accurately depicted the product\u2019s performance, but the FTC concluded that there were violations, two of which were that the commercials \u201cfalsely represented (1) that the use of F-310 would result in a complete reduction of air pollutants\u201d and \u201c(3) that the use of F-310 would affect all types of exhaust emissions[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">With respect to the first claimed violation the Ninth Circuit stated that \u201cneither the courts nor the [FTC] should freely speculate that the viewing public will place a patently absurd interpretation on an advertisement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court did \u201cnot think that any television viewer would have a level of credulity so primitive that he could expect to breath fresh air if he stuck his head into a bag inflated by exhaust, no matter how clean it looked.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the terminology which we are using in the instant matter that consumer would be both unsophisticated and unreasonable, and the ad would not be deceptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>The court in <em>Standard Oil, </em>however, sustained the other violation described above. The court noted evidence that only \u201cfourteen percent of motorists [were] aware that most polluting elements in automobile exhaust are invisible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 657-58 (footnote omitted). These motorists would be deceived by the absence of black smoke and particulate matter in the \u201cafter\u201d presentation. In the parlance that we are using in the instant matter, those consumers would be reasonable, but not sophisticated.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">C. Materiality</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Luskin\u2019s contends that \u201cgiving due consideration and weight\u201d to the FTC Policy requires that the materiality element of the determination of deception be based on \u201cbut for\u201d causation. Luskin\u2019s bases this argument on a summary in the Policy of the materiality element, where the FTC said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">\u201cThe basic question is whether the act or practice is likely to affect the consumer\u2019s conduct or decision with regard to a product or service. If so, the practice is material, and consumer injury is likely, because consumers are likely to have chosen differently <em>but for </em>the deception. In many instances, materiality, and hence injury, can be presumed from the nature of the practice. In other instances, evidence of materiality may be necessary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-7\"><em>Cliffdale Assocs., Inc., </em>103 F.T.C. at 175-76 (emphasis added). Under the Policy, it is the probability that the deceptive practice affected the customer\u2019s decision that makes the misrepresentation material. At a minimum a practice is subject to a cease and desist order if it has the tendency to deceive. The balance of the summary, including \u201cbut for\u201d causation, addresses the question of actual consumer injury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Our reading of the Policy statement is confirmed by the FTC\u2019s description of the requisites of materiality in <em>Cliffdale Associates. </em>There the FTC said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>\u201ca material misrepresentation ... involves information that is important to consumers and, hence, likely to affect their choice of ... a product. Consumers thus are likely to suffer injury from a material misrepresentation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 165-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">We hold that the Act includes the above description of the materiality element in a deceptive practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">D. FTC Guidelines on \u201cFree\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">In 1971, the FTC adopted a regulation interpretive of \u00a7 5 of the FTC Act. 36 Fed.Reg. 21,517 (1971). <em>See </em>16 C.F.R. \u00a7 251.1 (1998), \u201cGuide Concerning Use of the Word \u2018Free\u2019 and Similar Representations\u201d (Free Guidelines). In relevant part the regulation provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-9\">\u201cWhen making \u2018Free\u2019 or similar offers all the terms, conditions and obligations upon which receipt and retention of the \u2018Free\u2019 item are contingent should be set forth clearly and conspicuously at the outset of the offer so as to leave no reasonable probability that the terms of the offer might be misunderstood. Stated differently, all of the terms, conditions and obligations should appear in close conjunction with the offer of \u2018Free\u2019 merchandise or service. For example, disclosure of the terms of the offer set forth in a footnote of an advertisement to which reference is made by an asterisk or other symbol placed next to the offer, is not regarded as making disclosure at the outset.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">This interpretive rule reiterates the position taken by the FTC in 1953. <em>See In re Walter J. Black, Inc. t/a Classics Club &amp; Detective Book Club, </em>50 F.T.C. 225 (1953).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A3M\">The FTC has stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-11\">\u201c[w]hile the guide is interpretive of laws administered by the [FTC] and thus advisory in nature, proceedings, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>appropriate, to enforce the requirements of law <em>as explained </em>in the guide may be brought----\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">36 Fed.Reg. at 21,517 (emphasis added). <em>See also </em>16 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.5 (1998) (\u201cIndustry guides are administrative interpretations of laws administered by the [FTC] for the guidance of the public in conducting its affairs in conformity with legal requirements.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">According to the general provisions of the Free Guidelines, they were promulgated to accord with the way in which \u201cthe public understands\u201d the word \u201cfree.\u201d The FTC noted that \u201c[b]ecause the <em>purchasing public </em>continually searches for the best buy, and regards the offer of \u2018Free\u2019 merchandise or service to be a special bargain, all such offers must be made with extreme care so as to avoid any possibility that consumers will be misled or deceived.\u201d 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 251.1(a)(2) (emphasis added). As with the FTC Policy the Free Guidelines should be given due weight and consideration. <em>See generally </em>D. Pridgen, <em>Consumer Protection and the Law </em>\u00a7 11:21 (1986, 1998 Supp.) (Pridgen) (\u201cMost rational consumers presumably realize there is no such thing as a free lunch.

Citicorp USA, Inc., </em>137 Ill.App.3d 1035, 92 Ill.Dec. 780, 485 N.E.2d 591 (1985). There a credit card issuer, as an incentive for cardholders immediately to accept an increase in the annual fee, offered those accepting the increase \u201c TO valuable extra services\u2019 ... including \u2018free $100,000 common carrier travel insurance.\u2019\u201d <em>Fineman, </em>92 Ill.Dec. 780, 485 N.E.2d at 592. Like Maryland\u2019s Act, the Illinois statute at issue in <em>Fineman </em>provided that, \u2018\u201c[i]n construing [the prohibition against deceptive trade practices] consideration shall be given to the interpretations of the [FTC] and the federal courts relating to Section 5(a) of the [FTC] Act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 780, 485 N.E.2d at 593-94 (citing Ill.Rev. Stat. Ch. 121-1/2, \u00b6 262 (1981)). The <em>Fineman </em>court adopted and quoted the disjunctive rules set forth in the precursor to the Free Guidelines. <em>In re Walter J. Black, Inc., </em>50 F.T.C. 225. One of the alternate rules is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>\u201cThe use of the word \u2018Free,\u2019 [is] an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the following circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-4\">\u201c(1) When all of the conditions, obligations, or other prerequisites to the receipt and retention of the \u2018free\u2019 article of merchandise are not clearly and conspicuously explained or set forth at the outset so as to leave no reasonable probability that the terms of the advertisement or offer might be misunderstood.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 235-36 (cited at <em>Fineman, </em>92 Ill.Dec. 780, 485 N.E.2d at 594).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The court concluded that there was no violation because the card issuer had clearly stated in its notice \u201cthat the insurance was available only to those cardholders who agreed to pay the higher fee. There was no <em>reasonable probability </em>that the offer would be misunderstood.\u201d <em>Fineman, </em>92 Ill.Dec. 780, 485 N.E.2d at 594 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">For much the same reasons as those underlying our holding concerning the standard for determining if a practice is deceptive, we hold that a claim under the Act that an advertisement is deceptive because of its use of the word \u201cfree,\u201d or its equivalent, ordinarily should be decided by applying the same principles and rules that are applied by the FTC and the federal courts under \u00a7 5 of the FTC Act, including the principles and rules in the Free Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">E. Section 13-301(1) and (3)</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">In this Part IV.E, we apply the principles and rules discussed above to the free airfare advertising by Luskin\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">The Court of Special Appeals found substantial evidence in the testimony of the customer witnesses that they \u201canticipated that, upon making their purchases, Luskin\u2019s would give them airline tickets, not an application for a travel package----\u201d 120 Md.App. at 33, 706 A.2d at 118. This conclusion could only be reached by having equated lack of sophistication with lack of reasonableness. Under the circumstances here, a reasonable consumer could not expect to walk into any of the Luskin\u2019s locations, make a $200 purchase, and then have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Luskin\u2019s dispense two tickets for a flight to Florida, on the date, at the time, from the origin, to the destination and, perhaps, on the airline, that were chosen by the consumer. The advertisement targeted an audience of persons who would purchase $200 or more of electrical or electronic appliances, for home or office, including cellular telephones and computers. It would be obvious to nearly all in the targeted audience that Luskin\u2019s had not installed in each of its locations, for the period of the promotion, computer terminals connected to one or more airlines, servicing one or more airports in the three advertised destinations, in order to determine airline seat availability at the point of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">A closer question is presented by the Agency\u2019s alternate finding that \u201c[t]he consumer could reasonably have believed that airline ... vouchers would be presented by Luskin\u2019s.\u201d This finding depends on a rule of law that permits reading out of the newspaper advertisement the disclosures that the \u201cVacations Premiums [are] Offered Through [WI] Which is not affiliated with Luskin\u2019s\u201d and that a \u201cMinimum Hotel Stay [is] Required,\u201d as well as two statements that the reader \u201cSee Store For Details.\u201d The issue here is whether the reasonable consumer, knowing that there is no such thing as a \u201cfree lunch,\u201d will read the smaller type text or the brief television subtitle to learn what the \u201ccatch\u201d is, or whether the reasonable consumer, acting on an impression of the advertisement as a whole, would not see or discern the significance of the disclosures in smaller type. We need not decide that question in the instant matter. There is substantial evidence to support the Agency\u2019s finding that the advertisement was a deceptive practice under the Free Guidelines, based on omissions of material matter, even if a consumer, acting reasonably under the circumstances, would read the entire ad.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Luskin\u2019s did not purport to be making an unconditional gift. Rather, there were two levels of conditions in the ad. The first condition, that specific minimum purchases from Luskin\u2019s were required, was fully set forth in the ad. At the second level were the conditions of WI that the consumer must meet to get the \u201cfree airfare.\u201d Luskin\u2019s did not disclose the fifteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>dollar per person registration fee. The length of the required minimum hotel stays was not disclosed, so that a consumer reasonably might get the impression that a get-away weekend would qualify. Also not disclosed in the ad was the cost of the minimum stay, a factor which is clearly material to how \u201cfree\u201d the airfare for two really was. There was substantial evidence to support the litany of omissions from the ad that were found by the Agency. See Part I, <em>supra. </em>Thus, the ad omitted information that would be important to the consumer and that likely affected consumer conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">On substantial evidence the Agency found that the failure of the free airfare ad to state material facts tended to deceive and was a deceptive trade practice, as described in \u00a7 13-301(3), and that it therefore violated \u00a7 13-303. The free airfare ad is not a separate violation of \u00a7 13-303 by virtue of the Agency\u2019s also analyzing the ad\u2019s shortcomings as implicit misrepresentations, described in \u00a7 13-301(1). That analysis simply refers, to the same conduct by describing the other side of the same coin.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">V. Section 13-301(9)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Luskin\u2019s asserts that the Agency and the Court of Special Appeals have misinterpreted \u00a7 13-301(9) and that, if it is properly interpreted, Luskin\u2019s has not committed the deceptive practice therein described. Section 13-301(9) addresses acts of commission and of omission. The former are \u201c[deception, fraud, false pretense, false premise, [and] misrepresentation,\u201d while the latter are \u201cknowing concealment, suppression, or omission of any material fact with the intent that a consumer rely on the same,\u201d all in connection with \u201c[t]he promotion or sale of any consumer goods____\u201d Luskin\u2019s contends that \u00a7 13-301(9) requires scienter, and we agree. The acts of commission proscribed by \u00a7 13-301(9), if read to be innocent misrepresentations, would be duplicative of \u00a7 13-301(1). Although the word \u201cmisrepresentation,\u201d unqualified, may mean either an intentional or an innocent misrepresentation, \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d as found in \u00a7 13-301(9) is included in an enumeration of proscribed commissions, each of which con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>notes intentional misrepresentation. Consequently, under the rule of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>\u201cmisrepresentation\u201d in \u00a7 13-301(9) should be given the same meaning as the accompanying terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">The omissions proscribed by \u00a7 13-301(9) clearly require that the \u201cconcealment, suppression or omission of any material fact\u201d be \u201cknowing,\u201d as well as made \u201cwith the intent that a consumer rely on the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The Court of Special Appeals rejected the Luskin\u2019s argument by reading the phrase \u201cthe intent that a consumer rely on the same\u201d as modifying \u00a7 13-301(9) in its entirety. <em>Luskin\u2019s, </em>120 Md.App. at 35, 706 A.2d at 119. That is not the plain meaning of the words used. Further, if there were any ambiguity it is resolved by reference to the revision of the Act effected by Chapter 609 of the Acts of 1974, when present \u00a7 13-301(9) was added as \u00a7 20C(13). In relevant part the earlier statute read: \u201c[W]ith the intent that consumers rely upon the concealment, suppression, or omission in connection with the promotion or sale.... \u201d Changing this language to \u201cthe same\u201d during Code Revision did not effect a substantial change. The contrast between \u00a7 13-301(1) and (3) (scienter not required) with \u00a7 13-301(9) (scienter required) was pointed out in <em>Golt, </em>308 Md. at 10-11, 517 A.2d at 333. <em>See also </em>Comment, <em>Maryland\u2019s Consumer Protection Act: A Private Cause of Action for Deceptive Trade Practices, </em>38 Md. L.Rev. 733, 742 (1979). Thus, the Agency erred in its interpretation of \u00a7 13-301(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">YI. Section 13-305</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Our grant of certiorari also embraced the construction of \u00a7 13-305. The section is long and complex, containing subsections (a) through (h), but the principal arguments involve subsections (a) and (b). They read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">\u201c(a) Exceptions.\u2014This section does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-9\">\u201c(1) Trading stamps, as defined by \u00a7 13-301 of the Business Regulation Article;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-10\">\u201c(2) State lottery tickets issued under the authority of Title 9, Subtitle 1 of the State Government Article;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>\u201c(3) Retail promotions, not involving the offer of gifts and prizes, which offer savings on consumer goods or services including \u2018one-cent sales\u2019, \u2018two-for-the-price-of-one-sales\u2019, or manufacturer\u2019s \u2018cents-ofP coupons; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-4\">\u201c(4) Games of skill competition not involving sales promotion efforts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">\u201c(b) Prohibition.\u2014A person may not notify any other person by any means, as part of an advertising scheme or plan, that the other person has won a prize, received an award, or has been selected or is eligible to receive anything of value if the other person is required to purchase goods or services, pay any money to participate in, or submit to a sales promotion effort.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Looking first to the statutory language, Luskin\u2019s contends that its free airfare promotion does not fall within the prohibition of subsection (b), even though a purchase is required, because the advertisement is directed to the public generally. Any member of the public as a whole who makes the qualifying purchase obtains a travel certificate. Luskin\u2019s does not notify a person that that person has \u201cwon a prize, received an award, or has been selected or is eligible to receive anything of value.\u201d Although the travel certificate may be something of value, Luskin\u2019s does not notify a person that he is \u201celigible to receive\u201d it. Luskin\u2019s reads \u201celigible\u201d to connote one\u2019s having been placed in some special category different from the public as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">The Agency gives subsection (b) a much broader reading. It notes that \u00a7 13-101(b)(l) defines \u201cadvertisement\u201d to mean \u201cthe publication, dissemination or circulation of any oral or written matter, including labeling, which directly or indirectly tends to induce a person to enter into an obligation____\u201d Because subsection (b) prohibits notification \u201cby any means\u201d the Agency says that consumers are notified by the Luskin\u2019s ad. Hence, argues the Agency, inasmuch as notice includes notice by advertisement, subsection (b) does not require that the notice be sent to specific persons, as, for example, in direct mail advertising utilizing a mailing list. The Agency\u2019s brief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>does not undertake to harmonize the other words in subsection (b) with the Agency\u2019s construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">Each party reinforces its \u201cplain meaning\u201d argument by resort to legislative history. Present subsection (b) was originally enacted by Chapter 579 of the Acts of 1970 and codified as Maryland Code (1957, 1969 Repl.Vol., 1970 Cum.Supp.), Article 83, \u00a7 21D. When introduced as House Bill 141, the bill provided that \u201c[t]he notification to any person by any means, as part of an advertising scheme or plan, that he has won a prize and requiring him to do any act, purchase any other item, or submit to a sales promotion effort\u201d constituted an unlawful practice. 1970 Md. Laws at 1682. House Bill 141 was amended in the House Economics Matters Committee. The amendment additionally made unlawful notification that the person \u201creceived an award, or has been selected or is eligible to receive anything of value which is conditioned\u201d upon a purchase or submitting to a sales promotion. <em>Id.; </em>1970 Md. House J. at 479. The bill was further amended by the Senate Economic Affairs Committee to add the exception now found in subsection (a)(1) for trading stamps. 1970 Md. Senate J. at 1696.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The 1970 legislation presents the problem that has continued to bedevil \u00a7 13-305 as it was expanded over the years to the present time. Does present subsection (b) prohibit general advertising of any gift conditioned on a purchase, or are merchants who advertise that they give trading stamps outside of the reach of subsection (b) because no consumer has been notified in advance of any sale that they have won a prize or have become eligible to receive something of value. Phrased another way, is the \u201cexception\u201d for trading stamps necessary because of the breadth of the prohibition, or did some lobbyist, nearly thirty years ago, obtain a safe harbor for a trading stamp client who thereafter no longer needed to be concerned over how this Court might ultimately construe the prohibition\u2019s applicability to trading stamps?</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The \u201cexception\u201d for state lottery tickets in present subsection (a)(2) was added by Chapter 347 of the Acts of 1975. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>title to the bill states that it is for \u201cthe purpose of allowing tickets for the State Lottery to be given away as part of a sales promotion.\u201d Subsection (a)(2) presents the same problem discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">These two subsections, (a) and (b), that were in effect prior to 1975 were changed only in style, according to the Revisor\u2019s Note, in the adoption of the Commercial Law Article by Chapter 49 of the Acts of 1975. <em>See </em>1975 Md. Laws at 532. That revision, however, substituted the \u201cwhich is conditioned\u201d upon purchase or submission language of the 1970 statute with \u201cif the other person purchases an item or submits to a sales promotion.\u201d Md.Code (1975), CL \u00a7 13-305(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Provisions dealing with \u201ca sales promotion effort relating to the sale, lease, or rental of real property not prohibited by this section,\u201d now codified as \u00a7 13-305(e), were enacted by Chapter 535 of the Acts of 1985.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Subsection (e) imposes certain disclosure obligations that are triggered \u201c[w]hen a person offers prizes.\u201d This real estate subsection incorporates the problem discussed above by its reference to an offer that is \u201cnot prohibited by this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>The provisions that became present subsection (e) were introduced by Senator Levitan in the 1985 session as Senate Bill 869. The report of the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee on that bill refers, as background, to the fact that \u201c[m]any consumers have traveled several hundred miles in response to a solicitation promising valuable gifts, only to find that their \u2018prize\u2019 is an inexpensive trinket.\u201d It is far from clear what conduct of the type referred to in the Senate Report would be reached by subsection (e) but would not be prohibited under subsection (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">The difference between the Luskin\u2019s and the Agency positions is at least consistent with both sections. Assume, for example, a general ad for a second home development in Garrett County which promises a free television to those who come to the site (so that they may be subjected to a sales solicitation). The television screen is two inches by two inches. If the Agency construction of subsection (b) is correct, then the general ad, plus the promise of a gift, plus the prohibited condition would have been unlawful under \u00a7 13-305 since 1970, and the real estate promotion subsection, enacted in 1985, would not have reached schemes that it apparently sought to reach. Alternatively, if \u00a7 13-305 did not reach the conduct because there was no representation to a specific consumer that that person had become eligible to receive a television, then the real estate promotion subsection would operate and require disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Also consistent with the Luskin\u2019s position is the following statement of policy in the Senate Report on Senate Bill 369:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">\u201cBusinesses should be able to use gifts for sales promotion and consumers should be allowed to choose or receive the prizes offered in the promotions. However, the consumers must know before they expend their time and money, what conditions are attached to receiving the prizes offered in the sales promotion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">This is the policy of the FTC Free Guidelines that we applied under \u00a7 13-301(3), <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Section 13-305 was also substantially amended by Chapter 650 of the Acts of 1985, legislation introduced as House Bill 752. The report of the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee on House Bill 752 states that \u201c[t]he intent of the bill is to require disclosure of specified information to potential participants in contests, sweepstakes, and other prize-awarding events.\u201d This intent is accomplished by present subsections (g) and (h). Subsection (g) is triggered \u201c[i]f a person offers a contest ... not prohibited by [\u00a7 13-305], involving the award of prizes by chance.\u201d In that event certain disclosures must be made.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Subsection (h) has the same triggering provisions, other than that the contest must be one \u201cnot involving the award of prizes by chance.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Subsections (g) and (h) each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>require disclosure of the \u201cconditions\u201d that must be met to receive the prize. Subsections (g)(5); (h)(2). The principal differences between subsection (b) on the one hand and subsections (g) and (h) on the other are (1) that the scope of the latter is not expressly limited by the prohibited conditions and (2) that the former requires a notification that the consumer \u201chas won a prize ... or is eligible to receive anything of value,\u201d while the latter two subsections deal with the disclosure rules that must be followed when the contest is offered, in advance of any purported winning or achieving of eligibility by the consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Identical memoranda from the Agency separately submitted to the House Economic Matters Committee and to the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee when each was considering House Bill 752 (as enacted, Chapter 650) reflect that the Agency position at that time was generally consistent with the Luskin\u2019s position in the matter now before us. Those memoranda advised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">\u201cBusinesses want to use gifts as sales promotions and under House Bill 752 they will continue to be able to offer prizes as part of their promotions. House Bill 752 will simply require promoters to disclose the conditions of receiving those prizes <em>before </em>consumers spend their time and money.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Chapter 650 also added the exceptions found in \u00b6\u00b6 (3) and (4) of subsection (a). Paragraph (3) appears to be internally contradictory. It applies to \u201c[r]etail promotions, not involving the offer of gifts and prizes,\u201d which promotions include \u201c \u2018two-for-the-price-of-one sales.\u2019 \u201d There does not seem to be any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>difference between the latter and a promotion advertising \u201cBuy One\u2014Get One Free,\u201d and thus involving a gift or prize. Over the years the Agency\u2019s resolution of this anomaly has been to construe the \u201cexception\u201d in subsection (a)(3) to permit a gift that is \u201cfunctionally related\u201d to the object or service sold.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Subsection (a)(4) excepts from \u00a7 13-305 \u201c[gjames of skill competition not involving sales promotion efforts.\u201d There appears to be no difference between a sales promotion effort, which cannot be present for the exception of subsection (a)(4) to apply, and the essential element of \u201can advertising scheme or plan,\u201d set forth in subsection (b). Inasmuch as an essential element of subsection (b) must be missing for subsection (a)(4) to apply, subsection (a)(4) appears not to be an exception at all. The subsection (a)(4) provision strongly suggests that some interest group achieved its enactment as a safe harbor so that that group would not have to be concerned with how the Agency might enforce subsection (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Chapter 650 also sharpened the wording and expanded the scope of subsection (b) to read \u201cif the other person is required to purchase goods or services, pay any money to participate in, or submit to a sales promotion effort.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The most recent amendments to \u00a7 13-305 were made by Chapter 589 (Senate Bill 581) of the Acts of 1996. This was after the Agency filed its decision in the instant matter. The Legislative Services bill file on Senate Bill 581 demonstrates that the General Assembly was made aware of the Agency\u2019s decision. Senate Bill 746 of the 1996 session, that was not enacted, also has some relevance to the construction of \u00a7 13-305. The Agency argues that the outcome of these two bills in the 1996 session amounts to legislative agreement with the Agency\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 13-305.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>As introduced, Senate Bill 581 would have repealed subsection (b) in its entirety. This proposal precipitated a lobbying campaign in favor of the bill by the Maryland Retailers Association and certain other retailers, and in opposition to the bill by the Agency. The debate resulted in a compromise pursuant to which subsections (c) and (d) of \u00a7 13-305 were enacted. Subsection (c) provides that subsection (b) \u201cdoes not prohibit the offer of prizes requiring the person to purchase other goods and services if the retail price of the prize offered does not exceed\u201d a certain formula.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">At the 1996 session the mercantile community was also advocating that the Circuit Court for Harford County correctly had construed subsection (b) in the Luskin\u2019s declaratory judgment case. After reviewing \u00a7 13-305 in its entirety, that court had concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-5\">\u201cAll of these [subjections [of \u00a7 13-305], when read together ... indicate that the evil being attacked by this provision is advertisements that notify specific individuals that they have been selected to win a prize and not advertisements which combine two or more unlike items of merchandise or service in a single purchase price.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">In the instant enforcement action the Agency ruled differently, holding that subsection (b) applied to general advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Luskin\u2019s also had argued before the Agency in the instant matter that its free airfare promotion fell within the exception in subsection (a)(3). Applying its construction that the subsection (a)(3) exception applied only to items that are \u201cfunctionally related,\u201d the Agency ruled that there was no functional interrelationship between appliances and free airfare. The \u201cfunctionally-related\u201d test similarly spilled over into the 1996 legislative session. Senate Bill 746 would have amended subsection (a)(3) to insert \u201cwhether or not unlike merchandise or services are combined in a single promotion.\u201d As part of the compromise, Senate Bill 746 was not enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">This legislative action and inaction, the Agency concludes, evidences the legislative intent that subsection (b) applies to general advertising, and that the subsection (a)(3) exception is limited to items that are \u201cfunctionally related.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">We hold that Luskin\u2019s did not violate \u00a7 13-305(b). Consequently, we need not decide how \u00a7 13-305(a)(3) is to be construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The interpretation of \u00a7 13-305(b) espoused by Luskin\u2019s and applied by the circuit court in the declaratory judgment case looks to all of the words of subsection (b) and gives those words their ordinary meaning. In the context of one\u2019s winning a prize, or receiving an award, or having been selected or found eligible to receive something of value, the words connote some process of selection which the one notified has successfully completed. In that context to \u201cnotify\u201d one of that selection is to communicate in an individually directed fashion. By contrast, the Agency\u2019s reading of \u201cnotify\u201d is not the ordinary meaning. After seeing a television ad, a person simply does not say, \u201cI have just been notified that Unctious Used Cars is giving away a windshield ice scraper with each purchase.\u201d Moreover, the Agency\u2019s position gives no meaning to the representations that the one notified has won a prize, or received an award, or has been selected or is eligible to receive something of value. Only by ignoring those required representations, and by reading \u201cnotify\u201d to include any adver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>tisement, does the Agency bring the advertisement of any gift or prize within the prohibition of subsection (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Further, from our review of the legislative history, we conclude that, when originally enacting subsection (b), the General Assembly did not intend for it to reach any ad offering a gift or prize conditioned on purchase or submitting to a sales promotion. By reading out of subsection (b) the element of a representation concerning some special selection, the Agency removes any requirement of deception. The conduct legislatively intended to be proscribed is a notification that combines, with one of the prohibited conditions from which the advertiser will benefit, a representation of special selection, when, in fact, the special selection is \u201cpart of an advertising scheme or plan.\u201d The way in which the Agency reads subsection (b), it can be violated by an advertisement that is truthful. The Agency\u2019s interpretation turns into a violator a merchant who has not increased the price of the item or service required to be purchased, has not reduced the quality of the gift or prize, and has fairly set forth the conditions in the advertisement. That cannot have been the legislative intent, and that is not how the Agency viewed the legislative intent during the first fifteen years of the Act\u2019s existence, as evidenced by the legislative history reviewed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The National Consumer Law Center has recognized that \u00a7 13-305 should be interpreted in the limited manner articulated above. Citing to the statute, the Center stated that \u201c[i]t is deceptive to operate a contest or <em>otherwise specially select consumers </em>when the scheme is really designed to make contact with prospective buyers and special prices are not being offered.\u201d National Consumer Law Center, <em>Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices </em>\u00a7 4.6.6 (4th ed.1997) (emphasis added). In addition, the commentary refers to several sources from other states in which courts, legislatures, and administrative agencies prohibited the practice of informing consumers that they had been specially selected as prize winners.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The Agency\u2019s broad reading of \u00a7 13-305(b) is also inconsistent with the philosophy of \u00a7 13-306. That section was first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>enacted by Chapter 516 of the Acts of 1971. In that provision the General Assembly contemplated that \u201ca gift or other inducement [would be] offered to a customer in exchange for business.\u201d \u00a7 13-306(a). The statute requires that if the \u201cgift or other inducement\u201d is not available <em>\u201cat the time the customer complies with the conditions attached to the offer\u201d </em>then the offeror is to give a certificate that is redeemable for the gift. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The typical conditions for such an offer certainly include the purchase of some goods or services.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">We recognize that the Agency\u2019s current interpretation of subsection (b) provides ease of enforcement. The Agency need only see if an ad offers, on a prohibited condition, a gift that is not \u201cfunctionally related.\u201d This enforcement policy may well have accentuated the desirability for various interests to obtain legislative \u201cexceptions.\u201d But these \u201cexceptions\u201d cannot alter the original meaning and intent of the core prohibition. Statutory exceptions from a prohibition that is not applicable do not retroactively enlarge the prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">It may be that current public policy is to prohibit, on a <em>per se </em>basis, offers of prizes conditioned on purchases, where the prizes are above the monetary tolerances in subsection (c), even if the offers contain no representations of special selection. If that is the case, then the General Assembly may do so directly. That result is not achieved by creating an exception to a prohibition, the violation of which requires some representation in the advertising scheme or plan of special selection.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">VII. Special Defenses</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Luskin\u2019s also contends that the circuit court was not required to give deference to the Agency\u2019s findings, including the Agency\u2019s finding that there was no accord and satisfaction and that the instant enforcement action was not a retaliatory or selective one. The arguments advanced by Luskin\u2019s are in substance an attempt to avoid the substantial evidence test. We reject the arguments for the reasons given by the Court of Special Appeals. <em>Luskin\u2019s, </em>120 Md.App. at 38-41, 706 A.2d at 120-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">VIII. Breadth of Cease and Desist</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">Luskin\u2019s challenges the cease and desist provisions of the Agency\u2019s final order as being too broad, and we agree. Those provisions read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>\u201c1. Luskin\u2019s shall not use advertising that creates an overall impression about a particular matter that has the capacity, tendency or effect of deceiving or misleading consumers, or that fails to state any material fact if the failure deceives or tends to deceive consumers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-4\">\u201c2.

No statement made in an advertisement shall be ambiguous or make any other statement ambiguous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">\u201cB. Compliance with \u00a7 13-305</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-10\">\u201c7. Luskin\u2019s shall not violate Md. Com. Law Code Ann. \u00a7 13-305(b), which prohibits notifying consumers by any means, as part of an advertising scheme or plan, that consumers are eligible to receive anything of value, such as a prize, gift, or award, if the consumers are required to purchase any other goods or services, pay any money to anyone, or submit to a sales promotion effort. \u2018Anything of value\u2019 as used in this paragraph does not include a thing that is of negligible or <em>de minimis </em>monetary value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-11\">\u201c8. Luskin\u2019s may, as allowed by \u00a7 13-305(a)(3), conduct retail promotions which offer consumers monetary savings on the purchase of consumer goods and services. Such offers of monetary savings include manufacturer\u2019s \u2018cents off coupons and price reductions for buying together two or more of the same or functionally related items, such as offering components of a system for a single price, \u2018two-for-the-price-of-one\u2019 sales and \u2018one cent\u2019 sales. Such offers do not include an offer to sell together two or more items that are not functionally related, such as airline tickets and appliances, as part of an advertising scheme or plan in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>which one of the items is represented as \u2018free\u2019 or as a gift or prize.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-4\">\u201c9. Luskin\u2019s shall make the disclosures required by Md. Com. Law Code Ann. \u00a7 13-305(c), (e), (f), and (g), when applicable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The Agency \u201chas the power to prohibit not only continued use of past advertisements but also <em>future </em>acts that</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">involve the same violation or unlawful practice____\u201d <em>Luskin\u2019s</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\"><em>Inc. v. Consumer Protection Div., </em>338 Md. 188, 198, 657 A.2d 788, 792 (1995), The Agency is further authorized to issue an order requiring a violator \u201cto take affirmative action.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Consumer Protection Div. v. Outdoor World Corp., </em>91 Md.App. 275, 290, 603 A.2d 1376, 1383 (1992) (recognizing Agency\u2019s power to require notices sent into Maryland of eligibility for prize to state \u201cwhat the likelihood is that [recipients] will receive a prize of any significant value\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">The above-quoted order imposes requirements that go far beyond the deceptive practice in which Luskin\u2019s engaged in the instant matter. Paragraph nine of the order invokes provisions of the Act, violations of which were not even charged against Luskin\u2019s. Paragraph seven involves a violation, the charging of which we have held was based on an erroneous interpretation of \u00a7 13-305(b). Moreover, paragraph seven simply recites the language of \u00a7 13-305(b) and directs Luskin\u2019s not to violate it. Paragraphs one through six of the order go beyond the type of violation that Luskin\u2019s committed here. The violation here was the omission, before sale, of the disclosure of material facts relating to the conditions of the free airfare promotion. We assume that an order affirmatively requiring the disclosure of material conditions involving a promotion based on something being \u201cfree\u201d would be proper. The vice in the instant order is that it applies to all advertising, without limitation as to the promotional theme, while at the same time directing Luskin\u2019s to comply with what amount to the general principles that are applied to determine whether a statement is deceptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\"><em>Standard Oil Co. v. FTC, </em>577 F.2d 653 (9th Cir.1978), was a case of false advertising in the sale of gasoline. One provision of the order issued against Standard Oil directed it to cease and desist from</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-10\">\u201cusing any pictorial or other visual means of communication with or without an accompanying verbal text which directly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>or by implication creates a misleading impression in the minds of viewers as to the true state of material facts which are the subject of said pictures or other visual means of communication.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 661 n. 4. Although the deceptive trade practice in <em>Standard Oil </em>was in a simulation, the Court struck down the quoted provision and others like it. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\">\u201cThe order\u2019s generality adds to its burdensome character.

The Monetary Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">We also direct that those portions of the Agency\u2019s final order awarding certain monetary relief be vacated and that a modified order, based on principles of restitution, be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The final order deals with all customers who made qualifying purchases from Luskin\u2019s during the promotion period. Luskin\u2019s is ordered to provide two round trip airline tickets to the destination for which the purchaser qualified, and \u201c[t]he terms of the tickets must be such that the consumer may use them without any charge and on any date of the customer\u2019s choice for one year after the date of issue,\u201d with departure from Baltimore or Washington. Alternatively, Luskin\u2019s is ordered to pay each eligible consumer the cash value of the tickets ranging from $479 for Florida to $1,454 to Hawaii. In addition, Luskin\u2019s is ordered to reimburse all eligible customers for money paid by the customer to WI, except for payments for accommodations actually used. The final order established a claims procedure for the administration of the relief ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">It could not be more plain that the power of the Agency to award monetary relief in an administrative action brought by the Agency is limited to restitution. <em>See </em>\u00a7 13-204 (\u201c[T]he [Agency] has the powers and duties to ... (10) [a]ssess against any violator ... damages which flow from the improper, incomplete or untimely restitution by the violator____\u201d); \u00a7 13-402(b)(l) (Any cease and desist order may include a condition for \u201c(ii) [t]he restitution by the violator ... to the consumer of money, property, or any other thing received from the consumer in connection with a violation .... \u201d); \u00a7 13-403(b)(l) (\u201c[T]he [Agency] shall ... issue an order requiring the violator ... to take affirmative action, including the restitution of money or property.\u201d).

This comparison between public and private actions has been drawn in consumer initiated actions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number><em>See CitaraManis v.

Co., </em>304 Md. 731, 501 A.2d 48 (1985), we contrasted restitution, which was the relief in that proceeding, with a damage action, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">\u201c \u2018The damages recovery is to compensate the plaintiff and it pays him, theoretically, his losses. The restitution claim, on the other hand, is not aimed at compensating the plaintiff but at forcing the defendant to disgorge benefits it would be unjust for him to keep----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">\u201c \u2018Restitutionary recoveries often amount to about the same as the plaintiffs losses, and thus serve many of the compensatory purposes served by a damages recovery. The justification lies, however, in the avoidance of unjust enrichment on the part of the defendant.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 776, 501 A.2d at 71-72 (quoting Dobbs, <em>Law of Remedies </em>\u00a7 4.1, at 224 (1973)). <em>See also Bennett Heating &amp; Air Conditioning, Inc. v.

Corbin, <em>Corbin on Contracts </em>\u00a7 1107, at 574 (1964) (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">The Agency explains in its brief the rationale underlying its order that Luskin\u2019s pay what is apparently the retail value of two airline tickets, saying, \u201c[B]y representing the airfare tickets as \u2018free\u2019 and by not disclosing the material costs, terms and conditions, Luskin\u2019s <em>did </em>promise to deliver to consumers more than the WI travel package was actually worth.\u201d Brief of Respondent at 34. The Agency says that it is \u201cproviding relief to consumers by requiring Luskin\u2019s to give them what it promised.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>This approach treats the Luskin\u2019s-eligible consumer relationship as if there were an enforceable contract that had been breached. As a remedy the Agency ordered loss of the benefit of the bargain, or expectation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>interest, damages, <em>ie., </em>the difference between the value of that which was \u201cpromised\u201d less the value of that which was received. The Agency\u2019s approach can also be analyzed as if there had been a tort of deceit. As a remedy the Agency ordered tort damages, which, in appropriate circumstances in a deceit action, may be measured by loss of the benefit of the bargain. <em>See Hinkle v. Rockville Motor Co., </em>262 Md. 502, 278 A.2d 42 (1971).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">In the matter now before us the relief ordered by the Agency is not rooted in restitution. The relief ordered is not limited to preventing unjust enrichment. In this \u201cfree\u201d airfare promotion, Luskin\u2019s paid WI for the travel certificates. Those consumers who presented the certificates to WT paid an additional sum to WI to participate in the process, and, if they pursued the vacation, they paid WI for hotel and other accommodations. WI likely booked hotel rooms and airline seats for the off season and at discounted rates. WI\u2019s gross profit would be the total of the amounts paid to it by Luskin\u2019s and by the consumers less the amounts paid by it to the hotels and airlines. Further, the greater the attrition in the actual use of certificates issued by WI, the greater is the WI profit. In this somewhat myopic view of the transaction, Luskin\u2019s is out of pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The enrichment to Luskin\u2019s, however, lies in the additional net profit that Luskin\u2019s may have made on an increase in sales of items of $200 or more during the period of the promotion over the sales in that price range that Luskin\u2019s otherwise would have made.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The appropriate remedy under the circumstances of this case is to require Luskin\u2019s to disgorge the net profit it realized from the deceptive practice. Accordingly, we shall vacate the monetary relief portion of the Agency\u2019s final order and remand to the Agency for the calculation of monetary relief focused on unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">It is, of course, the function of the Agency to fashion the final order. We note, however, that, inasmuch as the remedy seeks to have Luskin\u2019s disgorge net profits de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>rived from the deceptive promotion, the base that the Agency decides to use for determining any increase in net profits may be derived using periods of time when lawful promotions were being conducted by Luskin\u2019s. Further, mathematical precision is not required; reasonable approximations suffice. <em>See M &amp; R Contractors &amp; Builders, Inc. v. Michael, </em>215 Md. 340, 349, 138 A.2d 350, 355 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">Luskin\u2019s argues that, in order to effect restitution, the goods purchased by the eligible consumers must be returned to Luskin\u2019s. That is not an appropriate or practical application of restitution in the instant matter. We recognized in <em>Consumer Publishing </em>that \u201cthe plaintiff is generally required to disaffirm the contract and restore what he received under the bargain, or at least offer in good faith to restore it, before the defendant is required to restore what he received.\u201d 304 Md. at 777, 501 A.2d at 72. We also recognized that \u201c[tjhis requirement has been relaxed when the thing received by plaintiff is expected to be consumed, or from its very nature cannot be returned, or is worthless.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In the instant matter the deceptive practice does not involve the goods themselves. Further, tender-back restoration is not practical, inasmuch as it would involve issues concerning the continued existence of the goods, the extent of the depreciation, whether the consumer would be required to pay the value of the use of the goods, and whether the consumer or Luskin\u2019s had the burden to deliver or to pick up. More important, the fallacy in this argument is that it does not consider the unjust enrichment of Luskin\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">There is a reliance element in restitution, <em>Consumer Publishing, </em>304 Md. at 779, 501 A.2d at 73, and the parties here are at odds over the treatment of that element in the Agency\u2019s claim procedure. That procedure contemplates mailing a questionnaire to customers who, as identified from the records of Luskin\u2019s, made qualifying purchases during the promotion period. All questions are to be answered under affirmation. One question on that form asks if \u201cone of the reasons\u201d for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>purchase was to get free airfare tickets. Luskin\u2019s contends that the question should be phrased as \u201cbut for\u201d causation, but we have already rejected that argument in Part IV.C, <em>supra. </em>Luskin\u2019s also points out that it has many long term customers who always buy their appliances at Luskin\u2019s and whose purchases during the promotion period would have been purely coincidental. The Agency\u2019s response is that the claim form follows the procedure approved in <em>Consumer Publishing, </em>304 Md. at 781, 501 A.2d at 74. There is, however, a significant difference between the advertising scheme in <em>Consumer Publishing </em>and that in the matter at hand. There the diet pills were available only through mail order so that reliance on the seller\u2019s advertising was inherent to a great degree in customer purchases. Here, purchases by those who did not rely on the ad at all should, in effect, be excluded from the award by determining the extent of unjust enrichment derived from increased sales of $200 or more.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">On remand, the agency should delete from its order the provision alternatively requiring Luskin\u2019s to furnish airline tickets. Like the requirement that Luskin\u2019s pay 100% of the retail value of airline tickets, the provision exceeds any unjust enrichment to Luskin\u2019s. Indeed, both the monetary and the specific performance relief in the Agency\u2019s order could be viewed as punitive, but, if the Agency seeks a punitive assessment, it is to be accomplished by invoking the civil penalty provisions under \u00a7 13-410 or criminal penalties under \u00a7 13-411. <em>See Golt, </em>308 Md. at 12, 517 A.2d at 333. A further deficiency in the specific performance alternative is that accommodating customer convenience makes administration of the cease and desist order so complex that court imposed sanctions for contempt based on alleged violations of the order are not realistic.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Further, on remand, the Agency will strike the provision that Luskin\u2019s pay to customers the amount paid by customers to WI for other than accommodations. These monies were not received by Luskin\u2019s. Any benefit to Luskin\u2019s is embodied in net profits that are to be disgorged as unjust enrichment. The Agency argues that this provision in its order is like the direction to refund redemption fees charged to obtain prizes that was approved in <em>Consumer Protection Div. v. Outdoor World, Corp., </em>91 Md.App. at 293, 603 A.2d at 1385. That was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>a directive, however, issued to an advertiser-seller who had received the redemption fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.

The section deals with conciliation. It provides that the Agency \u201cshall ... attempt to conciliate the matter\u201d of a violation, unless \u201cviolations are occurring which are causing immediate, substantial and irreparable injury.\u201d \u00a7 13\u2014402(a)(1) and (2). If the circumstances of the violations are the latter, \u201cthe Attorney General may seek an ex parte or interlocutory injunction pursuant to \u00a7 13-406, without first attempting conciliation.\u201d Subsection (b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-8\">\u201c(1) A written assurance of discontinuance, settlement agreement, or any cease and desist order provided for by this subtitle may include a stipulation or condition for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOx\">\u201c(i) The payment by the violator or alleged violator of the cost of investigation by the Division; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmD\">\u201c(ii) The restitution by the violator or alleged violator to the consumer of money, property, or nay other thing re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>ceived from the consumer in connection with a violation or alleged violation of this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-4\"><em>\u201c(2) </em>These stipulations and conditions do not preclude the Division from using any other stipulation, condition, or remedy necessary to correct a violation of this title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The Agency contends that the reference in (b)(2) to \u201cany other ... remedy necessary to correct a violation\u201d authorizes the Agency to order Luskin\u2019s to purchase airline tickets for, or pay the price of airline tickets to, each qualifying customer. Subsection (b)(2) makes it clear that there may be \u201cstipulation[s and] condition[s]\u201d that resolve part of a controversy between the Agency and an alleged violator, and that the Agency remains free to pursue \u201cany other ... remedy\u201d with respect fo disputed aspects of the matter. Subsection (b)(2), however, should be read to mean any other statutorily conferred remedy. Simply as a matter of drafting it would be unusual to confer an open-ended power to order any relief, including monetary relief, \u201cnecessary to correct a violation,\u201d in a section primarily dealing with conciliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">We also point out that nothing in our opinion directs how distribution is to be made of the amount to be disgorged by Luskin\u2019s under the principle of unjust enrichment. Nothing in our opinion requires a per capita distribution of the amount to be paid by Luskin\u2019s or prevents the creation of equitable classes of distributees, including conferring priority on those consumers who paid the $15 per person, nonrefundable processing fee to WI.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b391-7\">.
