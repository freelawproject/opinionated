Upon a motion by the State and based upon the intermediate appellate court\u2019s determination that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter because, in its view, the circuit court had improperly granted the petition for writ of error <em>coram nobis, </em>the Court of Special Appeals dismissed petitioner\u2019s belated appeal. We granted certiorari to address that dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">We shall vacate the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 dismissal and remand the matter to that court to address the issues raised by petitioner in his belated criminal appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-12\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b154-13\">Petitioner was involved in an automobile accident in Cumberland, Maryland, on November 25, 1993. According to Mary O\u2019Neal, her car was struck by a car occupied by petitioner and his mother. O\u2019Neal testified that petitioner was the driver of the car and petitioner\u2019s mother was the passenger. After the accident, petitioner\u2019s mother urged O\u2019Neal not to contact the police to report the accident. The police were called and when they arrived, it was learned that petitioner\u2019s driver\u2019s license was suspended. Petitioner told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>the state trooper that his mother had been the driver. Both petitioner and his mother testified at trial that she was driving the car when the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Petitioner was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Allegany County of driving while suspended and knowingly giving false accident report information to a police officer. He was convicted separately by the court of failure to yield the right of way. Petitioner was sentenced to consecutive terms of sixty days and one year in the Allegany County Detention Center, plus a fine of fifty dollars and two years of unsupervised probation following his release from custody. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed petitioner\u2019s convictions in an unreported opinion, filed April 25, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">After the intermediate appellate court affirmed petitioner\u2019s convictions, he filed a motion for new trial on June 22,1995, on the ground of newly discovered evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The motion was denied following a hearing on September 20, 1995, at which petitioner appeared without counsel. Petitioner appealed, and the Court of Special Appeals vacated that denial in an unreported opinion, filed June 12, 1996. That court held the trial court inadequately inquired into petitioner\u2019s waiver of counsel and remanded the matter to the circuit court for a new hearing on the motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Pursuant to the remand by the Court of Special Appeals, the circuit court held another hearing on the motion for new trial on December 5, 1996, but held its decision <em>mb curia. </em>The next day, the court issued a memorandum opinion and order denying the motion. Evidently, the court clerk failed to send a copy of the order to both petitioner and the State\u2019s Attorney. Petitioner became aware of the court\u2019s action after the thirty-day period for filing a timely appeal expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">On March 18, 1997, petitioner filed a motion for a belated appeal of the trial court\u2019s December 6, 1996, denial of his motion for a new trial. The circuit court denied petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>motion for a belated appeal on March 25, 1997. Petitioner sought reconsideration of the order denying his motion for a belated appeal on April 1, 1997, which was denied on April 17, 1997. Petitioner also filed a motion for reconsideration of the denial of his motion for new trial on April 1, which the court similarly denied on April 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Petitioner then filed in the circuit court a Petition for Writ of Error <em>Coram Nobis </em>on May 2, 1997, requesting as relief a belated appeal of the December 6, 1996, denial of his motion for a new trial. This petition was assigned a civil (\u201cMisc.\u201d) case number, and was dealt with as a civil matter. The circuit court, sitting as a civil court, issued the writ on May 30, 1997, granting petitioner a belated appeal of the denial of his motion for a new trial in his original criminal case. The State did not appeal from the circuit court\u2019s grant of the Writ of Error <em>Coram Nobis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Petitioner noted a belated appeal in the criminal case on June 4,1997, pursuant to the leave granted by the writ.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court of Special Appeals, upon a motion by the State, dismissed the appeal in a reported opinion, holding that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal because the circuit court improperly issued the writ of error <em>coram nobis. </em>This Court issued a writ of certiorari on August 26, 1998. Because the Court of Special Appeals considered and decided the wrong case, we shall, as we have indicated, vacate its judgment and order that court to consider the question properly raised by petitioner in his belated appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">II. Discussion and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">A writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>is a common law tool primarily used to correct factual errors by a court. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Court has discussed its use and application many times. Judge Delaplaine described the writ most thoroughly in <em>Madison v. State, </em>205 Md. 425, 432, 109 A.2d 96, 99 (1954):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbT\">At common law the ancient writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>has been available to correct errors of fact. It has been allowed, without limitation of time, for facts affecting the validity and regularity of the judgment, and has been used in both civil and criminal cases. While the occasions for its use have been infrequent, no one has doubted its availability. It is still available in Maryland in both civil and criminal cases.... <em>[C]oram nobis </em>will not lie (1) to correct an issue of fact which has been adjudicated, even though wrongly determined, or (2) to determine whether any witnesses testified falsely at the trial, or (3) to present newly discovered evidence, or (4) to strike out a conviction on the ground that the prosecuting witness was mistaken in his identification of the accused as the person who committed the crime. The purpose of the writ is to bring before the court facts which were not brought into issue at the trial of the case, and which were'material to the validity and regularity of the proceedings, and which, if known by the court, would have prevented the judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-5\"><em>See also Johnson v. State, </em>215 Md. 333, 336, 138 A.2d 372, 373 (1958); <em>Bernard v. State, </em>193 Md. 1, 3-4, 65 A.2d 297, 298 (1949); <em>Keane v. State, </em>164 Md. 685, 689-93, 166 A. 410, 411-13 (1933); <em>Hawks v. State, </em>162 Md. 30, 31-32, 157 A. 900, 901 (1932); <em>Jones v. State, </em>114 Md.App. 471, 475, 691 A.2d 229, 230-31, <em>cert. denied, </em>346 Md. 27, 694 A.2d 950, <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 118 S.Ct. 304, 139 L.Ed.2d 234 (1997). <em>See also United States v. Morgan, </em>346 U.S. 502, 507-08, 74 S.Ct. 247, 250-51, 98 L.Ed. 248 (1954). Because Maryland adopted the Common Law of England as it existed on July 4, 1776, subject to constitutional conflict, legislative amendment, or modification by this Court, <em>see </em>Md. Declaration of Rights, Art. 5(a), the common law writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>is a procedure still available in this State. We expressly recognized its use and availability in <em>Madison, </em>205 Md. at 432, 109 A.2d at 99. The usefulness of the writ of error <em>coram nobis </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>has been diminished, however, to some extent, by the Post Conviction Procedure Act (the Act).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">A writ of error <em>coram nobis, </em>like a habeas corpus proceeding and a proceeding under the Act, still may be used to collaterally challenge a criminal judgment. We have said: \u201cA defendant who is prevented from challenging the constitutionality of a prior conviction ... is not thereby divested of an opportunity for relief. That defendant may thereafter mount <em>a collateral challenge </em>by any means that remain available, including ... error <em>coram </em>nobis____\u201d <em>Fairbanks v. State, </em>331 Md. 482, 492-93, 629 A.2d 63, 68 (1993) (some emphasis added; footnote omitted). We also noted in <em>Fairbanks </em>that \u201c[t]he writ of error <em>coram nobis, </em>addressed to the court that entered judgment, may be available to the defendant who is no longer in custody.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 492 n. 3, 629 A.2d at 68 n. 3. <em>See also Gluckstern v. Sutton, </em>319 Md. 634, 662, 574 A.2d 898, 912 (describing the Post Conviction Procedure Act as a statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>substitute, under most circumstances, for the collateral common law remedies of habeas corpus and writ of error <em>coram </em>nobis), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 950, 111 S.Ct. 369, 112 L.Ed.2d 331 (1990); <em>Jones, </em>114 Md.App. at 478, 691 A.2d at 232 (explaining that a \u201cwrit of error coram nobis remains available ... as a remedy to mount a collateral attack upon a prior conviction or sentence.\u201d). <em>Cf. Blizzard v. State, </em>218 Md. 384, 388-89 &amp; n. 3, 147 A.2d 227, 229-30 &amp; n. 3 (1958) (noting overlap of the Act and Defective Delinquent Law, which was a civil proceeding, and similarity between the Act and former habeas corpus cases, which were civil in nature); <em>Roberts v. Director of Patuxent Institution, </em>226 Md. 643, 652, 172 A.2d 880, 885 (1961) (noting <em>Blizzard </em>analogy and holding post conviction procedures were not appropriate because applicant was not attacking validity of sentence; rather, habeas corpus or other collateral proceedings would be proper).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">A collateral challenge, by its very nature, is a separate and distinct civil procedure by which a defendant may challenge his or her conviction, sentence, or imprisonment. <em>See State Bar Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Kerr, </em>272 Md. 687, 689-90, 326 A.2d 180, 181 (1974) (noting, in discussing the concept of final judgments, that the federal post conviction act, \u201clike its Maryland counterpart, the Post Conviction Procedure Act (Maryland Code (1957, 1971 Repl.VoL), Art. 27, \u00a7 645A <em>et seq.), </em>does not constitute a part of the original criminal cause, but is an independent and collateral civil inquiry into the validity of the conviction and sentence.\u201d). Because collateral challenges are separate from the underlying judgment, the filing of such an action typically initiates an entirely new action in which the defendant sets forth his or her claims. If the defendant prevails in the civil court where he or she sought collateral relief, that court then issues the writ directing the criminal court pursuant to the terms of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">At common law, a proceeding on a writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>was a civil matter proeedurally independent of the underlying judgment being contested. <em>See United States v. Hayman, </em>342 U.S. 205, 221 n. 36, 72 S.Ct. 263, 273 n. 36, 96 L.Ed. 232 (1952) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>(explaining that the Reviser\u2019s Note to the federal post conviction statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (1995), which stated that section 2255 was \u201cin the nature of\u2019 a writ of error <em>coram nobis, </em>meant that \u201ca Section 2255 proceeding, like <em>coram nobis, </em>is an independent action brought in the court that entered judgment.\u201d); <em>State v. King, </em>191 Kan. 318, 319, 380 P.2d 325, 326 (1963) (recognizing that under the common law, applications for writs of error <em>coram nobis </em>were civil in character); <em>State v. Turner, 194 </em>Neb. 252, 256, 231 N.W.2d 345, 349 (1975) (noting that at common law, a proceeding on a writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>was a civil matter); <em>People v. Holland, </em>27 Misc.2d 345, 345, 209 N.Y.S.2d 58, 59 (1960) (noting that a writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>was, at common law, a civil proceeding), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>13 A.D.2d 518, 212 N.Y.S.2d 569 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Most other jurisdictions agree that a proceeding on a writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>remains a civil matter independent of the underlying case even though its resolution may affect the underlying case. <em>See generally Ex parte Wilson, </em>275 Ala. 439, 440, 155 So.2d 611, 612 (1963) (\u201cCoram nobis proceedings are essentially civil in nature____\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Cutsinger v. Spencer, </em>219 Ind. 148, 155, 41 N.E.2d 601, 603 (1941) (\u201c[T]he petition <em>for </em>the writ <em>of error coram nobis </em>must be considered a new proceeding, civil in nature____\u201d); <em>State v.

Sirles, </em>267 S.W.2d 66, 66 (Ky.1953) (\u201cProceedings on coram nobis are essentially a civil action____\u201d); <em>State v. Smith, </em>324 S.W.2d 707, 711-12 (Mo.1959) (\u201cWrits of error coram nobis ..., like habeas corpus proceedings, are in their nature civil rather than criminal proceedings.\u201d); <em>State v.

Some courts have held that although the <em>coram nobis </em>proceeding is collateral to the underlying criminal matter, it is not an independent civil action. <em>See generally Dwyer v. State, </em>151 Me. 382, 393, 120 A.2d 276, 283 (1956) (holding that a proceeding on a writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>is part of the underlying criminal matter); <em>State v.

Cooper, </em>876 F.2d 1192, 1194 (5th Cir.1989), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Smith v. Barry, </em>502 U.S. 244, 112 S.Ct. 678, 116 L.Ed.2d 678 (1992), <em>United States v.

Hanks, </em>340 F.Supp. 625, 626 (D.Kan.1972) (all holding that a proceeding on a writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>is a step in the criminal proceeding, not an independent civil action). Commentators<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>note that the split among the federal circuits, to some extent, has been caused by footnote four in <em>Morgan, </em>346 U.S. at 505 n. 4, 74 S.Ct. at 249 n. 4, 98 L.Ed. 248. That opinion has been characterized as resurrecting, \u201cphoenix-like from the ashes of American jurisprudence,\u201d petitions for writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>in federal criminal causes under the authority of the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a) (1994). <em>Balistrieri, </em>606 F.2d at 219. Footnote four reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aey\">Such a motion [on writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>] is a step in the criminal case and not like habeas corpus where relief is sought in a separate case and record, the beginning of a separate civil proceeding. While at common law the writ of error coram nobis was issued out of chancery like other writs, the procedure by motion in the case is now the accepted American practice. As it is such a step, we do not think that Rule 60(b), Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., expressly abolishing the writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>in civil cases, applies. This motion is of the same general character as one under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-6\"><em>Morgan, </em>346 U.S. at 505 n. 4, 74 S.Ct. at 249 n. 4, 98 L.Ed. 248 (citations omitted). The paradox in the footnote is that the Supreme Court first contrasted a writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>with a habeas corpus proceeding, which is historically a separate civil procedure, but then in the same footnote likened the writ to a civil post conviction action under section 2255. Courts holding that a writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>is a separate civil proceeding reason that the Supreme Court meant to distinguish <em>coram nobis </em>proceedings from habeas corpus proceedings because, although not an entirely new civil proceeding like habeas corpus proceedings, \u201ca coram nobis motion is a step in a criminal proceeding yet is, at the same time, civil in nature and subject to the civil rules of procedure,\u201d as are the post conviction proceedings under section 2255. <em>Balistrieri, </em>606 F.2d at 221; <em>see also Cooper, </em>876 F.2d at 1194. Courts holding alternatively follow the interpretation that footnote four meant to convey that writs of error <em>coram nobis </em>were to be construed only as steps within the same criminal case. <em>See Yasui, </em>772 F.2d at 1499. Notwithstanding any disagreements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>among the courts of the federal circuits, no confusion as to the nature of a writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>exists in this jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">As we have noted, this State adopted England\u2019s common law, subject to constitutional conflict, legislative change, or judicial modification. For various reasons, the General Assembly limited the right to appeal in common law habeas corpus and <em>coram nobis </em>proceedings for defendants who are in custody or on probation when it adopted the Post Conviction Procedure Act. <em>Gluckstem, </em>319 Md. at 658, 574 A.2d at 908. We have noted, however, that the Act is not a substitute for common law remedies when, for example, the defendant <em>is not in custody or on probation or parole. See Fairbanks, </em>331 Md. at 492 n. 3, 629 A.2d at 68 n. 3. The original common law remedies with their common law attributes continue to be viable. In that regard, a writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>remains a civil matter in Maryland, independent of the underlying action from which it arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Turning to the case at hand, petitioner\u2019s original criminal trial, subsequent motion for new trial, and the belated appeal of the denial of petitioner\u2019s last Motion for New Trial all were part of the criminal case, Case Number 5337 C.A., in the Circuit Court for Allegany County. When petitioner filed his Petition for Writ of Error <em>Coram Nobis, </em>a new case file was opened because such a petition creates a separate civil action collateral to the underlying criminal matter. The petition proceeded under Case Number 3320 Misc., a civil case number, and the writ was granted under that case number. The grant of the writ in the civil case directed the criminal court to afford petitioner permission to file a belated appeal in the criminal case. Petitioner then filed a notice of appeal in the present criminal case. The State, however, had failed to file any appeal of the grant of the writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>in the civil case. That decision, therefore, is final. The correctness of the trial court\u2019s grant of the writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>was, after the time for appeal had passed, no longer appeal-able.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>As we have noted, instead of appealing from the grant of the writ of error <em>coram nobis, </em>the State attempted to challenge the grant of the writ by filing a motion to dismiss in petitioner\u2019s belated criminal appeal with the Court of Special Appeals. That motion was based upon the State\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in granting the writ of error <em>coram nobis. </em>The State thus was using a motion to dismiss a criminal appeal to attack a judgment rendered in a civil case. The Court of Special Appeals, nonetheless, granted the State\u2019s motion, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">\u2022 The trial court\u2019s grant of a writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>was inappropriate because the error [petitioner] relies upon to validate the issuance of the writ does not relate to any fact not known at either the hearing on his motion for new trial or at [petitioner's original trial that would have affected the entry of judgment. The indirect and ultimate purpose of [petitioner]^ efforts is to place \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d before the court and to correct an adjudicated issue of \u201cfact\u201d that [petitioner] believes has been wrongly decided. A writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>does not he for such purposes. Hence, we are without jurisdiction to entertain any arguments [petitioner] might have raised by the grace of that writ.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-6\"><em>Ruby v. State, </em>121 Md.App. 168, 177, 708 A.2d 1080, 1084 (1998). The Court of Special Appeals determined it did not have jurisdiction to entertain the belated appeal granted petitioner pursuant to the writ of error <em>coram nobis. </em>Because that specific issue (the propriety of the grant of the writ) was not before it, the Court of Special Appeals erred. The only issues the intermediate appehate court should have decided were those pertaining to petitioner\u2019s appeal of the trial court\u2019s December 6, 1996, denial of his motion for a new trial in the criminal case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>The State\u2019s motion to dismiss petitioner\u2019s appeal is where the confusion began. As we have noted, there is no record in the docket entries noting an appeal of the trial court\u2019s grant of the petition for writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>in the civil proceeding. Maryland Rule 8-202(a) mandates that a \u201cnotice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order from which the appeal is taken.\u201d Failure of an aggrieved party to so file terminates its right of appeal and the appellate court acquires no jurisdiction to hear that matter. <em>See Houghton v. County Comm\u2019rs, </em>305 Md. 407, 413, 504 A.2d 1145, 1148 (1986). Therefore, because the State failed to appeal the final order of the circuit court issuing the writ of error <em>coram nobis, </em>the Court of Special Appeals did not have jurisdiction to address the propriety of that final civil order even in that civil case. Moreover, it had no jurisdiction to consider the propriety of the grant of the civil writ in petitioner\u2019s belated appeal of the denial of his motion for a new trial in the criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The Court of Special Appeals did not have jurisdiction to determine the propriety of the trial court\u2019s grant of the petition for writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>because the State did not note an appeal of the grant of that petition. We shall vacate the judgment of the intermediate appellate court and order it to consider on remand the issues raised by petitioner on belated appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS IN THIS COURT TO BE PAID BY ALLEGANY COUNTY; COSTS IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO ABIDE THE RESULT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-9\">. The newly discovered evidence was a report by Nationwide Insurance Company, petitioner\u2019s mother\u2019s insurer, that named petitioner\u2019s mother as the driver of the car when the accident occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b156-9\">. The question petitioner presented to the Court of Special Appeals in his belated appeal was: \"Did the trial court abuse its discretion by denying the motion for new trial?\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b156-10\">. We are cognizant that the Court of Special Appeals discussed the issues raised by petitioner as dictum in its opinion. A remand is necessary because it was dictum, not the holding in the case. We do not, in this proceeding, address the conclusions reached in the dictum.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b158-8\">. The Post Conviction Procedure Act, Maryland Code (1958, 1996 Repl.Vol., 1998 Cum.Supp.), Article 27, section 645A, was enacted in 1958 \"to create a simple statutory procedure, in place of the common law habeas corpus and coram nobis remedies, for collateral attacks upon criminal convictions and sentences.\" <em>Gluckstern v. Sutton, </em>319 Md. 634, 658, 574 A.2d 898, 909, <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 950, 111 S.Ct. 369, 112 L.Ed.2d 331 (1990). The Act did not abolish appeals in habeas corpus proceedings, however. In 1965, the Legislature added new language to the Act in subsection (e), which this Court has interpreted as allowing appeals from habeas corpus cases \"[i)n situations where the Post Conviction Procedure Act did not provide a remedy, and thus was not a substitute for habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 662, 574 A.2d at 912. The Act does not provide a remedy, for example, when the defendant is not incarcerated or subject to parole or probation. <em>See Fairbanks v. State, </em>331 Md. 482, 492 n. 3, 629 A.2d 63, 68 n. 3 (1993) (\"Post-conviction and habeas corpus remedies are available only if the defendant is in custody or subject to conditions of parole or probation.\u201d (citing <em>McMannis v. State, </em>311 Md. 534, 539-47, 536 A.2d 652, 654-58 (1988))). The Court of Special Appeals extended this reasoning to <em>coram nobis </em>cases and determined that the right of appeal in <em>coram nobis </em>actions survived the adoption of section 645A(e) of Article 27. <em>See Jones, </em>114 Md.App. at 478, 691 A.2d at 232. This Court has yet to address the correctness of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 \u25a0decision in <em>Jones </em>and we do not do so now because, as we shall explain, the issue is not properly before us as it was not properly before the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b161-6\">. <em>See, e.g., </em>Brendan W.

As we have indicated, the Court of Special Appeals referred to the denial of the motion for a new trial issue in dictum after dismissing the appeal pursuant to the State\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal, stating what it would do if that issue were before it. On remand, it shall have the opportunity to address the issue\u2014and determine it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
