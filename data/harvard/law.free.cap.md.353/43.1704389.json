We conclude that the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction over attorney\u2019s fees under Maryland Code (1991 Repl.Vol.), Labor and Employment Article, \u00a7 9-731 is not exclusive where the Commission rendered a decision approving the appropriate fee for legal services and the dispute involves an alleged contract about how that fee subsequently should be divided among attorneys who claim a portion of the fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The basic facts in this case are not contested. The dispute is between two law firms over the division of $12,500 in attorney\u2019s fees approved by the Commission in 1995. The Commission\u2019s approval related to the $200,000 settlement of a claim filed on behalf of Vonnie Colson, an employee of Owens-Corning Fiberglass, for work-related injuries to his back.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Both Appellant and Appellee represented Colson in pursuit of his claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits before the Commission during the years 1989 to 1995. Appellant Engel &amp; Engel, P.A. (Engel) represented Colson from 1989 to 1992. In 1992, Colson discharged Engel and retained Ingerman &amp; Horwitz (Ingerman), the Appellee in this case, as new counsel. The evidence of the alleged fee-sharing contract is based on a letter sent by Engel on December 3, 1992, to Ingerman. The letter mentions Engel\u2019s transfer of Colson\u2019s file to Ingerman and purports to confirm an agreement between the two law firms of a 50-50 division of attorney\u2019s fees generated as a result of Colson\u2019s claim. In relevant part, the letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-8\">\u201cIt is my understanding that due [to] the extensive work undertaken by our office in these matters, you have agreed to split any fees recovered in these matters on a 50-50 basis. You have also agreed to reimburse our office for the expenses incurred in the appeal that was tried before the Circuit Court for Baltimore City as it relates to [Colson\u2019s] injury. Our expenses for same total $116.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>On January 27,1993, in apparent response to Engel\u2019s letter, Ingerman sent Engel a check for the $116.00 in expenses. A brief letter sent with the check did not dispute the terms of Engel\u2019s December 3 letter. Ingerman then served as Colson\u2019s counsel until the settlement was reached in 1995. While Ingerman was retained as Colson\u2019s counsel, Philip Sturman was responsible for most of the work on the Colson case. Sturman\u2019s work on the case initially took place as an employee of Ingerman but later, after he left the firm to begin a solo practice, as a subcontractor to Ingerman pursuant to a written agreement under the terms of which Sturman was paid an hourly rate. Sturman submitted to Ingerman monthly bills for his work, which Ingerman paid. Sturman was the individual ultimately responsible for negotiating the settlement with Owens-Corning.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">After the settlement was reached, Ingerman submitted a petition, drafted by Sturman, to the Commission for attorney\u2019s fees totaling $12,500, which were approved. Engel then sought 50 percent, or $6,250, of the fees pursuant to the agreement stated in his December 3,1992, letter. Engel filed suit in the District Court of Maryland sitting in Baltimore City after Ingerman refused Engel\u2019s repeated demands for $6,250. The District Court denied Ingerman\u2019s motion for summary judgment, which contended that the court had no jurisdiction to hear a case concerning attorney\u2019s fees arising out of a workers\u2019 compensation claim. Based on testimony from witnesses for both parties, the District Court judge, Alan M. Resnick, concluded that the correspondence indicated that a 50-50 fee-sharing agreement had been reached and entered a judgment on the merits for Engel for $6,250 plus costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">On Ingerman\u2019s appeal, the circuit court reversed the District Court\u2019s decision without reaching the merits of Engel\u2019s claim. The circuit court found that, although no cases addressed Ingerman\u2019s jurisdictional defense, \u201cthe language ... in the various cases appears to suggest that the legislative policy [requiring Commission approval of attorney\u2019s fees related to claims before the Commission] is an all encompassing preemption of the field of attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d That court there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>fore concluded as a matter of law that the District Court had no jurisdiction to entertain Engel\u2019s suit and that Engel should seek recovery at the Commission. The jurisdictional issue is now before us on certiorari review from the circuit court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We will provide more facts as necessary in the analysis that follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The statute conferring jurisdiction on the Commission over attorney\u2019s fees, Md.Code (1991 RepLVoL), Labor and Employment Art., \u00a7 9-731,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-8\">\u201c(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014(1) Unless approved by the Commission, a person may not charge or collect a fee for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-9\">(i) legal services in connection with a claim under this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-10\">(ii) medical services, supplies, or treatment provided under Subtitle 6, Part IX of this title; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-11\">(in) funeral expenses under Subtitle 6, Part XIII of this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-12\">(2) When the Commission approves a fee, the fee is a lien on the compensation awarded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-13\">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2) of this subsection, a fee shall be paid from an award of compensation only in the manner set by the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-14\">(e) <em>Attorney\u2019s fees\u2014Administrative </em>review.\u2014On application of a party, the Commission may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>(1) hear and decide any question concerning legal services performed in connection with a claim; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-5\">(2) order a person who received a fee for legal services to refund to the payer any part of the fee that the Commission may find to be excessive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-6\">(d) <em>Same\u2014Enforcement and </em>appeal.\u2014An order of the Commission regulating payment or refund of payment for legal services may be enforced or appealed in the same manner as a compensation award.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">The attorney\u2019s fee provisions were originally enacted in 1957 as \u00a7 57 of Article 101 and their recodification as \u00a7 9-731 occurred in 1991 without any substantive changes relevant here. As a result, throughout this opinion our references to Maryland Code (1957, 1964 Repl.Vol., 1977 Cum.Supp.), Article 101, \u00a7 57 should be viewed as synonymous with \u00a7 9-731.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">In the typical workers\u2019 compensation case, the Commission will approve the legal fee for the attorney\u2019s work upon approving an award to a worker-claimant. For guidance as to the appropriate fee, the Commission has promulgated a schedule of fees. Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 14.09.01.25. The schedule establishes maximum amounts for attorney\u2019s fees based on the extent of the disability and the amount of the award. <em>Id. </em>The regulations also allow for a claimant\u2019s attorney to file a petition with the Commission for a fee in excess of the fee schedule. COMAR 14.09.01.24(B)(describing necessary contents of petition); COMAR 14.09.01.25(B)(2)(stating that the Commission \u201cmay approve an attorney\u2019s fee in excess of the limits set forth in this section only if exceptional circumstances are shown\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">In one of our leading cases interpreting Md.Code (1957, 1964 Repl.Vol., 1977 Cum.Supp.), Art. 101, \u00a7 57, <em>Feissner v. Prince George\u2019s Co., </em>282 Md. 413, 384 A.2d 742 (1978), we addressed how an award of attorney\u2019s fees under that section operates as a lien on the claimant\u2019s recovery. The appellant in <em>Feissner </em>served as an attorney for individual claimants and was awarded attorney\u2019s fees by the Commission. Prince George\u2019s County, the employer, refused to pay the fees be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>cause of the statutory offset provisions that then applied under former Md.Code (1957, 1964 Repl.Vol., 1977 Cum. Supp.), Art. 101, \u00a7 33(c) and (d), which limited a claimant\u2019s' recovery when the claimant\u2019s pension or other benefits exceeded the compensation benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The circuit court ordered the County to pay the attorney\u2019s fees, and the County appealed. The Court of Special Appeals reversed the circuit court, holding that the offset provisions of \u00a7 33 extinguished the compensation award granted by the Commission and precluded the creation of the lien on the compensation benefits for payment of legal fees. We affirmed, holding that when the Commission approves attorney\u2019s fees under Md.Code (1957, 1964 Repl.Vol., 1977 Cum.Supp.), Art. 101, \u00a7 57, the award operates as a lien on the worker\u2019s claim and is not a separate cost to be paid by the employer. <em>Feissner, </em>282 Md. at 418-19, 384 A.2d at 745-45. <em>See also </em>\u00a7 9-731(a)(2)(\u201cWhen the Commission approves a fee, the fee is a lien on the compensation awarded.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">We explained in <em>Feissner </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">\u201c[U]nder the Maryland statutory scheme, the payment of legal fees does not become an independent obligation of the employer or his insurer, but instead remains at all times the personal responsibility of the claimant. Thus legal fees are not among the enumerated benefits available to the claimant from his employer under the workmen\u2019s compensation laws of this state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">282 Md. at 418, 384 A.2d at 745. <em>See also Chanticleer Skyline Rm. v. Greer, </em>271 Md. 693, 700, 319 A.2d 802, 806 (1974)(ex-plaining that the attorney\u2019s fee provision does not operate as an add-on to the compensation award that the employer must pay, but instead provides that \u201ca single award of compensation is made\u201d to the claimant). Thus, our cases clearly establish that, under \u00a7 9-731, the claimant remains responsible for the attorney\u2019s fees generated in pursuing his or her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Because this case requires us to determine the reach of the statute conferring jurisdiction to the Commission over attorney\u2019s fees, we pause here to examine the context of that statute and the objectives the legislature sought to achieve through its enactment. As we observed in <em>Kaczorowski v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 525 A.2d 628 (1987), when interpreting statutory language the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">\u201clegislative purpose is critical, that purpose must be discerned in light of context, and that \u2018statutes are to be construed reasonably with reference to the purpose to be accomplished.... \u2019 The purpose, in short, determined in light of the statute\u2019s context, is the key.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">309 Md. at 516, 525 A.2d at 633 (quoting <em>Potter v. Bethesda Fire Dep\u2019t, </em>309 Md. 347, 353, 524 A.2d 61, 64 (1987), in turn quoting <em>State v. Fabritz, </em>276 Md. 416, 421, 348 A.2d 275, 278 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 942, 96 S.Ct. 1680, 48 L.Ed.2d 185 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">We previously have observed that the legislative act creating the Commission was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\">\u201cdesigned to protect workers and their families from hardships inflicted by work-related injuries. More particularly, it is designed to provide workers with compensation for loss of earning capacity resulting from accidental injury, disease or death arising out of and in the course of employment, to provide vocational rehabilitation, and to provide adequate medical services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-10\"><em>Queen v. Agger, </em>287 Md. 342, 343, 412 A.2d 733, 734 (1980). It is in light of the legislature\u2019s goal of adequately compensating injured workers that we must interpret the attorney\u2019s fee provision of \u00a7 9-731.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">As in litigation generally, in a workers\u2019 compensation case the party seeking compensation is responsible for his or her own attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See supra </em>Part II. A. Since workers\u2019 compensation law is designed to provide financial assistance to the injured or disabled worker in lieu of lost wages, the legislature recognized that the purpose of the law would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>be subverted if a worker\u2019s recovery were dissipated as a result of excessive fees incurred in recovering the compensation. As Professor Larson has observed, when the general rule that a party must pay his or her own legal fees</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agx\">\u201cis superimposed upon a closely calculated system of wage-loss benefits, a serious question arises whether the social objectives of the legislation may to some extent be thwarted. The benefit scales are so tailored as to cover only the minimum support of the claimant during disability. There is nothing to indicate that the framers of the benefit rates included any padding to take care of legal and other expenses incurred in obtaining the award.\u201d (Footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">3 Arthur Larson, Larson\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7 83.11, at 15-1271 (1989). <em>See also Chanticleer Skyline Rm., supra. </em>Thus, in <em>Feissner </em>we recognized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AF\">\u201ca serious risk exists that the purpose of the compensation award will be frustrated if benefits are exhausted by payment of excessive legal fees. Consequently, the primary function of [Md.Code (1957, 1964 Repl.Vol., 1977 Cum. Supp.), Art. 101,] \u00a7 57 is to protect against this possibility by authorizing the Commission to adopt appropriate safeguards.\u201d (Footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">282 Md. at 418, 384 A.2d at 746. Similarly, in <em>Chanticleer Skyline Rm., </em>we observed that the provision for attorney\u2019s fees is intended to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">\u201cprohibit the dissipation of an employee\u2019s compensation through the payment of excessive legal fees out of the award by giving the Commission the power to regulate when and how much remuneration an attorney who represents a claimant in [workers\u2019] compensation litigation is to receive from the employee for legal services rendered to him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">271 Md. at 699-700, 319 A.2d at 805. <em>See also Stevens v. Rite-Aid, </em>340 Md. 555, 564 n. 10, 667 A.2d 642, 646-47 n. 10 (1995)(quoting <em>Chanticleer Skyline Rm.); cf. Queen, </em>287 Md. at 344, 412 A.2d at 734 (holding that a health care provider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>may not enforce a contract the \u201cresult of which is to require an eligible injured employee to pay an amount greater than the amount approved by the Commission and paid by the employer or its insurer for services which the Commission requires the employer to provide\u201d). Therefore, consistent with the purpose of workers\u2019 compensation law generally, a primary objective behind the attorney\u2019s fee provision is to afford workers some degree of protection that their compensation will not be unduly diminished by excessive costs associated with obtaining recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">While claimants must be protected from exorbitant legal fees, there also exists a need to ensure that workers are able to obtain competent counsel to pursue their claims. Attorney\u2019s fees should not be so large as to be excessive, but they also should not be so low as to make representing claimants undesirable to the legal practitioner. 3 Arthur Larson, Larson\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7 83.16, at 15-1347-1349 (1989)(stating that attorney\u2019s fees may not be fixed so low as to deny claimants\u2019 effective legal representation). <em>See also Mitchell v. Goodyear Service Store, </em>63 Md.App. 426, 434, 492 A.2d 984, 988 (1985)( \u201c[T]he Commission may not set fees so cheeseparingly as to deprive claimants of the practical ability to obtain competent counsel.\u201d), <em>aff'd </em>306 Md. 27, 506 A.2d 1178 (1986); <em>City of Baltimore v. Bowen, </em>54 Md.App. 375, 386, 458 A.2d 1242, 1249 (1983)(same). If the. legislature itself had inflexibly established attorney\u2019s fees for workers\u2019 compensation cases through statutory enactment, a risk would have been created that the fees would be set too low so as to deny workers adequate legal representation. Thus, the legislature sought to balance the need to protect claimants from excessive legal fees against the need of workers to retain competent legal representation to pursue their claims. The delegation to an administrative agency with special expertise in the law of workers\u2019 compensation, <em>ie., </em>the Commission, was the best way to effectuate the balance of these potentially conflicting goals. Thus, the legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>granted the Commission broad authority over attorney\u2019s fees in workers\u2019 compensation cases, including the power to promulgate rules governing such fees. <em>See </em>\u00a7 9-309(a)(granting the Commission the power to \u201cadopt regulations\u201d in furtherance of its statutory mandates); <em>Feissner, </em>282 Md. at 418, 384 A.2d at 746 (discussing the Commission\u2019s broad authority to set attorney\u2019s fees); <em>Edmond v. Ten Trex, </em>83 Md.App. 573, 581, 575 A.2d 1267, 1270-71 (1990)(discussing the Commission\u2019s power to promulgate regulations). Furthermore, the Commission has relatively greater flexibility than the legislature for responding to the changing economic circumstances by lessening or increasing the attorney\u2019s compensation. The Commission has authority to modify its fee schedule, and its current fee schedule, which spans four pages of COMAE, gives the agency wide latitude in determining the appropriate fee size depending on the nature of the claim. COMAE 14.09.01.25. The agency is therefore uniquely positioned to conduct the delicate balance of protecting claimants and assuring adequate compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The role of the courts with respect to Commission-approved fees is much more limited. The courts retain a supervisory role over the Commission\u2019s approval of legal fees to guard against agency abuses of discretion and arbitrariness, but the courts may not substitute their own judgment as to the appropriate fee for the judgment of the Commission. As the Court of Special Appeals has observed: \u201cThe agency\u2019s expertise in setting attorney\u2019s fees in workmen\u2019s compensation cases is not to be undermined.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>63 Md.App. at 433, 492 A.2d at 988. <em>See also Rogers v. Welsh, </em>113 Md.App. 142, 686 A.2d 1107 (1996)(upholding Commission\u2019s decision not to exercise its discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees in excess of the regulatory guidelines); <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Comm\u2019n v. May, </em>88 Md.App. 408, 416, 594 A.2d 1232, 1236 (1991), quoting <em>Bowen, </em>54 Md.App. at 386, 458 A.2d at 1242 (\u201cThe amount of [attorney\u2019s] fees awarded is a decision within the sound discretion of the Commission and \u2018it is not the province of the courts to constrain the legitimate exercise of the Commission\u2019s dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>cretion.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Ten Trex, </em>83 Md.App. at 578-80, 575 A.2d at 1269-70 (upholding Commission\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Keeping in mind the purposes of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act generally and the attorney\u2019s fee provision specifically, as well as the Commission\u2019s special expertise in these areas, we now turn to the jurisdictional question posed by the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">This case concerns a dispute over the division of a fee that has already been approved by the Commission, rather than a dispute as to the Commission-approved fee itself. Thus, this appeal requires us to consider the scope of \u00a7 9-731, which gives the Commission jurisdiction over attorney\u2019s fees made \u201cin connection with\u201d a claim filed before the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Ingerman contends that Engel should have pursued his claim for 50 percent of the attorney\u2019s fee before the Commission and not the courts, a position with which the circuit court agreed. Ingerman argues that both the plain meaning of the statute and a reading of the case law give the Commission exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute involving legal fees for services rendered in the course of pursuing a worker\u2019s claim for compensation. We disagree. We initially explain why we believe that the plain words of the statute do not give the Commission exclusive jurisdiction and why the appellate decisions of this State fail to resolve the jurisdictional question posed in this appeal. We then look to the legislature\u2019s purpose and statutory scheme to determine how \u00a7 9-731 should apply in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">We begin by examining the text of \u00a7 9-731 to determine whether its meaning is plain and unambiguous. \u201cIf the language of the statute is plain and clear and expresses a meaning consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, no further analysis is ordinarily required.\u201d <em>Gargliano v. State, </em>334 Md. 428, 435, 639 A.2d 675, 678 (1994); <em>see also Prince </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number><em>George\u2019s County v. Vieira, </em>340 Md. 651, 658, 667 A.2d 898, 901 (1995). Ingerman contends that subsection (a)(1) plainly covers an attorney\u2019s attempt to charge or collect a portion of a fee already collected by another attorney. We conclude, however, that the statutory language accurately reflects the legislature\u2019s intention of conferring to the Commission jurisdiction over disputes between attorneys and <em>parties </em>to compensation claims, <em>ie., </em>between attorneys and claimants or employers, but not over disputes as to fee-sharing agreements among attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Section 9-731(a)(l) states in pertinent part that: \u201cUnless approved by the Commission, a person may not charge or collect a fee for: (i) legal services <em>in connection with </em>a claim under this title.\u201d (Emphasis added). These words provide no indication that the Commission must approve the payment of monies by one attorney to another attorney which, coincidentally, relate to a workers\u2019 compensation claim. Under such circumstances the attorney seeking payment is not charging or collecting a fee from a claimant\u2019s compensation; rather, that attorney is seeking to enforce a contractual obligation. Thus, we reject Ingerman\u2019s argument that, because the statute \u201cdoes not make exceptions for cases which do not affect the overall amount of the lien on the Claimant\u2019s award,\u201d the Commission has exclusive jurisdiction over the fee-sharing dispute. Since the fee-sharing dispute does not involve charging or collecting a fee from a claimant, no statutory \u201cexception\u201d is needed to conclude that jurisdiction properly lies with the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The only possible ambiguity that may be read into subsection (a)(1) stems from its failure to expressly indicate <em>from, whom </em>a person may not charge or collect a fee without Commission approval. Perhaps, ideally, the legislature would have indicated in specific terms <em>from whom </em>one may not charge or collect a fee, but such additional language seems unnecessary when one considers the implications of Ingerman\u2019s argument. Ingerman\u2019s contention presumes that attorney A (here, Engel) may not attempt to collect a portion of a fee from attorney B (Ingerman) without Commission approval, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>if the fee earned by attorney B was for compensation for a claim before the Commission and attorney A\u2019s services included work on the worker\u2019s claim. Thus, Ingerman\u2019s argument would apparently encompass any lawyer\u2019s claim against any other lawyer if there is any connection to a claim before the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">This argument is belied by the facts of this case. Ingerman does not dispute that Philip Sturman, the former employee of the firm who later worked as a subcontractor, performed much of the work on the Colson case. Sturman was paid on an hourly basis and performed most, if not all, of the work on Colson\u2019s case, following Ingerman\u2019s involvement, including negotiating the ultimate settlement and drafting the petition for legal fees. It was Ingerman, however, who was named counsel and whose name was on the petition for attorney\u2019s fees filed with the Commission. Ingerman\u2019s petition did not mention Sturman\u2019s role or the fact of his compensation for work on the Colson case. Ingerman paid Sturman for his services on the Colson case pursuant to their contract. Therefore, under Ingerman\u2019s broad reading of the statute, Sturman, with Ingerman\u2019s assistance, would have violated the statute by \u201ccharging] or colleet[ing] a fee ... for legal services in connection with a claim.\u201d Section 9-731 requires that persons obtain Commission approval of all charges or collections in connection with a claim; since the statute does not distinguish between contested and uncontested charges or collections, there is little to differentiate the Sturman-Ingerman contractual relationship from the relationship alleged by Engel. The fact that Sturman\u2019s contract was concurrent with Ingerman\u2019s representation of Colson, while Engel\u2019s was successive, is too slim a reed to distinguish the two situations and a distinction not available from even an extremely liberal reading of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Furthermore, if Ingerman had refused to pay Sturman, Sturman would not be precluded from filing suit in the courts for Ingerman\u2019s breach of their contract because of the mere fortuity that the contract involved services rendered in the pursuit of a claim under the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>would be even clearer that the courts have jurisdiction over the breach of contract if, in the posed hypothetical, Sturman\u2019s contract also involved services for working on matters unrelated to work before the Commission. Surely we would not require Sturman to pursue his claim for breach of contract in two different arenas.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Like the hypothetical situation involving Ingerman\u2019s refusal to pay Sturman, Engel\u2019s claim is for breach of a contract. Instead of a contract for payment by the hour, the alleged contract was \u201cto split any fees recovered in these matters on a 50-50 basis.\u201d It is insignificant for our purposes that one contract involved the transfer of Colson\u2019s case from Engel to Ingerman and the other involved payment for work performed on Colson\u2019s case as a subcontractor; in either case, under Ingerman\u2019s overly broad reading of \u00a7 9-731, both situations would involve fees for \u201clegal services in connection with a claim.\u201d Ingerman\u2019s plain language argument would therefore lead to an illogical result. A much more reasonable interpretation of the express language of \u00a7 9-731 would limit the Commission\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction to attempts to collect or charge fees <em>from, claimants </em>in connection with a claim before the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">A case that sheds further light on the \u201cin connection with\u201d language of \u00a7 9-731 is <em>Livingston Fire Pro. v. Hubbard, </em>45 Md.App. 504, 414 A.2d 5 (1980), <em>aff'd, Hubbard v. Livingston Fire Pro., </em>289 Md. 581, 426 A.2d 901 (1981). In that case the injured employee, Hubbard, was awarded compensation for permanent disability, but he subsequently recovered a judgment larger than his disability compensation from a third-party tortfeasor. The tort recovery operated to forfeit his right to future compensation payments. <em>See </em>\u00a7 9-902(c)(pro-viding injured employee the right to pursue third-party claim and for the allocation of any recovery from that claim). Hubbard then petitioned the Commission for attorney\u2019s fees to which he would have been entitled if the third-party claim had not been filed. The Commission denied the request, but on' appeal the circuit court reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>The Court of Special Appeals then reversed the circuit court. The court rejected Hubbard\u2019s contention that Md.Code (1957, 1964 Repl.Vol., 1977 Cum.Supp.), Art. 101, \u00a7 57 gives the Commission jurisdiction over payment or allocation of legal fees. <em>Livingston Fire Pro., </em>45 Md.App. at 510, 414 A.2d at 8. It held that, although the language of the statute gave the Commission jurisdiction over legal fees \u201crendered in connection with any claim under this article,\u201d the Commission had no jurisdiction for \u201ccounsel fees in connection with a third party claim as the pertinent language of the section is specifically limited to legal fees \u2018rendered in connection with any claim under this article.\u2019 \u201d <em>Livingston Fire Pro., </em>45 Md.App. at 511, 414 A.2d at 8 (quoting then Md.Code (1957, 1964 Repl.Vol., 1977 Cum.Supp.), Art. 101, \u00a7 57 and current \u00a7 9-731). We affirmed the decision of the intermediate appellate court. <em>Hubbard v. Livingston Fire Pro., </em>289 Md. 581, 426 A.2d 901 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">The instant case is analogous to Hubbard\u2019s request to the Commission for attorney\u2019s fees relating to the third-party claim. In <em>Hubbard, </em>a broad reading of the \u201cin connection with\u201d language of \u00a7 9-731 would have given the Commission jurisdiction to rule on attorney\u2019s fees, since Hubbard initially had been awarded compensation in a claim before the Commission and the tort recovery effectively operated as a substitute for the compensation claim for which the Commission had already approved attorney\u2019s fees. Nonetheless, the payment from a third party ended the Commission\u2019s role in the case, including its jurisdiction over attorney\u2019s fees. In the same way that the recovery from the third-party tortfeasor operated to divest the Commission from jurisdiction over Hubbard\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees in <em>Hubbard, </em>the Commission\u2019s order granting Ingerman\u2019s request for fees in this case operated to divest the Commission of exclusive jurisdiction over the legal fees involved in preparing Mr. Colson\u2019s compensation claims. Arguably, the attorney\u2019s fees sought by counsel in <em>Hubbard </em>are even more strongly \u201cconnected\u201d with the worker\u2019s claim than in the instant case, since those fees stemmed from a tort action that resulted in a recovery that actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>substituted for the compensation the claimant was due to receive under the Commission\u2019s previous order. In sum, in both cases an overly broad reading of the \u201cin connection with\u201d language would give the Commission exclusive jurisdiction over both claims for fees, but a much more logical reading limits the scope of the statute to requests for attorney\u2019s fees directly arising from a worker\u2019s claim. In essence, the scope of \u00a7 9-731 does not reach to collateral matters, and particularly when those matters are unrelated to the purposes of \u00a7 9-731, which will be discussed in more detail below. <em>See infra </em>Part III.C.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">We also disagree with Ingerman\u2019s contention that the Maryland cases interpreting \u00a7 9-731 and its predecessor, Md.Code (1957, 1964 Repl.VoL, 1977 Cum.Supp.), Art. 101, \u00a7 57, indicate that the Commission has exclusive jurisdiction over a dispute concerning the division of legal fees recovered in a worker\u2019s compensation case. We agree with Ingerman that the language in some of our cases refers in broad terms to the Commission\u2019s regulation of attorney\u2019s fees. For example, in <em>Chanticleer Skyline Rm., supra, </em>we observed that through the enactment of the attorney\u2019s fee provision \u201cthe Legislature has attempted to formulate a comprehensive mechanism by which the award of an attorney\u2019s fee is regulated.\u201d 271 Md. at 699, 319 A.2d at 805. The circuit court relied on similar case law references to the Commission\u2019s broad authority, concluding that the \u201clanguage of the Court of Special Appeals in the various cases appears to suggest that the legislative policy is an all encompassing preemption of the field of attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">However, as the circuit court and the parties to this appeal apparently recognized, no appellate decisions in Maryland express a view on whether the legislature intended that the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction over the regulation of attorney\u2019s fees in workers\u2019 compensation cases preempts, as the circuit court phrased it, \u201csomething as remote as [the subsequent distribution of a Commission-approved attorney\u2019s fee].\u201d Thus, the question we face on this appeal is a matter of first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>impression. We may not extract language from our cases considering the propriety of Commission-approved fees and apply that language to the entirely different context of a dispute among attorneys over a fee that the Commission has already approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">Our review of the case law of other jurisdictions uncovered only one case in which a court considered the jurisdiction of the state workers\u2019 compensation agency to entertain a dispute between attorneys over the distribution of the fee. <em>See Feldman v. Edwards, </em>107 Ga.App. 397, 130 S.E.2d 350 (1963). Like the instant case, <em>Feldman </em>involved a dispute between attorneys\u2014Edwards, who represented three claimants in workers\u2019 compensation proceedings, and Feldman, whom Edwards had employed as associate counsel. The State Board of Workmens\u2019 Compensation approved the legal fee contracts between the claimants and Edwards. Feldman then filed a petition with the state board asking that it direct Edwards to pay him one-half of the counsel fee approved. After the Board refused to take action on his petition, Feldman filed suit in a Georgia superior court assigning error to the Board\u2019s refusal to have a hearing to determine if he was entitled to a part of the attorney\u2019s fees. The superior court dismissed Feldman\u2019s lawsuit for lack of jurisdiction. On appeal, the Georgia appellate court held that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ-\">\u201cState Board of Workmen\u2019s Compensation has authority to examine and approve contracts between claimants and their counsel as to the amount of attorneys fees but it has no authority ... to examine and approve contracts between attorneys as to the division of their fees when associated to represent claimants. The only contracts before the Board were the contracts between Edwards and the claimants and such were the only contracts that the board could examine.\u201d (Citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-5\"><em>Feldman, </em>130 S.E.2d at 350-51. Thus, addressing a very similar situation as that posed in the instant case, the Georgia court concluded that once the state board approved a contract for legal fees related to a worker\u2019s claim, the board no longer had jurisdiction to settle a dispute over how the fees should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>distributed among feuding attorneys. Although we find the reasoning of the Georgia court persuasive, our holding need not reach as far in the instant case. In <em>Feldman, </em>the court addressed whether the state board had <em>any </em>jurisdiction over the fee dispute between attorneys; in this case we address, and reject, Ingerman\u2019s contention that the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction over the fee dispute is <em>exclusive.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the scope of the \u201cin connection with\u201d language of \u00a7 9-731 is ambiguous, we will now consider the present conflict in light of the legislature\u2019s intent and purpose in enacting the statute. We believe that the Commission accomplished the legislative purpose of \u00a7 9-731 once it approved Ingerman\u2019s petition for attorney\u2019s fees. The Commission\u2019s approval of Ingerman\u2019s petition for legal fees related to the settlement of Colson\u2019s claim fulfilled the statutory purposes described above. <em>See supra </em>Part II. C. The approval protected Colson\u2019s compensation and helped to ensure reasonable payment for the legal work involved. How the payment for legal work is subsequently distributed is not pertinent to the legislature\u2019s purpose of protecting workers and ensuring that claimants are able to find adequate legal representation. Ensuring that competent legal counsel is available to represent claimants is accomplished by the Commission\u2019s task of approving legal fees that are reasonable in total; whether that total amount approved is subsequently kept by one attorney who worked alone, or is distributed among a number of attorneys who participated in the matter, bears little impact on the policies behind \u00a7 9-731. Moreover, to hold, as Ingerman asks us, that the Commission has exclusive jurisdiction over disputes involving the distribution of Commission-approved fees would involve an unparalleled transfer of power from the judiciary to an administrative agency. For example, as described above, it would place before the Commission any dispute over the contract for services between Ingerman and its subcontractor Sturman. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>The legislature could not have intended such a broad expansion of the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction to entertain breach of contract claims that generally fall within the province of the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Furthermore, the Commission has no special expertise that would serve as a policy basis for conferring to it exclusive jurisdiction over the existence of, or a disagreement regarding, the terms of a fee-sharing contract between attorneys. The Commission simply has no special knowledge or skills relevant to ordinary contract claims or equitable claims for <em>quantum meruit. </em>Indeed, the dispute in this case is entirely unrelated to the Commission\u2019s mandate of \u201cprotecting] workers and their families from hardships inflicted by work-related injuries.\u201d <em>Queen, </em>287 Md. at 343, 412 A.2d at 734. Just as if there had been a contractual dispute between doctors over the division of medical fees earned as a result of services rendered in connection with a claim before the Commission, the total of which had been approved by the Commission, no policy or purpose would be served in refusing the doctors\u2019 access to the courts and holding that the Commission had exclusive jurisdiction over the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Finally, the ethical considerations often involved in disputes over attorney\u2019s fees provide further reason for our holding that jurisdiction in this case properly lies in the courts. Attorney\u2019s fee disputes often involve ethical considerations that are properly considered by a court of law and over which the Commission has no special expertise and no jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.5 (governing lawyer\u2019s fees); <em>Post v. Bregman, </em>349 Md. 142, 707 A.2d 806 (1998)(holding that violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct covering the splitting of fees among attorneys could make fee-splitting arrangement unenforceable).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To extend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction beyond approval of the total fee might intrude upon the need of the judiciary to regulate attorney professionalism.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Not only do we fail to see any policy basis for reading into \u00a7 9-731 exclusive jurisdiction of the Commission over a fee-sharing dispute among attorneys, we believe that a holding resulting in Commission review of the substance of Engel\u2019s claim could subvert the purposes of \u00a7 9-731 and the Commission\u2019s legitimate interest in the finality of its decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">The Commission would have one of two choices if it were to entertain Engel\u2019s request for a percentage of the legal fees relating to Colson\u2019s claim and find in favor of his request, as did the District Court. First, it could find the claimant, Colson, liable for additional fees payable to Engel. Under this scenario, the imposition of new fees would reduce Colson\u2019s recovery and, thus, directly and adversely implicate the purpose behind \u00a7 9-731 of protecting the claimant\u2019s recovery from diminution by excessive legal fees. Although it had earlier approved a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee for the costs of the case, the Commission would further reduce Colson\u2019s recovery by awarding an additional attorney\u2019s fee, this time payable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>to Engel. It is apparent from oral argument that, should this dispute be placed once again before the Commission, Ingerman would in fact claim that any fees owed to Engel should come from Colson and not Ingerman. Ingerman claimed at argument that its petition for attorney\u2019s fees did not include any work performed by Engel. It is clear, however, that the fee approved by the Commission was based on the $200,000 settlement of Colson\u2019s claim, which was the culmination of all the attorneys\u2019 work, including that of Engel and Sturman, and upon a Commission finding that \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d justified a fee in excess of the regular fee schedule.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See </em>COMAR 14.09.01.25(B)(2). Ingerman concedes that its petition to the Commission for approval of fees failed to indicate that additional fees might be sought by other attorneys. Furthermore, Ingerman\u2019s argument is undermined by the fact of Ingerman\u2019s payment to Sturman as a subcontractor, even though Sturman also had not been named in the fee petition (particularly given that he had prepared the petition). Thus, if we were to hold as Ingerman would have us, we would risk undermining the clear purpose of \u00a7 9-731 by exposing Col-son\u2019s recovery to further diminution after a reasonable fee for all the legal work giving rise to the settlement had already been approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Under the second scenario, the Commission could find that the fees owed by Ingerman to Engel should be taken from the total fee that it had previously approved. Presumably, the Commission would then have to review the nature of the work involved in preparing Colson\u2019s claim to determine the total amount of work and which attorney was responsible for the work. Since the Commission\u2019s original approval of the total amount of attorney\u2019s fees already involved a review of the work performed in preparing and litigating Colson\u2019s case, the Commission would have to revisit the same record a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Like courts, administrative agencies have an interest in the finality of their decisions. <em>Cf. </em>II Kenneth Culp Davis &amp; Richard J. Pierce, Jr., Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 13.8, at 248 (1994)(\u201cThe policy in favor of repose that underlies application of res judicata, or claim preclusion, to judicial decisions applies with equal strength to agency adjudications.\u201d) In approving the attorney\u2019s fees in this case the Commission found them reasonably related to the services rendered; thus, the Commission\u2019s task should be complete, and it should not be required to reopen its examination of the record to consider a contract collateral to the overall fee itself. The Commission had no knowledge that Ingerman\u2019s petition was subject to either Engel\u2019s or Sturman\u2019s claim, and to require it to reopen the matter in order to entertain such claims would impose a significant burden on the agency. Indeed, it would remain unclear under this scenario what, if anything, would prevent a new attorney <em>(e.g., </em>one who alleged a fee-sharing agreement with Engel) from seeking to reopen the case a third time.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">On the other hand, by allowing the courts to exercise jurisdiction over the alleged fee-splitting agreement, our holding leaves as final the Commission\u2019s approval of the total attorney\u2019s fees for which Colson is liable and it places before the courts what is, in reality, a contractual dispute over the distribution of a fee previously approved by the Commission. Indeed, we believe that little distinguishes the context of this case from <em>Vogelhut v. Kandel, </em>308 Md. 183, 517 A.2d 1092 (1986), which also involved a lawsuit filed by a discharged attorney against a successor attorney for a percentage of the fee recovery. The single fact that the fee dispute in this case stems from a claim that had been before the Commission does not detract from the principles of contract law and the ethical considerations that are relevant to disputes over fee-sharing agreements, and neither does that fact divest the courts of jurisdiction over the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">In sum, this matter involves an alleged contract between a discharged attorney and a successor attorney governed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>contract law principles we set forth in <em>Vogelhut, supra. </em>The language of \u00a7 9-731 supports this interpretation, and Maryland case law does not contradict it. To hold otherwise would not further the objectives of \u00a7 9-731 and of workers\u2019 compensation law generally; rather, such a holding would place those purposes at a substantial risk of being undermined. Having fulfilled its statutory mandate of protecting a claimant\u2019s compensation from diminution from excessive attorney\u2019s fees and providing adequate compensation for the services rendered, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission should not be burdened with a matter over which it has no policy interest nor any special expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED.

Ingerman does not contend that recovery from Engel would contravene any ethical standards.
