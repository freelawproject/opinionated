The issue presented in the petition is \u201c[wjhether the Exclusionary Rule, based on the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, applies in a civil forfeiture case in Maryland seeking the forfeiture of an automobile allegedly used in the drug trade.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Based on an informant\u2019s tip, three veteran officers of the Baltimore City Police Department\u2019s Northwest District Drug Enforcement Unit were conducting a general surveillance on Parkview Avenue in Baltimore City when they observed petitioner park his 1995 Corvette in the area. During the surveillance, they observed another man, also unknown to them, hand petitioner a large black bag through the Corvette\u2019s window, after which petitioner drove away. Even though the officers at that time had no prior knowledge of petitioner\u2019s involvement with controlled dangerous substances, they believed petitioner had conducted a drug transaction with the other man. The officers followed petitioner, but lost him. A police helicopter, however, tracked petitioner and eventually other officers stopped him in the 300 block of East Cold Spring Lane. The drug enforcement officers arrived on the scene and approached petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">One of the officers, explaining that he believed petitioner may have been involved in a drug transaction, asked about the contents of the bag. Petitioner responded that it contained gym equipment. The officer explained to petitioner that petitioner need not reveal the contents of the bag, but that he would request a drug-sniffing dog because of the earlier observations. Petitioner quickly opened and closed the bag. An officer observed a plastic bag inside the black bag, which he believed contained a controlled dangerous substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Petitioner was arrested on drug-related charges.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the arrest, another officer took the black bag out of the car and looked inside. The bag contained approximately 500 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>grams of cocaine. The three officers also found a brown paper bag inside the car that contained smaller bags of cocaine totaling approximately forty-eight grams. The officers then seized the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">Respondent, through the State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore City, filed a forfeiture action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against petitioner on June 6, 1996, pursuant to Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.VoL, 1998 Cum.Supp.),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Art. 27, section 297. That provision states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">(b) <em>Property subject to </em>forfeiture.\u2014The following shall be subject to forfeiture and no property right shall exist in them:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">(1) All controlled dangerous substances ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">(2) All raw materials, products and equipment of any kind which are used, or intended for use, in manufacturing, compounding, processing, delivering, importing, or exporting any controlled dangerous substance ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">(4) All ... <em>vehicles ... which are used, or intended for use, to transport, or in any manner to facilitate the transportation, sale, receipt, possession, or concealment of property described in paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection ...</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">(10) Everything of value furnished, or intended to be furnished, in exchange for a controlled dangerous substance in violation of this subheading, <em>all proceeds traceable to such an </em>exchange____ [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">Respondent based its complaint on subsections (4) and (10). At the forfeiture hearing, petitioner initially moved to dismiss the ease because, he alleged, the evidence necessary to prove respondent\u2019s case, the bags of cocaine, had been obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment and thus should be suppressed under the \u201cexclusionary rule.\u201d <em>See generally Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number><em>Weeks v. United States, </em>232 U.S. 383, 34 S.Ct. 341, 58 L.Ed. 652 (1914). After both parties argued their positions, the trial judge denied petitioner\u2019s motion. Petitioner made the same motion twice more during the hearing. The trial judge again denied each motion, but permitted a continuing motion for the record. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial judge offered the parties the opportunity to submit written memoranda on the issue. Ultimately, the trial court ruled that a Fourth Amendment violation had occurred and the exclusionary rule would apply, thus suppressing the evidence from the forfeiture trial. The court then dismissed the case. Respondent filed a timely appeal, arguing that the exclusionary rule does not apply to forfeiture proceedings under section 297. The Court of Special Appeals reversed, <em>Mayor of Baltimore v. One 1995 Corvette, </em>119 Md.App. 691, 706 A.2d 43 (1998), and we granted a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">II. <em>Plymouth Sedan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Central to this case is <em>One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania, </em>380 U.S. 693, 702, 85 S.Ct. 1246, 1251, 14 L.Ed.2d 170 (1965), in which the United States Supreme Court held that the exclusionary rule applies to forfeiture proceedings \u201csuch as the one involved\u201d in that case. In <em>Plymouth Sedan, </em>officers of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board stopped George McGonigle shortly after he drove his 1958 Plymouth sedan across the Benjamin Franklin Bridge into Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The officers, positioned at the foot of the bridge in New Jersey, had followed Mr. McGonigle after observing that the rear of his Plymouth was \u201clow in the rear, quite low.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 85 S.Ct. at 1247, 14 L.Ed.2d 170. During the stop, the officers searched the car without a warrant, finding thirty-one cases of liquor not bearing the necessary state tax seals. The officers arrested Mr. McGonigle.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania subsequently filed a petition for forfeiture of Mr. McGonigle\u2019s car based on a state statute that proclaimed \u201c[n]o property rights shall exist in any ... vehicle ... used in the illegal manufacture or illegal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>transportation of liquor ... and the same shall be deemed contraband and proceedings for its forfeiture to the Commonwealth may ... be instituted____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694 n. 2, 85 S.Ct. at 1247 n. 2, 14 L.Ed.2d 170. Mr. McGonigle initially moved to dismiss the case, arguing that because the evidence necessary to prove the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the thirty-one cases of liquor, had been obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment, they should be suppressed under the exclusionary rule. The trial judge granted the motion and dismissed the case. The Commonwealth appealed, and the Superior Court of Pennsylvania reversed the trial court. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court, holding that \u201ceven if the instant automobile had been illegally seized, such fact would not preclude the instant civil proceeding of forfeiture.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. One 1958 Plymouth Sedan, </em>414 Pa. 540, 547, 201 A.2d 427, 431 (1964), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>380 U.S. 693, 85 S.Ct. 1246, 14 L.Ed.2d 170 (1965). The United States Supreme Court \u201cgranted certiorari to consider the important question of whether the constitutional exclusionary rule enunciated in <em>[Weeks </em>and <em>Mapp </em>] applies to forfeiture proceedings of the character involved here.\u201d <em>Plymouth Sedan, </em>380 U.S. at 696, 85 S.Ct. at 1248, 14 L.Ed.2d 170 (citations omitted). The Court held \u201cthat the constitutional exclusionary rule does apply to such forfeiture proceedings,\u201d and reversed the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">In <em>Plymouth Sedan, </em>the Supreme Court relied heavily on <em>Boyd v. United States, </em>116 U.S. 616, 6 S.Ct. 524, 29 L.Ed. 746 (1886),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a case in which it was alleged that crates of plate glass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>were imported without the payment of the proper customs duty. The statute in that case provided a criminal penalty of $50 to $5000, up to two years imprisonment, and forfeiture of the goods. The government instituted a civil <em>in rem </em>forfeiture action against the imported glass. Addressing the civil nature of the proceeding, the Supreme Court in <em>Boyd </em>explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aco\">If the government prosecutor elects to waive an indictment, and to file a civil information against the claimants,\u2014that is, civil in form,\u2014can he by this device take from the proceeding its criminal aspect and deprive the claimants of their immunities as citizens, and extort from them a production of their private papers, or, as an alternative, a confession of guilt? This cannot be. The information, though technically a civil proceeding, is in substance and effect a criminal one.... As, therefore, suits for penalties and forfeitures, incurred by the commission of offenses against the law, are of this <em>quasi </em>criminal nature, we think that they are within the reason of criminal proceedings for all the purposes of the fourth amendment of the constitution....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 633-34, 6 S.Ct. at 534, 29 L.Ed. 746, <em>quoted in Plymouth Sedan, </em>380 U.S. at 697-98, 85 S.Ct. at 1249, 14 L.Ed.2d 170. The <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>Court made clear that, although <em>Boyd </em>involved evidence sought by subpoena, that factual difference was irrelevant because \u201cthe essential question is whether evidence[,] ... the obtaining of which violates the Fourth Amendment may be relied upon to sustain a forfeiture.\u201d <em>Plymouth Sedan, </em>380 U.S. at 698, 85 S.Ct. at 1249, 14 L.Ed.2d 170. Going on to explain its holding, the Court in <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>reasoned that \u201c[t]here is nothing even remotely criminal in possessing an automobile. It is only the alleged use to which this particular automobile was put that subjects Mr. McGonigle to its possible loss.\u201d <em>Id. at </em>699, 85 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>S.Ct. at 1250, 14 L.Ed.2d 170. Additionally, \u201ca forfeiture proceeding is quasi-criminal in character. Its object, like a criminal proceeding, is to penalize for the commission of an offense against the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 700, 85 S.Ct. at 1250, 14 L.Ed.2d 170. The Supreme Court summarized its holding, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-4\">[W]e conclude that the nature of a forfeiture proceeding, so well described ... in <em>Boyd, </em>and the reasons which led the Court to hold that the exclusionary rule ... is obligatory upon the States under the Fourteenth Amendment ... in <em>Mapp, </em>support the conclusion that the exclusionary rule is applicable to forfeiture proceedings such as the one involved here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 702, 85 S.Ct. at 1251,14 L.Ed.2d 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">The Court of Special Appeals, in its opinion below, criticized <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>and its modern application, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">Does <em>[Plymouth Sedan </em>] stand for the broad principle that Mapp\u2019s Exclusionary Rule must be applied to all drug-related forfeitures of automobiles regardless of whether those forfeiture proceedings are criminal or civil in character? A close reading of the opinion reveals that it most certainly does not.... Has <em>One 1958 Plymouth Sedan, </em>whatever it stood for, retained its vitality over the thirty-three years since it was handed down? No, it has not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqj\"><em>One 1995 Corvette, </em>119 Md.App. at 695-96, 706 A.2d at 45. That court also attempted to distinguish <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>from the case at hand, noting that in <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>the criminal penalties were less detrimental to Mr. McGonigle than the potential loss of his car in the forfeiture proceedings, while in this case petitioner faced severe criminal penalties that eclipsed the potential loss of his Corvette. Respondent makes similar arguments before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">A. The Continued Viability of <em>Plymouth Sedan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">Contrary to the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s opinion, <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>remains applicable. As recently as 1994, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Supreme Court cited the case as authority for the proposition that the exclusionary rule applies to civil forfeiture proceedings. <em>United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, </em>510 U.S. 43, 49, 114 S.Ct. 492, 499, 126 L.Ed.2d 490 (1993) (\u201cThe Fourth Amendment does place restrictions on seizures conducted for purposes of civil forfeiture, <em>One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania, </em>380 U.S. 693, 696, 85 S.Ct. 1246, 1248, 14 L.Ed.2d 170 (1965) (holding that the \u2022 exclusionary rule applies to civil forfeiture), but it does not follow that the Fourth Amendment is the sole constitutional provision in question when the Government seizes property subject to forfeiture.\u201d). Although the Court of Special Appeals opined that <em>United States v. Ursery, </em>518 U.S. 267,116 S.Ct. 2135, 135 L.Ed.2d 549 (1996), impliedly overruled <em>Plymouth Sedan, </em>that argument is inaccurate for two reasons: (1) <em>Ursery </em>dealt exclusively with the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause, see <em>infra, </em>and (2) <em>Ursery </em>never discussed or cited <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>in the majority opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Similarly, respondent relies on the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s quotation of <em>United States v. Janis, </em>428 U.S. 433, 447, 96 S.Ct. 3021, 3029, 49 L.Ed.2d 1046 (1976), to argue <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>does not control this case. The quotation from <em>Janis </em>states that \u201c[i]n the complex and turbulent history of the [exclusionary] rule, the Court never has applied it to exclude evidence from a civil proceeding, federal or state.\u201d That particular sentence, however, is followed by footnote seventeen of that opinion, which states: \u201c[T]he Court has applied the exclusionary rule in a proceeding for forfeiture of an article used in violation of the criminal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 447 n. 17, 96 S.Ct. at 3029 n. 17, 49 L.Ed.2d 1046 (citing <em>Plymouth Sedan, </em>380 U.S. 693, 85 S.Ct. 1246, 14 L.Ed.2d 170).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Eleven of the thirteen United States Courts of Appeals have interpreted <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>to stand for the proposition that the exclusionary rule applies to civil <em>in rem </em>forfeitures.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Additionally, courts in thirty-four states have interpreted <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>to stand for the same proposition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>that in many of these federal and state cases, the various courts refer to <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>primarily in dicta. Nevertheless, the cases consistently accept the interpretation of <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>as applying the exclusionary rule to civil <em>in rem </em>forfeiture proceedings. Our examination of the cases has revealed no court that completely rejects that interpretation, as the Court of Special Appeals did in the case below.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>This Court\u2019s interpretation of <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>has not differed from the conclusions reached by the majority of other courts, even those which distinguish <em>Plymouth Sedan. </em>In <em>Sheetz v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>315 Md. 208, 212, 553 A.2d 1281, 1283 (1989), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-4\">As a general matter, the federal exclusionary rule applies to criminal proceedings. However the Supreme Court has extended the rule to at least one civil proceeding in <em>One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, </em>380 U.S. 693, 85 S.Ct. 1246, 14 L.Ed.2d 170 (1965). There the Court held that illegally obtained contraband evidence could not be admitted in an automobile forfeiture case. Noting that the cost of forfeiture was quasi-punitive in nature and exceeded the cost of the criminal fines, the Court reasoned that \u201c[i]t would be anomalous indeed, under these circumstances, to hold that in the criminal proceeding the illegally seized evidence is excludable, while in the forfeiture proceeding, requiring the determination that the criminal law has been violated, the same evidence would be admissible.\u201d <em>One Plymouth Sedan, </em>380 U.S. at 701, 85 S.Ct. at 1251, 14 L.Ed.2d at 175. However since then, the Court has declined to extend the rule to <em>other </em>civil proceedings. <em>See United States v. Janis, </em>428 U.S. 433, 96 S.Ct. 3021, 49 L.Ed.2d 1046 (1976) (declining to apply the rule to federal tax proceedings where criminal evidence had been obtained by state police); <em>Immigration and Naturalization Serv. v. Lopez-Mendoza, </em>468 U.S. 1032, 104 S.Ct. 3479, 82 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>L.Ed.2d 778 (1984) (refusing to apply the rule in the context of civil deportation proceedings). [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-5\"><em>Cf. Whitaker v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>307 Md. 368, 382, 514 A.2d 4, 11 (1986) (\u201cThough <em>[Janis </em>] cannot be said to stand for the proposition that evidence may <em>never </em>be excluded in a civil proceeding, it nonetheless severely undermined those cases in lower courts which applied the exclusionary rule to civil proceedings.\u201d) Neither <em>Sheetz, Janis </em>nor <em>Whitaker </em>dealt directly with forfeiture proceedings. <em>Janis, </em>428 U.S. 433, 96 S.Ct. 3021, 49 L.Ed.2d 1046, declined to extend the exclusionary rule to a civil tax proceeding against an illegal bookmaker. <em>Sheetz, </em>315 Md. at 215-16, 553 A.2d at 1284-85, held that the exclusionary rule was inapplicable to administrative discharge proceedings unless improper motivation by the investigators could be shown. Finally, <em>Whitaker, </em>307 Md. at 380, 514 A.2d at 11, distinguished <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>in holding the exclusionary rule would not apply to the admissibility of items seized pursuant to a search warrant, even a defective warrant, in a public nuisance action in civil court.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Although we recognize, as did the Court of Special Appeals, that the reach of the exclusionary rule has been limited since <em>Mapp </em>and <em>Plymouth Sedan, see One 1995 Corvette, </em>119 Md. App. at 699-720, 706 A.2d at 49-58, we do not believe it to be appropriate, given the long and extensive history of reliance on <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>by the federal and state court systems, for this Court to attempt to overrule <em>Plymouth Sedan. </em>That is for the Supreme Court to do if it so chooses. It is our duty to continue to apply <em>Plymouth Sedan. See In re Flowers, </em>474 N.W.2d 546, 548 (Iowa 1991) (\u201cWe are unwilling to anticipate the demise of <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>... in the absence of a clear indication from the Supreme Court that it is no longer to be followed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">B. <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>Applies to the Case <em>Sub Judice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">We also address whether, as respondent argues, a civil <em>in rem </em>forfeiture proceeding under section 297 is distinguishable from the forfeiture proceeding in <em>Plymouth Sedan. </em>This argument, even if applicable, would depend on whether a civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number><em>in rem </em>forfeiture action under section 297 is \u201cquasi-criminal,\u201d thus requiring Fourth Amendment protections to be enforced through the exclusionary rule by reason of language within <em>Boyd, Plymouth Sedan, </em>and their progeny. We conclude that section 297 is \u201cquasi-criminal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">1. The Intended Purpose of the Fourth Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Both parties in this appeal argue that the exclusionary rule should or should not be applied to section 297 depending on whether the Legislature intended the law to be \u201cpunitive.\u201d Respondent, arguing the law is not intended to be punitive, relies on <em>Ursery, </em>518 U.S. at 292, 116 S.Ct. at 2149, 135 L.Ed.2d 549, which held that civil <em>in rem </em>forfeitures, particularly under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881, the federal equivalent to section 297, are not \u201cpunitive\u201d for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause. In opposition, petitioner relies on <em>Aravanis v. Somerset County, </em>339 Md. 644, 664 A.2d 888 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 1115, 116 S.Ct. 916, 133 L.Ed.2d 846 (1996), which held that \u201c[section] 297 ... is, like [21 U.S.C.] \u00a7\u00a7 881(a)(4) and (a)(7), a punitive statute, the purpose of which is to require \u2018direct payment to a sovereign as punishment for some offense,\u2019 \u201d under the Excessive Fines Clause contained in Article 25 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. <em>Id. </em>at 655, 664 A.2d at 893 (quoting <em>Browning-Ferris Indus. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., </em>492 U.S. 257, 265, 109 S.Ct. 2909, 2915, 106 L.Ed.2d 219 (1989)). <em>Aravanis </em>was premised largely on <em>Austin v. United States, </em>509 U.S. 602, 622, 113 S.Ct. 2801, 2812, 125 L.Ed.2d 488 (1993), which held that the Eighth Amendment Excessive Fines Clause applies to a federal civil forfeiture action under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881 because of the statute\u2019s punitive nature. <em>See also Bajakajian v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 321, -, 118 S.Ct. 2028, 2033, 141 L.Ed.2d 314 (1998) (\u201cForfeitures\u2014payments in kind\u2014are thus \u2018fines\u2019 if they constitute punishment for an offense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">The determination of whether the prophylactic, judicially-created exclusionary rule applies to a civil <em>in rem </em>forfeiture action is not based on whether the forfeiture statute was intended to be \u201cpunitive.\u201d Rather, because the federal exclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>sionary rule remedies certain violations of the Fourth Amendment, but is not coextensive with it, we must determine whether the Fourth Amendment was intended to apply to proceedings outside the scope of a criminal trial. Although the purpose of the exclusionary rule may be to curb improper police conduct, the purpose of the Fourth Amendment is to insure \u201cthe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures____\u201d It protects everybody, not just those of the criminal milieu, and, thus, is not limited to criminal proceedings. This issue was discussed by the Supreme Court in <em>Austin, </em>509 U.S. at 608 n. 4, 118 S.Ct. at 2804-05 n. 4, 125 L.Ed.2d 488:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\"><em>As </em>a general matter, this Court\u2019s decisions applying constitutional prot\u00e9ctions to civil forfeiture proceedings have adhered to th[e] distinction between [constitutional] provisions that are limited to criminal proceedings <em>and provisions that are not. </em>Thus, the Court has held that the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures applies in forfeiture proceedings, [citing <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>and <em>Boyd], </em>but that the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause does not, see <em>United States v. Zucker, </em>161 U.S. 475, 480-482, 16 S.Ct. 641, 648, 40 L.Ed. 777 (1896). It has also held that the due process requirement that guilt in a criminal proceeding be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, see <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970), does not apply to civil forfeiture proceedings. See <em>Lilienthal\u2019s Tobacco v. United States, </em>97 U.S. 237, 271-272, 24 L.Ed. 901 (1878).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">The Double Jeopardy Clause has been held not to apply in civil forfeiture proceedings, but only in cases where the forfeiture could properly be characterized as remedial. See <em>United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, </em>465 U.S. 354, 364, 104 S.Ct. 1099, 1105, 79 L.Ed.2d 361 (1984); <em>One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, </em>409 U.S. 232, 237, 93 S.Ct. 489, 493, 34 L.Ed.2d 438 (1972); see generally <em>United States v. Halper, </em>490 U.S. 435, 446-449, 109 S.Ct. 1892, 1900-1902, 104 L.Ed.2d 487 (1989) (Double Jeopardy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Clause prohibits second sanction that may not fairly be characterized as remedial). Conversely, the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Self-Incrimination Clause, which is textually limited to \u201ccriminal ease[s],\u201d has been applied in civil forfeiture proceedings, but only where the forfeiture statute had made the culpability of the owner relevant, see <em>United States v. United States Coin &amp; Currency, </em>401 U.S. 715, 721-722, 91 S.Ct. 1041, 1045, 28 L.Ed.2d 434 (1971), or where the owner faced the possibility of subsequent criminal proceedings, see <em>Boyd, </em>116 U.S., at 634, 6 S.Ct., at 534; see also <em>United States v. Ward, </em>448 U.S. 242, 253-254, 100 S.Ct. 2636, 2644, 65 L.Ed.2d 742 (1980) (discussing Boyd).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-4\">And, of course, even those protections associated with criminal cases may apply to a civil forfeiture proceeding if it is so punitive that the proceeding must reasonably be considered criminal. See <em>Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, </em>372 U.S. 144, 83 S.Ct. 554, 9 L.Ed.2d 644 (1963); <em>Ward, supra. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The Supreme Court as late as 1993 in <em>Austin </em>noted that the Fourth Amendment\u2019s provisions were not limited to criminal proceedings, but, that the Confrontation Clause, the due process \u201creasonable doubt\u201d standard, double jeopardy, and self-incrimination provisions were so limited. It clearly distinguished the applicability of these various provisions, squarely refusing to limit the Fourth Amendment\u2019s provisions to criminal cases, relying on <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>and <em>Boyd </em>in the process. The Court thus clearly implied in <em>Austin </em>that although the exclusionary rule is a judicially-created remedy intended to apply primarily to criminal and \u201cquasi-criminal\u201d proceedings, the Fourth Amendment applies to <em>all </em>\u201cunreasonable searches and seizures\u201d by the government, regardless of context. <em>See United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, </em>510 U.S. 43, 51, 114 S.Ct. 492, 500, 126 L.Ed.2d 490 (1993) (\u201cIt is true, of course, that the Fourth Amendment applies to searches and seizures in the civil context and may serve to resolve the legality of these governmental actions without reference to other constitutional provisions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Some administrative proceedings, although civil in nature, also can involve evidence that an administrative agency has searched for and seized while inspecting private property. Several Maryland statutes grant administrative agencies the right to seek search warrants to inspect private property. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1992, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-205 of the Business Regulation Article (amusement attractions); Md.Code (1982, 1996 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 7-256.1 of the Environment Article (controlled hazardous substances); Md.Code (1991, 1998 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 5.5-113 of the Labor &amp; Employment Article (railroad safety and health conditions); \u00a7 6-105 of the Labor &amp; Employment Article (high voltage power lines); Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 294 (controlled dangerous substances); Md. Code (1957, 1997 Repl.Vol., ), Art. 38A, \u00a7 8A (State Fire Marshal); Md.Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol.), Art. 89, \u00a7 2A (miscellaneous health and safety inspections by the Division of Labor and Industry). This Court, relying on <em>Marshall v. Barlow\u2019s, Inc., </em>436 U.S. 307, 98 S.Ct. 1816, 56 L.Ed.2d 305 (1978), held that search warrants sought pursuant to then Art. 89, section 2A were constitutionally valid only when based on \u201cprobable cause.\u201d <em>Fred W. Allnutt, Inc. v. Commissioner of Labor &amp; Industry, </em>289 Md. 35, 50-51, 421 A.2d 1360, 1368 (1980).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That holding presumably applies to all statutorily authorized administrative search warrants. Although we realize that \u201cprobable cause\u201d has somewhat different meanings in criminal and administrative contexts, <em>see id. </em>at 48-49, 421 A.2d at 1366-67, that Fourth Amendment protections apply to some administrative search warrants nonetheless demonstrates that the Fourth Amendment extends beyond traditional criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The Fourth Amendment is not limited by its language or its history to the context of criminal trials. Its goal is to insure freedom from unreasonable governmental searches and sei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>zures of any nature. By contrast, the goal of the Double Jeopardy Clause is to prevent multiple punishments and prosecutions (textually and historically criminal punishments and prosecutions), <em>Ursery, </em>518 U.S. at 273, 116 S.Ct. at 2139-40, 135 L.Ed.2d 549, and the goal of the Eighth Amendment Excessive Fines Clause is to prevent excessive punishments in the form of payments extracted by the government. <em>See generally Bajakajian, </em>524 U.S. 321, 118 S.Ct. 2028, 141 L.Ed.2d 314; <em>Austin, </em>509 U.S. 602, 113 S.Ct. 2801, 125 L.Ed.2d 488. After <em>Austin, </em>therefore, a determination of whether a forfeiture statute is \u201cpunitive\u201d in nature is only necessary when a double jeopardy or Eighth Amendment violation is alleged or when some other \u201cprotections associated with criminal cases\u201d other than Fourth Amendment protections, are involved. <em>Austin, </em>509 U.S. at 608 n. 4, 113 S.Ct. at 2804-05 n. 4, 125 L.Ed.2d 488 (citing <em>Ward, </em>448 U.S. 242, 100 S.Ct. 2636, 65 L.Ed.2d 742; <em>Mendozar-MaHinez, </em>372 U.S. 144, 83 S.Ct. 554, 9 L.Ed.2d 644). Fourth Amendment protections, therefore, apply regardless of the criminality of the conduct of the owner of the property or the use to which the property is put.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">As for other constitutional protections, a reviewing court should concern itself with whether the particular\u2019 protection was intended to apply to the particular case before it. Often, this decision will be based on whether the particular constitutional protection was intended to be limited to criminal or civil matters. Thus, as noted in <em>Austin, </em>509 U.S. at 608 n. 4, 113 S.Ct. at 2804 n. 4, 125 L.Ed.2d 488, the Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause, the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard, and the Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination, generally limited to criminal causes, do not apply to civil forfeitures. As noted, the Fourth Amendment lacks any such textual limitations. The Fourth Amendment applies, regardless of context, in cases in which the government allegedly has committed an \u201cunreasonable\u201d search or seizure or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>2. <em>Plymouth </em>Sedan\u2019s Definition of \u201cQuasi-Criminal\u201d Applies to Section 297</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Respondent argues, as the Court of Special Appeals opined below, that because <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>involved a case in which the penalty under the civil forfeiture action could exceed the criminal penalties, the term \u201cquasi-criminal\u201d is limited to those circumstances, making the current case distinguishable. In support of this argument, respondent notes that in the case before us, petitioner stands to lose his Corvette, yet in criminal court he would have faced up to twenty years of imprisonment, $25,000 in fines, and a mandatory minimum of five years imprisonment without parole. By contrast, in <em>Plymouth Sedan, </em>the punishment for the liquor offense was a $100 to $500 fine, but Mr. McGonigle\u2019s car was worth $1,000.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Noting this, the Supreme Court stated in <em>Plymouth Sedan, </em>380 U.S. at 700-01, 85 S.Ct. at 1251,14 L.Ed.2d 170, that \u201cthe forfeiture is clearly a penalty for the criminal offense and can result in even greater punishment than the criminal prosecution.\u201d The Court reasoned that \u201c[i]t would be anomalous indeed, under these circumstances, to hold that in the criminal proceeding the illegally seized evidence is excludable, while in the forfeiture proceeding, requiring the determination that the criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>law has been violated, the same evidence would be admissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 701, 85 S.Ct. at 1251,14 L.Ed.2d 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">Respondent also alleges that when <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>referred to a forfeiture action \u201csuch as the one involved here,\u201d the Court meant to limit its holding to forfeiture statutes similar to Pennsylvania\u2019s, which authorized a civil forfeiture action only after a criminal conviction. Respondent points out that under the Maryland forfeiture statute, criminal charges are irrelevant as to whether a forfeiture complaint may be filed under section 297 against the suspect property. Despite respondent\u2019s arguments, the conduct that gives rise to the forfeiture action under section 297 must, nevertheless, be criminal in nature. Under the statute, if there is no criminal conduct or criminal intent relating to the use of the object for which forfeiture is sought, no foundation for forfeiture exists. Subsection (b)(4) of section 297 provides that vehicles \u201cused or intended for use, to transport ... property described\u201d in certain other paragraphs are subject to forfeiture. The property described in those paragraphs, subsections 297(b)(1) &amp; (2), are controlled dangerous substances utilized \u201cin violation of the provisions of this subheading.\u201d The laws contained within the subheading, \u201cHealth-Controlled Dangerous Substances,\u201d establish the criminality of the conduct at issue here\u2014the illegal manufacture, distribution, or possession of controlled dangerous substances, including possession in sufficient quantities to indicate an intent to distribute. Although criminal charges may not be necessary, criminal conduct or criminal intent is.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">A more supportable interpretation of <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>is that it speaks in general terms, labeling as \u201cquasi-criminal\u201d any forfeiture action based upon inherently criminal activity, whether actually indictable or not, and no matter what the punishment. For instance, the Court noted that \u201cas Mr. Justice Bradley \u00e1ptly pointed out in <em>Boyd, </em>a forfeiture proceeding is quasi-criminal in character. Its object, like a criminal proceeding, is to penalize for the commission of an offense against the law.\u201d <em>Plymouth Sedan, </em>380 U.S. at 700, 85 S.Ct. at 1250, 14 L.Ed.2d 170. Moreover, immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>after noting the disparity in the forfeiture and criminal penalties in the case before it, the <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>Court noted in a footnote that <em>Boyd </em>\u201crejected <em>any </em>argument that the technical character of a forfeiture as an <em>in rem </em>proceeding against the goods had any effect on the right of the owner of the goods to assert as a defense violations of his constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 702 n. 11, 85 S.Ct. at 1251 n. 11, 14 L.Ed.2d 170 (emphasis added). Considering the use of this broad language, the Court was referring impliedly not just to forfeitures based upon the specific statutes in <em>Boyd </em>or <em>Plymouth Sedan, </em>but to all forfeiture actions requiring evidence of a criminal nature, <em>ie., </em>evidence of criminality. It is this general application of the exclusionary rule to most civil <em>in rem </em>forfeiture proceedings based upon criminal conduct, <em>ie., </em>\u201cquasi-criminal\u201d proceedings, that the eleven federal circuits and thirty-four sister states have accepted and applied. <em>See supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">We also note that the Supreme Court took great pains to distinguish its holding in <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>from <em>United States v. Jeffers, </em>342 U.S. 48, 54, 72 S.Ct. 93, 96, 96 L.Ed. 59 (1951) and <em>Trupiano v. United States, </em>334 U.S. 699, 710, 68 S.Ct. 1229, 1224-35, 92 L.Ed. 1663 (1948). In those cases, the Court stated in dicta that contraband <em>per se, </em>illegally seized and subsequently suppressed under the exclusionary rule, need not be returned to the criminal defendant because the contraband itself is illegal to possess. <em>See Plymouth Sedan, </em>380 U.S. at 698-99, 85 S.Ct. at 1249-50, 14 L.Ed.2d 170. By contrast, in <em>Plymouth Sedan, </em>the Court noted that possession of an automobile is not \u201ceven remotely criminal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 699, 85 S.Ct. at 1250, 14 L.Ed.2d 170. Rather, the Court stated, \u201c[i]t is only the alleged use to which this particular automobile was put that subjects Mr. McGonigle to its possible loss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court went on to explain that like in <em>Boyd, </em>the property involved in the forfeiture proceeding was \u201cnot intrinsically illegal in character.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 700, 85 S.Ct. at 1250, 14 L.Ed.2d 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Just as there was \u201cnothing even remotely criminal in possessing\u201d a 1958 Plymouth, it was not criminal for petitioner to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>own a 1995 Corvette. To prove, therefore, that the derivative contraband in this case, the Corvette, should be forfeited under section 297, respondent must provide evidence of a drug crime or the intention to commit one by petitioner related to the use of the vehicle, just as the Commonwealth in <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>had to prove evidence of contraband <em>per se, </em>the unsealed liquor, to seize Mr. McGonigle\u2019s car. A section 297 forfeiture action is, therefore, \u201cquasi-criminal\u201d litigation because criminality is at the basic foundation of the conduct from which a forfeiture suit may arise under the Maryland statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Finally, we reject respondent\u2019s argument that section 297, unlike the statute in <em>Plymouth Sedan, </em>does not require the actual commission of a crime to trigger a forfeiture action. Respondent cites <em>United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, </em>465 U.S. 354, 104 S.Ct. 1099, 79 L.Ed.2d 361 (1984), and <em>One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, </em>409 U.S. 232, 93 S.Ct. 489, 34 L.Ed.2d 438 (1972), for this proposition that <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>covered only forfeiture actions triggered by a criminal conviction. Both of these cases, however, addressed the Double Jeopardy Clause, which the Supreme Court has repeatedly held does not apply to civil forfeiture proceedings the Legislature does not intend to be \u201cpunitive.\u201d <em>See generally Ursery, </em>518 U.S. 267, 116 S.Ct. 2135, 135 L.Ed.2d 549. That a civil forfeiture statute requires a erimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>nal conviction prior to filing is more relevant under the Double Jeopardy Clause, which, as we have noted, seeks to prevent multiple punishments for the same offense. Considering <em>Austin, </em>the \u201cpunitive\u201d terminology is of much lesser relevance, if applicable at all, in Fourth Amendment cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Moreover, <em>Boyd, </em>upon which <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>relied heavily, concerned a revenue law that authorized forfeiture as a <em>criminal </em>penalty for failure to pay customs duties. Nevertheless, rather than initiating criminal proceedings, the government, in order to utilize a statute authorizing the issuance of a subpoena in non-criminal matters, filed a civil <em>in rem </em>action against the imported goods. The government\u2019s intention was obvious: the importer\u2019s papers were essential to prove the importer had not paid duties on the goods in question. The federal statute used by the government authorized it to issue a subpoena compelling production of such papers \u201c[i]n all suits and proceedings <em>other than criminal, </em>arising under any of the revenue laws of the United States.\u201d <em>Boyd, </em>116 U.S. at 619, 6 S.Ct. at 526, 29 L.Ed. 746 (emphasis added). The government based its subpoena on its \u201cshowing that said action is a suit or proceeding <em>other than criminal, </em>arising under the customs revenue laws of the United States, and <em>not for penalties.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). That the forfeiture derived from \u201can act [authorizing subpoenas,] which expressly excludes criminal proceedings from its operation, (though embracing civil suits for penalties and forfeitures,) and ... an information not technically a criminal proceeding,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 633, 6 S.Ct. at 534, 29 L.Ed. 746, made little difference. The Court emphasized that because the government proceeded using a non-criminal action should not \u201crelieve the proceedings or the law from being obnoxious to the prohibitions\u201d of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">We, too, deal with a statute that does not create a criminal proceeding, even though criminal evidence or contraband <em>per se, i.e., </em>the drugs, is typically necessary to prove a forfeiture case as to derivative contraband, <em>i.e., </em>the car, under section 297. As <em>Boyd </em>points out, \u201c[i]t is the duty of courts to be watchful for the constitutional rights of the citizen, and against any stealthy encroachments thereon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 635, 6 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>535, 29 L.Ed. 746. Like the <em>Boyd </em>Court, we decline to allow the government to avoid compliance with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment as traditionally applicable in criminal cases by proceeding under the auspices of a civil action that authorizes the taking of private property, but only if that property is used, or intended to be used, for criminally-related purposes. To do otherwise might facilitate a practice in which a car or other property, and the financial benefits resulting from forfeiture, might become the primary purpose of the actions rather than the apprehension and conviction of the criminals and their removal from society. <em>See </em>William Patrick Nelson, <em>Should the Ranch Go Free Because the Constable </em>Blundered? <em>Gaining Compliance with Search and Seizure Standards in the Age of Asset Forfeiture, </em>80 Cal. L. Rev. 1309,1325-33 (arguing that pragmatic concerns, <em>i.e., </em>increased budgetary revenue, the ability to use valuable assets in future undercover operations, and an appearance of stronger job performance, have encouraged greater use of forfeiture laws).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">3. Balancing Benefits Versus Social Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Respondent also argues that even if we classify section 297 forfeiture actions as \u201cquasi-criminal,\u201d we still should decline to apply the exclusionary rule because the Supreme Court recently noted that the rule applies only in situations \u201cwhere its deterrence benefits outweigh its \u2018substantial social costs.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation v. Scott, </em>524 U.S. 357, 118 S.Ct. 2014, 2019, 141 L.Ed.2d 344 (1998) (quoting <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 907, 104 S.Ct, 3405, 3412, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984)). Respondent contends that applying the rule to this case would provide minimal deterrence because the loss of the ability to use the evidence in petitioner\u2019s criminal prosecution alone would deter the police, especially given the severity of the criminal penalty versus the loss of his car. As we have indicated, this approach would result in the applicability of the exclusionary rule being dependent, at least in part, on the value of the vehicle seized. Such an approach, in our view, would not be feasible.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number><em>Scott, </em>moreover, is distinguishable because that case dealt only with parole revocation hearings, a type of proceeding completely unrelated to any issue determinative to this case. <em>Scott, </em>524 U.S. at---,-, 118 S.Ct. at 2017-18, 2022, 141 L.Ed.2d 344. The Court noted that parole is essentially an agreement, <em>ie., </em>a contract, between the state and a prisoner, granting \u201ca limited degree of freedom in return for the parolee\u2019s assurance that he will comply with the often strict terms and conditions of his release.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 118 S.Ct. at 2020, 141 L.Ed.2d 344. To allow an exclusionary rule in that context would hinder the state\u2019s ability to maintain close supervision over a parolee and, in turn, prove to the parole board that a parolee has violated his or her end of the \u201cdeal,\u201d <em>ie., </em>contract, thus exacting great societal costs which outweigh any deterrence effect. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">By contrast, in a civil drug-related forfeiture case, the need for deterrence exceeds the societal costs. Without the application of the exclusionary rule to section 297 forfeiture actions, officers could seize contraband, absent sufficient probable cause to do so, even if that same evidence would be inadmissible in a criminal context to prove the wrongdoer\u2019s criminality. We already have recognized that this consideration, \u201cwhether, at the time of the illegal search, the police were aware of the potential effect of using such evidence in civil proceedings\u201d is one factor of several \u201cin considering the motivation behind an improper search and seizure.\u201d <em>Sheetz, </em>315 Md. at 216, 553 A.2d at 1285. The lack of the deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule under circumstances in which probable cause is lacking could lead to a separate line of police work devoted to forfeiture. We are keenly aware that governments increasingly have filed civil forfeiture actions in lieu of criminal charges, knowing that constitutional protections provide greater obstacles to their criminal cases, and that forfeitures have a great financial impact not only on the defendant but on the government\u2019s coffers as well. <em>See </em>Nelson, <em>supra, </em>at 1328 (noting one study in which eighty percent of property owners who lost their assets to forfeiture were never charged with a criminal offense). This practice has become more common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>place despite our repeated warning that in this state, \u201cforfeitures are disfavored in law because they are considered harsh extractions, odious, and to be avoided when possible.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Frederick City Police Dept. v. One 1988 Toyota Pick-up Truck, </em>334 Md. 359, 375, 639 A.2d 641, 649 (1994) (citing <em>United States Coin &amp; Currency v. Director of Finance, </em>279 Md. 185, 187, 367 A.2d 1243, 1244 (1977); <em>Commercial Credit Corp. v. State, </em>258 Md. 192, 199, 265 A.2d 748, 752 (1970)). We believe that the benefits of the deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule outweigh the costs society may incur with its proper application to forfeitures under section 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The holding of <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>remains applicable to civil <em>in rem </em>forfeiture cases.

Only two cases appear to question whether <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>continues to extend the exclusionary rule to civil forfeitures. Both of these cases, however, addressed issues outside the scope of the Fourth Amendment. In <em>State v. One 1990 Chevrolet Corvette, </em>695 A.2d 502, 506 (R.I.1997), the Rhode Island Supreme Court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not apply to civil <em>in rem </em>forfeitures, following <em>United States v. Ursery, </em>518 U.S. 267, 116 S.Ct. 2135, 135 L.Ed.2d 549 (1996). That court noted it earlier had applied the exclusionary rule to a civil liquor license revocation hearing based on <em>Plymouth Sedan. </em>Like respondent in this case, the court pondered whether <em>Ursery </em>had effectively overruled <em>Plymouth Sedan. </em>The court did not answer, but distinguished <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>from <em>Ursery </em>and the case before it because <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>involved the Fourth Amendment, while <em>Ursery </em>involved Fifth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Amendment double jeopardy issues. <em>One 1990 Chevrolet Corvette, </em>695 A.2d at 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">In <em>United States v. One 1988 Ford Mustang, </em>728 F.Supp. 495 (N.D.Ill. 1989), the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois held that the \"proportionality\u201d test used to enforce the Eighth Amendment Excessive Fines Clause does not apply to civil forfeiture cases. In reaching that holding, the court questioned whether <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>was still good law. The holding of <em>One 1988 Ford Mustang </em>has been impliedly overruled, however, by <em>United States v. Bajakajian, </em>524 U.S. 321, 118 S.Ct. 2028, 141 L.Ed.2d 314 (1998), and <em>Austin v. United States, </em>509 U.S. 602, 113 S.Ct. 2801, 125 L.Ed.2d 488 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b182-5\">. <em>Barlow's </em>has since been limited by <em>Donovan v. Dewey, </em>452 U.S. 594, 101 S.Ct. 2534, 69 L.Ed.2d 262 (1981), which held that warrantless administrative searches are constitutionally permissible when alternative protections, namely regularity, are in place and specific enforcement needs exist. <em>Allnutt </em>remains good law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b184-5\">. It is certainly possible that Mr. McGonigle\u2019s automobile could have been worth <em>less </em>than the criminal penally. Given the wide range of available penalties in any given criminal statute compared to the wide range in values of property sought to be forfeited, it would prove difficult to say that a particular forfeiture law <em>always </em>exceeds or does not exceed the related criminal penalties. Under respondent's argument, the application of the exclusionary rule would bear little relation to the nature of the forfeiture statute, or of the forfeiture itself, but only to the value of the item seized. An identical search of two vehicles, one a Rolls Royce and the other, a twenty-year-old economy car, could cause differing applications of the exclusionary rule. Because of the value of the Rolls Royce, the statute might be punitive while, because of the low value of the other vehicle, it might not be. In other words, the evidence might be excluded in one instance and admitted in the other. This argument would lead to the absurd situation where the exclusionary rule would or would not be applicable depending upon the value of the item seized. We note that in <em>Boyd, </em>the civil forfeiture penalty did <em>not </em>exceed the criminal penalty, which <em>included </em>forfeiture, as well as two years imprisonment and a $50 to $5,000 fine. <em>Boyd, </em>116 U.S. at 617, 6 S.Ct. at 525, 29 L.Ed. 746.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b187-6\">. We recognize that in <em>Chase v. State, </em>309 Md. 224, 248, 522 A.2d 1348, 1360 (1987), we cited a major treatise which \"pointed out that the courts which hold that the exclusionary rule applies in forfeiture proceedings rely on <em>Plymouth\u2019s </em>reasoning that the rule applies to proceedings which are 'quasi-criminal' in that their object is to <em>penalize </em>for the commission of an offense against the law and could result in even greater <em>punishment </em>than the criminal prosecution.\" (Emphasis added.) Again, the primary focus in forfeiture cases involving the Fourth Amendment is not on \"punitiveness\" and \"punishment,\" but the Fourth Amendment's purpose of prohibiting \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures.\" <em>See Austin, </em>509 U.S. at 608 n. 4, 113 S.Ct. at 2804, 125 L.Ed.2d 488. The forfeiture statute in <em>Plymouth Sedan </em>had a penalty that, <em>in that case, </em>exceeded the possible criminal penalties, and also contained a condition precedent to the maintenance of the suit, <em>i.e., </em>a criminal conviction. It was, therefore, \"quasi-criminal\u201d in nature, adding support to the Supreme Court's decision. But, the Court did not limit its holding to only that factual context.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b191-8\">RAKER, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AOH\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">I believe Judge Moylan, writing below for the Court of Special Appeals, was correct in his analysis of this ease.
