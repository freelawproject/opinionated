That court reversed respondent\u2019s convictions, holding that the evidence presented to-the jury was not sufficient to support a finding that respondent was present at the scene of the crime, either constructively or actually. Therefore, under the common law rules relating to principals and accessories, that court held that the respondent should not have been convicted as a principal in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">We granted a writ of certiorari to consider whether the common law distinction between principals and accessories remains viable in Maryland. We hold that it does. Accordingly, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">On the date of the underlying crimes, October 17, 1995, respondent was employed by Recycling Incorporated. The company paid its employees\u2019 wages in cash, and the money normally was distributed by DeLisa Holmes, the office manager. Around 11:30 a.m., respondent called Recycling Incorporated\u2019s office to inquire when the payroll would be ready. Ms. Holmes told respondent the payroll would be ready at 12:00 p.m. Respondent then asked how the employees were going to be paid. Ms. Holmes replied that they would be paid in cash, to which respondent replied, \u201cgood.\u201d Respondent picked up his pay in cash at around 12:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>About an hour later, three men wearing dark clothing and carrying guns entered the Recycling Incorporated office. One man walked directly to Brian Fowler, the vice-president of the company, and held a gun on him. A second man put a gun to Ms. Holmes\u2019 head and told her to get the cash. She placed all of the cash, $14,600, in a bag provided by one of the men and the three men left. Ms. Holmes testified that the man who held the gun to her head seemed familiar with the office and knew where the money was located.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Testimony by other witnesses indicated that respondent was the mastermind behind the robbery. Anthony Williams testified that prior to the robbery, respondent told Williams he knew where they could get some easy money and that he had it \u201call planned out.\u201d Respondent targeted the recycling company because it paid its employees in cash and he knew how someone could get in and out quickly. Williams further testified that respondent had a map of the recycling center detailing where the employees would be standing, who should be grabbed, and who might have a gun. Respondent told the others that the robbery should occur between 11:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. and that while the robbery was in process, he would be on his route for the recycling company. The men arranged to meet later to split up the money. Williams further testified that he saw the men involved in the robbery the next day. Respondent said that \u201cit was easy, just like he had planned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">II. Discussion and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"Ay-\">A. Common Law Doctrine of Accessoryship</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">The question for which we issued the writ of certiorari and as phrased in the State\u2019s brief is: \u201cWas the evidence sufficient to establish that [respondent] was an accomplice either because constructive presence is not required to establish accomplice liability or because he was constructively present?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">The underlying issue argued by both parties is whether Maryland should retain the common law distinction between principals and accessories before the fact. The Court of Special Appeals, although criticizing the long-standing Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>land common law rule that distinguishes an accessory before the fact from a principal in the second degree by the requirement that the principal be actually or constructively present, nonetheless reversed respondent\u2019s convictions as a principal in the second degree. That court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-5\">There is, of course, a major legal hurdle regarding the State\u2019s request [to dispense with the distinction between accessories before the fact and principals]. The argument, in <em>Lewis [v. State, </em>285 Md. 705, 404 A.2d 1073 (1979) ], to change the rule mandating that an accessory cannot be tried before the principal is sentenced, was presented to the Maryland Court of Appeals, the State court of last resort authorized to set policy. It may well be that that Court would be favorably disposed to dispense with the distinction between accessories and principals, particularly principals in the second degree. Until and unless the Court of Appeals effectuates such a change, we hold that the evidence before the jury neither directly nor inferentially permitted a finding that [respondent] was constructively or actually present at the scene of the crime. Therefore, he could have been convicted only of being an accessory before the fact, rather than a principal in the second degree. Accordingly, we must reverse the judgements of conviction of [respondent] Sowell.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-6\"><em>Sowell v. State, </em>122 Md.App. 222, 238, 712 A.2d 96, 103-04 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">This Court described the common law distinction between principals and accessories in <em>State v. Ward, </em>284 Md. 189, 197, 396 A.2d 1041, 1046-47 (1978):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-8\">A <em>principal in the first degree </em>is one who actually commits a crime, either by his own hand, or by an inanimate agency, or by an innocent human agent. A <em>principal in the second degree </em>is one who is guilty of felony by reason of having aided, counseled, commanded or encouraged the commission thereof in his presence, either actual or constructive. An <em>accessory before the fact </em>is one who is guilty of felony by reason of having aided, counseled, commanded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>or encouraged the commission thereof, without having been present either actually or constructively at the moment of perpetration. An <em>accessory after the fact </em>is one who, with knowledge of the other\u2019s guilt, renders assistance to a felon in the effort to hinder his detection, arrest, trial or punishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">The main difference between an accessory before the fact and a principal in the second degree is that the latter must be actually or constructively present at the scene of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">As noted by the Court of Special Appeals in its opinion below, the distinction has not been without criticism. In <em>State v. Williamson, </em>282 Md. 100, 112-14, 382 A.2d 588, 594-95 (1978), Judge Levine, concurring, took issue with the majority\u2019s failure to abandon the accessory before the fact distinction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-6\">Since accessories and principals at common law were deemed to be equally culpable and therefore subject to the same punishment, <em>Agresti v. State, </em>2 Md.App. at 281, [234 A.2d 284]; 1 J. Chitty, <em>A Practical Treatise on the Criminal Law </em>*267 (1819); Clark <em>&amp; </em>Marshall, <em>A Treatise on the Law of Crimes </em>\u00a7 8.05, at 522 (7th ed.1967), the classification of parties as principals and accessories had little, if any, substantive significance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-7\">On the other hand, the common law doctrines of accessoryship did give rise to several highly technical procedural rules which, as one recent commentator has stated, \u201ctended to shield accessories from punishment notwithstanding overwhelming evidence of their criminal assistance.\u201d W. La-Fave <em>&amp; </em>A. Scott, <em>Handbook on Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 63, at 498-99 (1972)....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-8\">The reason for the development of these rules is obscure at best. Professor Perkins has speculated that they were devised by 14th and 15th century English common law courts as a means of alleviating the harshness of the death penalty in felony cases. R. Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>669 (2d ed.1989); <em>and see </em>W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, <em>Handbook on </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number><em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 63, at 499 (1972). If this theory of the historical provenience of the common law categories and procedures be correct, it is now beyond question that the rules have outlived their purpose, in light of the universal rejection of capital punishment for any but the most heinous felonies and the manifold constitutional restrictions placed upon application of the death penalty in recent years. <em>See, e.g., Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976); <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972).[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-5\">The common law principles of accomplicity and their procedural counterparts, in my opinion, have injected a most undesirable hyperteehnicality into the law of accomplice responsibility, which not infrequently operates to thwart justice and reduce judicial efficiency. <em>See </em>Note, 19 Wash. &amp; Lee L.Rev. 96 (1962). As this Court candidly stated in <em>Watson v. State, </em>208 Md. at 218, [117 A.2d 549]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-6\">\u201c \u2018This distinguishing of the accessory before the fact from the principal is a pure technicality. It has no existence either in natural reason or the ordinary doctrines of the law. For in natural reason the procurer of a crime is not chargeable differently'from the doer; and a familiar rule of the common law is that what one does through another\u2019s agency is regarded as done by himself---- Likewise in morals, there are circumstances wherein we attach more blame to the accessory before the fact than to his principal;----\u2019\u201d (Quoting 1 J. Bishop, <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 673, at 486-87 (9th ed.1923)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-10\">The time has come in my opinion to discard the common law distinction between principals and accessories before the fact and to replace these categories with an all-encompassing doctrine which would treat all those who knowingly procure, command, counsel, encourage, aid or abet a felon in the commission of a crime as principals regardless of wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>er the aider or abettor was actually or constructively present at the scene of the crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Similar sentiments have been expressed by this Court, but only with regard to the technical procedural rules accompanying the common law doctrine of aceessoryship. <em>See, e.g., Jones v. State, </em>302 Md. 153, 160-61, 486 A.2d 184, 188 (1985) (criticizing as illogical and unreasonable the common law rules that the principal must be convicted before the accessory and that the accessory cannot be convicted of a higher crime than the principal); <em>Lewis, </em>285 Md. at 715, 404 A.2d at 1079 (recognizing as unsound \u201cthe common law rule precluding trial of an accessory until the principal is sentenced\u201d); <em>Ward, </em>284 Md. at 192, 396 A.2d at 1043-44 (pointing out that the technical procedural rules accompanying the common law doctrine of aceessoryship are illogical and \u201cshield accessories from punishment notwithstanding overwhelming evidence of their criminal assistance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Even though in Maryland the common law may be modified by legislative act, Maryland Declaration of Rights, Article 5(a), or by judicial decision, <em>see State v. Hawkins, </em>326 Md. 270, 291-92, 604 A.2d 489, 500-01 (1992), we commented in <em>Ward </em>that \u201cMaryland is one of the few, if not the only state, which has retained this doctrine in virtually the same form as it existed at the time of William Blackstone in the 18th century, and it represents the law of Maryland at the present time.\u201d <em>Ward, </em>284 Md. at 191, 396 A.2d at 1043.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">All of the states substantively modifying the common law rule appear to have done so legislatively. The states that have legislatively modified the common law by explicit statutory language abolishing the distinction or language legislatively nullifying the distinction, albeit retaining some of the common law terminology, are Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. <em>See </em>Model Penal Code \u00a7 2.04, App. at 40-41 (Tentative Draft No. 1, 1956) (\u201cEvery American jurisdiction except Maryland has also legislated on the subject.\u201d); Model Penal Code \u00a7 2.06 cmt. 1, n. 3 (1985) (Official Draft and Revised Comments). <em>See also </em>Wayne R. LaFave &amp; Austin W. Scott, Jr., Criminal Law \u00a7 6.6(e), at 574-75 (2d ed.1986).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Even the birthplace of the common law, England, abrogated some of the technicalities of the doctrine of accessoryship, albeit by legislative reform. <em>See id. </em>(citing The Accessories and Abettors Act, 1861, 24 <em>&amp; </em>25 Viced, ch. 94 (Eng.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">This Court has abrogated judicially some aspects of the common law of accessoryship. For instance, in <em>Hawkins, </em>326 Md. at 294, 604 A.2d at 501, we abolished the common law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>limitation that an accessory after the fact may not be a principal in either degree in the commission of a substantive felony. In <em>Jones, </em>302 Md. at 159-61, 486 A.2d at 188, we held that an accessory before the fact may be convicted of a greater crime than the principal. <em>Lewis, </em>285 Md. at 715-16, 404 A.2d at 1077-78, abrogated the common law requirement that a principal must be convicted before the accessory. Finally, in <em>Ward, </em>284 Md. at 207, 396 A.2d at 1048, we held that there may be an accessory before the fact for murder in the second degree. Nonetheless, this Court has yet to address expressly the specific issue at hand of whether Maryland should abandon the common law doctrine of accessoryship. <em>See Ward, </em>284 Md. at 191 n. 3, 396 A.2d at 1043 n. 3; <em>Williamson, </em>282 Md. at 110, 382 A.2d at 593. This Court is not precluded from altering a common law rule in situations in which \u201cin light of changed conditions or increased knowledge, ... the rule has become unsound in the circumstances of modern life, a vestige of the past, no longer suitable to our people.\u201d <em>State v. Wiegmann, </em>350 Md. 585, 604, 714 A.2d 841, 850 (1998) (quoting <em>Harrison, </em>295 Md. at 459, 456 A.2d at 903). <em>See also Gaver v. Harrant, </em>316 Md. 17, 28, 557 A.2d 210, 216 (1989); <em>State v. Minster, </em>302 Md. 240, 245-46, 486 A.2d 1197, 1199-1200 (1985); <em>Williams v. State, </em>292 Md. 201, 217, 438 A.2d 1301, 1309 (1981); <em>Felder v. Butler, </em>292 Md. 174, 182-83, 438 A.2d 494, 499 (1981); <em>Adler v. American Standard Corp., </em>291 Md. 31, 42-43, 432 A.2d 464, 471 (1981); <em>Condore v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>289 Md. 516, 530-31, 425 A.2d 1011, 1018 (1981); <em>Kline v. Ansell, </em>287 Md. 585, 590, 414 A.2d 929, 931 (1980); <em>White v. King, </em>244 Md. 348, 354, 223 A.2d 763, 767 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">\u201c[I]n considering whether a long-established common law rule\u2014unchanged by the legislature and thus reflective of this state\u2019s public policy\u2014is unsound in the circumstances of modern life, we have always recognized that declaration of the public policy of Maryland is normally the function of the General Assembly.\u201d <em>Gaver, </em>316 Md. at 28-29, 557 A.2d at 216 (quoting <em>Harrison, </em>295 Md. at 460, 456 A.2d at 903). We have recognized that the General Assembly\u2019s failure to amend or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>abrogate a common law rule sometimes reflects its desired public policy. <em>See Wiegmann, </em>350 Md. at 605, 714 A.2d at 850-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The Legislature did relax an aspect of accessoryship in 1906 when it amended the formal requirements for indictments in homicide cases, allowing the State to charge an accused as either a principal or accessory with one form. <em>See </em>1906 Md. Laws, Chap. 248. That provision provided: \u201cIn any indictment for murder or manslaughter, <em>or for being an accessory thereto, </em>it shall not be necessary to set forth the manner or means of death.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We explained the intent behind the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-6\">\u201cStatutes similar in character to that now under consideration have been enacted in many of the American states as well as in England, in an effort to escape the excessive formalism of the common law, which formerly made the conviction or acquittal of one charged with crime so often turn upon some technical quibble rather than upon the guilt or innocence of the accused, and the uniform tendency of the courts has been to uphold them wherever that could be done without infringing the right of the accused to the protection of such constitutional guarantees, as the right to be informed of the charge against him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-7\"><em>Williamson, </em>282 Md. at 109-10, 382 A.2d at 593 (quoting <em>Neusbaum v. State, </em>156 Md. 149, 157-58, 143 A. 872, 876 (1928)). We additionally noted in <em>Williamson </em>that no other significant or otherwise relevant amendment to the provision had occurred since the 1906 Act. <em>Id. </em>at 109, 382 A.2d at 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">Tellingly, the Legislature has not, since the 1906 Act relating only to homicide, attempted to abrogate the common law doctrine of accessoryship for any other crime. In fact, as recently as 1994, the Committee Note<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to 1994 Maryland Laws, Chapter 712 indicated with regard to the revision of the burglary and related offenses provision: \u201cCurrent [statutory] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>provisions referring to an \u2018accessory before the fact\u2019 or to \u2018causing\u2019, \u2018aiding\u2019, or \u2018counselling\u2019 a burglary offense have been repealed. The Committee believes that the common law on accomplice liability adequately covers these types of actions.\u201d The Legislature thus chose to continue to allow the law of aecessoryship to be controlled by the common law with its enactment of Chapter 712. It did so despite several opinions by this Court limiting the doctrine\u2019s technical rules and expressing some disagreement with the restrictions of the common law. The Legislature is presumed to be aware of this Court\u2019s holdings. <em>See Wiegmann, </em>350 Md. at 606, 714 A.2d at 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">As petitioner notes and as we readily have admitted, several opinions written by this Court over the course of the last twenty years have abrogated certain requirements relating to aecessoryship, such as the requirement that a principal must be convicted before the accessory. <em>See Lewis, </em>285 Md. at 716, 404 A.2d at 1079. What is important to note is that these opinions abrogated merely the \u201ctechnical procedural rules accompanying the common law doctrine of aecessoryship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 715, 404 A.2d at 1079.. For instance, the procedural rale rejected in <em>Lewis </em>related to when the accessory may be tried, not the doctrine of aecessoryship itself. Similarly, in <em>Jones, </em>302 Md. at 160-61, 486 A.2d at 188, we held an accessory before the fact may be convicted of a greater crime than the principal, noting that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-6\">[mjerely because the evidence in the principal\u2019s trial may have been different, or the principal may have agreed to a favorable plea bargain arrangement, or the jury in the principal\u2019s trial may have arrived at a compromise verdict, is not a good reason for allowing the accessory to escape the consequences of having committed a particular offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 161, 486 A.2d at 188. In <em>Jones </em>we only abrogated a procedural aspect of the doctrine of aecessoryship, not the doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">Finally, as we mentioned, <em>supra, </em>although Maryland apparently is the only jurisdiction that has not rejected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>common law distinctions between principals and accessories, the majority of the other jurisdictions rejecting the distinctions have done so legislatively. Given the relative importance in completely abrogating an ancient and historic common law doctrine such as aecessoryship, we believe such a task is generally better left to the legislative body of this State. <em>See, e.g., Wiegmann, </em>350 Md. at 607, 714 A.2d at 851-52 (declining to abolish the common law rule permitting persons to resist illegal arrests). We decline, at this time, to abrogate the doctrine by judicial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">B. Constructive Presence</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Because we decline to abolish the common law distinctions between principals and accessories, we must address whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding \u201cthe evidence before the jury neither directly nor inferentially permitted a finding that [respondent] was constructively or actually present at the scene of the crime.\u201d <em>Sowell, </em>122 Md.App. at 238, 712 A.2d at 104. The standard for our review of the sufficiency of the evidence is \u201cwhether after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Bloodsworth v. State, </em>307 Md. 164, 167, 512 A.2d 1056, 1057 (1986) (citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 313, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2785, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)); <em>see also State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 478-79, 649 A.2d 336, 337 (1994); <em>Dawson v. State, </em>329 Md. 275, 281, 619 A.2d 111, 114 (1993); <em>McMillian v. State, </em>325 Md. 272, 289, 600 A.2d 430, 439 (1992); <em>Wilson v. State, </em>319 Md. 530, 535, 573 A.2d 831, 833 (1990). Our concern, therefore, is not whether the verdict was in accord with the weight of the evidence but rather, whether there was sufficient evidence produced at trial \u201cthat either showed directly, or circumstantially, or supported a rational inference of facts which could fairly convince a trier of fact of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offenses charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Stanley, </em>351 Md. 733, 750, 720 A.2d 323, 331 (1998); <em>Albrecht, </em>336 Md. at 479, 649 A.2d at 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>The indictment, as relevant to the issue before the Court, provided in the first count: \u201cThe Grand Jurors ... do present that Brian Lamont Sowell ... feloniously with a dangerous and deadly weapon did rob ... and violently did steal.\u201d The second count provided that respondent \u201cfeloniously did rob ... and violently did steal.\u201d In the third and sixth count, the indictment provided: \u201cThe Grand Jurors ... do present that Brian Lamont Sowell ... did unlawfully use a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence.\u201d In the seventh count, the indictment provided: \u201cThe Grand Jurors ... do present that Brian Lamont Sowell ... did unlawfully assault.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As is evident, the language of the indictment fails to charge respondent specifically as a principal or as an accessory.

We then went on to hold that the defendant in that case need not have been indicted specifically as an accessory or principal because the General Assembly by legislative enactment relaxed the formal indictment requirements for accomplices in cases of homicide. 1906 Md.

The mere presence of the Defendants at the time and place of the commission of the crime is not enough to prove that they aided and abetted. But if presence is proven, it is a fact that may be considered along with all of the surrounding circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-12\">However, <em>presence at the scene of a crime can be sufficient, if it was intended to and does aid the primary actor; </em>for example, standing by as a lookout to warn the primary actor of danger.

In <em>Ward, </em>284 Md. at 197, 396 A.2d at 1046-47, we explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-6\">[a] <em>principal in the second degree </em>is one who is guilty of felony by reason of having aided, counseled, commanded or encouraged the commission thereof in his presence, either actual or constructive. An <em>accessory before the fact </em>is one who is guilty of felony by reason of having aided, counseled, commanded or encouraged the commission thereof, without having been present either actually or constructively at the moment of perpetration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">We further described in detail the distinction between principals in the second degree and accessories before the fact in <em>Williamson, </em>282 Md. at 103-04, 382 A.2d at 590 (quoting 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-8\">\u201cA principal in the ... second degree ... is who is present, aiding and abetting the fact to be done. Which <em>presence </em>need not always be an actual immediate standing by, within sight or hearing of the fact; but there may be also a constructive presence, as when one commits a robbery or murder and another keeps watch or guard at some conve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>nient distance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>282 Md. at 103, 382 A.2d at 590. (Emphasis in original.) (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-5\">\u201cAs to the second point, who may be an accessary <em>before </em>the fact; Sir Matthew Hale defines him to be one who, being absent at the time of the crime committed, doth yet procure, counsel, or command another to commit a crime. Herein absence is necessary to make him an accessary; for if such procurer, or the like, be present, he is guilty of the crime as principal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">The concept of constructive presence is fairly broad, as one need not be in sight or hearing of the crime being committed to be a principal in the second degree. The test is not whether the alleged principal in the second degree could see the scene of the crime, but whether he or she could render assistance to the actual perpetrator. <em>See Williamson, </em>282 Md. at 105, 382 A.2d at 591 (\u201cA person is regarded as constructively present, within the rules relating to parties in criminal cases, whenever he is cooperating with the perpetrator and is so situated as to be able to aid him, with a view known to the other, to insure success in the accomplishment of the common purpose.\u201d (quotations and citation omitted)); <em>McBryde, </em>30 Md.App. at 360, 352 A.2d at 326 (\u201cA person is constructively present, hence guilty as a principal, if he is acting with the person who actually commits the deed in pursuance of a common design, and is aiding his associate, either by keeping watch or otherwise or is so situated as to be able to aid him, with a view, known to the other, to insure success in the accomplishment of the common enterprise.\u201d (citation omitted)). In <em>Williamson, </em>for example, even though the defendant was physically close enough to the scene of her husband\u2019s murder to render assistance to the killer, there was no evidence that she in fact was present in order to render aid of any kind; thus she could not, even though nearby, be convicted as a principal in the second degree.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Williamson, </em>282 Md. at 105, 382 A.2d at 591. By contrast, the defendants in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number><em>McBryde, </em>although not within sight of the scene of the crime, were waiting nearby to aid the principal in the first degree in his escape after he robbed a convenience store and thus were principals in the second degree. <em>McBryde, </em>30 Md.App. at 360, 352 A.2d at 326-27. The common element in constructive presence for the purpose of proving a defendant was a principal in the second degree, therefore, is the ability, desire, and design to render any necessary aid to the principal in the first degree during the commission of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">One commentator is in accord with this interpretation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-6\">A person is constructively present when he is physically absent from the situs of the crime but aids and abets the principal in the first degree at the time of the offense from some distance. This may happen when one stands watch for the primary actor, signals to the principal from a distance that the victim is coming, or stands ready (though out of sight) to render aid to the principal if needed. However, one must be close enough to render aid if needed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">LaFave &amp; Scott, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 6.6(b), at 571 (footnotes omitted). <em>See also Commonwealth v. Allen, </em>441 S.W.2d 424, 429 (Ky. 1969), a case in which the Kentucky Supreme Court held the defendant liable as a principal in the second degree for the sale of unregistered stocks because even though he was not physically present at the scene of the crime, he made himself available at his home and office by telephone to aid in the commission of the sale. The court noted that \u201c[t]he requirement of \u2018constructive presence\u2019 is satisfied if the aider and abettor can (1) arrive on the scene if necessary to render aid and assistance in the perpetration of the crime, or (2) watch out for trouble and give the perpetrator of the crime information of approaching danger, or (3) take part in aiding the escape of the perpetrator after the commission of the crime.\u201d <em>See also State v. Gregory, </em>37 N.C.App. 693, 695, 247 S.E.2d 19, 21 (1978) (\u201cActual distance from the scene is not always determinative of constructive presence; however, defendant must be close enough to be able to render assistance if needed and to encourage the crime\u2019s actual perpetration.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>Turning to the case at hand, the evidence tended to show that respondent went to Recycling Incorporated to pick up his wages at approximately 12:30 p.m. About an hour later, the three men who ultimately committed the robbery and other crimes entered Recycling Incorporated\u2019s offices and took the cash. Respondent was not present on the premises or nearby when the crimes took place. One witness testified that prior to the commission of the crimes, respondent drove to the area where the actors were waiting in parked cars and told them to go ahead. The witness testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-5\">A. He pulls up to the car, his side of the car in the front.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-6\">Q. And then drives off?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-7\">A. He says go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-8\">Q.

[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-14\">Another witness testified as to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-15\">Q____ [W]hat, if anything, did [respondent] say about where he would be when the robbery took place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-17\">THE WITNESS: <em>He said he was going to go out on his route so it wouldn\u2019t look like he had anything to do with it, </em>and that he would meet them back around Tuley Street right after everything happened, and then they would split the money up. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-18\">There was no evidence presented that respondent waited as a lookout or in a getaway car during the robbery. In fact, the evidence showed that respondent purposefully absented himself from the scene of the crime to avoid suspicion about his involvement. That he \u201cscouted out\u201d the situation <em>before </em>the robbery and signaled to the actors to \u201cgo ahead\u201d with their plan, although making him an accessory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>before the fact, does not render respondent actually or constructively present during the crime for purposes of principal in the second degree liability. There was no evidence that respondent had the ability to render aid to the principals during the actual commission of the crimes. Although the evidence tended to show that respondent was the mastermind of the robbery and planned the crimes from beginning to end, the simple fact is that he was not present, either actually or constructively, during the commission of these crimes. Accordingly, we hold there was not sufficient evidence from which to convict respondent as a principal in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">We hold that until the Legislature provides otherwise, Maryland retains the common law distinction between principals and accessories. Respondent was tried only as a principal in the second degree, which requires presence, not as an accessory before the fact, which does not require presence. Accordingly, we must affirm the Court of Special Appeals and reverse respondent\u2019s convictions because there was not sufficient evidence to find that he was present, actually or constructively, at the scene of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b768-9\">. Terrell Roshsay Pinkney was tried with respondent as a co-defendant and convicted of armed robbery, robbery, two counts of use of a handgun, false imprisonment, and first degree assault for his participation in the robbery at Recycling Incorporated. Mr. Pinkney and respondent both appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. That court affirmed the judgments as to Mr. Pinkney. Mr. Pinkney takes no part in the present appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b772-11\">. Many of these restrictions on the application of the death penalty ' subsequently have been modified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b774-6\">. California, for example, expressly abrogated the common law distinction and the need to indict an accused specifically as a principal or an accessory in 1872. <em>See </em>Cal.Penal Code, \u00a7 971 (West 1985). That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-7\">The distinction between an accessory before the fact and a principal, and between principals in the first and second degree is abrogated; and all persons concerned in the commission of a crime, who by the operation of other provisions of this code are principals therein, shall hereafter be prosecuted, tried and punished as principals and no other facts need be alleged in any-accusatory pleading against any such person than are required in an accusatory pleading against a principal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">Alabama similarly abolished the common law distinction between an accessory before the fact and a principal as well as the distinction between principals in the first and second degree as early as 1852. <em>See Stokley v.

To echo the words of Judge Irving Levine, the time has come to discard the <em>common law </em>distinction between principals and accessories before the fact and to replace these categories with an ail-encompassing doctrine which would treat all those who knowingly procure, command, counsel, encourage, aid or abet a felon in the commission of a crime as principals regardless of whether the actor was present at the place of the crime. <em>See State v. Williamson, </em>282 Md. at 114, 382 A.2d at 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Writing for the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Williamson, </em>36 Md.App. at 413, 374 A.2d at 914, Judge Thomas Hunter Lowe, in his perfervid dissent, noted the futility in awaiting a legislative change of the common law distinction between accessories before the fact and principals. He wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-6\">It is hardly conceivable that in the 20th Century, a court of last resort could so clearly recognize the utter purposelessness of so horrendously harmful a semantic distinction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>yet must still recognize its viability. Worse yet is the fact that more than two decades have passed since this \u2018pure technicality ... [which] has no existence either in natural reason or .the ordinary doctrines of the law ... \u2019 was held up to ridicule in that case, and the Legislature has done nothing to correct it. Nor did our own attempt at flagging this fictional foolishness in <em>Agresti v. State, </em>2 Md.App. 278, 281, 234 A.2d 284, elicit a statutory erasure of that common law blot upon jurisdictional reasoning, as has been accomplished in many, if not most common law jurisdictions. See 40 Am.Jur.2d, <em>Homicide </em>\u00a7\u00a7 28, 29; 21 Am.Jur.2d, <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7\u00a7 120-124; 22 C.J.S. <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 82; see also 95 A.L.R.2d 175, 178, 187.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">(Alteration and omissions in original) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">The judicial system and the common law created the doctrine in question, and thus, it is appropriate for the judicial branch of government to correct the anomaly when we recognize that the distinction is not practical, useful, or fair. As Judge Lowe noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-7\">This has caused us factually to distinguish and interpretatively whittle away at the rule, but such intellectual exercises hardly do justice to the judicial system. Because it was not the legislative branch but the common law judicial system that created the technical monster, I would no longer await the action of a Legislature which may well be too occupied with matters of state to clean up the jurisprudential cobwebs we have accumulated. The common law is a growing thing and when it outgrows old garments not only of no further use but of .potential harm, they should be discarded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 413-14,374 A.2d at 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">This Court, in this ease, should change the law, to be applied prospectively, and should no longer cling to a common law rule that has been rejected by <em>every </em>state in the nation. Whatever may have been the reason for the rule governing the indictment of the actor as a principal or accessory before the fact, that reason, as we noted in <em>Lewis </em>regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>sequence of the principal\u2019s and accessory\u2019s trials, has long since disappeared. As observed by Judge Levine in <em>Williamson, </em>and Judge Eldridge in <em>Lewis, </em>the procedural rules probably were devised by 14th and 15th century English courts as a means of alleviating the harshness of the death penalty in all felony cases. <em>Williamson, </em>282 Md. at 113, 382 A.2d at 595; <em>Lewis, </em>285 Md. at 715, 404 A.2d at 1079; <em>see also Watson v.

Today, the death penalty in Maryland, with two exceptions, is reserved for principals in the first degree, and thus, the original purpose of the distinction\u2014to restrict excessive executions when all felonies were punishable by death\u2014no longer exists.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Perkins &amp; Boyce, Criminal Law, <em>Parties to Crime </em>at 759 (3d ed. 1982) (\u201cSince the reason for the principal-accessory distinction ceased to exist when most felonies were removed from the category of capital crimes, the distinction itself should be abrogated ... \u201d). Further, the punishment for accessories before the fact in Maryland is the same as for principals. <em>See Ward, </em>284 Md. at 210, 396 A.2d at 1053 (\u201cAs an accessory before the fact he is punished as a partaker of the guilt of the principal and is hable to the same punishment as the principal.\u201d). The distinction has outlived its purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The majority recounts the recent occasions this Court has changed the common law as to principals and accessories, but distinguishes those cases on the ground that the changes were merely technical changes. Maj. op. at 725. <em>See, e.g., Lewis v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number><em>State, </em>285 Md. at 715, 404 A.2d at 1079 (noting that \u201cthe technical procedural rules accompanying the common law doctrine of accessoryship are illogical\u201d). The majority misconstrues the Court\u2019s reference to <em>technical procedural rules. </em>The' common law requirement that an actor be charged either as a principal or an accessory before the fact falls within this Court\u2019s concept of technical procedural rules and is a distinction without a difference. As Judge Levine explained in his concurring opinion in <em>Williamson, </em>282 Md. at 112-13, 382 A.2d at 594-95:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-5\">[Tjhe common law doctrines of accessoryship did give rise to several highly technical procedural rules which, as one recent commentator has stated, \u201ctended to shield accessories from punishment notwithstanding overwhelming evidence of their criminal assistance.\u201d W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, <em>Handbook on Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 63, at 498-99 (1972). These rules make their appearance in essentially three areas: 1) jurisdiction; 2) trial; and 3) pleading. As to the first, jurisdiction, the rule was that an accessory could be put on trial only in that jurisdiction in which the act of accessory-ship was committed, irrespective of the situs of the felony, itself. <em>State v. Chapin, </em>17 Ark. 561, 566 (1856); R. Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>671 (2d ed.1969).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-6\">Insofar as trial procedure is concerned, an accessory before the fact at common law could not be tried before the principal. Thus, if the principal were acquitted or his identity never established, an accessory to the felony could never be brought to trial, thereby escaping punishment altogether. <em>Commonwealth v. Phillips, </em>16 Mass. 423, 425 (1820); L. Hochheimer, <em>The Law of Crimes and Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 38, at 23 (1897).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-7\">Finally, the rule as to pleading, invoked by the Court of Special Appeals to reverse appellee\u2019s conviction, has produced the result that one charged with the commission of a felony as a principal cannot be convicted of that crime if the evidence actually produced shows only that the accused had acted as an accessory before the fact. <em>Agresti v. State, </em>2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>Md.App. at 284, 234 A.2d 284.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] Conversely, if an individual is charged in the indictment solely as an accessory before the fact, subsequent proof of his guilt as a principal will not result in a conviction. <em>McBryde and Bland v. State, </em>30 Md.App. [357] at 360[, 352 A.2d 324].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">We are dealing here with the procedural, technical common law rule as to pleading and a variance between the charge and the proof \u201cspread over the principal and accessory categories.\u201d LaFave &amp; Scott, Substantive Criminal Law, <em>Parties to Crime, </em>\u00a7 6.6(d)(2) (1986 &amp; 1999 Supp.). It is as appropriate for this Court to eliminate the charging requirement as it was to abolish the requirement that the principal must be tried before the accessory before the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">It is well-settled that, while a court should afford due respect to the important doctrine of <em>stare decisis, </em>that doctrine \u201cis not to be construed as preventing us from changing a rule of law if we are convinced that the rule has become unsound in the circumstances of modern life.\u201d <em>White v. King, </em>244 Md. 348, 354, 223 A.2d 763 (1966); <em>Hearst Corp. v. State Dept. of A &amp; T., </em>269 Md. 625, 643-644, 308 A.2d 679, 689 (1973). We have repeatedly recognized and stated that \u201c[t]his Court has manifested a willingness to change common law rules which have \u2018become unsound in the circumstances of modern life.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>302 Md. 153, 161, 486 A.2d 184, 188 (1985) (quoting <em>Lewis, </em>285 Md. at 715, 404 A.2d at 1079); <em>Boblitz v. Boblitz, </em>296 Md. 242, 273, 462 A.2d 506, 521 (1983); <em>Moxley v. Acker, </em>294 Md. 47, 52, 447 A.2d 857, 859-60 (1982); <em>Williams v. State, </em>292 Md. 201, 217, 438 A.2d 1301, 1309 (1981); <em>Pope v. State, </em>284 Md. 309, 342, 396 A.2d 1054, 1073 (1979). As Judge Eldridge noted, again, in <em>Lewis, </em>285 Md. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>715, 404 A.2d at 1078, the common law is not static, is subject to change, and adapts itself to changing conditions and increasing knowledge. And finally, as Justice Holmes stated, as to <em>stare decisis:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-5\">It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV. It is still more revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Holmes, <em>The Path of the Law, </em>10 Harv. L.Rev. 457, 469 (1897).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">The majority points to the recent code revision of Burglary and the Legislative election \u201cto continue to allow the law of accessoryship to be controlled by the common law with its enactment of Chapter 712.\u201d Maj. op. at 725. The Committee to Revise Article 27\u2014Crimes and Punishments of the Annotated Code of Maryland conducts a piecemeal revision of the criminal code, and in the recent Burglary revision, the retention of the law of accessoryship should not be read as legislative approval for the common law of accessoryship. The committee addressed the substance of the crime, and likely did not find it appropriate to eliminate the pleading requirement for an accessory before the fact for simply one crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">The common law rules as to accomplices and the procedural pleading requirements have, as Judge Levine observed, \u201cinjected a most undesirable hyper-technicality into the law of accomplice responsibility, which not infrequently operates to thwart justice and reduce judicial efficiency.\u201d <em>Williamson, </em>282 Md. at 113, 382 A.2d at 595. In that the only justification for retaining the distinction between accomplice and principal is the \u201csheer antiquity of the doctrine,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 115, 382 A.2d at 596, this Court should obliterate the distinction. These procedural traps for the prosecution are, as Judge Lowe observed, as fundamentally unfair as it would be to have set them for the accused. No unfair prejudice will inure to the accused by the elimination of this distinction. <em>See Williamson, </em>282 Md. at 114, 382 A.2d at 595-96. \u201cThe concept of fair play which we recognize as a basic tenet of Anglo-American jurisprudence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>not reserved solely for the accused. Society should share in it equally.\u201d <em>Williamson, </em>36 Md.App. at 414, 374 A.2d at 915 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">While recognizing that Maryland is the only state which retains the common law rule as to accessoryship, the majority points out that in all the other states, the change was made by the legislature and not the courts. There are several responses to this argument. First, very few states, if any, have retained the criminal common law as has Maryland. Second, in <em>Hawkins, Ward, Lewis, </em>and <em>Jones, </em>in changing the law of accessoryship, this Court never looked to the manner in which the other states changed the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">The majority states that \u201cthe General Assembly\u2019s failure to amend or abrogate a common law rule sometimes reflects its desired public policy.\u201d Maj. op. at 723-24. I agree with that proposition. The principle must be read in context, however. In that this Court has recognized that the archaic common law rules as to accessoryship are obsolete, <em>see Jones, </em>302 Md. at 158, 486 A.2d at 187, the majority surely cannot mean that letting a guilty defendant \u201coff\u2019 on a technical pleading error such as we are discussing is reflective of the public policy of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">This Court should clean up its own cobwebs and abolish the distinction between principals and accessories.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b787-7\">. This Court has changed some aspects of the common law of accessoryship. For example, <em>see State v. Hawkins, 326 </em>Md. 270, 604 A.2d 489 (1992) (Orth, J.) (Court of Appeals changed common law rule of aceessoryship to allow verdict of guilty as an accessory after the fact along with verdict of guilty on the substantive offense); <em>Jones v. State, </em>302 Md. 153, 486 A.2d 184 (1985) (Eldridge, J.) (Court of Appeals changed common law rule to allow accessory before the fact to be convicted of a greater crime than that of which the principal was convicted); <em>Lewis v. State, </em>285 Md. 705, 404 A.2d 1073 (1979) (Eldridge, J.) (Court of Appeals changed common law to allow accessories before the fact and accessories after to the fact to be tried before the principal in certain circumstances).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b789-6\">. The first exception, recently enacted by the Legislature, is that a principal in the second degree is death-eligible for the murder of a law enforcement officer killed in the performance of his duties, if the principal willfully, deliberately, and with premeditation intended the death of the law enforcement officer, was a major participant in the murder, and was actually present at the time and place of the murder. Chapter 538, Acts of 1998, effective October 1, 1998 (codified at Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 1998 Supp.), Article 27, \u00a7 413(d)(1), (e)(1)). The second exception is that a person who engages or employs another person to commit murder is death-eligible where the murder was committed pursuant to an agreement or contract for remuneration or the promise of remuneration. Art. 27, \u00a7 413(d)(7), (e)(l)(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b791-7\">. Professors Perkins and Boyce cite <em>Agresti </em>v. <em>State, </em>2 Md.App. 278, 234 A.2d 284 (1967), as an example of the application of the common law rule that one charged only as an accessory could not be convicted if the evidence established that he was instead a principal. Perkins &amp; Boyce, Criminar Law, <em>Parties to Crime </em>at 754 n. 77 and accompanying text (3d ed.1982). They note that as a result, it was possible for an accomplice to avoid conviction altogether because of uncertainty as to whether he had been present at the time the offense was committed by the principal. <em>Id. </em>at 754-55.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b793-8\">WILNER, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AvW\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">Along with Judge Raker, I concur in the result reached by the majority. As is she, I am persuaded that the remaining distinction in the Maryland common law between principals and accessories is an anachronism that serves no useful purpose and ought to be abolished. It is a common law rule that is fully within our power to change. Judge Cathell\u2019s research discloses, however, that, notwithstanding its common law status, in all of the other States where the rule has been changed, the change has been made by the State Legislature, and that does give me some pause. That the distinction has not been abolished by the Maryland General Assembly may well be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>explained, as Judge Lowe, a former Speaker of the House of Delegates, noted in <em>Williamson v. State, </em>36 Md.App. 405, 414, 374 A.2d 909, 914 (1977) (Lowe, J., dissenting), not by any policy opposition to a change, but simply by the fact that the Legislature simply is \u201ctoo occupied with matters of state to clean up the jurisprudential cobwebs we have accumulated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>I am not aware that the General Assembly, in recent times, has been asked to make the change.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">I would urge the Article 27 Committee, created by the General Assembly for the purpose of making appropriate recommendations for substantive changes to the Criminal Code, to consider this matter and to make a recommendation to the next (2000) session of the Legislature, so that it will have the matter squarely before it. We can then see if it feels as we do\u2014that this distinction ought to be repealed\u2014and we can be guided accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
