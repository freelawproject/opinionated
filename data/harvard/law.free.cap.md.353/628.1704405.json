He received concurrent sentences totaling three years; however, all but nine months were suspended with three years of probation to be served thereafter. The judgment was affirmed by the Court of Special Appeals. We granted petitioner\u2019s Petition for Writ of Certiorari to address the question: \u201cDid the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that Petitioner\u2019s objection to the admission of other crimes evidence was not preserved by his motion <em>in </em>limine?\u201d We hold that the Court of Special Appeals did not err. We shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Encompassed within the question presented is petitioner\u2019s attack on the continued viability of the \u201ccontemporaneous objection rule.\u201d That rule, with respect to criminal actions, is set forth in Maryland Rule 4-323(a) and provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-9\">(a) <em>Objections to evidence. </em>An objection to the admission of evidence shall be made at the time the evidence is offered or as soon thereafter as the grounds for objection become apparent. Otherwise, the objection is waived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">Petitioner\u2019s primary request is that this Court change its long-standing position that when trial courts <em>deny </em>motions <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence, thereby permitting the admission of evidence, the issue of admissibility ordinarily is not preserved for appellate review unless contemporaneous objections are made at the time the evidence is later introduced at trial. By his request, petitioner asks us to revisit <em>Prout v. State, </em>311 Md. 348, 535 A.2d 445 (1988), where we held, in the circumstances of that case, that a trial court\u2019s order pursuant to a motion <em>in limine </em>that resulted in the exclusion of evidence sufficed to preserve the evidentiary issue for appeal. Petition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>er urges us to extend the holding in <em>Prout </em>to motions <em>in limine </em>rulings that permit the admission of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">We restate the facts as summarized in petitioner\u2019s brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-7\">The State\u2019s case consisted of the testimony of three police officers involved in a narcotics surveillance on January 17, 1997 in the Aspen Hill area of Montgomery County. The subject of that surveillance was an individual described as a black male with hair in corn rows wearing a black leather jacket who was reportedly in possession of a quantity of CDS. One of the officers conducting the surveillance, Detective Mark Yamada, testified that he eventually spotted this individual, whom he identified as the Petitioner, in an apartment complex at the intersection of Bel Pre Road and Georgia Avenue. Yamada saw the Petitioner get into a Chrysler New Yorker with two other black males and followed them to the Leisure World Shopping Center, where he saw the Petitioner and a second male make calls at a pay phone. The men then left that shopping center and drove to the Aspen Manor Shopping Center. Yamada continued his surveillance until a time later on when the three men were arrested by other officers in the surveillance team. Pursuant to that arrest, suspected cocaine was seized---- According to Yamada\u2019s testimony, the substance recovered, which was later verified to be cocaine, was an \u201ceight-ball\u201d which could be broken down into smaller units. He stated that its wholesale value would be anywhere from $120 to $160.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">Other officers offered testimony at trial supporting these facts. The defense produced somewhat contradictory evidence as to the occurrences at the Aspen Manor Shopping Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">One of the detectives in the case took a statement from petitioner after he had been arrested, advised of his rights, and petitioner had waived those rights. Prior to trial, petitioner filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude portions of that statement, which initially was granted. The motion later was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>reconsidered by another judge, who ultimately denied the motion to exclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The detective who took petitioner\u2019s statement testified at trial. In his testimony, the detective testified as to the questions and answers comprising petitioner\u2019s statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-6\">Okay. The first question I asked him, do you use or sell drugs? [Petitioner] responded a little of both. I smoke willies. It is a street term for marijuana laced with crack. I score for myself to smoke willies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">What is the most you have ever sold, I asked. $100. I go buy it and pinch off some for myself when I sell it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-8\">Where did you get the crack you had tonight? He said I got it from DC. Were you going to sell it? I was going to smoke it, was his answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-9\">Were you going to sell it to the girl? And 1 put in parentheses Brigdon. No, she didn\u2019t know anything about it. I have seen her around, but I didn\u2019t really know her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-10\">At that point, I put a line across the end of the conversation we had and both [petitioner] and I signed it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">This testimony was given without objection. It was only later when the State offered the written statement in its entirety that the defense counsel, in response to a query by the court as to whether be had any objections to the admissibility of the document itself, responded: \u201cYour Honor, the objection has been litigated. We would ask to preserve that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-12\">Holding that the issue had not been properly preserved, the Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMG\">The Court of Appeals has stated that it will not find reversible error on appeal when objectionable testimony is admitted if the essential contents of that objectionable testimony have already been established and presented to the jury without objection through the prior testimony of other witnesses. <em>Grandison v. State, </em>341 Md. 175, 218-19, 670 A.2d 398 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 1027, 117 S.Ct. 581, 136 L.Ed.2d 512 (1996). In the present case, [petitioner] objected to the admission of the written evidence. However, he did not object to Detective D\u2019Ovidio\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>describing [petitioner\u2019s] statement. Although [petitioner] had made a pretrial motion <em>in limine, </em>an objection was necessary at the time the evidence was introduced in order to preserve his objection to the admission of that evidence. <em>Prout v. State, </em>311 Md. 348, 356, 535 A.2d 445 (1988); Md. Rule 4-323(a). The evidence, of which [petitioner] now complains, was presented to the jury without objection. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s error was harmless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Petitioner\u2019s sole argument before this Court is that the Court of Special Appeals erred because \u201cthe judge\u2019s denial of his motion <em>in limine </em>was alone sufficient to preserve his objection to the detectives\u2019s recitation of the entire statement.\u201d As is evident, petitioner focuses on the verbal recitation of the statement by the detective, to which petitioner did not object at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">II. <em>Prout v. State</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\"><em>Prout, </em>311 Md. at 351-53, 535 A.2d at 446-47, involved a motion <em>in limine </em>by the defendant to obtain permission to cross-examine a State\u2019s witness about whether she had certain previous criminal convictions in order to impeach that witness\u2019 testimony. The State argued in response that the defense should not be permitted to inquire about the witness\u2019 convictions. The trial court in <em>Prout, </em>in essence, ruled that certain evidence was to be excluded, even though the issue originally was presented as a motion <em>in limine </em>to admit the evidence. Accordingly, the issue in <em>Prout </em>was the exclusion, not the admission of evidence, which is the converse of the issue here: the denial of a motion to exclude evidence that resulted in the evidence\u2019s admission.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>In <em>Prout, </em>we first summarized the arguments advanced by the parties:</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">On appeal, the State argues that Prout failed to preserve his objection to the trial court\u2019s ruling on his motion <em>in limine, </em>which excluded the witness\u2019s prostitution and solicitation convictions. The State contends that Maryland Rule 4-322(a),[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] which requires a party to object to the admission of evidence at the time it is offered, applies to the facts <em>sub judice </em>and, thus, that Prout needed to make a subsequent proffer of the convictions at the point at which he would have offered them at trial. Prout, on the other hand, argues that the trial court\u2019s ruling on his motion <em>in limine </em>was alone sufficient to preserve the issue of the admissibility of the complainant\u2019s convictions for appeal. Prout contends that subsection (c) of Maryland Rule 4-322, rather than subsection (a), is the applicable rule for determining when an objection to a trial court\u2019s ruling <em>excluding </em>evidence has been preserved for appeal. Prout further contends that he has satisfied the provisions of subsection (c).</p>\n<p id=\"AJ5\"><em>Prout, </em>311 Md. at 353-54, 535 A.2d at 447-48 (footnotes omitted). We went on to explain motions <em>in limine:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">Whether a trial judge\u2019s ruling granting a motion <em>in limine </em>may be reviewed on appeal when there is no subsequent proffer of the evidence at trial presents a question of first impression in this Court. Typically, a motion <em>in limine </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>is a motion made before or during a jury trial outside of the hearing of the jury, the purpose of which is to prevent the jury from hearing certain questions and statements that are allegedly prejudicial to the movant. Specifically, the motion usually seeks an order restricting opposing counsel from offering questionable evidence before the judge has had an opportunity to rule on its admissibility. Evidence is most often sought to be excluded because it is incompetent, irrelevant, immaterial, privileged, or otherwise inadmissible. <em>See generally McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 52, at 128 (E. Cleary 3d ed.1984). Thus, the real purpose of a motion <em>in limine </em>is to give the trial judge notice of the movant\u2019s position so as to avoid the introduction of damaging evidence which may irretrievably infect the fairness of the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-5\">Obviously, the trial judge may either grant or deny the motion. If the trial judge admits the questionable evidence, the party who made the motion ordinarily must object at the time the evidence is actually offered to preserve his objection for appellate review. However, when the trial judge resolves these motions by clearly determining that the questionable evidence will <em>not </em>be admitted, and by instructing counsel not to proffer the evidence again during trial, the proponent of the evidence is left with nothing to do at trial but follow the court\u2019s instructions. Under these circumstances, the court\u2019s ruling controls the subsequent course of the trial and the proponent\u2019s objection is preserved for review without any further action on his part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACO\"><em>Id. </em>at 355-56, 535 A.2d at 448-49 (footnote omitted). We first responded to the State\u2019s argument and then went on to reach our holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">The State, however, insists that Maryland Rule 4-322(a) requires that a party make a subsequent proffer or objection when his evidence is excluded. Rule 4-322(a) provides that \u201c[a]n objection to the <em>admission </em>of evidence shall be made at the time the evidence is offered or as soon thereafter as the grounds for objection become apparent. Otherwise the objection is waived.\u201d As we see it, Rule 4-322(a) is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>inapplicable when a trial judge rules to exclude evidence. Moreover, subsection (c) of Rule 4-322 states that to preserve an objection to a \u201cruling or order\u201d <em>other than one admitting evidence, </em>\u201cit is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling or order is made or sought, makes known to the court the action that the party desires the court to take or the objection to the action of the court.\u201d Thus, when a trial judge, in response to a motion <em>in limine, </em>makes a ruling to exclude evidence that is clearly intended to be the final word on the matter, and that will not be affected by the manner in which the evidence unfolds at trial, and the proponent of the evidence makes a contemporaneous objection <em>[ie., </em>at the time of the action by the trial court on the motion <em>in limine], </em>his objection ordinarily is preserved under Rule 4-322(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 356-57, 535 A.2d at 449 (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">On the same day we decided <em>Prout, </em>we explained this concept further in <em>Watson v. State, </em>311 Md. 370, 535 A.2d 455 (1988). We stated, <em>id. </em>at 372-73 n. 1, 535 A.2d at 457 n. 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxX\">We find that Watson preserved his objection to the court\u2019s admission of his attempted rape conviction in spite of the fact that he did not object at the precise moment the testimony was elicited. Maryland Rule 4-322(a) provides that \u201c[a]n objection to the admission of evidence shall be made at the time the evidence is offered or as soon thereafter as the grounds for objection become apparent.\u201d In <em>Prout v. State, </em>311 Md. 348, 535 A.2d 445 (1988), we concluded that when a trial judge makes a final ruling on a motion <em>in limine </em>to admit evidence, the party opposing the admission of the evidence must subsequently object at trial when the evidence is offered to preserve his objection for appeal. <em>Prout, </em>535 A.2d at 449. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial judge ruled prior to trial on the motion <em>in limine </em>to admit Watson\u2019s prior convictions. <em>Thus, standing alone, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number><em>Watson\u2019s objection to the trial court\u2019s pretrial ruling would be insufficient to preserve his objection for our review. </em>However, the trial judge reiterated his ruling immediately prior to the State\u2019s cross-examination of Watson. It was during this cross-examination that the State elicited Watson\u2019s prior convictions. As we see it, requiring Watson to make yet another objection only a short time after the court\u2019s ruling to admit the evidence would be to exalt form over substance. We have repeatedly stated that neither this Court nor Rule 4-322(d) requires formal exceptions to the admission of evidence. <em>Covington v. State, </em>282 Md. 540, 543, 386 A.2d 336, 337 (1978); <em>Elmer v. State, </em>239 Md. 1, 9, 209 A.2d 776, 781 (1965); <em>Kennedy v. Crouch, </em>191 Md. 580, 586, 62 A.2d 582 (1948); <em>Davis v. State, </em>189 Md. 269, 273, 55 A.2d 702 (1947). Accordingly, we find the issue of the admissibility of Watson\u2019s attempted rape conviction preserved. [Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">More recently, we said in <em>United States Gypsum Co. v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>336 Md. 145, 174, 647 A.2d 405, 419 (1994),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>Generally, where a party makes a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude irrelevant or otherwise inadmissible evidence, and that evidence is subsequently admitted, \u201cthe party who made the motion ordinarily must object at the time the evidence is actually offered to preserve [its] objection for appellate review.\u201d <em>Prout v. </em>State 311 Md. 348, 356, 535 A.2d 445, 449 (1988). <em>See Watson v. State, </em>311 Md. 370, 372-373 n. 1, 535 A.2d 455, 457 n. 1 (1988); <em>Billman v.

State, </em>328 Md. 398, 402-403, 614 A.2d 949, 951 (1992).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-5\"><em>See also Leet v. Totah, </em>329 Md. 645, 666, 620 A.2d 1372, 1882 (1993); <em>Simmons v. State, </em>313 Md. 33, 37, 542 A.2d 1258, 1260 (1988). In <em>Simmons, </em>a case in which we followed the <em>Prout </em>analysis as to motion <em>in limine </em>rulings excluding evidence, we reiterated the general applicable rule: \u201cWe agreed [in <em>Prout </em>] that \u2018[i]f the trial judge admits the questionable evidence, the party who made the motion ordinarily must object at the time the evidence is actually offered to preserve his objection for appellate review.\u2019 \u201d <em>Simmons, </em>313 Md. at 37, 542 A.2d at 1260 (second alteration in original) (quoting <em>Prout, </em>311 Md. at 356, 535 A.2d at 449). The Court of Special Appeals has interpreted our holding in <em>Prout </em>in a similar manner. For instance, that court held in <em>Hickman v. State, </em>76 Md.App. 111, 117, 543 A.2d 870, 873 (1988):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">We glean the following propositions from <em>Prout. </em>Whether the motion <em>in limine </em>is made before trial or during trial, a court\u2019s ruling which has the effect of admitting contested evidence does not relieve the party, as to whom the ruling is adverse, of the obligation of objecting when the evidence is actually offered. Failure to object results in the non-preservation of the issue for appellate review. On the other hand, when the effect of the ruling [on a motion <em>in limine </em>] is to exclude the evidence, and the trial judge intends that ruling to \u201cbe the final word on the matter,\u201d a contemporane - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>ous objection made at the time of the ruling ordinarily preserves the issue for appellate review. <em>See Simmons v. State, </em>313 Md. 33, 37-38, 542 A.2d 1258, 1259-60 (1988).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Azg\"><em>See also Market Tavern, Inc. v. Bowen, </em>92 Md.App. 622, 648, 610 A.2d 295, 308-09 (holding that the moving party, whose pretrial motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence was denied and who failed to object to the admission of the evidence at trial, did not preserve the issue for appeal), <em>cert. denied, </em>328 Md. 238, 614 A.2d 84 (1992); <em>Collier v. Eagle-Picher Indus., </em>86 Md.App. 38, 62, 585 A.2d 256, 268 (\u201cA motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence that is denied does not ordinarily eliminate the need to object when the offending evidence is offered.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>323 Md. 33, 591 A.2d 249 (1991); <em>Dyce v. State, </em>85 Md.App. 193, 196, 582 A.2d 582, 584 (1990) (\u201cOrdinarily, improper admission of evidence will not be preserved for appellate review unless the party asserting error objected at the time the evidence was offered or as soon thereafter as the grounds for the objection became apparent.\u201d (citing <em>Prout, </em>311 Md. at 356-57, 535 A.2d at 449; Md. Rule 4-323(a))); <em>Turgut v. Levine, </em>79 Md.App. 279, 284-87, 556 A.2d 720, 722-24 (1989) (involving, as in <em>Prout, </em>an order excluding evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">In sum, the rule from <em>Prout </em>as to rulings on motions <em>in limine </em>that result in the admission of evidence is that the contemporaneous objection rule ordinarily applies. When the evidence, the admissibility of which has been contested previously in a motion <em>in limine, </em>is offered at trial, a contemporaneous objection generally must be made pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-323(a) in order for that issue of admissibility to be preserved for the purpose of appeal. When motions <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence are granted, normally no further objection is required to preserve the issue for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">III. Resolution</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Petitioner does not quarrel with the interpretations that the appellate courts of this state have ascribed to <em>Prout, </em>but takes the position that we should modify that rule to remove the requirement for a contemporaneous objection when a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence has been denied. In other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>words, petitioner asks us to extend the holding of <em>Prout </em>to orders arising out of motions <em>in limine </em>that result in admission of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">In his brief, petitioner offers a review of the focus and function of motions <em>in limine, </em>pointing out the previous, generally accepted position that such motions did not preserve issues for appellate review because they historically had not been considered final, at one time had been considered usurpations of judicial power, and have been considered of limited utility. Petitioner goes on to explain that a \u201csubstantial number of courts have held that an adverse ruling\u201d on such a motion sufficiently preserves the issue, that the federal circuits are split on whether to \u201cadhere to the contemporaneous objection requirement,\u201d and that a trend exists in the federal circuits to \u201csoften\u201d the rule. He then states, correctly, that this Court\u2019s position prior to <em>Prout </em>had been that a ruling on such a motion <em>in limine </em>\u201cwas never a final appealable order.\u201d After noting the limited change created by <em>Prout </em>as to certain orders excluding evidence arising out of motions <em>in limine, </em>petitioner argues that Maryland Rule 4-323(c) should apply equally to orders resulting in the admission of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">The only way in which we could do as petitioner suggests is to ignore the language of subsections 4~323(a) and (c), their relationship to each other, our discussion and application of those subsections in <em>Prout, </em>and the logic utilized in that opinion to carve out an exception to the contemporaneous objection rule, which currently applies <em>only </em>to a trial court\u2019s orders of exclusion. As relevant to the present case, Rule 4-323(a) states specifically: \u201cAn objection to the admission of evidence shall be made at the time it is offered.... Otherwise, the objection is waived.\u201d Subsection (c) states in relevant part: <em>\u201cObjections to other rulings or orders. </em>For purposes of review by the trial court or on appeal of any other ruling or order, it is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling or order is made or sought, makes known to the court the action that the party desires the court to take or the objection to the action of the court.\u201d (Bolding added.) By its very terms, subsection (a) applies to evidence proffered as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number><em>admissible </em>at trial. Subsection (c) applies to objections to all <em>other </em>rulings or orders, including rulings or orders that exclude evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">We fully explained the different functions of these two subsections of Maryland Rule 4-323 in <em>Prout. As </em>indicated before, we noted in that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">Rule 4-322(a) provides that \u201c[a]n objection to the <em>admission </em>of evidence shall be made at the time the evidence is offered or as soon thereafter as the grounds for objection become apparent. Otherwise the objection is waived.\u201d As we see it, Rule 4-322(a) is inapplicable when a trial judge rules to exclude evidence. Moreover, subsection (c) of Rule 4-322 states that to preserve an objection to a \u201cruling or order\u201d <em>other than one admitting evidence, </em>\u201cit is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling or order is made or sought, makes known to the court the action that the party desires the court to take or the objection to the action of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ak8\"><em>Prout, </em>311 Md. at 356-57, 535 A.2d at 449. We emphasized in <em>Prout </em>the different treatment of orders resulting in the admission of evidence and orders resulting in the exclusion of evidence. Orders resulting in the admission of evidence continue to be controlled by subsection (a); rulings resulting in the exclusion of evidence are considered under subsection (c). Petitioner suggests that because a trial court has the discretion to exclude evidence, all of its rulings, whether to admit or exclude, should be governed by subsection (c). This apparently would eliminate the need to object when evidence is admitted after denial of a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude that evidence. In essence, petitioner proffers that the contemporaneous objection rule should in such cases be eliminated and replaced by motion <em>in limine </em>practice. To do otherwise, he states, is to make Maryland Rule 4-323 a \u201ctrap for the unwary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Petitioner would make the proposed substitution, however, only in instances in which the ruling of the trial court on the motion <em>in limine </em>\u201cwas definitive.\u201d That caveat itself, in our view, would be a trap for the unwary. If the pretrial ruling is believed definitive, no objection might be made if the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>is thereafter proffered at trial. Later, if an appellate court does not interpret the pretrial ruling as definitive, it might hold the evidentiary issue has not been preserved because of the failure to make a contemporaneous objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Moreover, the present rule generally promotes consistency and judicial efficiency. Often, the motions judge and the trial judge are different.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under the contemporaneous objection rule, the trial judge can assume when evidence is submitted and its admissibility is challenged, that the issue of admissibility is before her or him. In that situation, the arguments as to admissibility are before the judge presiding over the final phase of the trial on its merits, not before any one of a number of judges who may have considered various pretrial motions. That issue of admissibility will then be considered in the context of the prior trial proceedings and where those proceedings logically can lead. The issue of relevancy at the trial stage may well be affected by the prior witnesses and evidence previously admitted during the trial. The trial judge will often be in a better position than a motions judge to assess the admissibility of evidence because of trial events that have occurred since the motions judge made her or his ruling. Also, although the trial judge normally will be aware of the ruling on a pretrial motion, or at least have that ruling immediately available to her or him, the trial judge usually would not have immediately available the arguments made at the pretrial proceeding or the reasons expressed from the bench by the motions judge or judges explaining the ruling. Additionally, in some cases the attorneys at trial may not be the same attorneys who argued the pretrial motion. How would they know what degree of \u201cdefinitiveness\u201d resulted from the pretrial ruling? How do the trial attorneys know whether they should argue objections at the time the evidence is proffered at trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>Under petitioner\u2019s theory, if the pretrial ruling denying a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence is \u201cdefinitive,\u201d it is final. If final, what is the trial judge to do when the evidence is later offered? Evidence deemed relevant prior to trial may no longer be relevant at the time it is proffered at trial. If the motion <em>in limine </em>ruling was definitive, and thus a final ruling, does it remain admissible even though subsequent events at trial have established that it is not relevant? Can the party that prevailed at the pretrial proceeding object to later consideration on the ground that the pretrial ruling was definitive and thus final? If the trial judge makes a separate ruling, does she or he err? If the trial judge disagrees with the motions judge\u2019s definitive ruling and rules differently, which ruling is final for appellate purposes? And finally, does the issue of the \u201cdefinitiveness\u201d of what occurred at the motions hearing turn into a \u201cmini-trial\u201d within the trial on the merits? All of these contingencies render petitioner\u2019s proposal, in our view, a complicated concept at best. The contemporaneous objection rule, Maryland Rule 4-323(a), is simple, efficient, and fair in its operation. In other words, it works.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Petitioner points out several instances in which trial attorneys have not adhered to the contemporaneous objection rule and, according to petitioner, have been \u201cwaylaid on the road to appellate review by the requirements of the rule.\u201d Much the same could be said of the failure to adhere to many other rules. Moreover, our experience indicates that the provisions of the contemporaneous objection rule enjoy a wide dissemination among the members of the Bar. The transcripts in cases before this Court are, w\u00e9 suspect, replete with examples of attempts by attorneys to comply with this well-known requirement of Maryland trial practice. The rule is not a trap for the unwary. The unwary trap themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Petitioner contends that in <em>Prowl, </em>311 Md. at 356, 535 A.2d at 449, we stated that a ruling that excludes evidence \u201ccontrols the subsequent course of the trial.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Petitioner asserts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>an order denying exclusion can also control the subsequent course of the trial. We disagree. Much can happen in a trial prior to the offering of disputed evidence that can affect its admissibility. When the contemporaneous objection rule applies, the subsequent course of the trial as to admissibility issues generally will be controlled by the rulings of the trial judge, rulings generated by the events as they have unfolded during the trial. The trial judge is in a better position to make definitive rulings. Moreover, the trial rulings made at the time of trial admitting evidence are <em>per se </em>definitive\u2014the evidence comes in.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">We decline the invitation to apply the holding of <em>Front </em>to denials of motions <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence. When a pretrial ruling results in the admission of evidence, the contemporaneous objection rule, Maryland Rule 4-323(a), shall continue to apply. Contemporaneous objections to the admission of evidence normally must be made when the evidence is offered at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">Dissenting Opinion by RAKER, J., in which ELDRIDGE, J., joins.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-8\">. The defense counsel in <em>Prout </em>made an oral motion <em>in limine </em>prior to opening statements to \"advise the court\u201d of his intention to cross-examine the State\u2019s only witness about several prior convictions. The State objected, and the trial court ultimately permitted defense counsel to inquire only as to two of that witness\u2019 convictions. The defense counsel did not object to the court\u2019s order at the time the defense counsel would have cross-examined the witness about her other convictions. The defendant was found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>On appeal, the State contended that the defense failed to preserve its objection to the judge\u2019s ruling on the motion <em>in limine, </em>which excluded the evidence the defense sought to introduce.

Thus, the court\u2019s <em>denial </em>of Prout\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>had the same effect as the <em>grant </em>of a traditional motion <em>in limine, </em>i.e., to exclude the proffered evidence. Accordingly, we will treat the trial judge's ruling on Prout\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>as if it were a grant of a motion to exclude.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-9\"><em>Prout, </em>311 Md. at 355 n. 4, 535 A.2d at 448 n. 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b685-10\">.

In <em>Watson, </em>311 Md. at 371-72, 535 A.2d at 456-57, the defendant made a pretrial motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence from being used for impeachment purposes should Mr. Watson take the stand. The motion was denied. At trial, after Mr. Watson testified in his own defense, the State informed the court that it intended to use part of that evidence on cross-examination to impeach the defendant's direct testimony. The trial court then reiterated its pretrial ruling. When, shortly thereafter, the State proffered the evidence, the defense made no objection. We noted that if the only ruling at issue were the pretrial ruling, Watson's pretrial motion would not have preserved the issue unless a contemporaneous objection was made at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 372-73 n. 1, 535 A.2d at 457 n. 1. Because the trial court had ruled again during the trial while the relevant witness was actually testifying, and shortly before the challenged evidence was admitted, we noted it \"would be to exalt form over substance\u201d to find the issue unpreserved. <em>Id. Watson </em>was limited to its specific circumstances, which are absent in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b688-9\">. As is obvious, <em>United States Gypsum </em>was a civil case.

Of course, trial judges retain the right to change rulings on evidence admissibility. In cases of such changes, the latter ruling is normally the final or \"definitive\u201d ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b695-9\">RAKER, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ACA\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. First, I would hold that under the facts of this case, the alleged error was preserved for appellate review. Second, I would eliminate the requirement of a contemporaneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>objection to preserve for appellate review a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion <em>in limine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Although not specifically provided for in the Maryland Rules of Procedure, a motion <em>in limine </em>is widely used by practitioners in an effort to exclude prejudicial evidence from trial. The question which frequently arises is whether the motion <em>in limine </em>is sufficient to preserve any error for appeal when the motion is denied, or whether an objection was required when the evidence was introduced at trial. Within the framework of <em>Prout, </em>the Majority adheres to the contemporaneous objection rule, and holds that a pre-trial order denying a motion <em>in limine </em>is ordinarily insufficient to preserve for appeal the question of the admissibility of the evidence. I disagree. I would hold that a motion <em>in limine </em>is sufficient in and of itself to preserve an alleged error of a pretrial evidentiary ruling, regardless of whether the <em>in limine </em>ruling was to admit or to exclude the evidence, and without the requirement of a contemporaneous objection at trial. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"AXN\">A motion <em>in limine </em>is ordinarily made at the beginning of a trial, or before a trial actually commences, with the purpose of excluding prejudicial matters from the knowledge of the jury. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed.1990) defines <em>\u201cin limine </em>\u201d as \u201con or at the threshold; at the very beginning; preliminarily.\u201d Such motions are beneficial in that they reduce the need for bench conferences, eliminate the necessity for curative instructions to a jury to disregard inadmissible evidence, and generally minimize interruptions during trial. <em>See Palmerin v. City of Riverside, </em>794 F.2d 1409, 1412-13 (9 th Cir.1986). Most trial lawyers know that prejudicial information suggested to jurors is often difficult to cure, that objections to prejudicial material may only emphasize it, and that curative instructions may be at best minimally effective. <em>See </em>J. Ghent, Annot., <em>Modem Status of Rules as to Use of Motion In Limine or Similar Preliminary Motion to Secure Exclusion of Prejudicial Evidence or Reference to Prejudicial Matters, </em>63 A.L.R.3d 311 (1975 &amp; 1998 Supp.). The use of the motion <em>in limine </em>is an accepted procedure to avoid this dilemma.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>There is a split of opinion around the country on the necessity for a contemporaneous objection to preserve error raised in a motion <em>in limine. </em>Generally, the First, Fifth, Eighth, and Eleventh Circuits adhere to the contemporaneous objection requirement. <em>See, e.g., Goulah v. Ford Motor Co., </em>118 F.3d 1478, 1483 (11th Cir.1997); <em>Marceaux v. Conoco, Inc., </em>124 F.3d 730, 734 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Keeper v. King, </em>130 F.3d 1309, 1315 (8th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Graves, </em>5 F.3d 1546, 1551 (5th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Reed, </em>977 F.2d 14, 17 (1st Cir.1992). Many states also require contemporaneous objections. <em>See, e.g., State v. Hayes, </em>350 N.C. 79, 511 S.E.2d 302 (1999); <em>Lin v. Houston Community College System, </em>948 S.W.2d 328, 336 (Tex.App.1997); <em>Carter v. State, </em>634 N.E.2d 830, 832-33 (Ind.Ct.App.1994); <em>Romanek-Golub &amp; Co. v. Anvan Hotel Corp., </em>168 Ill.App.3d 1031, 119 Ill.Dec. 482, 522 N.E.2d 1341, 1347-48 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The Third, Fourth, Seventh, Ninth, Tenth and D.C. Circuits have abolished the requirement and have held that a denial of a motion <em>in limine </em>alone may be sufficient to preserve error. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Madoch, </em>149 F.3d 596, 600 (7th Cir.1998); <em>Scott v. Ross, </em>140 F.3d 1275, 1285 (9th Cir.1998), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>151 F.3d 1247, <em>cert. denied, Cult Awareness Network v. Scott, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 119 S.Ct. 1285, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014; <em>Walden v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., </em>126 F.3d 506, 519 (3rd Cir.1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 118 S.Ct. 1516, 140 L.Ed.2d 669 (1998); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>81 F.3d 1321, 1325 (4th Cir.1996), <em>vacated and remanded in part on other grounds, </em>110 F.3d 62 (4 th Cir.1997); <em>Pandit v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc., </em>82 F.3d 376, 380 (10th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Mejia-Alarcon, </em>995 F.2d 982, 986-88 (10th Cir.1993); <em>American Home Assur. v. Sunshine Supermarket, </em>753 F.2d 321, 324-25 (3rd Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>561 F.2d 859, 862-63 (D.C.Cir.1977). Many states also have eliminated the need for the contemporaneous objection in these circumstances. <em>See, e.g., State v. Weeks, </em>270 Mont. 63, 891 P.2d 477, 490 (1995); <em>State v. Bradshaw, </em>193 W.Va. 519, 457 S.E.2d 456, 475 (1995); <em>Dalrymple v. Fields, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>276 Ark. 185, 633 S.W.2d 362, 364 (1982); <em>State v. Miller, </em>229 N.W.2d 762, 767-68 (Iowa 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">A workable rule that emerges from those cases that have relaxed or eliminated the contemporaneous objection requirement is that an objection to the denial of the motion <em>in limine </em>is alone sufficient to preserve the alleged error if the substance of the objection has been thoroughly explored at the hearing on the motion, the order denying the motion is explicit and definitive, the evidence offered at trial is substantially consistent with the evidence considered at the hearing on the motion, and there is no suggestion that the trial court would reconsider the matter at trial. <em>See Palmerin, </em>794 F.2d at 1412-1413; <em>Bradshaw, </em>457 S.E.2d at 475. This is the rule I would adopt for Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The Ninth Circuit in <em>Palmerin v. City of Riverside, </em>794 F.2d 1409, 1413 (1986) rejected the bright-line approach of the Fifth and Eighth Circuits requiring a contemporaneous objection to the admissibility of evidence to preserve the matter for appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 1413. The court declined to adopt that approach because \u201cit raises the danger that an unsuccessful motion <em>in limine </em>will serve as a trap for unwary counsel and bar an appeal of a meritorious issue on essentially technical grounds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-7\">To require invariably a contemporaneous objection after a rejected <em>in limine </em>motion would be tantamount to requiring formal exceptions. This would exalt the form of timely objection over the substance of whether a proper objection has been made and considered by the trial court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-8\">We, therefore, reject an invariable requirement that an objection that is the subject of an unsuccessful motion <em>in limine </em>be renewed at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 1413.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">In <em>United States v. Mejia-Alarcon, </em>995 F.2d 982, 986-88 (10th Cir.1993), the Tenth Circuit rejected a <em>per se </em>rule that motions <em>in limine </em>may never preserve an objection for appellate review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court concluded that when counsel diligently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>advances the contentions supporting a motion <em>in limine </em>and fully informs the trial judge of the issue in an evidentiary hearing, application of the rule requiring a contemporaneous objection at trial makes little sense and serves as a \u201ctrap for the unwary, who sensibly rely on a definitive, well-thought-out pretrial ruling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 986. The court observed that \u201crequiring the renewal of objections after a definitive ruling may be a needless provocation to the trial judge, not to mention a distracting interruption during the trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">The <em>Prowl </em>rule is the real trap for Maryland practitioners. The <em>Prout </em>rule permits preservation when the motion <em>in limine </em>is granted, but not so when the motion is denied. Contrary to the pronouncement of the Majority, the rule does not promote consistency and judicial efficiency. Indeed, the contrary is true. The <em>Prowl </em>rule is subject to discretionary and sometimes arbitrary application, leading to inconsistent results. <em>See, e.g., Watson v. State, </em>311 Md. 370, 535 A.2d 455 (1988); <em>Dyce v. State, </em>85 Md.App. 193, 582 A.2d 582 (1990) (holding issue preserved notwithstanding the lack of literal compliance with Rule 4-323(a) because of the temporal proximity between the ruling on the motion <em>in limine </em>and the prosecutor\u2019s initial inquiry on cross-examination).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">As this Court in <em>Watson v. State, </em>311 Md. 370, 373 n. 1, 535 A.2d 455, 457 n. 1 (1988) pointed out in justifying review without a contemporaneous objection, \u201crequiring Watson to make yet another objection only a short time after the court\u2019s ruling to admit the evidence would be to exalt form over substance. We have repeatedly stated that neither this Court nor Rule 4-322(d) requires formal exceptions to the admission of evidence.\u201d In <em>Watson, </em>the trial judge ruled prior to trial on the motion <em>in limine </em>to admit Watson\u2019s prior convictions. <em>Id., </em>535 A.2d at 457 n. 1. The trial judge reiterated his ruling immediately prior to the State\u2019s cross-examination of Watson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>which elicited the alleged inadmissible evidence. <em>Id., </em>535 A.2d at 457 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Reed objected pre-trial, and the trial judge reconsidered the evidence immediately prior to the commencement of the trial. Is this not form exalted over substance to require yet another objection? Clearly, the Maryland Rules have eliminated the need for formal exceptions to preserve objections. Md. Rule 4-323(d) <em>Formal exceptions unnecessary; see also Watson, </em>311 Md. at 372-73 n. 1, 535 A.2d at 457 n. 1; <em>Covington v. State, </em>282 Md. 540, 543, 386 A.2d 336, 337 (1978). Requiring a formal objection under the circumstances presented herein is akin to requiring a formal exception. <em>See Sunshine Supermarket, </em>753 F.2d at 324-25 (observing that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 46, which states that formal exceptions are unnecessary, could be construed to eliminate the contemporaneous objection rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">In this case, the judge presiding at the trial held full argument on the motion <em>in limine. </em>The trial judge made a final, definitive ruling denying the motion. At trial, when the evidence was offered, defense counsel stated: \u201cThe objection has been litigated. We would ask to preserve that.\u201d An objection when the evidence was offered at trial would have been futile and have added nothing. As the Supreme Court of Oregon observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-6\">In the case at bar, defense counsel did not have to walk barefoot through any more legal coals to protect his client\u2019s record. He made a sufficient offer of proof of what would happen in the trial to permit the court to rule intelligently on the propriety of the offered evidence, he asked for a final ruling and, although the trial judge was not obligated to do so, the judge gave a final ruling. There was no need for any further procedure to preserve the assignment of error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-7\"><em>State v. Foster, </em>296 Or. 174, 674 P.2d 587, 592 (1983) (in banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and remand the case to that court for a consideration of the issue on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Judge ELDRIDGE has authorized me to state that he joins in the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-11\">.
