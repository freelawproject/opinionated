The jury found respondent guilty of the following: Count one: second degree murder of Marvis Willis; count two: use of a handgun in the commission of a felony in the murder of Marvis Willis; count three: second degree murder of Donnell Willis; count four: first degree murder of Raynard Willis; and count five: use of a handgun in the commission of a felony in the murder of Raynard Willis. The court sentenced respondent to life without parole for count four and additional consecutive sentences of thirty years each for counts one and three and twenty years each for counts two and five.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">Respondent appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which reversed his convictions in an unreported opinion and remanded the case to the circuit court. The State petitioned this Court for writ of certiorari on April 17, 1998, and respondent filed a cross-petition on April 22, 1998. We granted both petitions to address an important issue raised in this matter. As rephrased by the State in its brief before this Court, petitioner presents question one for our review and respondent presents question two:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-11\">1. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that the issue of territorial jurisdiction presented a question of fact for the jury to resolve?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>2. Did the trial court properly admit evidence of Butler\u2019s prior conviction for armed robbery during the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">We shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals as to the first question. Because respondent\u2019s convictions are reversed and remanded, we need not address the second question.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">We shall set forth the relevant facts in this case as described by the Court of Special Appeals in its opinion below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-8\">Appellant was charged and convicted of the murders of Marvis Willis, his former girlfriend, her brother Raynard, and her three-year-old son Donnell. The bodies were discovered in Raynard\u2019s leased car in northwest Washington, D.C., when the D.C. Fire Department was called to investigate a vehicle fire. All three bodies were wrapped in bedding that had been secured with cellophane tape. The bodies of Donnell and Raynard were found in the passenger compartment of the car, while Marvis\u2019s body was discovered in the trunk. Police investigators determined that the fire had been set deliberately with flammable liquid and an open flame.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-9\">Autopsies performed on the three bodies revealed that Marvis and Raynard had been shot to death; Donnell was asphyxiated. Marvis\u2019s body was burned after death and the other two bodies suffered heat damage from the vehicle fire. A .38 caliber revolver with an unusual \u201ctop break\u201d barrel was found with the bodies. At trial, the State presented testimony by a firearms expert who stated that the bullets extracted from the bodies were consistent with, but not conclusive as, having been fired from that weapon. Marvis and Raynard\u2019s mother testified that the items of bedding in which the bodies were wrapped were articles that she had given to Marvis on previous occasions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-10\">The State produced testimony by a neighbor, Terry Lee Flowers, who stated that he had seen appellant leave Marvis\u2019s apartment in a burgundy rental car on the evening of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>December 2, 1991. When he saw the car on a later news broadcast and recognized it as the one appellant was driving, he attempted unsuccessfully to call a crime report hotline. Flowers also testified that he had seen appellant with the top-break handgun found with the bodies and remembered talking to appellant about the unusual gun in November 1991.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">The State also produced testimony by the homicide investigator who canvassed the neighborhood where the burned car was found on the night of the fire. The investigator reported having seen a man wearing a tam and a fur coat in a doorway just two doors down from the location of the vehicle fire. He later chose appellant\u2019s likeness from an array of photographs and also identified appellant from the witness stand. Several prosecution witnesses testified that appellant and Marvis had been having relationship difficulties related to appellant\u2019s involvement with other women. Appellant himself testified that they had agreed to end their relationship and to live separately because appellant was not ready for marriage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">Appellant testified in his own defense, denying that he committed the murders, that he was present on P Street on the night of the vehicle fire, that he drove Raynard\u2019s car on that evening, or that he ever showed Flowers a top-break handgun.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">II. Discussion and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">In the case before us, the question is if a dispute exists as to whether the crime for which the defendant is accused occurred within Maryland, is such a determination an issue of law for the court to decide or is it a factual determination to be made by the trier of fact? This Court has never addressed this issue squarely.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">The State argues to this Court, as it did to the Court of Special Appeals, that when a criminal defendant challenges a court\u2019s territorial jurisdiction, that issue should be raised prior to trial and determined by the trial judge. The State proffers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>several reasons for this conclusion. First, the State claims a challenge to a court\u2019s territorial jurisdiction strikes at the very \u201cfoundation of the court\u2019s authority,\u201d and therefore should be determined by the court as a matter of law. Second, the State argues, territorial jurisdiction is a threshold issue that should be challenged prior to trial. In that vein, the State analogizes territorial jurisdiction to the determination of venue, which is normally decided by the court upon a mandatory pretrial motion to dismiss pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-252. Finally, the State argues that even if this Court were to determine that a challenge to the trial court\u2019s territorial jurisdiction need not be made prior to trial, the issue is one of law to be decided by the trial court and not a factual determination to be made by the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Respondent, on the other hand, argues that when facts relating to the location of the crime are in dispute, the matter should be resolved by the trier of fact. Second, contrary to the State, respondent argues venue and territorial jurisdiction are not analogous and should not be treated similarly. Respondent also contends that the majority of states and the federal circuits submit the issue of territorial jurisdiction to the trier of fact. Finally, respondent argues that when the issue of territorial jurisdiction is submitted to the trier of fact, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that criminal conduct occurred in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The Court of Special Appeals, relying on <em>Burral v. State, </em>118 Md.App. 288, 702 A.2d 781 (1997), <em>cert. granted, </em>349 Md. 105, 707 A.2d 90 (1998), held that the \u201cquestion of territorial jurisdiction was a question of fact for the jury and that the State had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the crimes were committed in Maryland.\u201d Therefore, the intermediate appellate court held, the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury to resolve the issue of territorial jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Territorial jurisdiction describes the concept that only when an offense is committed within the boundaries of the court\u2019s jurisdictional geographic territory, which generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>is within the boundaries of the respective states', may the case be tried in that state. The roots of the territorial jurisdiction requirement lie in the Sixth Amendment: \u201c[T]he Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, made applicable to state judicial proceedings by the Fourteenth Amendment, requires that \u2018in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a ... trial, by an impartial jury of' the State ... wherein the crime shall have been <em>committed---- Trindle v. State, </em>326 Md. 25, 38, 602 A.2d 1232, 1238 (1992) (Eldridge, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part) (quoting U.S. Const, amend. VI). We said in <em>Bowen v. State, </em>206 Md. 368, 375, 111 A.2d 844, 847 (1955), that \u201can offense against the laws of the State of Maryland is punishable only when committed within its territory. A person cannot be convicted here for crimes committed in another state.\u201d <em>See also Martel v. State, </em>221 Md. 294, 299, 157 A.2d 437, 440, <em>cert. denied, </em>363 U.S. 849, 80 S.Ct. 1628, 4 L.Ed.2d 1732 (1960). Commentators are in accord with this description. <em>See, e.g., </em>Annotation, <em>Comment Note\u2014Necessity of Proving Venue or Territorial Jurisdiction of Criminal Offense Beyond Reasonable Doubt, </em>67 A.L.R.3d 988, \u00a7 10, at 1004 (1975) (\u201cThe judicial power to hear and determine a criminal prosecution, as between the forum and other states, federal districts, or countries, on the basis of the offense having occurred .within the territorial limits of the forum state or federal district, is what is referred to by the term \u2018territorial jurisdiction.\u2019\u201d). Venue, then, pertains to the county in which a case can be tried; territorial , jurisdiction concerns whether the offense was committed within the boundaries of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">We are bound as to the issue of territorial jurisdiction by the restraints of common law. This Court has noted that \u201cunder the common law ... a state may punish only those crimes committed within its territorial limits.\u201d <em>Pennington v. State, </em>308 Md. 727, 730, 521 A.2d 1216, 1217 (1987). <em>Cf. Trindle, </em>326 Md. at 31, 602 A.2d at 1235 (\u201c[A]t common law a crime is committed in the state where the criminal act (or omission) occurs if the crime is defined only in terms of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>act (or omission) but a crime will also be considered as committed in the state where its intended result occurs if the definition of the crime includes such a result.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Even though a trial court's power is limited geographically by the principles of territorial jurisdiction, under certain circumstances, the defendant\u2019s presence is not required in a court\u2019s territorial jurisdiction if, for instance, the intended result or an essential element of his or her crime lies in Maryland. <em>See id.; Urciolo v. State, </em>272 Md. 607, 631, 325 A.2d 878, 892 (1974) (\u201cAlthough presence within the territorial jurisdiction of the state is necessary to subject a person to its penal laws, actual presence is not necessary to make a person amenable to the laws of a state for a crime committed there; the presence may be constructive rather than actual.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Although this Court has never addressed the exact issue presented here,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> other jurisdictions have. One commentator has explained that \u201c[a]t least when the matter has been put into issue by the defendant, whether the prosecuting government actually has criminal jurisdiction over the conduct of the defendant is a matter to be determined by the trier of fact.\u201d Wayne R. LaFave &amp; Austin W. Scott, Jr., Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 2.7(b), at 163 (1986) (footnote omitted). The Arizona Supreme Court held likewise in <em>State v. Willoughby, </em>181 Ariz. 530, 538, 892 P.2d 1319, 1325 (Ariz.1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 1054, 116 S.Ct. 725, 133 L.Ed.2d 677 (1996). In that case, the defendant, Daniel Willoughby, his wife Trish, and their children resided in Phoenix, Arizona. On a family trip to Mexico, the defendant and the children returned to their vacation condominium from a day trip to find Trish stabbed, strangled, and bludgeoned. She died later that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>The defendant was charged with murder and conspiracy by the Arizona courts. His lover, a Mexican resident alien living in Arizona, was charged with and pled guilty to the murder to Mexican authorities. At the close of his trial in Arizona, the defendant requested the judge to instruct the jury that it must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the crimes for which he was charged were committed within the territorial jurisdiction of Arizona. The judge refused and resolved the jurisdictional facts as a matter of law under a preponderance of the evidence standard. The Arizona Supreme Court held that the trial court erred. The court first stated: \u201cIf jurisdictional facts are intertwined with the merits of the case, the jurisdictional and substantive issues are difficult to resolve separately <em>only if the jurisdictional facts are controverted by evidence.\u201d Id. </em>at 536, 892 P.2d at 1325. The court went on to note that if the facts upon which the territorial jurisdiction of the court depends are disputed, most states have held that the jury should resolve those disputes. <em>Id. </em>at 536-37, 892 P.2d at 1325-26. The Arizona Supreme Court adopted this rule, holding that \u201c[i]n the very rare case in which jurisdiction is legitimately in issue because of contradicting jurisdictional facts, Arizona\u2019s territorial jurisdiction must be established beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 538, 892 P.2d at 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The majority of other state and federal courts, as the <em>Willoughby </em>court noted, are in accord with the rule that, generally speaking, when facts regarding a court\u2019s territorial jurisdiction are in dispute, the resolution of those facts should be left for the trier of fact, not the court. <em>See, e.g., People v. Witt, </em>53 Cal.App.3d 154, 167, 125 Cal.Rptr. 653, 661 (\u201c[T]he question of territorial jurisdiction is a question of fact to be determined by the trier of fact.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 916, 96 S.Ct. 1518, 47 L.Ed.2d 768 (1976); <em>Lane v. State, </em>388 So.2d 1022, 1028 (Fla.1980) (\u201c[T]his territorial jurisdiction issue is a factual determination which is within the province of the jury to resolve----\u201d); <em>People v. Holt, </em>91 Ill.2d 480, 492, 64 Ill.Dec. 550, 440 N.E.2d 102, 108 (1982) (stating that territorial jurisdiction must be proved to the trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt); <em>State v. Liggins, </em>524 N.W.2d 181, 184 (Iowa 1994) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>(holding that when territorial jurisdictional facts are disputed, the issue should be determined by the jury); <em>State v. Collin, </em>687 A.2d 962, 964 (Me.1997) (holding that pursuant to Maine\u2019s territorial jurisdiction statute and cases from other states addressing the issue, territorial jurisdiction is an issue of fact to be decided by a jury when controverted, but determined by the court when no facts are in dispute); <em>State v. Baldwin, </em>305 A.2d 555, 559 (Me.1973) (\u201c[T]he State has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the criminal conduct it seeks to vindicate occurred in the State of Maine.\u201d); <em>State v. Bragg, </em>295 N.J.Super. 459, 466, 685 A.2d 488, 491 (1996) (explaining that with respect to jurisdictional facts and under that state\u2019s territorial jurisdiction statute, \u201c \u2018the court should determine as a matter of law whether it has jurisdiction over a specific area, and that the trier of fact then determines whether the crime occurred within that area,\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>State v. Schumann, </em>111 N.J. 470, 545 A.2d 168 (1988))); <em>People v. McLaughlin, 80 </em>N.Y.2d 466, 472, 591 N.Y.S.2d 966, 606 N.E.2d 1357, 1359-60 (1992) (holding that territorial jurisdiction must be proved by the State to the trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt and citing to twenty-two jurisdictions that hold likewise); <em>State v. Batdorf, </em>293 N.C. 486, 494, 238 S.E.2d 497, 502-03 (1977) (\u201c[W]hen jurisdiction is challenged, as here, the State must carry the burden and show beyond a reasonable doubt that North Carolina has jurisdiction to try the accused.\u201d); <em>Commonwealth v. Bighum, </em>452 Pa. 554, 307 A.2d 255, 258 (1973) (\u201c[I]n those infrequent cases where jurisdiction depends upon the resolution of disputed facts, it is within the province of the jury to resolve the issue under proper instructions ____\u201d); <em>see also Bryant v. Taylor, </em>797 F.Supp. 456, 461 (D.Md.1992) (explaining that the factual dispute of whether a criminal offense was committed on land within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States is a jury question); <em>United States v. Greer, </em>956 F.Supp. 531, 536 (D.Vt.1997) (recognizing that under certain statutory offenses, the issue of territorial jurisdiction may be a factual determination for the jury).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Iowa has held expressly that not only is territorial jurisdiction a factual issue to be determined by the jury when disputed, it is an essential element of the crime that the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Liggins, </em>524 N.W.2d at 184. That court\u2019s holding relied in part on Iowa\u2019s rather expansive criminal territorial jurisdiction statute, which essentially provided that territorial jurisdiction is an element to be proven by the state.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The Indiana Court of Appeals in <em>McKinney v. State, </em>558 N.E.2d 860, 863 (Ind.Ct.App.1990), went not quite as far and held that in some cases, the existence of a fact to be proven is treated like an element of the crime. In <em>McKinney, </em>there was testimony that the defendant, Scott McKinney, murdered his victim in Ohio. There also was testimony indicating that he committed the murder in Indiana, where the body was found. The Indiana Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">The presumption that a homicide victim found in the state was murdered in the state leads to the conclusion that the state has territorial jurisdiction to prosecute the perpetrator. Territorial jurisdiction is not necessarily thought of as an element of a crime. Nevertheless, the Model Penal Code makes explicit the conclusion that territorial jurisdiction is a fact that must be established. Model Penal Code \u00a7 1.13(9)(c). Indiana statutes do not define jurisdiction as an element of the offense; <em>however, where the law has established the necessity of a certain fact for an accused to be guilty of an offense, the existence of that fact is treated much like an element of the offense. See McGowan v. State </em>(1977), 267 Ind. 16, 366 N.E.2d 1164; <em>Sumpter v. State </em>(1974), 261 Ind. 471, 306 N.E.2d 95; <em>Young v. State </em>(1972), 258 Ind. 246, 280 N.E.2d 595. In this case then territorial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>jurisdiction is an element of the offense that must be proved by the state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Thus, the court held that because it was necessary for the state to prove that the murder was committed in Indiana in order to convict the defendant in an Indiana court, territorial jurisdiction was an element of the crime of murder under the circumstances of that case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">As we have explained, it is well-settled in Maryland that a court must have territorial jurisdiction over a criminal defendant to exercise its jurisdiction, or power, over that defendant. Similarly, our courts consistently have recognized that in order to satisfy the territorial jurisdiction requirement, the crime, or essential elements of it, must have occurred within the geographic territory of Maryland. For example, this Court explained in <em>Urciolo, </em>272 Md. at 631-32, 325 A.2d at 892:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">Where one absent from a state commits a crime therein through an innocent agent the absentee is liable in the state in which the crime was committed to indictment, trial and conviction. 21 Am.Jur.2d \u00a7 387 (1965)____ In other words, acts performed outside a state, by intending to produce and producing detrimental effects within the state justify that state in prosecuting and convicting the person who causes the harm as if he had been present at the commission of the crime. 21 Am.Jur.2d <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 386 (1965); Annot., 42 A.L.R. 272 (1926). Typically, if a person, while in one state sets in motion a force which operates in another state, the actual presence of the offender in the other state is not necessary to make him amenable to its laws for the crime committed there, if an offense is the immediate result of his action. 21 Am.Jur.2d <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 386 (1965). This principle has been applied where one delivers counterfeit money or a forged instrument to a child of tender years or to an innocent adult, with instructions to pass and utter the same and the act is done. <em>See </em>Clark and Marshall, Crimes \u00a7 4.00 at 207 (7th ed.1967). <em>See Adams v. People, supra </em>[1 N.Y. 173 (1848)], where one who in Ohio addressed a letter to a person in New York and obtained money by false <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>pretenses upon presentation in New York of the letter by an innocent agent was held guilty as a principal in New York. <em>See also Commonwealth v. White, </em>123 Mass. 430, 25 Am. Rep. 116 (1877) (larceny) and <em>Commonwealth v. Thomas, </em>410 Pa. 160, 189 A.2d 255, <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U.S. 856 [84 S.Ct. 118, 11 L.Ed.2d 83] (1963) (conspiracy). [Some citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><em>See also Jones, </em>51 Md.App. at 339, 443 A.2d at 978 (\u201cIn our view of Maryland law, it is not essential to criminal responsibility that the accused perform every act necessary to accomplish the crime within the geographical confines of Maryland.\u201d). Difficulties occur, as in the case <em>sub judice, </em>when the body of a murdered victim is found within the territorial limits of one state,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but other evidence tends to show that the actual murder or essential elements thereof might have taken place in another state, thereby generally giving the latter state power to hear the matter under the concept of territorial jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">We hold that when evidence exists that the crime may have been committed outside Maryland\u2019s territorial jurisdiction and a defendant disputes the territorial jurisdiction of the Maryland courts to try him or her, the issue of where the crime was committed is fact-dependent and thus for the trier of fact. A bald, conclusory assertion that the offense was not committed within Maryland\u2019s territorial jurisdiction, however, is not, by itself, sufficient to create a dispute as to territorial jurisdiction\u2014there must be some supportive evidence. When evidence raises a genuine dispute, territorial jurisdiction becomes an issue the State must prove to the trier of fact.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>note that the issue put forth to the trier of fact is not, what are the territorial boundaries of the jurisdiction of the court; that is, in the context of criminal law, generally an issue for the court. The issue to be determined by the fact finder is when the site or location of the crime is disputed, whether the crime, or certain elements thereof, occurred within the geographical territorial limits of Maryland. Such a determination is a factual issue and in criminal cases in Maryland, factual disputes are for the trier of fact. <em>See </em>Md. Declaration of Rights, art. 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The Court of Special Appeals has decided this issue similarly. In <em>McDonald v. State, </em>61 Md.App. 461, 487 A.2d 306 (1985), the defendant suggested on appeal that the Circuit Court for Montgomery County did not have jurisdiction to hear the case because, during part of the commission of the crimes, the defendant could have traveled into the District of Columbia or other states. The prosecution had presented substantial evidence that the crimes occurred within Maryland. The intermediate appellate court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">It is incumbent upon the appellant to do more than make a bare allegation that the crime might have occurred outside of Maryland in order to sufficiently generate the issue of lack of jurisdiction. In <em>Carroll [v.

We next <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>must determine the State\u2019s burden of proof. The majority of states that have adopted the rule that territorial jurisdiction, when factually disputed, is an issue for the trier of fact also have held the prosecution must prove territorial jurisdiction beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See, e.g., Willoughby, </em>181 Ariz. at 538, 892 P.2d at 1327; <em>Lane, </em>388 So.2d at 1028; <em>Holt, </em>91 Ill.2d at 492, 64 Ill.Dec. 550, 440 N.E.2d at 108; <em>Liggins, </em>524 N.W.2d at 184-85; <em>McKinney, </em>553 N.E.2d at 863; <em>Baldwin, </em>305 A.2d at 559; <em>Bragg, </em>295 N.J.Super. at 465, 685 A.2d at 491; <em>McLaughlin, </em>80 N.Y.2d at 472, 591 N.Y.S.2d 966, 606 N.E.2d at 1359-60; <em>Batdorf, </em>293 N.C. at 494, 238 S.E.2d at 502-03; <em>see also </em>LaFave &amp; Scott, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2.7(b), at 163. A minority of states require only that the state prove territorial jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See, e.g., People v. Cavanaugh, </em>44 Cal.2d 252, 262, 282 P.2d 53, 59 (1955) , <em>cert. denied, </em>350 U.S. 950, 76 S.Ct. 325, 100 L.Ed. 828 (1956) . States requiring the beyond a reasonable doubt standard proffer many compelling reasons for imposing this higher standard. For instance, as noted by the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine in <em>Baldwin, </em>305 A.2d at 559, proper jurisdiction, whether territorial or subject matter, is of vital import to the criminal court trying the defendant. Without it, the case cannot proceed and the judgment cannot be enforced. Imposing the higher standard of proof to prove territorial jurisdiction insures that the court trying the matter \u201cdoes so with authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Arizona Supreme Court has explained that \u201c[i]t simply makes no sense in a single trial to require the factfinder to determine the existence of facts on the reasonable doubt standard for guilt purposes and the same facts on the preponderance standard for [territorial] jurisdiction purposes.\u201d <em>Willoughby, </em>181 Ariz. at 538, 892 P.2d at 1327. Finally, one commentator has summarized the various rationales employed by other jurisdictions in requiring the higher standard with respect to territorial jurisdiction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">[M]ore recent cases have quite consistently held that jurisdiction is a matter which must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Even if the result is not compelled under <em>In </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>re Winship[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] because jurisdiction is not one of \u201cthose facts essential to establishing criminality of the defendant\u2019s conduct,\u201d it is nonetheless sound. Use of the beyond a reasonable doubt standard minimizes the possibility that a defendant will be tried in one state for a crime actually committed elsewhere. Moreover, it makes it more likely that other states will afford full faith and credit to decisions regarding criminal jurisdiction, even though they are not constitutionally required to do so. There is also the practical consideration that using a lesser standard for a portion of the prosecution\u2019s case and the beyond a reasonable doubt standard for the rest would doubtless create confusion in the minds of jurors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">LaFave &amp; Scott, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2.7(b), at 163 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Judge Harrell, writing for the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Smith v. State, </em>116 Md.App. 43, 55-56, 695 A.2d 575, 581-82, <em>cert. denied, </em>347 Md. 254, 700 A.2d 1215 (1997), although not reaching the issue of the State\u2019s burden in proving territorial jurisdiction, did address the State\u2019s burden in proving proper venue. After noting that the defendant bore the initial burden of producing evidence to dispute venue, the intermediate appellate court held it was the State\u2019s burden to prove proper venue when put into dispute by the defendant. The court went on to hold that \u201c[although the State must prove proper venue, it need do so only by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56, 695 A.2d at 581. Discussing decisions from other jurisdictions, the Court of Special Appeals reasoned this standard was proper for proving venue because Maryland does not consider venue an essential element of a crime. The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">Certainly, if venue were an element of a crime in Maryland, it would have to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Nevertheless, this Court is convinced that venue generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>is not an element of a crime nor a fundamental right of an accused. Therefore, it need only be proved by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 61, 695 A.2d at 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Contrary to venue, which concerns the location at which to hold a trial, territorial jurisdiction, although not an element of the crime, is a necessary and fundamental element of the broader concept of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is clear, therefore, that territorial jurisdiction is entirely necessary to proceed properly in any criminal case. Concomitant with the importance of a court\u2019s territorial jurisdiction is the degree of proof required by the State to prove to the trier of fact that territorial jurisdiction is, if put into dispute by the defendant, proper. Although territorial jurisdiction is not an element of the crime in Maryland, given that without territorial jurisdiction a court lacks jurisdiction and, thus, the power to enforce the judgment, we believe it manifest that the State prove to the trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense occurred within the court\u2019s territorial jurisdiction. This elevated burden is consistent with the burden already imposed on the State that it must prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See State v. Grady, </em>276 Md. 178, 181, 345 A.2d 436, 438 (1975). As we have indicated, the Court of Special Appeals already has addressed the burden required in establishing territorial jurisdiction. <em>See Burral, </em>118 Md.App. at 293, 702 A.2d at 783 (\u201cJurisdiction must be proved by the State beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d); <em>Jones, </em>51 Md.App. at 340, 443 A.2d at 978 (\u201cOf course, territorial jurisdiction represents a factual question for the jury to resolve with appropriate instructions and the State has the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">When the evidence generates a genuine issue and becomes, therefore, a factual determination for the trier of fact, the prosecution must prove territorial jurisdiction beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>a reasonable doubt. Although not an element of a criminal offense, territorial jurisdiction is part and parcel to fundamental jurisdictional issues because the offense must have occurred within the geographic limits of the state in order for a court of that state to exercise its power over the defendant. In other words, the State must prove that a <em>Maryland </em>crime has been committed. Given the fundamental nature of territorial jurisdiction and the gravity of the error in wrongly determining it, we hold that in Maryland, once the issue is generated and disputed by more than mere bald allegations, prosecutors must prove territorial jurisdiction to the trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The record in this case reflects that the matter of territorial jurisdiction was disputed. The evidence was that the bodies were discovered in a car in the District of Columbia and that a gun had been discharged inside the passenger compartment. Based upon those facts, the other evidence presented, or lack thereof, respondent\u2019s defense counsel moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s case and again at the close of all the evidence. Counsel also requested that the jury be instructed to determine territorial jurisdiction, and then excepted to the charge that omitted the requested instruction. The trial judge ruled: \u201cI believe that the jurisdiction issues in the case were ones for the court, not for the jury.\u201d Because the trial court in this case decided the matter of territorial jurisdiction as a matter of law and did not present the issue to the jury, even though properly and adequately disputed by the defendant, the case must be reversed and remanded.
