This right is a corollary to the common law doctrine of informed consent, which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">\u201c \u2018follows logically from the universally recognized rule that a physician, treating a mentally competent adult under non-emergency circumstances, cannot properly undertake to perform surgery or administer other therapy without the prior consent of his patient.

Prior to October 1993, the Life-Sustaining Procedures Act governed the form and effect of advance directives. Md.Code (1982, 1990 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 5-601 through 5-614 of the Health-General Article. The Life-Sustaining Procedures Act permitted an individual, who was qualified to execute a will, to execute a declaration, called an advance directive, directing the withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining procedures in the event two physicians certified the individual to be in a terminal condition. <em>Id. \u00a7 </em>5-602.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">This act was criticized, especially in that the advance directives only applied to individuals imminently facing death, without including individuals in a persistent vegetative state, and the act was ambiguous with regard to the withholding or withdrawal of artificially administered sustenance necessary for comfort care and to alleviate pain. J.C. Byrnes, <em>Life-Support Withdrawal: Law of Commiseration or Principle </em>?, 2:2 Md. J. Contemp. Legal Issues 331, 348-49 (1991). As Attorney General Curran observed in 1988, decisions about life-sustaining medical procedures were being made \u201cagainst a background of legal confusion.\u201d 73 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 162, 169 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>In May 1993, the General Assembly repealed the Life-Sustaining Procedures Act and enacted the Health Care Decisions Act (the Act), by Chapter 372 of the Acts of 1993, codified in Md.Code (1982, 1994 Repl.Vol., 1998 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 5-601 through 5-618 of the Health-General Article (HG).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Act overlies an individual\u2019s existing common law right to refuse life-sustaining medical procedures:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-4\">\u201cThe provisions of this subtitle are cumulative with existing law regarding an individual\u2019s right to consent or refuse to consent to medical treatment and do not impair any existing rights or responsibilities which a health care provider, a patient, including a minor or incompetent patient, or a patient\u2019s family may have in regard to the provision, withholding, or withdrawal of life-sustaining procedures under the common law or statutes of the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">\u00a7 5-616(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The Act establishes the framework by which health care decisions may be made. An individual, called the declarant, may make an advance directive. This may be done orally or in writing. \u00a7 5-601(b). The declarant may also appoint an agent for health care. \u00a7 5-601(c). Or, the decision may be made by some other surrogate. \u00a7 5-605.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Under the Act \u201c[a]ny competent individual may, at any time, make a written advance directive regarding the provision of health care to that individual, or the withholding or withdrawal of health care from that individual.\u201d \u00a7 5-602(a). The writing must be signed by or at the express direction of the declarant, dated, and subscribed by two witnesses. \u00a7 5-602(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">With regard to an oral advance directive, the Act provides that \u201c[a]ny competent individual may make an oral advance directive to authorize the providing, withholding, or withdrawing of any life-sustaining procedure or to appoint an agent to make health care decisions for the individual.\u201d \u00a7 5-602(d). An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>oral advance directive made after October 1, 1993, must be \u201cmade in the presence of the [declarant\u2019s] attending physician and one witness and documented as part of the [declarant\u2019s] medical record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The attending physician and the witness must sign and date the documentation in the medical record. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">It is the responsibility of the declarant to notify the attending physician that the declarant has made an advance directive; if the declarant is comatose, incompetent, or otherwise incapable of communication, any other person may notify the attending physician. \u00a7 5-602(f)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Once an attending physician is notified of a written advance directive the physician must make the advance directive, or a copy of it, a part of the declarant\u2019s medical records. \u00a7 5-602(f)(2)(i). Once an attending physician is notified of an oral advance directive, the physician must \u201cmake the fact of the advance directive, including the date the advance directive was made and the name of the attending physician, a part of the declarant\u2019s medical records.\u201d \u00a7 5\u2014602(f)(2)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">An advance directive becomes effective either when conditions specified by the declarant are determined to have been satisfied in the manner specified by the declarant or \u201cwhen the declarant\u2019s attending physician and a second physician certify in writing that the patient is incapable of making an informed decision\u201d regarding the treatment. \u00a7\u00a7 5-602(e)(l), 5-606(a)(1). This certification must be made prior to providing, withholding, or withdrawing medical treatment, and within two hours after the declarant has been personally examined by one of the two certifying physicians. \u00a7 5-606(a)(l). An adult is considered to be \u201cincapable of making an informed decision\u201d when the declarant is unable</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcP\">\u201cto make an informed decision about the provision, withholding, or withdrawal of a specific medical treatment or course of treatment because the patient is unable to understand the nature, extent, or probable consequences of the proposed treatment of course of treatment, is unable to make a rational evaluation of the burdens, risks, and bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>fits of the treatment or course of treatment, or is unable to communicate a decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">\u00a7 5-601(0(1). Compare \u00a7\u00a7 5-602(e)(2), 5-606(a)(2) (providing that, if the declarant is unconscious or unable to communicate by any means, only the written certification of the attending physician is required).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Additionally, where the declarant has an advance directive but has <em>not </em>appointed a health care agent, a health care provider cannot withhold or withdraw life-sustaining procedures<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on the basis of the advance directive unless two physicians certify that the declarant is in one of three diagnostic conditions: a terminal condition, an end-stage condition, or a persistent vegetative state. \u00a7 5-606(b). If the condition is a terminal condition<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or an end-stage condition,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the declarant\u2019s attending physician and a second physician must certify that the declarant is in a terminal or end-stage condition. \u00a7 5-606(b)(1).

An individual who is competent \u201cmay, at any time, make a written advance directive appointing an agent to make health care decisions for the individual under the circumstances stated in the advance directive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An instrument appointing a health care agent must comply with the signature and attestation requirements for an advance directive. \u00a7 5-602(c). \u201c[T]he threshold of inability for being declared \u2018incapable of making an informed decision\u2019 ... must be reached before an advance[ ] directive, appointment of a health care agent, or surrogate decisionmaking may become operative to govern health care decisionmaking.\u201d J.F. Fader II, <em>The Precarious Role of the Courts: Surrogate Health Care Decisionmaking, 53 </em>Md. L.Rev. 1193, 1210-11 (1994) (footnote omitted). If a health care agent has been appointed, and if two physicians have certified as to the declarant\u2019s incapacity, there is no express requirement for physician certification that the declarant is in one of the three defined diagnostic conditions prior to withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining procedures.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Another type of agent for health care under the Act is a surrogate decisionmaker. Under the priority scheme set forth in the Act, where the declarant has no guardian, spouse, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>adult child, the declarant\u2019s parent(s) \u201cmay make decisions about health care for a person who has been certified to be incapable of making an informed decision and who has not appointed a health care agent.\u201d \u00a7 5-605(a)(2). The surrogate decisionmaker must base his decisions for the declarant on the declarant\u2019s wishes (substituted judgment), considering six factors outlined in \u00a7 5-605(c)(2)(i) through (vi), or, if the declarant\u2019s wishes are unknown or unclear, on the declarant\u2019s best interest. \u00a7 5-605(c). A surrogate decisionmaker\u2019s ability to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining procedures is limited to situations in which the declarant is certified by two physicians to be in one of the three defined diagnostic conditions. \u00a7 5-606(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">The Attorney General has also opined that a durable power of attorney authorization under Maryland Code (1974, 1991 Repl.Vol., 1998 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 13-601 of the Estates and Trusts Article may be used to authorize an agent to direct the \u25a0withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining procedures.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-5\">\u201cA person (the principal) may use a durable power of attorney to direct an agent (the attorney in fact) to carry out the principal\u2019s specific directive concerning medical treatment, including the withholding or withdrawing of artificially administered sustenance under specified circumstances. Alternatively, a principal may choose to empower the attorney in fact to make all medical decisions on his or her behalf, rather than directing a specific treatment decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">73 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. at 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">II. The General Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">On July 18, 1994, Wright, age 33, was transported by ambulance from his home to the Moore Clinic, an outpatient HIV facility at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore City. He was suffering from AIDS and was, on that day, complaining of fever, a worsening cough, poor oral intake, and diarrhea. From the Moore Clinic, Wright was admitted as an inpatient to the Osier 8 medicine service at the hospital for evaluation and treatment. From July 18 until July 20, Wright <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>was treated in Osier 8 for acute renal failure. During that time his family regularly visited with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">On July 20, Wright telephoned his mother to tell her that he would be coming home that day after he finished receiving a blood transfusion. The purpose of the blood transfusion was to increase his circulating blood volume, which tended to improve his well-being.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Within minutes after the transfusion was completed, Wright was found unresponsive and without a pulse. Dr. James Miller, the resident physician assigned to care for Wright in Osier 8, directed that cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) be administered. Wright was also intubated to assist his breathing. Breathing and circulation were restored. Wright was then transferred from Osier 8 to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) at Johns Hopkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Wright\u2019s mother, father, and home health care nurse arrived at the hospital after having been informed of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">A physician informed Wright\u2019s parents that it was their decision whether to keep Wright in the MICU or to send him back to Osier 8. The mother requested that Wright\u2019s breathing tube be removed and that he be sent back to Osier 8. She requested comfort care treatment only for her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">The transfer order from the MICU to Osier 8, bearing date of July 20, states: \u201cPt. is DNR/DNI.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The transfer note, dated July 21, describes the occurrence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-10\">\u201c[Patient] was found in full arrest today by nursing staff after receiving a blood transfusion. Total CPR @ 10 min. Successful intubation and conversion from course V-fib to supraventricular tach. Transferred to MICU.

Transferred back to floor____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">\u201cWe will provide comfort care and make no further attempt to reintubate or resuscitate [patient] again per his expressed wishes.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">A consultation report written shortly after the occurrence concluded with certain recommendations, one of which read: \u201cWould contact ethics committee to discuss medical-legal [and] ethical issues i.e., withholding of IVFs, nutrition, antibiotics etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">Following the occurrence, Wright lay in a coma for two days. His mother testified that Dr. Miller informed her that Wright had suffered sixty-five percent brain damage. She further stated that after regaining consciousness Wright could only moan and call out for her. He died on July 30, 1994, ten days after his cardiac arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">Wright had been HIV positive since the mid-1980s and began treatment at Johns Hopkins around 1990. An assessment for HIV case management by Johns Hopkins was made on February 12, 1993. On his HIV Case Management Psychosocial Form, Wright checked a space indicating that he needed legal assistance and inserted the comment \u201cLiving Will, Power of Attorney.\u201d On his HIV Case Management Plan of Care worksheet, in the \u201cLegal Concerns\u201d section, Wright checked the preprinted goal reading \u201c[d]evelop legal plans to meet present and future life planning concerns.\u201d On that same page, under the sub-heading \u201cLife Planning Decisions,\u201d he placed a checkmark next to \u201cDo not resuscitate (DNR)\u201d and \u201cLiving Will/Durable Power of Attorney decisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">Less than two weeks later, on either February 22 or 23, Wright executed a document entitled \u201cDeclaration of Life-Sustaining Procedures (Living Will).\u201d Wright\u2019s Living Will directed that life-sustaining procedures be withheld or withdrawn in the event that two physicians (a) certify Wright to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>in a terminal condition as a result of any incurable injury, disease, or illness, and (b) determine that Wright\u2019s death is imminent and will occur whether or not life-sustaining procedures that would only serve to prolong the dying process were utilized. The Living Will was signed by Wright and his mother and attested by two witnesses.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">The first page of a document entitled \u201cDurable Power of Attorney for Healthcare\u201d is also in evidence. That page does not contain the spaces for signatures and a date. Wright\u2019s mother represented to this Court that Wright executed this document in February 1993. Page one contains the appointment of Wright\u2019s mother as his \u201cagent to make healthcare decisions for [him] as authorized in this document,\u201d and the appointment of his father as alternate health care agent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Page one states that Wright\u2019s mother\u2019s durable power of attorney for health care becomes effective upon the certification by two physicians that Wright is incapable of making certain decisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-4\">\u201c2.

The power shall continue in effect during my disability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The document also states what authority is granted to the health care agent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">\u201c3.

Life-sustaining procedures or measures are those forms of medical care which only serve to artificially prolong the dying process, and may include mechanical ventilation, dialysis, antibiotics, artificial nutrition and hydration, and other forms of medical treatment which stimulate or maintain vital bodily functions. Life-sustaining procedures do not include care necessary to provide comfort or alleviate pain.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">Additional facts will be stated in the discussion of specific issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>III. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">The complaint contains four counts. In Count One (\u201cNegligence-Survival Act\u201d), Wright\u2019s mother, as personal representative of Wright\u2019s estate, alleged that on July 20, 1994, the defendants negligently administered CPR contrary to Wright\u2019s Living Will and \u201cnegligently failed to reasonably, timely and properly explore and/or inquire as to Decedent\u2019s intentions concerning resuscitation,\u201d which resulted in Wright experiencing \u201cadditional unnecessary neurological impairment, pain and suffering, and ultimately ... a prolonged, painful and tragic death on July 30, 1994.\u201d In Count Two (\u2018Wrongful Death\u201d), Wright\u2019s parents alleged that Wright\u2019s suffering that resulted from the resuscitation caused them \u201cmental anguish, unremitting grief and sorrow and pecuniary loss.\u201d In Count Three (\u201cBattery\u201d), Wright\u2019s parents alleged that the defendants \u201cconducted an intentional, non-consensual harmful and/or offensive touching of the Decedent when they instituted resuscitative measures in violation of Decedent\u2019s advance[] directives and/or failed to timely explore Decedent\u2019s desires regarding resuscitative measures.\u201d In Count Four (\u201cLack of Informed Consent\u201d), Wright\u2019s parents alleged that the defendants</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">\u201cfailed to obtain Plaintiffs\u2019 informed consent in that they negligently failed to disclose to Plaintiffs all material information, including, but not limited to, the nature of the proposed treatment [i.e., CPR]; the probability of success of the contemplated resuscitation and its alternatives; the risks and unfortunate consequences associated with such a treatment; and were otherwise negligent in failing to provide them with proper informed consent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The parents stated that \u201c[a]ny reasonable person, under the same or similar circumstances, if provided with such material information, would have withheld consent to the treatment, and would have sought alternative measures and would not have been subjected to continuing pain and suffering.\u201d Pursuant to Maryland Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-2A-06B of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (CJ), the plaintiffs elected to waive arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>After taking Wright\u2019s mother\u2019s deposition, the defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that they were statutorily immune from liability, that Wright\u2019s Living Will never became operative, that there is no legally cognizable claim for Wright\u2019s \u201cwrongful life\u201d damages, that no wrongful act caused Wright\u2019s death, that no battery occurred, and that the emergency of the cardiac arrest suspended the physicians\u2019 duty to obtain informed consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Wright\u2019s parents opposed the motions, filing an affidavit from Wright\u2019s mother and, later, an affidavit from Dr. William J. Brownlee. The plaintiffs argued that the defendants were not statutorily immune; that the Living Will was operative at the time of the resuscitation, or that, even if the Living Will was statutorily invalid, Wright exercised his common law right to refuse medical treatment; and that the administering of CPR was the wrongful act causing Wright\u2019s death. In a supplemental memorandum of law the parents argued that, contrary to Johns Hopkins\u2019s written policies, the defendants failed to place Wright\u2019s Living Will in his medical chart and failed to discuss the matter of resuscitation with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The circuit court entered judgment for the defendants for reasons stated in a lengthy written opinion. Much of the opinion reviewed facts as asserted by the plaintiffs and held that they did not alter the legal result. The court concluded that, at the time of his cardiac arrest, Wright was not in a terminal or an end-stage condition. Nor were the defendants \u201crequired to delay resuscitation even for the minutes required to seek and obtain either consent of a health care agent or formal medical certification of the decedent\u2019s pre-arrest medical condition as might warrant a' declination to resuscitate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">With regard to Wright\u2019s Living Will, the court concluded that, although there may exist a dispute of facts as to \u201cinstitutional pre-resuscitation knowledge of that advance directive,\u201d the conditions precedent to trigger the Living Will, that is, physician certification that Wright was in a terminal condition or imminently facing death, had not been met. With regard to oral directives by Wright the court held that, if the health care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>providers who resuscitated Wright could be shown to have been on notice of contrary oral directives at that time, they were not documented in Wright\u2019s medical records as required under the Act and were, therefore, not binding on other, subsequently-involved physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">Further, agreeing with an opinion by the Attorney General, 79 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 137 (1994), the court held that certain uncertified oral statements by Wright lacked \u201creasonable clarity for informed medical implementation,\u201d and that there was no evidence that cardiac arrest had been predicted and particular consideration given to a DNR in that event.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Wright\u2019s parents appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. Prior to that court\u2019s consideration of the case, Johns Hopkins and the defendant physicians petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari. Wright\u2019s parents cross-petitioned. We granted both petitions. <em>Johns Hopkins Hosp. v. Wright, </em>350 Md. 280, 711 A.2d 871 (1998).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">IY. The Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The parties have raised numerous and somewhat overlapping issues. They are: \u25a0 \u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-8\">1. Under the Act or the common law, does an individual, and, accordingly, the individual\u2019s estate, have a cause of action for a health care provider\u2019s failure to comply with the individual\u2019s advance directive?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-9\">2. Did the plaintiffs set forth sufficient facts to state causes of action for negligence, wrongful death, battery, and lack of informed consent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-10\">3. Under the Act, does a sudden and unforeseen cardiac arrest render an otherwise non-terminal individual \u201cterminal,\u201d thereby triggering the operation of an advance directive?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>4. Under the Act or the common law, once an individual makes an advance directive, what measures must one or more individual health care providers at an institution take to notify other individual health care providers at the same institution of the advance directive?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-4\">5. Under the Act, is a health care provider immune from liability for providing life-sustaining procedures to an individual who has directed in advance that life-sustaining procedures be withheld or withdrawn in certain circumstances?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-5\">6. Under Maryland law, are the damages resulting from the administration of a life-sustaining procedure a compensable \u201cinjury\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-6\">7. In an emergency situation, is a health care provider liable for providing life-sustaining procedures to an individual who has made an advance directive if the health care provider is unaware of the advance directive, believes the advance directive not to be operative, or cannot ascertain the individual\u2019s intentions regarding the provision of life-sustaining procedures?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">We shall assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that the answer to the first issue is \u201cyes.\u201d Nevertheless, because the answer to issue two is \u201cno,\u201d we affirm the judgment of the circuit court. Accordingly, it is unnecessary specifically to address the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">Y. The Negligence Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">There are three aspects to the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the .defendants breached a duty to Wright to withhold resuscitation: (A) violation of the instructions in the Living Will; (B) violation of a statutorily recognized, oral advance directive; and (C) violation of a legally effective, oral DNR instruction that does not meet the formal requirements of the Act. In analyzing each of these arguments the evidence most favorable to the plaintiffs is that the Living Will was in Wright\u2019s chart at Osier 8 on July 20,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>A. The Living Will</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">Wright\u2019s Living Will was executed on either February-22 or 23, 1993, prior to the October 1, 1993 effective date of the Act. The Living Will was therefore executed pursuant to the then-effective Life-Sustaining Procedures Act, Md.Code (1982, 1990 Repl.Vol.), HG \u00a7 5-602. In fact, Wright\u2019s Living Will follows substantially verbatim the model form for a living will set forth in that prior law. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 5-602(c). The Act, however, states that \u201c[a] valid living will- or durable power of attorney for health care made prior to October 1,1993 shall be given effect as provided in this article, even if not executed in accordance with the terms of this article.\u201d \u00a7 5-616(b). Therefore, Wright\u2019s February 1993 Living Will is governed by the Health Care Decisions Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Under the Act, an advance directive becomes operative either under the conditions specified by the declarant, or, if no such conditions are specified, upon the written certification of two physicians that the declarant is incapable of making an informed decision. \u00a7 5-602(e)(l). In this case, Wright did specify the conditions that trigger the operation of the advance directive. His Living Will provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">\u201cIf at any time I should have any incurable injury, disease or illness certified to be a terminal condition by two (2) physicians who have personally examined me, one (1) of whom shall be my attending physician, and the physicians have determined that my death is imminent and will occur whether or not life-sustaining procedures are utilized and where the application of such procedures would serve only to artificially prolong the dying process, I direct that such procedures be withheld or withdrawn, and that I be permitted to die naturally....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">There is no evidence that any physicians certified that Wright was in a terminal condition and that his death was imminent. Therefore, under its terms the Living Will never became operative. As a result, even if the Osier 8 attending physician was on notice of Wright\u2019s Living Will, that advance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>directive would not have precluded the attending physician from resuscitating Wright in the event of a cardiac arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Wright\u2019s parents dispute that the Living Will was not operative. First, they contend that at the time of the resuscitation Wright\u2019s medical condition was terminal and his death was imminent. This argument, however, does not overcome' the lack of the physicians\u2019 certification at the time of the resuscitation that was required to trigger the operation of the Living Will.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Second, Wright\u2019s parents submit that \u201c[r]egardless of whether the written Advance Directive was operable in and of itself, it nonetheless operates as a clear directive of Decedent not to have any life-sustaining procedures performed on him.\u201d The Living Will actually indicates a contrary directive; that is, a directive to have life-sustaining procedures performed only in the specified circumstances which are to be determined to exist by two physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Third, Wright\u2019s parents argue that Wright was extubated after the physicians \u201crealized that the Decedent had signed an Advance Directive refusing life-sustaining treatment,\u201d thereby acknowledging that Wright\u2019s Living Will was operative despite the lack of certification. The direct and seemingly undisputed evidence from the medical records and from Wright\u2019s mother\u2019s deposition testimony is that Wright was extubated pursuant to his family\u2019s request and not the Living Will. Viewing the extubation solely in terms of the Living Will, and ignoring the mother\u2019s agency for health care, it was the withdrawal of life-sustaining procedures, without the conditions of the Living Will having been satisfied, that was not authorized. The plaintiffs, however, cannot complain of this deviation from the authorization of the Living Will because they requested the extubation.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">B. Oral Advance Directive</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">Nor is the Act\u2019s recognition of oral advance directives of assistance to the plaintiffs. An oral advance directive that is effective under the Act must be made in the presence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>attending physician and one witness and must be documented as part of the patient\u2019s medical record. \u00a7 5-602(d). In this case the medical record does not document any oral directive, as that term is used in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">C. DNR Order</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The plaintiffs direct their principal arguments to attempting to cobble from pieces of evidence a non-statutory, oral advance directive by Wright that his chart was to be coded DNR. It is undisputed, however, that no DNR order was in Wright\u2019s medical record. Further, Wright\u2019s mother admitted on deposition that she did not know whether her son ever expressed to Dr. Miller her son\u2019s wish \u201cthat if he got to the point where he was unable to eat on his own and breathe on his own, he didn\u2019t want those types of functions to be carried out by machinery.\u201d ' She also admitted that she did not know if her son expressed to anyone, other than herself, his wish that \u201cif he had a heart attack he didn\u2019t want any measures taken ... just let him go.\u201d In addition, Wright\u2019s mother admitted that, prior to Wright\u2019s cardiac arrest, she did not tell \u201cany of the health care providers \u2022 that if [Wright] had a sudden and unexpected heart attack, that he wanted the doctors to just let him go.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Against the background set forth above, the following portions of the record present the evidence most favorable to the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In her affidavit Wright\u2019s mother states that it was Wright\u2019s understanding, as well as hers, that the Living Will was effective immediately \u201cand in the event that it came [Wright\u2019s] time to go, [Wright] did not want any life-sustaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>procedures performed on him.\u201d He \u201cintended and understood the Living Will to include refusal to be resuscitated.\u201d After executing the Living Will, \u201con each occasion when [Wright] was to be admitted,\u201d including the admission on July 18, 1994, \u201cDr. Patricia Barditch-Cro[vo] asked [Wright] whether he had changed his mind regarding the Living Will, and [Wright] said he had not.\u201d In the six months preceding Wright\u2019s death, he was seen in the Johns Hopkins emergency room on at least two occasions. \u201cOn both [of] these occasions, [Wright] told the emergency room physician that he did not want to be resuscitated.\u201d During Wright\u2019s admission to Johns Hopkins immediately preceding the admission of July 18, 1994, Wright\u2019s mother \u201cdid see the Living Will in [Wright\u2019s] chart.\u201d On July 20, 1994, after the resuscitation, a nurse who was being consoled by Wright\u2019s home health care nurse said \u201cthat she had not looked in [Wright\u2019s] chart before she called the code.\u201d On July 22, 1994, while Wright\u2019s mother was visiting with him, \u201ca nurse or nursing assistant told [her] that she didn\u2019t know how this could have happened when the living will was in [Wright\u2019s] medical records.\u201d Wright \u201cmade it clear to everyone, friends, family and his health care providers, that he did not want any life-sustaining procedures, including resuscitation, because he wanted to die with dignity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">In her deposition Wright\u2019s mother testified that upon arriving at the MICU the physician in charge of the MICU, who \u201cwas not a part of the [resuscitation] team,\u201d approached her and apologized on behalf of those who had resuscitated Wright. The MICU chief said that \u201c[h]e knew that [Wright] had the DNR. He knew [Wright] had a living will on his chart and should not have been resuscitated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The evidence relied on by the plaintiffs blurs the distinction between Wright\u2019s Living Will and a possible DNR order. The latter is an order that \u201cspeaks to a form of treatment, CPR, that would be applied, if at all, only after an unpredictable and dramatic change in the patient\u2019s condition\u2014 that is, if the patient were to suffer a cardiac arrest.\u201d 79 Op. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Att\u2019y Gen. at 137.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The only evidence bearing on the standard of care for the entry of a DNR order is found in the Johns Hopkins Medical Staff Manual which sets forth that institution\u2019s established policy \u201cto guide the physician when writing DNR orders.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-4\">\u201cThe Attending Physician has the responsibility to discuss with the patient ... the withholding of resuscitation when death is imminent and inevitable from an irreversible condition or there exists a high probability that this will occur during the course of the hospitalization, or may occur during an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Thus, the relevant period for the writing of any DNR order would have been while Wright was in Osier 8 with Dr. Miller as his attending physician. In his affidavit Dr. Miller states that \u201cWright\u2019s cardiac arrest was not an expected result of his underlying disease process, but rather an acute, but reversible, reaction to his blood transfusion.\u201d That opinion is uncontradicted. Indeed it was anticipated that Wright would be discharged to home following his blood transfusion, and he had telephoned his mother shortly prior to the transfusion to arrange for transportation. Further, the evidence most favorable to the plaintiffs is the opinion of the plaintiffs\u2019 medical expert that, as of July 18-20, 1994, Wright\u2019s life expectancy was less than six months. That is not \u201cimminent\u201d death in the context of the standard of care described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Thus, any vitality of plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claim turns on the legal sufficiency of the use of \u201cresuscitation\u201d in the oral statements by Wright to an unidentified emergency room physician on each of two admissions there prior to July 18, 1994, and in the oral statement by the physician in charge of the MICU. We hold for policy reasons that this evidence is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>legally sufficient. Here, none of the physicians involved in the statements was Wright\u2019s attending physician during the relevant period. We will not recognize these uses of \u201cresuscitation\u201d by or in the presence of physicians other than the attending physician to be the functional equivalent of the entry of a DNR order in Wright\u2019s chart at Osier 8. Simply put, if such a conclusory and unexplained oral statement can be the basis for finding that there was in fact a DNR order, so that an action for violating the order would he, then an oral statement made without any explanation of its basis by a physician who was not attending prior to cardiac arrest would support withholding resuscitation. Life or death decisions are not to be made so casually.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">The Attorney General has recognized that a non-statutory, oral advance directive by a patient to an attending physician may be effective, under limited circumstances, to permit the entry of a DNR order. 79 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. at 154. That opinion addressed the \u201cdifficult issue [of] the effect to be accorded a formerly competent patient\u2019s decision to decline CPR if the patient made the decision in a discussion with a physician that was unwitnessed and therefore is <em>not </em>an oral advance directive under the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Competing considerations were recognized. It \u201cwould not be faithful to the General Assembly\u2019s purpose [to accord] the same legal effect to an unwitnessed statement as to an oral advance directive. To do so would make a nullity out of the witness requirement\u201d which was intended to be \u201ca measure of protection for the patient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Yet, \u201cthe Act surely has not displaced entirely the legal right of patients simply to tell their physicians what they want and don\u2019t want, with informed consent.\u201d Effect must be given to the cumulative rights provision, \u00a7 5-616(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The principle applied by the Attorney General was that a person has a right to decide about future life-sustaining procedures. 79 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. at 154 (citing 73 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>185). In the cited opinion that principle undergirded the conclusion that a patient could \u201cmake a choice about life-sustaining procedures, including artificially administered sustenance, should that situation arise,\u201d without executing a formal document. 73 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. at 185. Instead, \u201ca person who is competent to make medical decisions at the time of decision about insertion of a feeding tube can decide whether to allow that procedure or not by simply telling the attending physician, who should document the decision in the patient\u2019s record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, in the 1994 opinion the Attorney General concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-4\">\u201cA competent patient\u2019s decision to forgo CPR may be given direct effect by entry of a DNR order, even if the patient is no longer competent and no health care [agent] or surrogate is available ... if the patient\u2019s decision, albeit not an oral advance directive, is the product of informed consent about contingencies in the discrete context of a discussion of <em>\u2018a </em>future course of treatment.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">79 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. at 154 (quoting 73 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. at 185). The opinion, however, expressed the following caveat:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">\u201cBut if the patient merely tells the physician of a generalized and open-ended desire to forgo life-sustaining procedures, including CPR, in the indefinite future, the decision may be given effect only as evidence that might allow some other decision-maker\u2014a health care agent, surrogate, or guardian with court approval\u2014to authorize a DNR order. Physicians need to be aware of the importance of having a witness to this more generalized type of patient decision in order to create a fully effective oral advance directive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"An5\"><em>Id. </em>at 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">We agree with the analysis by the Attorney General. In the instant matter the evidence supporting the entry of a DNR order does not rise above evidence of a \u201cgeneralized and open-ended desire\u201d on Wright\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">The foregoing conclusion answers a number of the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments. As we previously noted in Part V.A, <em>supra, </em>the parents contend that the extubation of Wright evidences that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>the defendants could have applied the Living Will without a certification that the conditions therein set forth had been met. As explained above, Wright\u2019s mother, as his agent for health care, could, and did, give effect to her son\u2019s generalized intent, but the defendants could not give it effect, absent informed consent given by Wright in the context of an explanation of the contingencies of future treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Plaintiffs additionally submit that the defendants breached a duty to Wright to record his expressed desires in his record. This submission merely recycles the argument that we have previously rejected. From the standpoint of our assumed legal duty on the defendants to honor a DNR order, a \u201cgeneralized and open-ended desire\u201d need not be recorded because it is not a DNR order.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Essentially the plaintiffs urge this Court to recognize a common law action for having administered CPR that would be viewed as unauthorized under the evidence most favorable to the plaintiffs in this case. In <em>Mack, </em>this Court foreshadowed the need for comprehensive legislation related to a patient\u2019s right to refuse medical treatment by declaring that changing the common law on matters related to this right was a \u201cquintessentially legislative\u201d function. 329 Md. at 222, 618 A.2d at 761. The Act, enacted several months after the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mack, </em>was the product of intense intellectual debate between judges, attorneys, academicians, ethicist's, and physicians and drew on two competing bills submitted to the General Assembly. For a detailed account of the evolution of the Act, see D.E. Hoffmann, <em>The Maryland Health Care Decisions Act: Achieving the Right Balance?, </em>53 Md. L.Rev. 1064 (1994), and J.C. Byrnes, <em>The Health Care Decisions Act of 1993, </em>23 U. Balt. L.Rev. 1 (1993). We shall not use our power to declare the common law to move the line between an authorized and an unauthorized DNR further from the statutory, oral advance directive than the type of DNR order that we have recognized above as authorized. The legitimate public policy concern for protecting the patient does not permit embracing within the authorized DNR order one entered on the basis of a generalized desire that has not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>translated by informed consent into a discrete plan for future treatment contingencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">For all of the foregoing reasons, under the circumstances here, the CPR was authorized by the treatment without consent provision of the Act, \u00a7 5-607.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">VI. The Other Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The parents alleged in their complaint that the defendants \u201cfailed to obtain [Wright\u2019s parents\u2019] informed consent in that they negligently failed to disclose to [Wright\u2019s parents] all material information, including, but not limited to, the nature of the proposed treatment [i.e., CPR]; the probability of success of the contemplated resuscitation and its alternatives; the risks and unfortunate consequences associated with such a treatment; and were otherwise negligent in failing to provide them with proper informed consent.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Section 5-607, under which the CPR was authorized, accords with the common law doctrine of informed consent, which is suspended in an emergency situation. <em>See Sard v. Hardy, </em>281 Md. at 438-39, 379 A.2d at 1019 (\u201cThe doctrine of informed consent ... follows logically from the universally recognized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>rule that a physician, treating a mentally competent adult under non-emergency circumstances, cannot properly undertake to perform surgery or administer other therapy without the prior consent of his patient.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 wrongful death claim is without merit. The action lies \u201cagainst a person whose wrongful act causes the death of another.\u201d CJ \u00a7 3-902(a). Here the alleged wrongful act, CPR, caused Wright to live.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">It appears that in this appeal Wright\u2019s parents have abandoned their battery claim. While they preserved the claim in their cross-petition for certiorari, they have made no argument in support of the claim in their brief to this Court. Further, in their reply brief Wright\u2019s parents have failed to respond to the defendants\u2019 assertion that Wright\u2019s parents \u201chave abandoned any claim that the Circuit Court erred in its dismissal of the Wrights\u2019 battery claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.
