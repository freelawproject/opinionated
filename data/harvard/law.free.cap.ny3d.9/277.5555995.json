Detective Elliott obtained information about Temel Greene in violation of Mr. Greene\u2019s physician-patient privilege, and where that privilege implicates a constitutionally-protected right, both the information obtained through the initial violation and the fruits of that violation must be suppressed. <em>(People v Figueroa, </em>173 AD2d 156; <em>People v Petro, </em>122 AD2d 309; <em>People v Sinski, </em>88 NY2d 487; <em>Matter of Grand Jury Investigation of Onondaga County, </em>59 NY2d 130; <em>Matter of Grand Jury Investigation in N.Y.

II. The second photo array, the lineup and the identifying witness\u2019s in-court identification of Temel Greene must be suppressed where the second photo array was unduly suggestive, and where it therefore irreparably tainted the lineup and in-court identification. <em>(People v Chipp, </em>75 NY2d 327; <em>People v Gilbert, </em>295 AD2d 275; <em>Simmons v United States, </em>390 US 377; <em>People v Malphurs, </em>111 AD2d 266; <em>People v Hall, </em>81 AD2d 644; <em>People v Tindal, </em>69 AD2d 58.) III. The Appellate Division correctly concluded that the trial court\u2019s <em>Sandoval </em>ruling was erroneous where that ruling permitted inquiry into the locations and dates of Temel Greene\u2019s prior arrests; contrary to the Appellate Division\u2019s ruling, however, that error was not harmless. <em>(People v Sandoval, </em>34 NY2d 371; <em>People v Coe, </em>95 AD2d 685; <em>People v Arnold, </em>298 AD2d 895; <em>People v Moore, </em>238 AD2d 228; <em>People v Walston, </em>99 AD2d 847; <em>People v Rivera, </em>216 AD2d 221; <em>People v Grant, </em>7 NY3d 421.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b372-12\"><em>Robert T.

Detective Michael Elliott was assigned to investigate the homicide. Elliott learned from the victim\u2019s aunt that, according to talk on the street, the shooting was the result of a fight on October 13 in which a man had been slashed in the face.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">Elliott went to a nearby hospital and asked an administrator \u201cif anyone came in for a slashing to the face on that date.\u201d The administrator gave him defendant\u2019s name and address. With the help of a police computer, Elliott obtained defendant\u2019s arrest record and a photograph of him. A witness to the shooting identified the photograph; the trail thus begun led to more evidence against defendant, and eventually to his conviction for second degree manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">The main ground for defendant\u2019s appeal is the denial of his motion to suppress all evidence obtained as a result of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>hospital\u2019s disclosure of defendant\u2019s name and address to Elliott. Supreme Court held that evidence obtained in violation of the physician-patient privilege need not be suppressed. The Appellate Division affirmed on two alternative grounds: that there was no breach of the privilege, and that even if there was suppression was not required. A Judge of this Court granted leave to appeal, and we now affirm on the second of those two grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">CPLR 4504 (a) says: \u201cUnless the patient waives the privilege, a person authorized to practice medicine . . . shall not be allowed to disclose any information which he acquired in attending a patient in a professional capacity, and which was necessary to enable him to act in that capacity.\u201d We have held that the privilege does not apply to \u201csuch ordinary incidents and facts as are plain to the observation of any one without expert or professional knowledge\u201d <em>(Klein v Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., </em>221 NY 449, 453 [1917]). The People argue that the rule of <em>Klein </em>controls this case, because defendant\u2019s wound was visible to anyone who looked at him. Defendant argues that, while his wound may have been obvious, the cause of it was not; he says that laypeople cannot tell whether a wound is caused by a \u201cslash\u201d or some other kind of injury <em>(cf. Matter of Grand Jury Investigation in N.Y. County, </em>98 NY2d 525, 531 [2002] [the privilege may turn on \u201cwhether particular injuries and their causes would have been obvious to a layperson\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">We need not decide this issue, because we agree with both courts below that, even if there was a violation of the physician-patient privilege, the suppression of the evidence found as a result is not required. The physician-patient privilege is based on statute, not the State or Federal Constitution <em>(Klein, </em>221 NY at 453). Our decisions make clear that a violation of a statute does not, without more, justify suppressing the evidence to which that violation leads <em>(People v Patterson, </em>78 NY2d 711, 716-717 [1991]).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">We have made an exception to this rule only when the principal purpose of a statute is to protect a constitutional right <em>(People v Taylor, </em>73 NY2d 683, 690-691 [1989]; <em>People v Gallina, </em>66 NY2d 52, 59 [1985]). The statute at issue in <em>Taylor </em>governed the procedure to be followed on an application by police officers for a search warrant; the statute in <em>Gallina </em>governed court-authorized wiretapping. In each case, while a violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>statute was not necessarily a violation of a constitutional right, the statutes existed to safeguard rights protected by the Fourth Amendment. In those cases, we held that when the statutes were violated, the evidence obtained as a result should be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">This case is nothing like <em>Taylor </em>or <em>Gallina. </em>There is no constitutional right to privacy in physician-patient communications. The Legislature has created, by statute, several exceptions to the physician-patient privilege <em>(see e.g. </em>Penal Law \u00a7 265.25 [doctors must report gunshot wounds and life-threatening knife wounds to the police]; Family Ct Act \u00a7 1046 [a] [vii] [physician-patient privilege inapplicable at hearings in child protective proceedings]). It could, if it chose, make another exception for the disclosure in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Indeed, the argument for suppression here is weaker than the argument we rejected in <em>Patterson, </em>for the statute at issue in <em>Patterson, </em>which required return to a criminal defendant of his photograph after charges against him were dismissed, had at least some relation to a constitutionally protected right: the presumption of innocence <em>(see </em>78 NY2d at 716). The physician-patient privilege, by contrast, does not serve primarily to protect individuals against government conduct; it regulates a private relationship. The primary obligation to comply with CPLR 4504 is the doctor\u2019s\u2014or, in this case, the hospital\u2019s. To suppress evidence resulting from a violation of section 4504 would be to punish the State for a doctor\u2019s or hospital\u2019s misconduct\u2014a punishment unlikely to deter doctors and hospitals, who have little interest in whether criminal prosecutions succeed or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Defendant\u2019s other arguments lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
