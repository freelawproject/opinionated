There is no merit to plaintiffs\u2019 claim against Japan Airlines Management Corp. regarding improper illumination of the Port Authority\u2019s parking area. <em>(Orr v Spring, </em>288 AD2d 663; <em>Bernstein v Starrett City, </em>303 AD2d 530.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b448-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b448-6\">Jones, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">In this consolidated negligence action, we are required to consider the relationship between the exclusive remedy provisions of Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7\u00a7 11 and 29 (6), and principles of agency. Specifically, we are asked whether Japan Airlines Management Corp. (JAMC), as the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey\u2019s (Port Authority) putative managing agent, may benefit from the exclusive remedy defense in an action by plaintiff Brent Fung, a Port Authority employee, against JAMC. In a related action, Fung seeks to recover damages against Aero Snow Removal Corp. arising out of the same alleged injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"ALq\">Plaintiff Brent Fung is employed by the Port Authority as an electrician. Plaintiff claims that at approximately 6:00 a.m. on January 22, 2001, he slipped and fell on a patch of ice shortly after arriving in the parking lot of Building 14 at John F. Kennedy International Airport and that he sustained back injuries requiring surgery, for which he began collecting workers\u2019 compensation payments a year later. The Port Authority owned the Building 14 premises, which it leased to JAMC. JAMC simultaneously subleased 70% of the premises\u2014which encom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>passes the subject parking lot\u2014back to the Port Authority. The lease/sublease declared that \u201c[t]his Agreement does not constitute [JAMC] as the agent or representative of the Port Authority for any purpose whatsoever,\u201d and that \u201c[n] either a partnership nor any joint [ ]venture\u201d is created. This statement of the parties\u2019 relationship is repeated elsewhere in the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The lease obligated JAMC to contract with other entities for snow removal and electrical lighting work for the entire premises, among other maintenance responsibilities. Pursuant to the lease, JAMC contracted with Aero to commence \u201cpush and pile\u201d snow removal operations when one inch of snow accumulated. Further, Aero would provide \u201cice/snow control\u201d services\u2014such as salting or sanding\u2014at JAMC\u2019s request. Finally, the contract provided that JAMC was to release Aero upon the satisfactory completion of the snow removal. The Port Authority and JAMC share maintenance expenses on a 70%/30% basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">In 2002, Fung, and his wife suing derivatively (plaintiffs), commenced a negligence action against JAMC, among others (Action No. 1). JAMC subsequently commenced a third-party action against Aero and a fourth-party action against the Port Authority, each for common-law and contractual indemnification. Plaintiffs thereafter commenced a separate negligence action against Aero (Action No. 2). At his examination before trial, Fung testified that he did not notice any snow on top of or near the ice patch after he fell, nor did he know for how long the ice patch existed. Moreover, Fung testified that he had complained to his supervisor about poor or inadequate lighting in the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">JAMC\u2019s representatives also testified. Rudolph Auslander, JAMC\u2019s president, indicated that he signed the snow removal contract with Aero on behalf of JAMC as \u201cthe agent for [the] Port Authority.\u201d JAMC\u2019s signature line on its contract with Aero says that JAMC acted \u201cAs Agents [sic] for the Port Authority.\u201d Sameer Sikander, a facilities manager at JAMC, testified as to the snowstorm that occurred during the two days preceding Fung\u2019s accident, January 20 and 21, 2001. Relying on his \u201csnow logs\u201d created during the storm, Sikander testified that salting of the Building 14 parking lot occurred between 10:30 p.m. on January 20 and 1:30 a.m. on January 21, but that subsequent salting may have taken place. He further testified that heavy snow fell in the early morning hours of January 21 and that snow clearing operations began around 3:00 a.m. and continued into the afternoon. Further, Aero\u2019s operations manager, Joseph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Boecio, testified that the JAMC/Aero contract did not require Aero to affirmatively salt or sand any area; that, based on Aero\u2019s records, all of Aero\u2019s work concerning the snow storm in question occurred on January 21, between 12:30 a.m. and 3:15 p.m., a day before Fung\u2019s accident; and that Aero did not sand or salt the parking lot on January 21. \u2022 , .</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Following discovery, JAMC moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and all cross claims asserted against it. JAMC argued that, as the Port Authority\u2019s agent responsible for maintenance of the parking lot and lighting fixtures, it was immune from liability under the exclusive remedy provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law. Additionally, JAMC argued that, in any event, it did not have actual or constructive notice of the alleged ice patch or of the parking lot\u2019s allegedly poor lighting.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Aero subsequently moved for summary judgment dismissing JAMC\u2019s third-party complaint against it in Action No. 1 and separately moved for summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in Action No. 2. Further, the Port Authority moved for summary judgment dismissing JAMC\u2019s fourth-party complaint against it in Action No. 1, and JAMC cross-moved for the same relief on the second and third causes of action for contractual indemnification, apparently abandoning its common-law indemnification claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Supreme Court denied JAMC\u2019s and Aero\u2019s motions to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 claims, and Aero\u2019s motion to dismiss JAMC\u2019s third-party complaint. Further, the court granted the Port Authority\u2019s motion to the extent of dismissing JAMC\u2019s common-law indemnification claim in the fourth-party complaint in Action No. 1, but denied its motion, and JAMC\u2019s cross motion, as to the contractual indemnification claim, noting that questions of fact existed as to JAMC\u2019s liability in the underlying personal injury action. The court rejected JAMC\u2019s exclusive remedy defense because JAMC and Fung\u2019s employer, the Port Authority, \u201care separate legal entities\u201d with \u201cseparate income tax returns, separate budgets, and separate day-to day control\u201d even though they may have \u201csome financial interrelation\u201d (2005 NY Slip Op 30132[U], *4).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">JAMC appealed from so much of Supreme Court\u2019s order as denied its motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint in Action No. 1 and denied its cross motion for summary judgment on the contractual indemnification claim in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>fourth-party complaint against the Port Authority. Aero cross-appealed from so much of Supreme Court\u2019s order as denied its motions for summary judgment dismissing JAMC\u2019s and plaintiffs\u2019 complaints against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The Appellate Division reversed Supreme Court\u2019s order, insofar as appealed from, granted JAMC\u2019s motion and dismissed the complaint and all cross claims asserted against it in Action No. 1, granted Aero\u2019s motion and dismissed the third-party complaint in Action No. 1 and the complaint in Action No. 2, and \u201csevered\u201d Action No. 1 \u201cagainst the remaining defendants\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>(Fung v Japan Airlines Co., Ltd., </em>31 AD3d 707, 707-708 [2d Dept 2006]). As to the injured plaintiffs underlying action against JAMC, the court relied on <em>Seudath v Mott </em>(202 AD2d 658 [2d Dept 1994], <em>lv dismissed </em>85 NY2d 890 [1995]) and determined that because JAMC \u201cwas serving as the Port Authority\u2019s managing agent when the accident occurred, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against [JAMC] are barred pursuant to the exclusivity provisions of Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 708).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">As to Aero in Action No. 2, the court concluded that plaintiffs failed to raise a triable issue of fact in response to Aero\u2019s demonstrated entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. The court determined that the parties\u2019 remaining contentions were either rendered academic or were without merit. This Court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">A. Action No. 1: Fung v Japan Airlines Company, Ltd., et al.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7\u00a7 11 and 29 (6) restrict an employee from suing his or her employer or coemployee for an accidental injury sustained in the course of employment. However, the workers\u2019 compensation remedy is generally not exclusive if the employee is injured by a third person <em>(see </em>Minkowitz, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 64, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29, at 196). Central to the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>before us is whether JAMC was Fung\u2019s employer entitled to claim exclusivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Plaintiffs argue that in finding that JAMC acted as the Port Authority\u2019s managing agent, the Appellate Division disregarded the clear statement of intent in the JAMC/Port Authority lease; that, in any event, the court misapplied the exclusivity defense to bar their action against JAMC because even if JAMC may be considered the Port Authority\u2019s agent, JAMC was neither \u201cin the same employ\u201d as Fung, a Port Authority employee <em>(see </em>\u00a7 29 [6]), nor Fung\u2019s employer within the meaning of Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 11. JAMC, in turn, contends that it was effectively the Port Authority\u2019s agent, noting that the JAMC/Aero contract states that JAMC \u201crepresents that all charges under this Agreement are incurred by [JAMC] as <em>agent </em>for the Port Authority\u201d and that it signed the contract <em>\u201cAs Agents </em>for the Port Authority\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Initially, we note that whether or not JAMC actually served as the Port Authority\u2019s managing agent, on this record its defense must fail as a matter of law <em>(see Thompson v Grumman Aerospace Corp., </em>78 NY2d 553, 557 [1991]). The Appellate Division here relied on its decision in <em>Seudath, </em>concluding that JAMC is entitled to the exclusive remedy defense simply because it is the Port Authority\u2019s managing agent. We do not read <em>Seudath </em>as supporting this conclusion and, in any event, the purported managing agency status in the present case does not establish a relationship between JAMC and Fung that would allow JAMC to assert the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law defense. In <em>Seudath, </em>plaintiff was the superintendent of a building co-owned by a married couple. Plaintiff received workers\u2019 compensation payments and then sued the building\u2019s co-owner, a managing agent and a company that \u201cmanage[d] the premises\u201d (202 AD2d at 658). Critically, the defendants were deemed to have \u201c \u2018operated\u2019, \u2018maintained\u2019, and \u2018controlled\u2019 the premises\u201d and were thus held to be either plaintiffs \u201ccoemployees or special employers\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 659). This conclusion necessarily implies that the defendants had some cognizable working relationship with the plaintiff or his employer that rendered them either the plaintiffs employer or coemployee for Workers\u2019 Compensation Law purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The exclusive remedy doctrine has been previously extended to persons or entities other than the injured plaintiffs direct employer <em>(see e.g. Thompson, 78 </em>NY2d 553 [1991] [special employers]; <em>Ugijanin v 2 W. 45th St. Joint Venture, </em>43 AD3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>911 [2d Dept 2007] [same]; <em>Alvarez v Cunningham Assoc., L.P., </em>21 AD3d 517 [2d Dept 2005] [same]; <em>Kramps v Goldbetter, </em>292 AD2d 571 [2d Dept 2002] [employer in alter ego context]; <em>Gonzalez v Lovett Assoc., </em>228 AD2d 342 [1st Dept 1996] [special employer in managing <em>agency </em>context]; <em>Reynoso v Kensington Mgt. Servs., </em>181 AD2d 415, 415 [1st Dept 1992] [same]; <em>Felder v Old Falls Sanitation Co., </em>47 AD2d 977 [3d Dept 1975], <em>affd </em>39 NY2d 855 [1976] [employer in joint venture context]; <em>Fallone v Misericordia Hosp., </em>23 AD2d 222 [1st Dept 1965], <em>affd 17 </em>NY2d 648 [1966] [same]) or coemployee <em>(see e.g. Hanford v Plaza Packaging Corp., </em>2 NY3d 348, 350 [2004]; <em>Macchirole v Giamboi, </em>97 NY2d 147 [2001]; <em>Sojka v Romeo, </em>293 AD2d 522 [2d Dept 2002]).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Essential to all of these decisions is a working relationship with the injured plaintiff sufficient in kind and degree so that the third party, or the third party\u2019s employer, may be deemed plaintiffs employer. In <em>Thompson, </em>for example, we reaffirmed the principle that an employee \u201cof one employer may also be in the special employ of another\u201d when certain factors exist (78 NY2d at 557). A special employee is \u201cone who is transferred for a limited time of whatever duration to the service of another,\u201d and limited liability inures to the benefit of both the general and special employer <em>(id.; see also Schramm v Cold Spring Harbor Lab., 17 </em>AD3d 661, 662 [2d Dept 2005]). Although no one factor is determinative, a \u201csignificant\u201d and \u201cweighty feature\u201d in deciding whether a special employment relationship exists is \u201cwho controls and directs the manner, details and ultimate result of the employee\u2019s work\u201d\u2014in other words, who determines \u201call essential, locational and commonly recognizable components of the [employee\u2019s] work relationship\u201d (78 NY2d at 558; <em>see also Ugijanin, </em>43 AD3d at 913 [discussing \u201c(p)rincipal factors in determining the existence of a special employment relationship,\u201d including control, direction and supervision, payment of wages and furnishing of equipment, hiring and discharging, among others]). Thus, we have always looked to the underlying facts of the parties\u2019 relationship, and the same considerations govern a section 11 claim to immunity in other contexts, regardless of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Similarly, in <em>Macchirole, </em>we reiterated the basic principles for assessing an immunity defense under section 29 (6). \u201cParties are coemployees in \u2018all matters arising from and connected with their employment\u2019 \u201d (97 NY2d at 150, quoting <em>Heritage v Van Patten, </em>59 NY2d 1017, 1019 [1983]). Among other limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>not relevant here, the parties must have been \u201cacting within the scope of their employment, as coemployees, at the time of injury\u201d (id.; <em>see also Hanford, </em>2 NY3d at 350).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Thus, it is not the title of the purported \u201cemployer\u201d\u2014in this case, a putative managing agent\u2014that controls, but rather the actual working relationship between that party and the purported \u201cemployee.\u201d Here, JAMC argues agency but stops conspicuously short of explaining its working relationship with Fung or his employer. The title alone, however, does not suffice <em>(see Thompson, </em>78 NY2d at 557; <em>Bynog v Cipriani Group, </em>1 NY3d 193, 200 [2003]; <em>Macchirole, </em>97 NY2d at 150; <em>see also Smith v Delta Intl. Mach. Corp., </em>2007 WL 1540958, *5, 2007 US Dist LEXIS 38373, *16 [ED NY 2007] [\u201cregardless of the (managing agency) title, the entity must demonstrate that it controlled and directed the manner, details and ultimate result of the employee\u2019s work\u201d]; <em>Dashnau v Coulston Found., </em>1997 WL 305255, *3, 1997 US Dist LEXIS 7602, *8 [SD NY 1997] [noting that managing agency status \u201cbegs the question of the actual \u2018degree of control exercised over the employee\u2019 and, more importantly, whether the (agent) enjoyed \u2018exclusive daily control over the direction and manner\u2019 of (the employee\u2019s) work\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">If, on the other hand, JAMC argues by implication, as it appears to do, that it had a working relationship with Fung or the Port Authority sufficient to be deemed his special employer, no record evidence exists to support that conclusion. Instead, the record reflects that the Port Authority directed, supervised and controlled all aspects of Fung\u2019s employment as an electrician. As plaintiffs argued, \u201cthere has been no evidence that [JAMC] had any contact with plaintiff at all.\u201d Moreover, JAMC does not seriously argue that it is Fung\u2019s coemployee <em>(see </em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 [6]). We thus conclude, as did Supreme Court, that the Port Authority and JAMC are separate legal entities with separate day-to-day control over their respective employees\u2019 work. Accordingly, neither section 11 nor section 29 (6) serves to bar plaintiffs\u2019 action against JAMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">B. Action No. 2: Fung v Aero Snow Removal Corp.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">In their direct action against Aero, plaintiffs concede that the JAMC/Aero contract to provide snow removal services does not, standing alone, trigger a duty of care running to them. They argue, nevertheless, that Aero\u2019s failure to salt or sand the area of snow it plowed left open the possibility that the mounds of snow may have melted and refrozen, or that its plowing left a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>thin sheet of snow, thus creating or exacerbating a dangerous condition. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">We have recognized three exceptions to the general rule that a \u201cbreach of a contractual obligation will not be sufficient in and of itself to impose tort liability to noncontracting third parties upon the promisor\u201d <em>(Church v Callanan Indus., </em>99 NY2d 104, 111 [2002]). While plaintiffs urge the exception based on negligent performance of a service required under a contract, we have previously rejected a similar argument in <em>Espinal v Melville Snow Contrs. </em>(98 NY2d 136 [2002]). As we noted in <em>Espinal, </em>by merely plowing the snow, as required by the contract, defendant\u2019s actions could not be said \u201cto have created or exacerbated a dangerous condition\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 142). Here, as in <em>Espinal, </em>plaintiffs point to no term of the JAMC/Aero contract that required Aero to salt or sand the parking lot absent JAMC\u2019s request to do so, nor to record evidence that such a request was made. Therefore, because Aero owed no duty of care to Fung, plaintiffs\u2019 claim against Aero must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Accordingly, the Appellate Division order should be modified, with costs to plaintiffs against Japan Airlines Management Corp., by remitting to the Second Department for consideration of issues raised but not determined on the appeal to that court that pertain to plaintiffs and Japan Airlines Management Corp. and, as so modified, affirmed, with costs to Aero Snow Removal Corp. against plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Smith and Pigott concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Order modified, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b451-10\"> In dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 claims against JAMC in Action No. 1, the Appellate Division neither considered on the merits, nor expressly dismissed, JAMC\u2019s fourth-party contractual indemnification claims against the Port Authority. Accordingly, on remittal the Appellate Division must consider JAMC\u2019s action against the Port Authority in light of our holding. Although in its purported severance the Appellate Division order suggests that actions against defendants other than the Port Authority remained pending, the actions against all other defendants originally named in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint had been dismissed in earlier proceedings at Supreme Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
