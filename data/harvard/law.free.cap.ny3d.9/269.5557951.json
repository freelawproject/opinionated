The Appellate Division erred in upholding the Zoning Board of Appeals of the City of Long Beach\u2019s (ZBA) legally erroneous and arbitrary determination that the 1992 stipulation extending the time limits in the existing variance required formal ratification by the ZBA after notice and a hearing. <em>(Matter of New York Life Ins.

II. The Appellate Division erred by applying a deferential standard of judicial review of the Zoning Board of Appeals of the City of Long Beach\u2019s pure errors of law. <em>(Matter of Faith For Today v Murdock, </em>11 AD2d 718, 9 NY2d 761; <em>Matter of St. Onge v Donovan, </em>71 NY2d 507; <em>Cornell Univ. v Bagnardi, </em>68 NY2d 583; <em>Matter of Jayne Estates v Raynor, </em>22 NY2d 417; <em>Matter of Diocese of Rochester v Planning Bd. of Town of Brighton, </em>1 NY2d 508; <em>Matter of Clark v Board of Zoning Appeals of Town of Hempstead, </em>301 NY 86; <em>Matter of Madison-Oneida Bd. of Coop.

Because no formal ratification hearing was required to extend the time to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>satisfy the conditions of the variance, the stipulation is binding on the Zoning Board of Appeals of the City of Long Beach. <em>(Matter of New York Life Ins.

A second board meeting and vote are not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Sinclair Haberman sought a variance from the City of Long Beach Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) to build a four-tower residential condominium complex. The ZBA granted the variance, but after one of the towers was built a dispute arose about the other three. Haberman brought a lawsuit against the City, the ZBA and the City\u2019s building commissioner, which was settled by a stipulation in 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">Paragraph 4 of the stipulation said that Haberman would apply for new variances to permit construction of the remaining three buildings. These variances were to be subject to certain conditions, including time limits in which Haberman must apply for building permits: within five years of the grant of the variance for building 2, 6V2 years for building 3 and seven years for building 4. In paragraph 5 of the stipulation, Haberman agreed to pay $200,000 to the City to fund public improvements for the benefit of his project, including the installation of underground utility lines; and the City agreed to begin construction of the improvements not later than two years after receiving the $200,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">Haberman did apply for the new variances, and the ZBA granted them on August 4, 1989. Haberman paid the $200,000 to the City in December 1989, so that, under paragraph 5 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>stipulation, the City was required to install the underground utility lines not later than December 1991. That deadline was not met, and the City asked Haberman for an extension of time. Haberman agreed to grant it, on condition that the paragraph 4 time limits, governing his time to apply for building permits, were also extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">These terms were reflected in a letter dated April 7, 1992 from Haberman to the City\u2019s Corporation Counsel, who represented all the defendants\u2014including the ZBA\u2014in Haber-man\u2019s lawsuit. The letter said, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\">\u201cThe undersigned Plaintiff-Petitioner in the above entitled action does hereby agree to extend the time of The City of Long Beach (\u2018The City\u2019), to comply with paragraph \u20185\u2019 of the Stipulation of Settlement of the above entitled action, dated March 8, 1989 (\u2018Stipulation\u2019), without time limitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">\u201cIn consideration for this extension, it is agreed by the parties that the time limitations contained and set forth in paragraph \u20184\u2019 of the Stipulation shall be tolled and shall not run against the Plaintiff-Petitioner until such time as The City has complied with the terms of paragraph \u20185\u2019 of the Stipulation. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-8\">\u201cPlease indicate all of the defendants\u2019 consent to the foregoing by signing and returning the enclosed copy of this letter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">The Corporation Counsel signed an acknowledgment that he \u201cconsented and agreed to\u201d the April 1992 letter as attorney for all of the defendants, including the ZBA. The letter agreement was then attached to a new stipulation, providing that the 1989 stipulation \u201cbe, and hereby is, modified in accordance with the letter dated April 7th, 1992.\u201d The new stipulation was signed by counsel for all parties and \u201cso ordered\u201d by Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">For the next decade, it seems, nothing of significance happened. The City did not install the underground utility lines, and Haberman did not apply for a building permit. Finally, in 2002, Haberman\u2019s construction company applied for a permit to begin work on building 2, and in 2003 the City\u2019s Building Department issued the permit. The cooperative corporation that had acquired building 1 back in the 1980s opposed the new construction, and asked the ZBA to revoke the permit; the ZBA did so, relying on Haberman\u2019s failure to meet the schedule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>contained in the 1989 stipulation. The ZBA rejected the argument that Haberman\u2019s time had been extended by the April 1992 letter agreement, saying that \u201c[s]uch a major change . . . required a ratification by the ZBA after a public hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Haberman brought this litigation to annul the ZBA\u2019s revocation and reinstate his building permit. Supreme Court annulled the ZBA\u2019s action, but the Appellate Division reversed, holding that the ZBA \u201chad a rational basis for finding that the stipulation purporting to extend the prior variance was unenforceable\u201d (35 AD3d 465, 467 [2006]). We granted leave to appeal, and now reverse the Appellate Division\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The only question before us is whether the ZBA is bound by the Corporation Counsel\u2019s agreement, as its attorney, to the April 1992 letter extending Haberman\u2019s time to apply for building permits. Ordinarily, of course, parties to litigation are bound by their lawyers\u2019 agreements on their behalf <em>(see Hallock v State of New York, </em>64 NY2d 224 [1984]), but the ZBA claims this rule does not apply here, because Haberman\u2019s time could be extended only by a vote of the ZBA itself. We reject the ZBA\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">It is true that, as Haberman concedes, the grant of a variance requires ZBA action <em>(see Matter of Commco, Inc. v Amelkin, </em>62 NY2d 260 [1984]; <em>Carbone v Town of Bedford, </em>144 AD2d 420 [2d Dept 1988]). That is, presumably, why the parties\u2019 original stipulation, in 1989, provided for the issuance of new variances by the ZBA. We have held, however, that once a variance has been issued, the same formality is not required to extend the variance\u2019s duration: \u201cIt is not required that ... an application [for an extension] be treated as a new application for which public notice and a hearing are mandatory\u201d <em>(Matter of New York Life Ins. Co. v Galvin, </em>35 NY2d 52, 59 [1974]). The ZBA concedes that, under <em>Galvin, </em>a new notice and hearing were not necessary, but says that an extension should still require a ZBA vote. It cites no authority for this rule, and we see no good reason to adopt it.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">The agreement to extend Haberman\u2019s time was entered into in writing, after negotiations between counsel, and was approved by the court. It was a benefit given to Haberman in exchange for a benefit received by the City\u2014an extension of the City\u2019s time to install underground utility lines. It is admitted that the Corporation Counsel was the ZBA\u2019s attorney in the lit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>igation Haberman brought. The ZBA does not claim that, in signing the April 1992 letter agreement and the stipulation adopting it, its lawyer was violating the ZBA\u2019s instructions, or concealing his actions from his client\u2014and clearly no such problem, if it existed, was known to Haberman. In other words, the Corporation Counsel had at least apparent, if not actual, authority to act on the ZBA\u2019s behalf. It would be unfair to hold, many years after the event, that the lawyer\u2019s agreement was a nullity because the parties did not follow a procedure that no statute and no precedent required.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division, insofar as appealed from, should be reversed, with costs, and the matter remitted to the Appellate Division for consideration of issues raised but not determined on the appeal to that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Order, insofar as appealed from, reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
