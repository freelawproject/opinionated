His associate Michael O\u2019Carroll called 911. Within minutes, two police officers arrived on the scene, and immediately went to Millares, who was lying, half on the street, half on the sidewalk, between two parked cars. There was a small crowd of onlookers. Officer Doyle bent down to observe the victim more closely. He was bleeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>and. grimacing with pain. As soon as Officer Doyle had summoned an ambulance, he spoke with Millares, who replied in a low voice. The officer asked for, and Millares gave, his name, address and phone number. The officer then asked Millares what had happened. Millares responded that he had argued with a man named Bori, who had shot him three times, and he told the officer Bori\u2019s address. Officer Riordan, meanwhile, searched the location for shell casings, finding four discharged casings from a .380 caliber pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">O\u2019Carroll had witnessed the shooting and, after Millares died of his injuries, he informed the police that he had seen defendant Juan Nieves-Andino, who was known as Bori, shoot Mill-ares. O\u2019Carroll knew defendant, who had sold drugs for Mill-ares; in 1999, defendant apparently ventured out on his own, and the two men quarreled.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">After being apprehended in Puerto Rico and returned to New York, defendant was charged with second-degree murder and other crimes. He moved in limine for an order excluding, as hearsay, Millares\u2019s statement that he had been shot by a man named Bori. Citing <em>Crawford v Washington </em>(541 US 36 [2004]), defendant argued that admission of the statement would violate his Sixth Amendment right to confront a witness against him. The People responded that the statement was admissible as an excited utterance and that its admission would not violate the Sixth Amendment. Supreme Court agreed with the People.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">At trial, Officer Doyle testified that Millares told him he had been shot by a man named Bori, and that Millares had told him where Bori lived. O\u2019Carroll testified that he saw defendant approach Millares, pull a .380 caliber pistol from the pouch of his \u201choodie,\u201d and fire four or five shots at Millares, before running away. In addition, autopsy evidence indicated that the cause of death was complications from a gunshot wound. The jury convicted defendant of second-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">The Appellate Division agreed with Supreme Court that defendant\u2019s right of confrontation was not violated by the admission of Millares\u2019s response to the officer\u2019s questioning. A Judge of this Court granted leave to appeal, and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">Our decision is guided by <em>Crawford v Washington </em>(541 US 36 [2004]) and <em>Davis v Washington </em>(547 US 813 [2006]). In those cases, the Supreme Court held that the Federal Confrontation Clause prohibits the \u201cadmission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless [the witness] was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>prior opportunity for cross-examination\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 821). Only statements that are testimonial make the absent declarant a \u201cwitness\u201d within the meaning of the Confrontation Clause <em>(see id.). </em>In <em>Davis, </em>the Supreme Court explained that statements made in response to police inquiries are <em>not </em>testimonial when the circumstances \u201cobjectively indicat[e] that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 822).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">Last year, in <em>People v Bradley </em>(8 NY3d 124 [2006]), we had occasion to apply the \u201cprimary purpose of the interrogation\u201d analysis set forth in <em>Davis </em>to a statement, made by a woman to a police officer, that her boyfriend had assaulted her. The officer testified that, following a 911 call, he arrived at the door of an apartment to find the shaken woman who was bleeding profusely and walking with a limp. He asked her what had happened and she said her boyfriend had thrown her through a glass door. The officer then found the defendant in the apartment and observed a broken glass door. We held that \u201cdefendant\u2019s right of confrontation was not violated by the admission into evidence of a statement made in response to a question from a police officer, where the officer\u2019s evident reason for asking the question was to deal with an emergency\u201d (8 NY3d at 125). Because the victim\u2019s \u201cstatement was made when the officer could reasonably have assumed, and apparently did assume, that he had an emergency to deal with\u201d (8 NY3d at 128), it was not testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Defendant argues that when the assailant, having left the crime scene, no longer poses a physical threat to the victim, the primary purpose of a police officer\u2019s questioning of the victim cannot be to meet an ongoing emergency. We do not believe that <em>Davis </em>imposed such a restricted interpretation of what constitutes a continuing emergency. Whether an officer\u2019s primary reason for making an inquiry was to deal with an emergency is a fact-based question that must necessarily be answered on a case-by-case basis. Even when the assailant has fled, the circumstances of the police officer\u2019s questioning of the victim may objectively indicate that the officer reasonably assumed an ongoing emergency and acted with the primary purpose of preventing further harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Officer Doyle arrived at the scene of a recent shooting and, as soon as he had summoned medical help, asked the victim what had happened. Given the speed and sequence of events, the offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>cer could not have been certain that the assailant posed no further danger to Millares or to the onlookers. His brief solicitation of pedigree information and information about the attacker\u2019s identity was part of Officer Doyle\u2019s reasonable efforts to assess what had happened to cause Millares\u2019s injuries and whether there was any continuing danger to the others in the vicinity. In other words, the primary purpose of his inquiry was to find out the nature of the attack, \u201cso that he could decide what, if any, action was necessary to prevent further harm\u201d (Bradley, 8 NY3d at 127). \u201c[T]he nature of what was asked and answered . . . viewed objectively, was such that the elicited statements were necessary to be able to <em>resolve </em>the present emergency, rather than simply to learn . . . what had happened in the past\u201d <em>(Davis, </em>547 US at 827). In short, Officer Doyle, like the officer in <em>Bradley, </em>reasonably assumed that there was an ongoing emergency. It follows that Millares\u2019s responses to Officer Doyle\u2019s inquiries were nontestimonial <em>(see Bradley, 8 </em>NY3d at 128) and that their admission did not implicate defendant\u2019s right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s urging, Officer Doyle\u2019s questioning of Millares is distinguishable from the interrogation in the companion case to <em>Davis, Hammon v Indiana, </em>in which the Supreme Court held that the victim\u2019s statement was testimonial. In <em>Hammon, </em>the officers questioned a husband and wife in separate rooms following a report of domestic disturbance, and the wife filled out a battery affidavit <em>(see Davis, </em>547 US at 820). The husband remained under the control of the police during the wife\u2019s questioning in <em>Hammon, </em>so that the police knew that the emergency had ended when they began their inquiries. By contrast, Officer Doyle had no knowledge of the assailant\u2019s whereabouts when he began questioning Millares.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Our holding today is also consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s dictum in <em>Davis </em>that statements made by a victim of domestic violence to a 911 operator might be testimonial if they were made after the victim told the operator that the assailant had fled <em>(see Davis, </em>547 US at 828-829). When a 911 operator or a police officer justifiably believes that the assailant no longer poses a threat to the victim, the purpose of his or her interrogation of the victim may \u201cevolve\u201d from dealing with an ongoing emergency to establishing past events with a view to later criminal prosecution <em>(see Davis, </em>547 US at 828). On this record, however, the initial purpose of Officer Doyle\u2019s inquiry did not change.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b111-4\">Jones, J. (concurring).</author>\n<p id=\"AA\">I agree with the majority that the Appellate Division\u2019s order upholding defendant\u2019s conviction should be affirmed, and that Millares\u2019s statements regarding his pedigree information were nontestimonial. I write separately, however, because the circumstances objectively indicate that Millares\u2019s statements concerning defendant\u2019s identity, address and past conduct were not elicited by an interrogation designed to assist Officers Doyle and Riordan in meeting an ongoing emergency. To the contrary, they indicate that the primary purpose of the interrogation was to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to a later criminal prosecution. Accordingly, these statements were testimonial under <em>Crawford v Washington </em>(541 US 36 [2004]) and <em>Davis v Washington </em>(547 US 813 [2006]), and defendant\u2019s right of confrontation was violated when the trial court admitted these statements. Nevertheless, I conclude that this error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Officers Doyle and Riordan both testified that on November 28, 2000, at about 4:14 a.m., they received a distress call over their radio stating that a man had been shot at 176th Street and Clay Avenue in the Bronx. Upon arriving at that location, both police officers exited their vehicle. Officer Doyle testified that he \u201cwent over to the victim, who was laying down.\u201d Officer Riordan provided more detail as to what he and Officer Doyle did as they exited their vehicle. At trial, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\">\u201c[people]: What, if anything, did you observe your partner do after you parked your car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-8\">\u201c[officer riordan]: Both my partner and myself walked over towards the crowd and I looked down and I saw a male laying down on the sidewalk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-9\">\u201c[people]: What did your partner do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-10\">\u201c[officer riordan]: My partner kneeled down next to the person laying down ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-11\">\u201c[people]: What did you notice about the person, what else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>\u201c[officer riordan]: He was moaning loudly. I believe I heard people in the crowd, one or two saying, you know, that he was shot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-5\">\u201c[people]: Okay. And what, if anything, did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">\u201c[officer riordan]: Well, upon hearing that[,] I immediately turned around and turned my flashlight on and started looking on the ground around the general area for any shell casings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Officer Riordan also testified that he left Officer Doyle with Millares.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Before speaking to Millares, Officer Doyle had an opportunity to observe that Millares was conscious, bleeding and grimacing in pain. Officer Doyle, who was trained to administer CPR, determined that he could not render any medical assistance to Millares. At trial, he was asked why he could not render medical assistance, to which he responded: \u201cFor the seriousness of his injury, I\u2019m not trained to give assistance. I could make things worse.\u201d Instead, Officer Doyle \u201ccalled for an ambulance to respond to [a] man shot.\u201d After calling the ambulance, Officer Doyle, who testified that he \u201cwanted to get some information from [Millares],\u201d bent down on one knee and began to question Millares. Officer Doyle asked Millares for pedigree information (his name, age, address and phone number) and then asked what happened. According to Officer Doyle\u2019s testimony, Millares said he had an argument with defendant (whom he identified by his nickname \u201cBori\u201d) and \u201cBori shot him three times.\u201d Mill-ares also gave Officer Doyle specific information about where defendant resided. The following testimony was elicited at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-9\">\u201c[people]: Did the victim ever tell you where this person Bori lived?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-10\">\u201c[officer doyle]: I don\u2019t recall. I can\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3\">\u201c[people]: Would something refresh your memory?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak\">\u201c[officer doyle]: Yes, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-11\">\u201c[people]: I ask the witness be shown this piece of paper. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-12\">\u201c[people]: Does that refresh your recollection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-13\">\u201c[OFFICER DOYLE]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-14\">\u201c[people]: And did the victim, Jose Millares, indicate to you where this person Bori lived?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>\u201c[OFFICER DOYLE]: YeS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-5\">\u201c[people]: Where was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-6\">\u201c[officer doyle]: 1818 Clay Avenue, Apartment 1A.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">After the ambulance came and went, Officer Doyle put up crime scene tape and cordoned off the area. When the detectives arrived on the scene, he gave them the information he had received from Millares.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">The question before this Court is whether, objectively considered, Officer Doyle\u2019s questioning of Millares produced testimonial statements. As explained by the Supreme Court in <em>Davis, </em>\u201c[statements] are testimonial when the circumstances <em>objectively </em>indicate that there is no . . . ongoing <em>emergency, and </em>that the <em>primary purpose </em>of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution\u201d (547 US at 822 [emphasis added]). Here, it is clear from the facts and circumstances that Officer Doyle\u2019s interrogation of Millares was part of an investigation into past criminal conduct. One need only consider the actions of Officers Doyle and Riordan upon arriving on the scene to determine that they were not faced with an ongoing emergency or a concern of a future attack by the assailant (nor was there any indication that the assailant was still on the scene).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">Right after Officers Doyle and Riordan came upon the crime scene, Officer Riordan immediately began to look for and recover evidence. Officer Doyle, on the other hand, initially sought to ensure Millares\u2019s safety. Although Officer Doyle could not render medical assistance to Millares, he called an ambulance. However, as soon as he made that call, he could do nothing further for Millares except find out Millares\u2019s pedigree information, which could assist the ambulance workers, and stay with him until the ambulance arrived. At this point, although Mill-ares was in extremis, Officer Doyle\u2019s focus properly shifted from managing an emergency to investigating a past crime and gathering key information such as where defendant resided. Put differently, because it was objectively apparent that the emergency (i.e., the threat from the assailant) had passed, when Officer Doyle asked \u201cwhat happened,\u201d he was not trying to determine \u201cwhat is happening.\u201d Unlike the police officer in <em>People v Bradley </em>(8 NY3d 124 [2006]), Officer Doyle asked \u201cwhat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>happened\u201d not as a means of finding out what caused Millares\u2019s injuries or determining what action needed to be taken in order to prevent further harm to Millares. Officer Doyle already had the answers to those questions before he spoke to Millares.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Thus, Officer Doyle\u2019s interrogation of Millares regarding the crime committed against him, although completely appropriate and necessary, elicited testimonial statements\u2014i.e., statements one would expect a witness to make at trial\u2014which are subject to the constraints of the Confrontation Clause. As stated by the <em>Davis </em>Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-6\">\u201cPolice investigations themselves are, of course, in no way impugned by our characterization of their fruits as testimonial. Investigations of past crimes prevent future harms and lead to necessary arrests. While prosecutors may hope that inculpatory \u2018non-testimonial\u2019 evidence is gathered, this is essentially beyond police control. Their saying that an emergency exists cannot make it be so. The Confrontation Clause in no way governs police conduct, because it is the trial <em>use </em>of, not the investigatory <em>collection </em>of, <em>ex parte </em>testimonial statements which offends that provision. But neither can police conduct govern the Confrontation Clause; testimonial statements are what they are\u201d (547 US at 832 n 6).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">Recognizing that police officers at a crime scene may shift their focus from addressing an emergency to conducting an investigation, <em>Davis </em>and <em>Bradley </em>contemplate that police interrogations can yield nontestimonial and/or testimonial statements based on the circumstances of the particular case.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Here, the majority\u2019s view\u2014that all of the statements made by Mill-ares to Officer Doyle were nontestimonial\u2014fails to follow the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Davis </em>that what \u201cthe circumstances objectively indicate\u201d about the purpose of a particular interrogation is controlling. The circumstances in this case do not objectively indicate that the primary purpose of the interrogation was at all times to assist the police in dealing with an ongoing emergency. In fact, the very existence of an ongoing emergency is belied by the trial testimony of Officers Doyle and Riordan, as well as their collective conduct at the crime scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">Violations of a criminal defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation are subject to a constitutional harmless error analysis <em>(see People v Eastman, </em>85 NY2d 265, 276 [1995]). Unless the People show that the error is \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d such error requires reversal of the conviction and a new trial <em>(Eastman, </em>85 NY2d at 276). \u201cSuch errors are considered harmless when, in light of the totality of the evidence, there is no reasonable possibility that the error affected the jury\u2019s verdict\u201d <em>(People v Douglas, </em>4 NY3d 777, 779 [2005], citing <em>People v Crimmins, </em>36 NY2d 230, 240-241 [1975]). In deciding whether the People have met their burden for establishing harmlessness, a reviewing court must \u201cconsider both the overall strength of the case against defendant and the importance [of the improperly admitted evidence to that case]\u201d <em>(People v Goldstein, </em>6 NY3d 119, 129 [2005]).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Here, although it was error to admit Millares\u2019s statements concerning defendant\u2019s identity, address and past conduct, there was no reasonable possibility that the error contributed to defendant\u2019s conviction. O\u2019Carroll\u2019s testimony at trial described the shooting in great detail. Further, much of O\u2019Carroll\u2019s testimony was corroborated by other evidence presented at trial. For example, O\u2019Carroll testified that defendant, a man he knew very well, drew a .380 caliber automatic pistol from his \u201choodie\u201d pocket and fired three shots at Millares. According to O\u2019Carroll, Millares fell wounded, but defendant kept firing until the weapon jammed. O\u2019Carroll\u2019s description of how defendant \u201cunjammed\u201d the pistol was corroborated by the People\u2019s ballistic expert at trial. O\u2019Carroll also detailed how defendant stood \u201cMight on top of [Millares]\u201d and twice fired his gun again after the wounded victim had fallen to the ground and crawled a few feet. One of the two bullets fired by defendant ricocheted off the floor of nearby truck and also hit Millares. O\u2019Carroll\u2019s testimony on this point was corroborated by the medical examiner who testified that the three bullet wounds sustained by the victim were consistent with a gunman standing over a prostrate victim and pointing the gun down at him. O\u2019Carroll also testified that after the shooting, he saw Millares bleeding from the back. According to the medical examiner, Millares was shot in the back.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">In light of O\u2019Carroll\u2019s testimony and the corroborating evidence presented at trial, there was no reasonable possibility that the trial court\u2019s erroneous admission of the above-mentioned statements influenced the jury\u2019s verdict. Thus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>People have met their burden for establishing that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Graffeo and Read concur with Judge Pigott; Judge Jones concurs in result in a separate opinion in which Judges Ciparick and Smith concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b114-9\"> Accordingly, defendant\u2019s unduly restrictive view of what constitutes an ongoing emergency (see majority op at 15) is unavailing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
