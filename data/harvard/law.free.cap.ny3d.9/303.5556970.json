There is a distinction between land use control imposed by police power and private agreement. <em>(Matter of Friends of Shawangunks v Knowlton, </em>64 NY2d 387.) II. The 1963 resolution of subdivision approval was an exercise of police power under Town Law \u00a7 276. <em>(Asian Am. for Equality v Koch, </em>129 Misc 2d 67, 128 AD2d 99, 72 NY2d 121; <em>Matter of Kamhi v Planning Bd. of Town of Yorktown, </em>59 NY2d 385; <em>Matter of Golden v Planning Bd. of Town of Ramapo, </em>30 NY2d 359; <em>Matter of Brous v Smith, </em>304 NY 164; <em>Delaware Midland Corp. v Incorporated Vil. of Westhampton Beach, </em>79 Misc 2d 438, 48 AD2d 681, 39 NY2d 1029.)

IV The \u201copen space\u201d notation on the filed map provides an additional level of notice. <em>(Eltman v Harvey, </em>93 Misc 2d 634.) V The subdivision condition creating parcels B and E as a buffer applies to the land and is enforceable under the provisions of Town Law \u00a7 268 irrespective of ownership. <em>(Matter of Weinrib v Weisler, </em>33 AD2d 923; <em>FGL &amp; L Prop.

VI. The subdivision condition is stated plainly and unambiguously. <em>(Holmes v Planning Bd. of Town of New Castle, </em>78 AD2d 1.) VII. The Town of Wappinger is not estopped from exercising its police power under Town Law \u00a7 268 (2). <em>(Matter of Parkview Assoc. v City of New York, </em>71 NY2d 274; <em>Town of Putnam Val. v Sacramone, </em>16 AD3d 669.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b399-5\"><em>Bleakley Platt &amp; Schmidt, LLP, </em>White Plains <em>(James W.

The Town of Wappinger\u2019s enforcement <em>of </em>the Planning Board\u2019s open space restriction is void as an ultra vires act because it exceeded its police power by enforcing the restriction without complying with the \u201copen space\u201d provision of General Municipal Law \u00a7 247. <em>(Matter of Long v Adirondack Park Agency, </em>76 NY2d 416; <em>Ryder v City of New York, </em>32 AD3d 836; <em>Matter of DeTroia v Schweitzer, </em>87 NY2d 338; <em>Cole v Mandell Food Stores, </em>93 NY2d 34; <em>Matter of Raritan Dev.

The open space restriction is not a \u201czoning regulation\u201d <em>of </em>the Town Board, as the Second Circuit inaccurately referred to it. Thus, the O\u2019Maras are not presumed to have constructive knowledge of the restriction. <em>(Matter of Real Holding Corp. v Lehigh, </em>2 NY3d 297; <em>Matter of Society of N.Y. Hosp. v Del Vecchio, </em>70 NY2d 634; <em>North Bay Assoc. v Hope, </em>116 AD2d 704; <em>Envirogas, Inc. v Town of Westfield, </em>82 AD2d 117; <em>B &amp; J Invs. Corp. v Town Bd. of Town of Clinton, </em>56 AD2d 882; <em>Matter of Weisman v Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Vil. of Kensington, </em>260 AD2d 487; <em>Matter of Marx v Planning Bd. of Vil. of Mill Neck, </em>185 AD2d 348; <em>Bringslimark v Town of Clarkstown, </em>128 AD2d 663.) III. The unrecorded open space restriction is not in the O\u2019Maras\u2019 chain of title and, thus, is not enforceable against them under Real Property Law \u00a7 291 and General Municipal Law \u00a7 247. <em>(Matter of Ioannou v Southold Town Planning Bd., </em>304 AD2d 578; <em>Witter v Taggart, </em>78 NY2d 234; <em>Eltman v Harvey, </em>93 Misc 2d 634; <em>Goldstein v Gold, </em>66 NY2d 624; <em>Ebling Brewing v Gennaro, </em>189 App Div 782; <em>Covey v Niagara, Lockport &amp; Ontario Power Co., </em>286 App Div 341; <em>Pallone v New York Tel.

A planning board may impose an open space restriction as a condition of approval of a subdivision. <em>(Matter of International Innovative Tech.

Upon filing with the County Clerk, the contents of a subdivision plat are binding and enforceable as against all purchasers of the lots, blocks, parcels or sites created thereby. <em>(Matter of Koncelik v Planning Bd. of Town of E.

The Planning Board tentatively approved a preliminary layout of the project and conditioned approval, in part, on the creation of a permanent open space on a preliminary plat.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At a January 23, 1963 meeting, the Board approved the final plat (1963 Plat), which divided the property into seven parcels, including parcels B and E, which were designated the buffer area where open space would be located.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The words \u201cOpen Space\u201d were written on parcels B and E of the plat. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Board minutes for the January 23 meeting indicated that the plat was accepted subject to eight conditions, among them that no building permits would be issued for parcels B and E, as indicated on the 1963 Plat. The 1963 Plat and Board minutes were filed with the Town. The 1963 Plat was also filed with the Dutchess County Clerk\u2019s Office. Wildwood Manor was ultimately constructed and continues to be occupied.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Parcels B and E remained undeveloped for nearly 40 years until the circumstances that prompted this litigation arose.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiff Absolute Property Management, a corporation owned by brothers Donald and Patrick O\u2019Mara, acquired parcels B and E. On October 18, 2000, Absolute purchased the parcels for $29,500 at an in rem tax sale with the intent to construct 10 single family houses on the property. It took title subject to any existing right-of-way, easement, any and all existing restrictions, conditions and covenants of record. Prior to closing, Patrick O\u2019Mara ordered a title report and obtained title insurance. Attached to the policy was Schedule B. Neither Schedule B nor the title policy made reference to an \u201cOpen Space\u201d restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">In 2002, the O\u2019Maras, taking steps towards building on the property, retained a licensed land surveyor (Gerald Lynn) who prepared a survey of parcels B and E. Lynn based the survey, in part, on an examination of the 1963 Plat. Lynn observed the \"Open Space\u201d notation on parcels B and E, but ignored it and never included the notation on the survey submitted to the Town Building Department.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The first house was to be built on parcel B and was to serve as a residence for Donald O\u2019Mara and his family. The Town issued a building permit, a temporary certificate of occupancy and approved both an interim survey for the lot on which the house was to be built and a site plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>In July 2003, Ronald. Lafko, the son of Fred Lafko (one of the original developers of the land), approached a town councilman to express his concern that the development violated the 1963 Plat. In November 2003, the newly-appointed Town Building Inspector issued a stop work order based on the open space restriction noted on Map 3107. Donald O\u2019Mara protested the issuance of the order and attempted to resolve the matter with the Town. The O\u2019Maras were not aware of the \u201copen space\u201d restrictions on parcels B and E until after the Town issued the order\u2014three years after they purchased the property. The Town permitted Donald O\u2019Mara to complete exterior work but did not vacate the stop work order. On December 2, 2003 an attorney for the Town made a written settlement proposal to the O\u2019Maras\u2019 counsel in which the Town offered to grant a certificate of occupancy for the house provided the rest of parcels B and E were dedicated to the Town. In response, the O\u2019Maras filed an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The O\u2019Maras\u2019 original complaint alleged claims under 42 USC \u00a7 1983 and under the Takings Clause of the Federal Constitution, the latter being dismissed on the eve of trial. The complaint was amended to add a claim for a judgment declaring that the O\u2019Maras owned parcels B and E free and clear of the open space restriction. Essentially, the O\u2019Maras argued that the open space restriction had to be recorded under Real Property Law \u00a7 291 to be enforceable against them. In further support of that argument, plaintiffs urged that the Town acquired an interest in the property pursuant to General Municipal Law \u00a7 247 and upon acquisition of the property by the Town, the recording requirement was triggered. The amended complaint also contained claims for fraud and negligent misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The District Court dismissed the fraud and negligence claims. As to the section 1983 claim, the court held that because the O\u2019Maras had a legitimate claim of entitlement to a certificate of occupancy and the Town\u2019s basis for withholding the certificate was illegal, the Town had violated the O\u2019Maras\u2019 constitutional right to substantive due process, thus entitling them to damages for the loss of use and occupancy of the house. Finally, the court held that the open space restriction was unenforceable against the O\u2019Maras, who were bona fide purchasers for value without notice. The court, citing Real Property Law \u00a7 291, determined that the restriction was not properly recorded within Dutchess County. Further, the court, relying on <em>Matter of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number><em>Ioannou v Southold Town Planning Bd. </em>(304 AD2d 578 [2d Dept 2003]), held that the failure to record any restriction on the use of property precludes enforcement of the restriction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Upon the Town\u2019s appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed in part by dismissing the section 1983 claim. Additionally, the court held that \u201c[w]hile . . . the process of approving and filing the 1963 Plat complied with both [Town Law \u00a7 276 and Real Property Law \u00a7 334], neither section addresses whether a subdivision plat is enforceable against subsequent purchasers\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 699). In light of the foregoing, and given the absence of controlling precedent from this Court, the Second Circuit certified the following question to this Court: \u201cIs an open space restriction imposed by a subdivision plat under New York Town Law \u00a7 276 enforceable against a subsequent purchaser, and under what circumstances?\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Under the circumstances of this case, we answer the certified question in the affirmative. An open space restriction placed on a final plat pursuant to Town Law \u00a7 276, when filed in the Office of the County Clerk pursuant to Real Property Law \u00a7 334, is enforceable against a subsequent purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Real Property Law \u00a7 334, the law applicable to the filing of the 1963 Plat (and applicable today), provides that no real property subdivided into separate lots can be offered for sale to the public without the filing of a map in the Office of the County Clerk or Register of Deeds where the property is located. Additionally, no plat of a subdivision may be recorded (i.e., filed) with the County Clerk or Register until it is approved by a planning board and such approval is endorsed in writing on the plat in the manner designated by the planning board <em>(see </em>Town Law \u00a7 278 [now renumbered Town Law \u00a7 279 (1)]; \u00a7 276 [3]). Thus, the statutory scheme in effect in 1963 provided that (1) no subdivision could be approved except by the planning board, (2) no plat could be filed with the County Clerk unless it had the endorsement of the planning board and (3) the subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>plat had to be filed in the Office of the County Clerk within 90 days of its approval. Accordingly, no lot subdivided from a larger piece could be sold without planning board approval. By virtue of its filing requirement, this statutory scheme afforded notice to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Plaintiffs argue that the Board cannot enforce the open space restriction on their property unless the restriction is recorded under Real Property Law \u00a7 291, which requires that conveyances of real property be recorded.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> *8 In furtherance of this argument, plaintiffs posit that the Town, in reserving to itself the right to prevent anyone from building anything on these parcels, \u201cacquired\u201d an open space interest pursuant to General Municipal Law \u00a7 247 (2) and that this acquisition amounts to a \u201cconveyance\u201d of real property. Plaintiffs submit that because the prior owners (David Alexander and Fred Lafko) had been stripped of all rights to use parcels B and E, except the right to be taxed, the effect was that the property was acquired by the Town through its pervasive and restrictive control of the property. This Court disagrees and finds no evidence that the Town acquired parcels B and E by \u201cpurchase, gift, grant, bequest, devise, lease or otherwise\u201d (General Municipal Law \u00a7 247 [2]). Further, there is no evidence that there was a \u201cconveyance\u201d within the meaning of Real Property Law \u00a7 290 (3). Accordingly, Real Property Law \u00a7 291 is inapposite to the case at bar. Moreover, there is no statutory requirement to record a plat in the chain of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The system of filing subdivision plats exists throughout New York State. In the instant case, a search of the records filed in the Office of the Dutchess County Clerk would have disclosed the 1963 Plat. When Absolute acquired title at the tax sal\u00e9, a description of the property was limited to its tax grid number. The tax map only showed two boundaries for the lot conveyed. In order to determine the boundaries of its holdings, Absolute should have searched the County Clerk\u2019s property records until it found the subdivision plat that created its parcel. Had Absolute examined the plat, it would have discovered the open space restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">In conclusion, we note that towns are separately bestowed with the authority to regulate land use within their borders <em>(see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Town Law \u00a7 261). This grant of authority is broad and encompasses a town\u2019s ability to impose reasonable conditions in the course of approving a subdivision <em>(see </em>Town Law \u00a7 276; <em>see also Matter of Koncelik v Planning Bd. of Town of E. Hampton, </em>188 AD2d 469, 471 [2d Dept 1992]). The ability to impose such conditions on the use of land through the zoning process is meaningless without the ability to enforce those conditions, even against a subsequent purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Accordingly, under the circumstances of this case, the certified question should be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Smith and Pigott concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Following certification of a question by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and acceptance of the question by this Court pursuant to section 500.27 of the Rules of Practice of the Court of Appeals (22 NYCRR 500.27), and after hearing argument by counsel for the parties and consideration of the briefs and the record submitted, certified question answered under the circumstances of this case in the affirmative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-8\">. Generally, a plat is a map describing a piece of land and its features, such as boundaries, lots, roads, and easements <em>(see </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1188-1189 [8th ed 2004]). Under Town Law \u00a7 276 (4) (b), a \u201cpreliminary plat\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">\u201ca drawing prepared in a manner prescribed by local regulation showing the layout of a proposed subdivision including, but not restricted to, road and lot layout and approximate dimensions, key plan, topography and drainage, all proposed facilities unsized, including preliminary plans and profiles, at suitable scale and in such detail as local regulation may require.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b400-10\">.

Such final approval qualifies the plat for recording in the office of the county clerk or register in the county in which such plat is located.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b401-9\">. Notwithstanding the Board\u2019s restrictions, at some point, the Wappinger Tax Assessor increased the assessment on the property from $7,500 to $47,500 noting on his records, \u201cNo Reason For this very low value.
