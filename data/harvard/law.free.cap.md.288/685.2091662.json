(the employer or Holy Cross). We are concerned with the question of whether that sum comes within the purview of Maryland Code (1957, 1979 Repl. Vol.) Art. 95A, \u00a7 8 (d) (2) requiring a nonprofit organization electing pursuant to the statute in lieu of paying the regular tax \"to pay to the Executive Director for the unemployment insurance fund an amount equal to the amount of regular benefits and one half of the extended benefits paid, that is attributable to service in the employ of such nonprofit organization\u201d and thus whether Holy Cross is obliged to reimburse ESA for the sum erroneously so paid.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that since the sum paid here was attributable solely to error of the agency there is no liability on the part of the employer. Hence, we shall reverse the holding of the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Maryland Empl. Sec. </em>v. <em>Holy Cross Hosp., </em>43 Md. App. 406, 405 A.2d 766 (1979), and direct that it affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">Prior to the enactment of Chapter 790 of the Acts of 1971 nonprofit employers were not subject to the provisions of the unemployment insurance law. Art. 95A, \u00a7 8 (d) (2) as enacted by that chapter specified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\">Any nonprofit organization which, pursuant to \u00a7 20 (g) (7) of this article is or becomes subject to this article on or after January 1, 1972, shall pay contributions under the provisions of subsections (a), (b) and (c) hereof, unless it elects in accordance with this paragraph, to pay to the Executive Director for the unemployment insurance fund an amount equal to the amount of regular benefits and one half of the extended benefits paid, that is attributable to service in the employ of such nonprofit organization, to individuals for weeks of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>unemployment which begin during the effective period of that election.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Holy Cross made the election referred to in \u00a7 8 (d) (2). The controversy here involves its former employee who filed a claim in December 1974 for unemployment insurance benefits. Holy Cross claimed that the employee here was discharged \"for gross misconduct, specifically, taking a heavy object and lunging at his supervisor and chasing him down the hall with the intention, supposedly, of inflicting severe pain.\u201d Since Code (1957, 1969 Repl. Vol.) Art. 95A, \u00a7 6 (b) specifies that an employee guilty of gross misconduct shall be disqualified from receiving unemployment compensation until he earns ten times his weekly benefit amount, the employer contended that no benefit should be paid. ESA initially found him guilty of misconduct, not <em>gross </em>misconduct. This had the effect of disqualifying the employee from benefits for a period of nine weeks. The employer appealed. ESA\u2019s referee found what took place to be <em>gross </em>misconduct, thus effectively denying benefits to the employee. Nevertheless, ESA continued to make payments to the disqualified employee. The amount paid to him after that decision was $2,269.50. ESA now seeks reimbursement from the employer for the sum erroneously paid.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">When the employer was unsuccessful in convincing ESA that it had no liability for reimbursement for benefits paid as a result of agency error, it took the controversy to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. There Judge Cahoon in a well-reasoned and comprehensive opinion reversed the decision of the Board of Appeals of ESA.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">In the circuit court, the Court of Special Appeals and here the employer has pointed to the definition of \"benefits\u201d appearing in Art. 95A, \u00a7 20 (b) in support of its position that it has no liability for this overpayment. There the term is defined as \"money payments <em>payable </em>to an individual, <em>as provided in this article </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>employer.) Its argument is that the overpayment simply is not a benefit provided by Art. 95A. The Court of Special Appeals rejected this argument, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-4\">The lower court, in reaching its conclusion that a reimburser employer was not liable for benefits erroneously paid, relied heavily on the definition of \"benefits\u201d contained in \u00a7 20 (b), which is \"money payments payable to an individual, as provided in this article....\u201d The court reasoned that \"fi]f what was paid to the claimant was not payable under the Act, it was not a benefit paid.. .We consider this conclusion a dubious one in light of the language of \u00a7 8 (d), which deals specifically with reimburser employers and states, in pertinent part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">\"Benefits <em>paid </em>to employees of nonprofit organizations shall be financed in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-6\">It is therefore apparent that under \u00a7 8 (d) the critical reference is to benefits \"paid\u201d rather than benefits \"payable.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>43 Md. App. at 409.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">This argument of the employer has much to be said for it. However, we need not base our decision upon that specific point.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">We have found but five states in which appellate courts have considered an issue analogous to the case at bar, California, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, and Oregon. The relevant cases we have located are <em>Carleson v. Cal. Unemployment, </em>64 Cal. App. 3d 145, 134 Cal. Rptr. 278 (1976); <em>Unemp. Ins. Appeal Bd. </em>v. <em>Wilm. Medical Center, </em>373 A.2d 204 (Del. 1977); <em>Baptist Hospital, Inc. v. White, </em>313 So. 2d 106 (Fla. App. 1975), and the somewhat analogous case of <em>City of Stuart </em>v. <em>McMullian, </em>340 So. 2d 1209 (Fla. App. 1976), relying on <em>Baptist Hospital; Department of Employment </em>v. <em>St. Alphonsus Hospital, </em>98 Idaho 283, 561 P.2d 1316 (1977), and <em>Mann Home v. Morgan, </em>19 Or. App. 853, 529 P.2d 964 (1974). Only <em>Mann </em>can be said to give any support to the position espoused by ESA. In that case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>benefits had legitimately and legally been paid to certain employees who had left their employment voluntarily and without good cause. For this they were disqualified from receiving benefits for a specified period. The court said it \"infer[red] that the three employees in question had served out their respective periods of disqualification as provided in ORS 657.176, and had duly requalified themselves for benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>19 Or. App. at 855. A statute provided that \"[bjenefits paid to an individual for unemployment immediately after the expiration of a period of disqualification for having left work of an employer voluntarily without good cause shall not be charged to that employer.\u201d ORS 657.471 (3). At issue was whether this provision was applicable only to the experience rating of taxpaying employers or whether it was also applicable to reimbursing employers. The court pointed to the fact that adopting the construction urged by the employer \"would result in the payment of benefits from the Fund without a corresponding payment of taxes or reimbursement of the Fund by the employer with respect to these former employees,\u201d and said it \"w[ould] not give an interpretation to a statute which produces an inconsistent or unreasonable result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>19 Or. App. at 857. Prior to the court\u2019s decision in that case a change was made in the statute specifying that the provision was not applicable to reimbursing employers. Thus, the court also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-4\">On February 16, 1973, when the above amendment was before the House Committee on Labor and Industrial Relations, the committee minutes show that a spokesman for the Employment Division, which was the proponent of the amendment, appeared before the committee and testified as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">\"Federal law requires that reimbursing nonprofit employers reimburse the Fund for all of regular benefits and one-half of extended benefits applicable to wages paid by such nonprofit unit. While this fact is stated in present [ORS] 657.505(7)(a), a new section, Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>tion 4 of this 1973 Act, is being added to insure that all are aware that reimbursing employers cannot be relieved of benefit charges regardless of the circumstances involved.\u201d Minutes, House Committee on Labor and Industrial Relations, February 16, 1973. <em>[Id. </em>at 858.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-5\">In some situations, as in this case, the amendment may be a declaration of the meaning of the statute. <em>Layman v. State Unemp. Comp. Com., </em>167 Or. 379, 117 P.2d 974, 136 ALR 1468 (1941); <em>Kaiser Cement v. Tax Com., </em>[250 Or. 374, 443 P.2d 233 (1968)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-7\">From our examination of the legislative history of ORS 657.504, which expressly excludes reimbursing employers from the provisions of ORS 657.471, it is evident that the legislature was merely declaring existing law, and explicitly telling all nonprofit organizations that reimbursing employers are not relieved of benefit charges. <em>[Id. </em>at 858-59.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">In <em>Carleson </em>the cash amount involved was but $72.00. Obviously, the parties were litigating over principle. The California statute is very similar to ours. The court there pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-9\">In its decision ... the [State Unemployment Insurance] Board stated as follows: \"We adopt the referee\u2019s statement of facts and reasons for decision. We agree with his conclusion that amounts <em>erroneously </em>paid to the benefit claimant in <em>excess </em>of his potential maximum award are not 'benefits ... paid based on base period wages with respect to employment for the entity.\u2019 Such amounts are beyond the statutorily defined limit for which additional cost reimbursement can be charged under the provisions of Unemployment Insurance Code section 803(b) (1). [\u00b6] If the Legislature has left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>the Department without a fund against which it can charge these payments, the Department should address its grievance to the Legislature.\u201d [<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] <em>[Id. </em>64 Cal. App. 3d 148, 134 Cal. Rptr. 280 (Emphasis in court\u2019s opinion).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">It also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\">In sustaining the Regents\u2019 demurrer to the Department\u2019s petition, the trial court stated: \"Well, I don\u2019t think that a payment that is made by a computer by mistake is a benefit, so I am inclined to sustain the demurrer.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>64 Cal. App. 3d 149, 134 Cal. Rptr. 280.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">It further said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-9\">Reimbursement employers are exempt from liability for federal unemployment tax. Accordingly, only tax rate employers fund the administration of the unemployment insurance system. [id. 64 Cal. App. 3d 152, 134 Cal. Rptr. 282.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">The court differentiated between what it called \"anticipated overpayments,\u201d referring to an overpayment which might take place by virtue of an initial allowance of benefits followed by a denial on appeal, as took place here, and \"error overpayments,\u201d as also took place here. The court observed, \"If the decision allowing benefits is finally overturned on appeal, 'anticipated overpayments\u2019 are not charged against the tax rate employer\u2019s reserve account. . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>64 Cal. App. 3d 153, 134 Cal. Rptr. 283. (A similar provision exists in Maryland law. See Code (1957, 1979 Repl. Vol., 1979 Cum. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Supp.) Art. 95A, \u00a7 8 (c) (2) (ii)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It concluded, \"Any amount exceeding the maximum amount of allowable benefits does not constitute 'benefits paid based on base period wages;\u2019 and a reimbursement employer has no obligation to pay such amounts. . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>64 Cal. App. 3d 156, 134 Cal. Rptr. 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">The Delaware case had a slightly different twist. In <em>Wilmington Medical Center </em>the issue presented was whether a nonprofit employer which had elected the reimbursement method of assessment was chargeable for unemployment compensation benefits paid to former employees who left such employ without entitlement to compensation but who later became eligible for compensation. The court said it \"agree[dl with the Superior Court that such payments are not chargeable, for the reasons stated in that Court\u2019s opinion,\u201d referring to <em>Wilmington Med. Ctr. v. Unemployment Ins. App. Bd., </em>346 A.2d 181 (Del. Super. 1975), as well as the reasons stated in its own opinion. The Delaware statute required reimbursements for benefits paid \"attributable to service in the employ of such nonprofit organization, to individuals for weeks of unemployment which begin during the effective period of such election.\u201d 19 Del. C. \u00a7 3345 (c) (3). The lower court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-5\">To interpret the phrase \"attributable to service\u201d as meaning any compensation based upon earlier paid wages despite an intervening \u00a7 3315 disqualification would violate the apparent intent of the Legislature by imposing costs upon nonprofit organizations for what in the ordinary case of business employers would not be classified as compensated unemployment. <em>[Id. </em>346 A.2d at 183. |</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The Supreme Court of Delaware said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-7\">An examination of the Federal Statute mandating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>unemployment coverage for nonprofit employers, 26 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 3309 (1970), and legislative history pertinent thereto, 2 <em>U.S.C.C.A.N. </em>pp. 3606-49 (1970), impels the conclusion that such compensation was not intended to be chargeable to a nonprofit employer. As no statutory definition of \"attributable to service,\u201d nor relevant Delaware legislative history exists we apply the mode presently used for calculating other employer assessments, which excludes payments to employees leaving without entitlement, from calculation of the assessments. <em>[Id. </em>373 A.2d at 205.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">In <em>Baptist Hospital </em>an employee left its employment for what he believed would be a better paying job. He was discharged by the subsequent employer prior to earning the minimum amount required in order to make him eligible to draw unemployment compensation from its account. When he applied for unemployment compensation he was paid $405.00 chargeable to that subsequent employer\u2019s account before the error was discovered. The Division of Employment Security then demanded that the hospital reimburse it for the sum erroneously paid. The Florida statute was similar to the California, Delaware, and Maryland statutes. The court said in holding the hospital not liable for the erroneous disbursement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-6\">The provisions of the foregoing statute specifically provide that the reimbursement employer pay benefits attributable to service in its employ and only authorizes the Division to bill the reimbursement employer for benefits attributable to service in its employ. The statute does not make any provision for a reimbursement employer paying the Division for payments which the Division erroneously or incorrectly paid. Thus, there is no statutory authority for the Division to charge a reimbursement employer with payments erroneously made. <em>[Id. </em>313 So. 2d 107.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>It has been suggested that the language appearing in Senate Report No. 91-752, 91st Congress Second Session (1970), <em>reprinted in </em>[1970] <em>U. S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News </em>3606 at 3618 evidences that Congress intended that reimbursers bear the risk and, therefore, the loss occasioned by agency errors which result in erroneous payments to former employees of nonprofit organizations. The committee report was concerned with the amendments to the Federal Unemployment Tax Act which were intended to bring nonprofit organizations such as the employer here within its provisions. It said that \"nonprofit organizations would be allowed to adopt a form of self-insurance. . . .\u201d A construction interpreting the statute to make all such employers selfinsurers and thus to make the employer here responsible was rejected by the Secretary of Labor in <em>Department of Labor v. State of Delaware Department of Labor et al., </em>Conformity Proceedings ETA-1 (1979), where he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-4\">To understand the Senate Report\u2019s language as interpreting section 3309 (a) (2) of FUTA to require \"pure self-insurance\u201d (i.e., strict liability) of reimbursing employers is to read too much into the language of the report. <em>[Id. </em>at 9.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">In that case the Department of Labor had taken issue with the fact the States of Delaware, New Jersey, and New York, after enacting \"legislation permitting non-profit organizations and State and local governmental entities to elect the reimbursement method of financing unemployment compensation costs in lieu of the payroll tax contribution method required to be used by profit-making employers,\u201d had \"[i]n their interpretation and implementation of their laws ... determined that, under certain circumstances, reimbursing employers need not reimburse the unemployment compensation fund for compensation paid out of that fund.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. The decision of the Delaware Supreme Court in <em>Wilmington Medical Center </em>was one of the interpretations in controversy. Thus, it is perhaps relevant to state that the administrative law judge said in his opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>For the reasons below, I find the <em>rationale </em>of <em>Wilmington Medical Center v. Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board, </em>346 A.2d 181 (Delaware, [Super.] 1975), affirmed 373 A.2d 205 (1977), dispositive of the issues here presented. Accordingly, I find and conclude that the respective State laws concerning reimbursing employers (including the interpretation and implementation of said laws) are in conformity with FUTA and in substantial compliance with FUTA. <em>[Id. </em>at 5 (Emphasis in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">He reasoned, \"A payment made illegally, improperly, or as the result of mistake or fraud is not a benefit which is 'payable\u2019 to a claimant. On the contrary, it was never payable which is the reason it constitutes an overpayment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The Secretary of Labor said in his opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">The States have argued that section 3309 (a) (2) of FUTA requires reimbursement only of compensation attributable under the State law to service with the reimbursing employer. Therefore, since their laws do not attribute to service with the employer certain compensation paid out as an overpayment due to fraud, or due to computer error or other mistakes, or paid out due to service with a subsequent employer, reimbursing employers in their States are not required by section 3309 (a) (2) to reimburse such compensation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">In its Statement of Exceptions and elsewhere in the record the Department of Labor has contended, in essence, that such a procedure constitutes \"noncharging\u201d of employers, and that the concept of \"noncharging,\u201d while relevant to contributing employers, is not relevant to reimbursing employers, which, it has contended, are required by section 3309 (a) (2) to be self-insurers. <em>[Id. </em>at 3-4.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>The Secretary further said in his opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-4\">With respect to the statutory language, the recommended decision [of the administrative law judge] stated, in relevant part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-5\">\"Stated simply, the determination of whether compensation benefits paid are 'attributable to service\u2019 with a reimbursing employer (and, accordingly, should be charged to the account of said employer for purposes of reimbursement) is committed by the <em>plain </em>terms of section 3309 (a) (2) to the States in the administration of their respective statutes. This is dispositive of the instant proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\">\"It is recognized that one State may enact legislation charging reimbursing employers for benefits in a particular situation that would not be chargeable to such employers in another State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-7\">I agree with the above-cited passage of the recommended decision. I therefore find, as a matter of law, that (1) a reimbursing employer must always fully reimburse the State unemployment fund whenever compensation, which is attributable to service with such employer, is paid out of such fund, (2) whether the compensation paid out is attributable to service with such employer is a matter to be determined under the provisions of the unemployment compensation law of the State, which reasonably interpret and implement section 3309 (a) (2) of FUTA, (3) the provisions of State law in issue in this case, whereby compensation is not considered attributable to service with the reimbursing employer when it is paid out due to service with a subsequent employer, or when it is an overpayment due to fraud, or due to computer error or other mistake, are reasonable interpretations and implementations of section 3309 (a) (2) of FUTA, and (4) a reimbursing employer may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>relieved from reimbursing compensation paid out of the State unemployment fund with respect to its former employees whenever it is reasonably determined under such provisions of the State unemployment compensation law that the compensation paid out was not attributable to service with the reimbursing employer. <em>[Id. </em>at 6-8 (Emphasis in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Although we find persuasive the holdings of the California, Delaware, and Florida courts and the decision of the Secretary of Labor, this case must be determined upon the basis of construction of the Maryland statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">In <em>Police Comm\u2019r v. Dowling, </em>281 Md. 412, 418-19, 379 A.2d 1007 (1977), we set forth a number of the holdings of this Court relative to statutory construction. They include that the cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and carry out the real legislative intent; in determining that intent we consider the language of an enactment in its natural and ordinary signification; a corollary to this rule is that if there is no ambiguity or obscurity in the language of a statute, there is usually no need to look elsewhere to ascertain the intent of the General Assembly; a court may not insert or omit words to make a statute express an intention not evidenced in its original form; the General Assembly is presumed to have had, and acted with respect to, full knowledge and information as to prior and existing law and legislation on the subject of the statute and the policy of the prior law; and, absent a clear indication to the contrary, a statute, if reasonably possible, is to be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory. See also <em>Messitte </em>v. <em>Colonial Mortgage Serv., </em>287 Md. 289, 293-94, 411 A.2d 1051 (1980); <em>In Re James S., </em>286 Md. 702, 705, 410 A.2d 586 (1980); <em>Board v. Stephans, </em>286 Md. 384, 388, 408 A.2d 1017 (1979); <em>Harbor Island Marina v. Calvert Co., </em>286 Md. 303, 311, 407 A.2d 738 (1979); and <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. </em>v. <em>Department, </em>284 Md. 216, 219, 395 A.2d 1174 (1979). We have said many times that statutes should be interpreted in a manner which avoids absurd, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>illogical, or unreasonable consequences. See, e.g., <em>Francois v. Alberti Van &amp; Stg. Co., </em>285 Md. 663, 670, 404 A.2d 1058 (1979); <em>Curtis v. State, </em>284 Md. 132, 149, 395 A.2d 464 (1978); <em>Grosvenor v. Supervisor of Assess., </em>271 Md. 232, 242, 315 A.2d 758 (1974); <em>Coerper v. Comptroller, </em>265 Md. 3, 6, 288 A.2d 187 (1972); <em>Pan Am. Sulphur Co. v. State Dep\u2019t, </em>251 Md. 620, 627, 248 A.2d 354 (1968), and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">In determining whether Holy Cross has liability we must look at \u00a7 8 (d) (2) as a whole. What is required of a nonprofit reimbursing employer is that it pay \"an amount equal to the amount of regular benefits and one half of the extended benefits paid, that is <em>attributable to service in the employ of such nonprofit organization . .. .\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The Congress and the General Assembly obviously intended to favor nonprofit organizations such as the employer here. Otherwise, there would have been no reason for providing them the option of being responsible for claims of their former employees in lieu of paying the regular tax. To hold as ESA would have us to do would make possible the potentially absurd result of the nonprofit organization\u2019s being potentially liable for errors and machinations which could run into many thousands of dollars. Suppose, for instance, that through computer error a number of checks were issued to a claimant which contained three additional zeros to the left of the decimal point. If our statute had words in it similar to that added in California after the <em>Carleson </em>decision to the effect that the sum paid by the employer to ESA should include sums paid \"due to any computational or other error of any type by [ESA] whether or not such error could be anticipated,\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> then it could be said legitimately that nonprofit employers making the election did so with full knowledge that agency error could cripple them financially. However, no such language appears in the Maryland statute. The payment here was attributable solely to agency error, not to service in the employ of the nonprofit organization. The employee was found ineligible for compensation by reason of gross misconduct relative to his employment by the nonprofit organization. As we see it, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>plain meaning of the statute is that the employer shall be liable only for those payments made which are attributable to service in its employ. Since the payment made here was as a result of ESA\u2019s error and not as a result of service in the employ of Holy Cross, it follows that the Court of Special Appeals erred. We understand the intent of this statute to be that nonprofit employers should be insurers against unemployment, not insurers against governmental error. We realize full well that the result of this decision may be to impose the loss upon the fund to which regular employers contribute.

What the dissent fails to note, however, is that the preamble to the definition embodied in \u00a7 20 (b) is \"unless the context clearly requires otherwise . ...\u201d In 8 17 (d) the context does clearly require otherwise. Thus, the difference in meaning between \"benefits\u201d as used in \u00a7 8 (d) (2) and its use in 8 17 (d) cannot be the basis for finding an ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">The fact that a state legislature elsewhere in its wisdom has seen fit to change a statute can hardly be taken as indicating what the statute meant without change nor does it demonstrate the meaning of the words in our particular statute. We have nothing here akin to that which took place relative to the Maryland version of the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, originally enacted by Chapter 294 of the Acts of 1939. In a series of decisions, as pointed out by Judge Collins for the Court in Schultz v. Kaplan, 189 Md. 402, 407, 56 A.2d 17 (1947), this Court held \"that where there exists an immediate cause of action between the parties for which one of the common remedies of law or equity is adequate and available, a proceeding for a declaratory judgment is not appropriate within the contemplation of that Act.\u201d Then, however, the General Assembly passed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>Chapter 724 of the Acts of 1945 reenacting that Act with a preamble specifying that \"lijt [was] the sense of the General Assembly that the real legislative intent in the passage of the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, was that the existence of another adequate remedy at law or in equity should not preclude a judgment for declaratory relief in cases in which it was appropriate,\u201d specifying that it was its intent and desire in reenacting that statute \"so to change the wording of the Act that it clearly and unmistakably expresses the intention which the General Assembly believe[d] was sought to be expressed in the passage of the Act.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b721-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>\n<em>Davidson, J.,</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Ayo\">\n<em>dissenting:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">The majority here holds that a reimburser is not required to reimburse the Fund for money paid to a former employee as a result of agency error. It bases this holding on an interpretation of the language \"attributable to service in the employ of such nonprofit organization\u201d contained in Maryland Code (1957,1979 Repl. Vol.), Art. 95A, \u00a7 8 (d) (2). The majority concludes that the \"payment here was attributable solely to agency error and not to service in the employ of the nonprofit organization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">In my view, the language, the legislative history, and the purpose of \u00a7 8 (d) (2) indicate that the Legislature intended the phrase \"benefits paid\u201d to include money paid to a former employee as a result of agency error and, therefore, intended reimbursers to reimburse the Fund for such payments. The fact that the Legislature intended reimbursers to reimburse the Fund for such payments indicates that it also intended that such payments be considered to be \"attributable to service in the employ of such nonprofit organizations.\u201d I, therefore, would hold that a reimburser is required to reimburse the Fund for money paid to a former employee as a result of agency error. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Here the reimburser contends that \u00a7 8 (d) (2) requires reimbursement for benefits paid but does not require reimbursement for payments that are not benefits. It points out that that section provides, in pertinent part, that any nonprofit employer who elects to reimburse the Fund must reimburse the Fund in:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-7\">\"an amount equal to the amount of <em>regular benefits and one half of the extended benefits paid. </em>...\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>It further points out that \u00a7 20 (b) defines \"benefits,\u201d in pertinent part, as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-4\">\"money payments <em>payable </em>to an individual, <em>as provided in this article. . </em>..\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">It maintains that because money erroneously paid after a final agency determination of disqualification is not money \"payable ... as provided in this article,\u201d such payments are not \"benefits\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 20 (b) and \u00a7 8 (d) (2). The reimburser concludes, therefore, that it is not required to reimburse the Fund for such payments. I do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the actual intent of the Legislature. <em>Department of State Planning v. Mayor of Hagerstown, </em>288 Md. 9, 14, 415 A.2d 296, 299 (1980). The primary source from which to determine this intent is the language of the statute itself. In determining whether the meaning of a statutory provision is ambiguous, even when its language appears to be clear, it is necessary to examine that provision in context and in relation to all the other provisions of the statute. <em>Comptroller of the Treasury </em>v. <em>John C. Louis Co., </em>285 Md. 527, 538, 404 A.2d 1045, 1052-53 (1979). A provision is ambiguous if its meaning is in conflict with other provisions of the same statute. <em>Celanese Corp. of America </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>186 Md. 463, 471, 47 A.2d 379, 383 (1945); <em>Alexander v. Worthington, </em>5 Md. 471, 485 (1854); 2A A. Sutherland, <em>Statutes and Statutory Construction, </em>\u00a7 46.04 (4th ed. C.D. Sands 1973). When statutory language is ambiguous, a court may consider the statute\u2019s legislative history and administrative interpretations and must consider its purpose. <em>Department of State Planning, </em>288 Md. at 15, 415 A.2d at 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">An examination of the phrase \"benefits paid\u201d contained in \u00a7 8 (d) (2) in context and in relation to \u00a7 20 (b) and \u00a7 17 (d) of the statute reveals that the phrase \"benefits paid\u201d may have two different meanings. If the word \"benefits\u201d were defined in accordance with \u00a7 20 (b) as \"money payments payable to an individual, as provided in this article,\u201d then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>the phrase \"benefits paid\u201d would refer only to money paid after an agency determination of eligibility. Under such circumstances, a reimburser would not be required to reimburse the Fund for payments made after an agency determination of disqualification or other ineligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">The word \"benefits\u201d as used in \u00a7 17 (d), however, would appear to have a different meaning. That section provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-5\">\"When any person has received any sum <em>for benef\u00edts for which he is found </em>by the Executive Director <em>to have been ineligible, </em>the amount thereof may be recovered from benefits payable to him or which may be payable to him in the future. ...\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">In view of the parties\u2019 concession that under this section, money paid to a claimant after an agency determination of ineligibility may be recovered, there can be no question that the word \"benefits\u201d as used in \u00a7 17 (d) refers to any money paid to an individual regardless of his eligibility at the time of the payment. If the word \"benefits\u201d contained in \u00a7 8 (d) (2) were defined in accordance with \u00a7 17 (d), then the phrase \"benefits paid\u201d contained in \u00a7 8 (d) (2) would refer to any money paid, including money paid after an agency determination of disqualification or other ineligibility. Under these circumstances, a reimburser would be required to reimburse the Fund for payments made after an agency determination of disqualification or other ineligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Because the meaning of the word \"benefits\u201d in \u00a7 20 (b) is in conflict with its meaning in \u00a7 17 (d), the meaning of the phrase \"benefits paid\u201d contained in \u00a7 8 (d) (2) is ambiguous. As a result of this ambiguity, it is unclear whether a reimburser must reimburse the Fund for erroneous payments made after an agency determination that a claimant was disqualified or otherwise ineligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">A comprehensive review of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 3301 \u2014 3311 (Employment Security Amendments of 1970) and Md. Code, Art. 95A discloses a statutory scheme that distinguishes between the obligations of employers who pay contributions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>to the Fund (contributors) and those of reimbursers. Contributors are required to make payments to the Fund regardless of whether any of their former employees have been paid benefits from the Fund. Contributors must pay the Fund a statutorily determined amount that may be modified by the contributors\u2019 experience rating which is essentially based upon the total amount of chargeable benefits paid from the Fund to each contributor\u2019s former employee. Art. 95A, \u00a7 8 (b); \u00a7 8 (c) (2); \u00a7 8 (c) (4); \u00a7 8 (c) (4) (i).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, contributors must pay a surcharge if the fund balance falls below a specified level. \u00a7 8 (c) (4) (ii).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, FUTA requires contributors to pay a Federal unemployment tax, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3301,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that provides the funds for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>Maryland Unemployment Insurance Administration Fund, from which, in turn, the administrative expenses of ESA are paid. Art. 95A, \u00a7 14.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">The Legislature, recognizing that administrative errors occur, provided that under specified circumstances, payments from the Fund made to former employees are not to be charged against a contributor\u2019s experience rating. \u00a7 8 (c) (10) (A); \u00a7 8 (c) (10) (B); \u00a7 8 (c) (2) (ii); \u00a7 8 (c) (8) and \u00a7 17 (e); \u00a7 8 (c) (8) and \u00a7 17 (d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, if the Executive Director determines that a contribution was erroneously collected, a contributor is entitled to an adjustment in the form of a credit or a refund. \u00a7 15 (b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although the individual contributor is thus afforded some degree of relief, he, like all other contributors, must ultimately share in and pay for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>the cost of these agency errors, all of which result in payments from the Fund. \u00a7 20 (i).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Reimbursers are not required to make any payment to the Fund unless a former employee has been paid money from the Fund. The reimburser must pay the Fund only the amount that was paid from the Fund to a former employee. \u00a7 8 (d) (2). Reimbursers are not required to pay a surcharge if the Fund balance falls below a specified level. Moreover, they are not required to pay the FUTA tax and, therefore, do not share in the costs of the Fund\u2019s administration. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3301 and \u00a7 3306 (c) (8). Finally, Art. 95A does not provide for any kind of relief for reimbursers when agency error results in payments from the Fund to the reimbursers\u2019 former employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">At the time \u00a7 8 (d) (2) was enacted, the Legislature was cognizant of the differences between the obligations of contributors and reimbursers. It also recognized that agency errors occur. It was fully aware that although it had afforded some degree of relief to contributors by providing that their individual experience ratings not be charged for agency errors which resulted in payments of money from the Fund to their individual employees, it nonetheless had required that employers must ultimately share in and pay the cost of agency errors which resulted in payments of money from the Fund. In the absence of an express provision affording reimbursers any form of relief, there is nothing to indicate that when an agency error results in the payment of money from the Fund to reimbursers\u2019 former employees, the reimbursers should be excused from the employers\u2019 ultimate obligation to pay the cost of such errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">In my view, the entire statutory scheme embodied in the Employment Security Amendments of 1970 and Md. Code, Art. 95A evidences a legislative intent that reimbursers who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>do not contribute to the; Fund, and who do not share in the expenses of maintaining or administering it, should not be afforded relief from the cost of agency errors made with respect to the reimbursers' former employees at the expense of the contributors who ultimately pay those costs. While it may appear somewhat inequitable to require reimbursers to pay for agency errors for which they are not responsible, it must be remembered that they elect to become reimbursers and may at their option terminate that election to become contributors to the Fund. In my view, it is even more inequitable to require contributors to pay for agency errors for which they are no more responsible than are reimbursers when it is remembered that contributors alone bear the total administrative costs of the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">The legislative history of the Employment Security Amendments of 1970 evidences the same legislative intent. Senate Report No. 91-752, 91st Congress, 2d Session, <em>reprinted in </em>[1970] <em>United States Code Congressional and Administrative News, </em>3606, 3618, was issued before Congress enacted the Employment Security Amendments of 1970 to the Federal Unemployment Tax Act which subjected nonprofit employers to its provisions. That report stated, in pertinent part, that by permitting nonprofit employers to elect the status of reimbursers rather than contributors, \"the nonprofit organizations would be allowed to adopt a form of self-insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">In my view, Senate Report No. 91-752 evidences that Congress intended reimbursers to bear the risk and, therefore, the loss occasioned by agency errors that result in erroneous payments to their former employees. I recognize that certain elements of self-insurance may not be applicable to a reimburser. However, the essence of self-insurance is the assumption by the self-insurer of the otherwise insurable risks associated with the activity in question. The risk of loss resulting from agency error is such a risk. The Fund insures a contributor against the risk of loss resulting from agency error with respect to its former employees. If a reimburser is intended to be a self-insurer, it must be regarded as assuming the risk of loss resulting from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>agency error with respect to its former employees. Any reimburser unwilling to assume this risk may elect to become a contributor.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">In order to assist the States in implementing the Employment Security Amendments of 1970, the Manpower Administration of the Department of Labor issued a document entitled \"Draft Legislation to Implement the Employment Security Amendments of 1970 . . . H.R. 14705, Together with Explanatory Commentary.\u201d The commentary following \u00a7 8 (f) (5), which is substantially similar to Art. 95A, \u00a7 8 (d) (2), provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">\"Non-charging of benefits to employers reflects concepts that are not reasonably applicable or adaptable to reimbursing employers. When benefits paid to a former employee of a contributing employer are not charged to the employer\u2019s account, he escapes only the consideration of such benefit payments in the computation of his contribution rate. He does not avoid a potential liability to share with all other contributing employers, to the extent that the fund may require, in meeting such benefit costs. Minimum contribution rates, solvency accounts, socialized costs, etc., are devices that recognize this potential liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">\"Reimbursing employers, who are required to pay into the State fund an amount equal to the benefit costs attributable to service in their employment, are in an inherently different position. <em>They are self-insurers, fully liable for such benefit costs of their employees </em>and not liable at all for the cost of any other benefits. If a reimbursing employer, for example, were relieved of the cost of post-disqualification benefits paid to a worker who had quit his employment, no other reimbursing employer could be required to pay into .the fund to help meet that cost, as is in effect the case with a contributing employer whose account is non-charged for such a benefit payment.\u201d [United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>States Dept, of Labor, Draft Legislation to Implement the Employment Security Amendments of 1970 . . .

Tittsworth, </em>269 Md. 677, 684, 309 A.2d 476, 480 (1973). Both support the view that the Legislature intended reimbursers to reimburse the Fund for payments made as a result of agency error.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">This conclusion is consistent with the purpose of \u00a7 8 (d) (2). In <em>North Charles General Hospital, Inc. v. Employment Security Administration, </em>286 Md. 115, 121, 405 A.2d 751, 755 (1979), this Court recognized that the Legislature\u2019s general purpose in enacting \u00a7 8 (d) (2) was to minimize the economic burden of reimbursers\u2019 participation in the Fund. At the same time, the Court determined that the Legislature intended reimbursers to be entitled to minimize their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>economic burden only under the very limited circumstances expressly provided by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">The majority recognizes that \"this case must be determined upon the basis of construction of the Maryland statute.\u201d Yet the only rationale it offers for its interpretation of \u00a7 8 (d) (2) is that \"the Congress and the General Assembly obviously intended to favor nonprofit organizations such as the employer here.\u201d Thus, in reaching its result the majority totally ignores the statutory scheme embodied in the language of the Act, the legislative history of the Employment Security Amendments of 1970, the Department of Labor\u2019s administrative interpretation, and the purpose of \u00a7 8 (d) (2) as articulated by this Court in <em>North Charles.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\"><em>In my view, </em>the language, the legislative history, and the purpose of \u00a7 8 (d) (2) indicate that the Legislature intended reimbursers to reimburse the Fund for payments made as a result of agency error.

Moreover, because the language, the legislative history, and the purpose of \u00a7 8 (d) (2) indicate that the Legislature intended reimbursers to reimburse the Fund for payments made as a result of agency error, I can only conclude that the Legislature further intended that such payments must be considered to be \"attributable to service in the employ of such nonprofit organization[s].\u201d I, therefore, would hold that a reimburser is required to reimburse the Fund for payments erroneously made after a final agency determination that a claimant was disqualified or otherwise ineligible to receive payments.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">Judges Eldridge and Cole authorize me to state that they join me in the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b721-9\">.

The majority relies on a 1979 decision of the Secretary of Labor in a conformity proceeding involving the States of Delaware, New Jersey and New York that I find to be unpersuasive. United States Dept, of Labor v. Delaware et al., Conformity Proceedings-ETA-1 (31 Oct. 1979). The Secretary's statement there that the term \"self-insurer,\u201d appearing in Senate Report No. 91-752, did not evidence a congressional intent \"to require 'pure self-insurance\u2019 (i.e., strict liability) of reimbursing employers . . .\u201d was dicta. The Secretary\u2019s holding was that the question whether a reimburser may be relieved of the obligation of reimbursing for payments made as a result of agency error was a matter of state law.

Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 657.471(3) (1979). In 1973, the Oregon State Legislature amended the statute to require reimbursers to reimburse the Fund for such payments.
