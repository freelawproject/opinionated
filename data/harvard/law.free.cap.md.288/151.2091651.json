One of the appellees, Doris M. Gartelman (claimant), was an insured motorist under a policy issued to her husband by the appellant, Pennsylvania National Mutual Casualty Insurance Company (insurer). On 13 July 1977, the claimant, while operating an uninsured moped <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> owned by her husband, was injured when she was forced off the road by an unidentified truck. The claimant sought benefits from the insurer under the insurance policy\u2019s personal injury protection (PIP) and uninsured motorist (UM) provisions. The insurer refused to pay because of exclusions contained in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">On 21 February 1978, in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, the claimant filed a petition for a declaratory judgment seeking a declaration that she was entitled to coverage under the policy, or, in the alternative, under the Act governing the Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund (MA1F). Md. Code (1957, 1979 Repl. Vol.), Art. 48A, \u00a7\u00a7 243A-N. The trial court granted the claimant\u2019s and MAIF\u2019s motions for summary judgment, declared that the claimant was entitled to coverage under both the PIP and UM provisions of the policy, and entered judgment in favor of the claimant and MAIF. The insurer appealed to the Court of Special Appeals which affirmed. <em>Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l Mutual Casualty Ins. Co. v. </em>Gartelman, 43 Md. App. 413, 405 A.2d 779 (1979). We granted a writ of certiorari. We too shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Personal Injury Protection Coverage</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">This case initially presents the question whether, under Art. 48A, \u00a7 539 and \u00a7 545, a motor vehicle liability policy may exclude from PIP coverage an insured who is injured while occupying an uninsured motor vehicle owned by a named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">In Maryland, there is an established legislative policy designed to make certain that those who own and operate motor vehicles in this State are financially responsible. Art. 48A, \u00a7\u00a7 243A-N; \u00a7\u00a7 538-547; Md. Code (1977 &amp; 1979 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 17-101 \u2014 \u00a7 17-107 of the Transportation Article. This legislative policy has the overall remedial purpose of protecting the public by assuring that operators and .owners of motor vehicles are financially able to pay compensation for damages resulting from motor vehicle accidents. <em>See Rentals Unlimited, Inc. </em>v. <em>Administrator, Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>286 Md. 104, 110, 405 A.2d 744, 748-49 (1979); <em>Keystone Mutual Casualty Co. v. Hinds, </em>180 Md. 676, 679, 26 A.2d 761, 762 (1942). To effectuate this legislative policy, the owner of a motor vehicle registered in Maryland is required to provide security, usually in the form of a vehicle liability insurance policy. \u00a7\u00a7 17-103, 17-104 of the Transportation Article. Every such insurance policy must provide PIP coverage. Art. 48A, \u00a7 539. The primary purpose of this requirement is to assure financial compensation to victims of motor vehicle accidents without regard to the fault of a named insured or other persons entitled to PIP benefits. \u00a7 540.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Section 539 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">\"No policy of motor vehicle liability insurance shall be issued, sold or delivered . .. unless the policy also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>affords the minimum medical, hospital and disability benefits set forth herein.... The benefits, or their equivalent, shall cover the named insured and members of his family residing in his household....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">Section 545 expressly provides for certain exclusions from this requirement. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\">\"The coverages prescribed under \u00a7 539 of this article may exclude from benefits thereunder any person otherwise insured under the policy who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">(a) Intentionally causes the accident resulting in the injury, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">(b) Is injured while operating or voluntarily riding in a vehicle known by him to be stolen, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-8\">(c) Is injured while in the commission of a felony or while in violation of \u00a7 21-904 of the Transportation Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-9\">(d) With respect to motorcycles, economic loss benefits required under \u00a7 539 may be excluded, or may be offered with deductibles, options or with specific exclusions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">Here the policy under which the claimant was insured provided the required PIP coverage. However, with respect to exclusions, it provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-11\">\"This insurance does not apply</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-12\">(c) to bodily injury sustained by the named insured or any relative while occupying ... any motor vehicle owned by the named insured ... which is not an insured motor vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">The insurer contends that the insurance policy\u2019s exclusion of an insured injured while occupying an uninsured motor vehicle owned by a named insured is nothing more than a \"narrowing [of] the insurer\u2019s liability in a manner not inconsistent with statutory requirements.\u201d It asserts that there is \"no statutory bar or evidence of intent to preclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>such an exclusion.\u201d The insurer concludes that its exclusion does not conflict with the statutory requirements and is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">The claimant contends that the exclusion is invalid. She points out that although the statute provides for certain exclusions, it does not provide for excluding an insured occupying an uninsured motor vehicle owned by a named insured. Accordingly, she concludes that the policy does not provide the coverage required by \u00a7 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the actual intent of the Legislature. <em>Department of State Planning v. Mayor of Hagerstown, </em>288 Md. 9, 14, 415 A.2d 296, 299 (1980). Where a statute expressly provides for certain exclusions, other should not be inserted. <em>Coleman v. State, </em>281 Md. 538, 546, 380 A.2d 49, 54 (1977); <em>State Ins. Comm\u2019r v. Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em>241 Md. 108, 117, 215 A.2d 749, 754-55 (1966). Any provision of an automobile liability insurance policy which conflicts with the requirements of the statute regulating such policies is invalid. <em>Peninsula Ins. Co. v. Houser, </em>248 Md. 714, 721, 238 A.2d 95, 99 (1968); <em>Keystone Mutual, </em>180 Md. at 679, 26 A.2d at 762; <em>Lord v. Maryland Automobile Ins. Fund, </em>38 Md. App. 374, 377, 381 A.2d 23, 25 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Applying these principles to the instant case produces a clear result. Section 545 expressly provides for only four exclusions from the required PIP coverage. It does not expressly provide an exclusion for an insured occupying an uninsured motor vehicle owned by a named insured. We decline to insert such an exclusion which would be contrary to the remedial legislative purpose of assuring compensation for damages to victims of motor vehicle accidents without regard to fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The insurance policy in this case, because it provides an exclusion for an insured occupying an uninsured motor vehicle owned by a named insured, denies PIP coverage to a class of persons who are required by \u00a7 539 to be covered. The policy\u2019s exclusion, therefore, conflicts with the statute and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>invalid. Accordingly, the claimant is entitled to coverage under the policy\u2019s PIP provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Uninsured Motorist Coverage</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The second question presented is whether, under Art. 48A, \u00a7\u00a7 541 (c) and 243H (a) (1) (i), a motor vehicle liability policy may exclude from UM coverage an insured who is injured while occupying an uninsured highway vehicle owned by an insured other than himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">In Maryland, in addition to PIP coverage, every motor vehicle liability insurance policy must provide UM coverage. \u00a7 541 (c). The primary purpose of this requirement is to assure financial compensation to the innocent victims of motor vehicle accidents who are unable to recover from financially irresponsible uninsured motorists. <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. v. Maryland Automobile Ins. Fund, </em>277 Md. 602, 605, 356 A.2d 560, 562 (1976); <em>Allied American Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>219 Md. 607, 611, 150 A.2d 421, 424 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Section 541(c) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-9\">\"[E]very policy of motor vehicle liability insurance ... shall contain coverage ... for damages which the insured is entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of bodily injuries sustained in an accident arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of such uninsured motor vehicle. The coverage required under this subsection (c) shall be in such form and subject to such conditions as may be approved by the Commissioner of Insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-10\">\"In no case shall the uninsured motorist coverage be less than the coverage afforded a qualified person under Article 48A \u00a7\u00a7 243H and 243-1.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Section 243H (a) delineates the types of claims which may be made against MAIF. More specifically, \u00a7 243H (a) (1) (i) expressly provides that such claims may be maintained provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-4\">\"The claimant was not, at the time of the accident, operating or riding in an uninsured motor vehicle <em>owned by him </em>and is not the personal representative of the person so operating or riding in such a vehicle.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Thus the statute expressly excludes from coverage a claimant who is operating an uninsured motor vehicle which he himself owns. The primary purpose of this exclusion is to encourage owners of uninsured motor vehicles to become insured. <em>Unsatisfied Claim &amp; Judgment Fund of Md. v. </em>Hamilton, 256 Md. 56, 60, 259 A.2d 303, 305 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Here the insurance policy under which the claimant was insured provided the required UM coverage. However, with regard to exclusions, it provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">\"This insurance does not apply</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-8\">(b) to bodily injury to an insured while occupying a highway vehicle (other than an insured highway vehicle) <em>owned by the named insured </em>any designated insured or any relative resident in the same household as the named or designated insured.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">The insurer contends that this exclusion, approved by the Commissioner of Insurance, is, in effect, identical to that contained in \u00a7 243H (a) (1) (i). It maintains that \u00a7 243H (a) (1) (i) must be construed to deny coverage, not only to an insured operating an uninsured motor vehicle which he himself owns, but also to all other persons insured under the policy when operating an uninsured motor vehicle owned by an insured other than himself. It points out that unless the statute is so construed, an insured could own several motor vehicles, insure only one, and nevertheless obtain UM coverage under the policy for other insureds, even when they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>are operating one of the uninsured motor vehicles. Under such circumstances, the insurer would be unable to ascertain the risk which it was undertaking because it would not know the number of vehicles to be covered. The insurer asserts that the Legislature could not have intended such an anomalous result. It concludes that when \u00a7 243H (a) (1) (i) is construed to exclude an insured operating an uninsured motor vehicle owned by an insured other than himself, the insurance policy\u2019s \"UM coverage is identical to that afforded a qualified person under \u00a7 243H and is in conformance with \u00a7 541.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">The claimant contends that the insurance policy\u2019s exclusion is invalid. She points out that although the statute permits the exclusion of a claimant operating an uninsured motor vehicle which he himself owns, it does not provide for excluding a claimant operating an uninsured motor vehicle owned by an insured other than himself. Accordingly, she concludes that the policy does not provide the coverage required by \u00a7 541(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">An additional rule of statutory construction applicable here is that in ascertaining and effectuating the actual intent of the Legislature, a court must read the language of the statute in context and in relation to all of its provisions. Where statutory language is plain and unambiguous, and expresses a definite meaning consonant with the statute\u2019s purpose, courts must not insert or delete words to make a statute express an intention different from its clear meaning. <em>Department of State Planning, </em>288 Md. at 15, 415 A.2d at 299. Moreover, Maryland\u2019s uninsured motorist statute is remedial in nature and should be liberally construed in order to promote its purpose of recovery for innocent victims of motor vehicle accidents. <em>State Farm, </em>277 Md. at 605, 356 A.2d at 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Applying these principles to the instant case produces a clear result. Section 243H (a) (1) (i) expressly excludes from coverage a claimant operating an uninsured motor vehicle which he himself owns. No express exclusion is provided for a claimant operating an uninsured motor vehicle owned by an insured other than himself. Thus the plain and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>unambiguous language of the statute establishes that only a claimant operating an uninsured motor vehicle which he himself owns can be excluded from UM coverage. The Insurance Commissioner\u2019s approval of the policy\u2019s exclusion is not persuasive because it is an administrative interpretation contrary to the clear and unambiguous meaning of the statute. <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. John C. Louis Co., </em>285 Md. 527, 543, 404 A.2d 1045, 1055 (1979); <em>State Farm, </em>277 Md. at 606, 356 A.2d at 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Our reading is consonant with the remedial legislative purpose of \u00a7 541 (c). That section is concerned with the protection of innocent victims of motor vehicle accidents rather than with the protection of insurance companies from allegedly unascertainable risks. The purpose of \u00a7 243H (a) (1) (i) is to encourage the owner of an uninsured motor vehicle to become insured by imposing upon him the penalty of exclusion from coverage for failure to obtain insurance. This purpose is not furthered by penalizing other insured persons who cannot obtain insurance for uninsured motor vehicles which they do not own. The exclusion of such other insured persons from UM coverage is contrary to the purpose of \u00a7 541 (c) which is to assure financial compensation to innocent victims of motor vehicle accidents who are unable to recover from financially irresponsible motorists.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, we decline to insert words necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>construe \u00a7 243H (a) (1) (i) as providing an exclusion for a claimant operating an uninsured motor vehicle owned by an insured other than himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The insurance policy in this case, because it provides an exclusion for an insured operating an uninsured motor vehicle owned by an insured other than himself, denies UM coverage to a class of persons who are required by \u00a7 541 (c) to be covered. The policy\u2019s exclusion is not identical to that provided by \u00a7 243H (a) (1) (i). Indeed, it is in conflict with the statute and is therefore invalid. Accordingly, the claimant is entitled to coverage under the policy\u2019s UM provision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b173-8\">. Throughout this opinion, we are assuming without deciding that, under the insurance policy here involved, a moped is a \u201cmotor\u201d or \"highway\u201d vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b174-9\">. \u00a7 540 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-10\">\"The benefits required under \u00a7 539 of this article shall be payable <em>without regard to the fault or nonfault </em>of the named insured or the recipient in causing or contributing to the accident....\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b180-5\">. The insurer\u2019s reliance on Unsatisfied Claim &amp; Judgment Fund of Md. v. Hamilton, 256 Md. 56, 259 A.2d 303 (1969), to show that this Court has construed \u00a7 243H (a) (1) (i) as excluding from coverage persons other than those specifically denominated in the statute is misplaced. There, we interpreted the words \"personal representative\u201d appearing in \u00a7 243H (a) (1) (i) to include the widow and minor child of an insured who, at the time of the accident, was operating an uninsured motor vehicle owned by him. The question in that case was whether claimants who stood in the place of the owner of an uninsured motor vehicle were excluded from coverage. In holding that under the statute they were excluded, we stated that the decisive criterion for recovery was the status of the uninsured owner. We recognized that to permit a recovery by those standing in the owner\u2019s place under circumstances in which the owner himself could not recover, would produce an absurd and anomalous result.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">In <em>Hamilton, </em>the question involved, in essence, the exclusion of a claimant operating an uninsured motor vehicle which he himself owned. It did not involve a question whether a claimant who was not the owner of an uninsured motor vehicle could be excluded, a matter which involves different policy considerations. <em>Hamilton </em>is therefore inapposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b181-12\">. In view of our decision, we need not consider the insurer\u2019s contention that under the insurance policy the claimant was not entitled to recover because the moped she was operating was an uninsured motor or highway vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
