Cave of the Sixth Judicial Circuit to conduct an evidentiary hearing and make findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Maryland Rule BV9. After conducting an evidentiary hearing, Judge Cave filed a memorandum setting forth his finding that Sperling had been convicted of two misdemeanors involving moral turpitude in violation of Disciplinary Rule 1-102 (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">The record discloses that Sperling was charged by a multi-count indictment in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on November 3, 1978. On April 23, 1979, Sperling was convicted by a jury of one count of the indictment, the misdemeanor of attempting to obtain money by false pretenses with intent to defraud.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1957, 1970 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 140. He was sentenced to a term of two years\u2019 imprisonment which was suspended; he was placed on probation for two years and ordered to pay court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">On March 16, 1979, Sperling was charged with violating Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 142, obtaining goods of the value of $150 by means of a bad check with intent to defraud. On July 12, 1979, he entered a guilty plea to this offense in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He was given a one-year suspended sentence and ordered to pay a fine of $500 and court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Sperling failed to appear before Judge Cave at the evidentiary hearing on the disciplinary petition, and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>filed no exceptions to Judge Cave\u2019s findings. We scheduled the matter for oral argument to determine the appropriate sanction to be imposed for Sperling\u2019s misconduct. Sperling appeared before us and urged the imposition of a sanction less than disbarment, although he offered no exculpatory or mitigating fadtors in his defense. It is clear that Sperling engaged in criminal conduct involving moral turpitude, dishonesty, fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation in violation of the disciplinary rule. We think disbarment is the appropriate sanction. <em>See Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Andresen, </em>281 Md. 152, 379 A.2d 159 (1977); <em>Bar Ass\u2019n of Balto. City v. Carruth, </em>271 Md. 720, 319 A.2d 532 (1974); <em>Maryland State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Agnew, </em>271 Md. 543, 318 A.2d 811 (1974); <em>Bar Ass\u2019n v. Marshall, </em>269 Md. 510, 307 A.2d 677 (1973). We therefore direct that the name of Lawrence Sperling be stricken from the rolls of those authorized to practice law in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b596-14\">. \"DR 1-102 Misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-15\">(A) A lawyer shall not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-16\">(1) Violate a Disciplinary Rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-17\">(2) Circumvent a Disciplinary Rule through actions of another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-18\">(3) Engage in illegal conduct involving moral turpitude.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>(4) Engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">(5) Engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-9\">t6) Engage in any other conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b597-10\">.
