BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-22\">Marina Guzman-Munoz, a native and citizen of Peru, seeks review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019s (BIA) order denying her motion to reopen her removal proceedings under the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (VAWA), Pub.L. No. 103-322, tit. IV, 108 Stat.1902 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 8, 16, 28, and 42 U.S.C). Guzman-Munoz had originally sought relief under the Cuban Refugee Adjustment Act of 1966(CAA), Pub.L. No. 89-732, 80 Stat. 1161 (codified as amended at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255 note), based on her marriage to Leonardo Cruz, a Cuban national who was a lawful permanent resident. The Immigration Judge (IJ) determined that Guzman-Munoz and Cruz were not credible, that their marriage was a sham, and ordered Guzman-Munoz\u2019s removal from the United States to Peru.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-23\">Guzman-Munoz appealed to the BIA, which affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. Guzman-Munoz then filed a motion with the BIA to reopen her final order of removal, alleging that she was eligible for a special cancellation of removal and adjustment of status as the battered spouse of a Cuban national pursuant to VAWA. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(2). In support of her motion, Guzman-Munoz submitted: (1) bills and bank statements showing that she and Cruz lived together; (2) her signed statement alleging that Cruz insulted her, pushed her, threw a remote control at her, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>and forced her to have sex with him; and (3) an evaluation from a therapist indicating that Guzman-Munoz had suffered verbal, physical, and financial abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-5\">The BIA denied her motion to reopen, noting that not only had she failed to show that her marriage to Cruz was bona fide in the first place, she had also failed to demonstrate that her evidence of abuse was previously unavailable. Notwithstanding those two fatal deficiencies, the BIA continued, Guzman-Munoz\u2019s evidence failed to establish a prima facie case that she was a battered spouse or subjected to extreme cruelty under VAWA. This petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-7\">Before we can reach the merits of Guzman-Munoz\u2019s appeal, we must determine whether we have jurisdiction over her petition in the first place. <em>See Univ. of S. Ala. v. Am. Tobacco Co., </em>168 F.3d 405, 410 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201cSimply put, once a federal court determines that it is without subject matter jurisdiction, the court is powerless to continue.\u201d). We determine our subject matter jurisdiction de novo. <em>See Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1231 (11th Cir.2007). Generally speaking, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1) \u201cconfers jurisdiction upon this court to review any final order of removal,\u201d and by way of implication confers \u201cthe authority to review orders denying motions to reopen any such final order.\u201d <em>Patel v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>334 F.3d 1259, 1261 (11th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-8\">That jurisdiction is limited, however, by \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, which strips us of jurisdiction to hear discretionary agency judgments \u201cregarding the granting of relief under section ... 1229b,\u201d i.e., the battered spouse provisions of VAWA. <em>See Bedoya-Melendez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>680 F.3d 1321, 1324 (11th Cir.2012); <em>Martinez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1219, 1222-23 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201c[W]e continue to lack jurisdiction over the BIA\u2019s purely discretionary decision that a petitioner did not meet \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D)\u2019s ... standard.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); see <em>also Kucana v. Holder, </em>558 U.S. 233, 247, 130 S.Ct. 827, 836-37,175 L.Ed.2d 694 (2010) (\u201cRead harmoniously, both clauses [of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)] convey that Congress barred court review of discretionary decisions only when Congress itself set out the Attorney General\u2019s discretionary authority in the statute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-11\">The practical import of this rule is that we do not have subject matter jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that an alien is not a battered spouse. In <em>Bedoya-Melendez, </em>we considered the BIA\u2019s denial of a petition for cancellation of removal brought under \u00a7 1229b(b)(2). <em>See Bedoya-Melendez, </em>680 F.3d at 1328. Because the BIA\u2019s denial rested on its discretionary determination that BedoyaMelendez was not a battered spouse, we held that we lacked jurisdiction to review the petition. <em>Id. </em>Although our caselaw on this matter has only applied \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i)\u2019s jurisdiction-stripping provisions for battered-spouse determinations in that context, the logical \u2014 indeed, inevitable \u2014 result is to extend it to our review of a denial of a motion to reopen after a petitioner has failed to establish a prima facie case under \u00a7 1229b.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This makes sense, because \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>does not speak in terms of final orders, prima facie cases, or motions to reopen. Instead, \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae simply bars review of discretionary agency judgments granting or denying relief under \u00a7 1229b. To hold otherwise would create an end-run around our holding in <em>Bedoya-Melendez, </em>because petitioners would be able to obtain appellate-court jurisdiction simply by raising \u00a7 1229b arguments on motions to reopen. To summarize: because our jurisdiction to review denials of motions to reopen derives from our jurisdiction to review final orders of removal, <em>see Patel, </em>334 F.3d at 1261, it follows that the jurisdiction-stripping provisions of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae must apply to appellate-court review of final orders of removal and to denials of motions to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-4\">In this case, the BIA made a discretionary decision when it determined that Guzman-Munoz had not established a prima facie case that, she was a battered spouse or subjected to extreme cruelty under \u00a7 1229b. Therefore, \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae strips us of jurisdiction to hear Guzman-Munoz\u2019s appeal. And although Guzman-Munoz correctly points out that we retain jurisdiction to review constitutional challenges of law, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), she raises no such challenge. An alien does not have a constitutionally protected interest in discretionary forms of relief, such as a decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen. <em>See Scheerer v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1244, 1253 (11th Cir.2008). Further, to the extent that Guzman-Munoz argues that the BIA erred in finding that her evidence was not previously unavailable, any error was harmless because the BIA disposition of the case also rested on its determination that Guzman-Munoz had not established a prima facie case under \u00a7 1229b.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-6\">We conclude that we do not have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary denial of Guzman-Munoz\u2019s motion to reopen, and she has raised no constitutional issue or question of law for which we do have jurisdiction. Accordingly, we dismiss Guzman-Munoz\u2019s petition for review for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-8\">PETITION DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1367-9\">. Guzman-Munoz's reliance on our unpublished decision in <em>Sukhera v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>139 Fed.Appx. 153 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam), is misplaced, because in that case we merely held that we had jurisdiction to review the BIA's denial of a motion to reopen because the BIA had denied the motion on a non-discretionaiy basis. <em>See id. </em>at 155 (expressly noting that \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) was not implicated because \u201cthe BIA denied the motion on the non-discretionary basis of statutory ineligibility\u2019\u2019).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
