We modify the certified ballot title.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">The proposed initiative measure provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-5\">\u201cSection 41 is added to Article I of the Oregon Constitution:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-6\">\u201c(1) The purpose of the criminal justice system is to protect the people of Oregon. This system shall be based on the principle that each individual is responsible for his/her acts. A just and effective criminal justice system depends on concern for the rights of crime victims. To ensure victims a meaningful role in the criminal justice system and to accord them due dignity and respect, victims of crime are hereby granted the following rights in all prosecutions for crimes and juvenile proceedings:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-7\">\u201c(a) The right to be informed of, to be present at, and to be heard at all criminal proceedings, including trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-8\">\u201c(b) The right to have all relevant evidence admissible against the criminal defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-9\">\u201c (c) The right to be reasonably protected from the criminal defendant or the convicted criminal throughout the criminal justice process; sentences and release decisions are to be based on the principle of reasonable protection of the victim and the public;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-10\">\u201c(d) The right, upon request, to information about the conviction, sentence, imprisonment, criminal history and future release from physical custody of the criminal defendant or convicted criminal;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-11\">\u201c(e) The right, in an adult criminal prosecution, to a public trial without delay by an impartial jury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-12\">\u201c(f) The right to have a copy of a transcript of any court proceeding, if one is otherwise prepared;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-13\">\u201c(g) The right that no law shall treat convictions for separate crimes involving a victim as a single conviction for purpose of determining a criminal defendant\u2019s criminal history.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-14\">\u201cUnless provided otherwise by direct vote of the people, the rights conferred on victims by this section shall be limited only to the extent required by the United States Constitution; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>nor shall Section 9, Article I and Section 12, Article I of this constitution be construed more broadly than the United States Constitution in criminal cases involving a victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-4\">\u201c(2) Nothing in this amendment shall reduce the rights that a criminal defendant has under the United States Constitution as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-5\">\u201c(3) Nothing in this section shall affect any existing statutory rule relating to privilege or hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-6\">\u201c(4) Nothing in this amendment shall affect any existing statutory or constitutional right of the press.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-7\">\u201c(5) The district attorney is authorized to assert the rights conferred by this section in all criminal prosecutions and juvenile proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">\u201c(6) \u2018Victim\u2019 means persons who have suffered financial, social, psychological or physical harm as a result of a crime or juvenile offense, and includes, in the case of a homicide, a member of the immediate family of the decedent, and, in the case of a minor victim, the legal guardian of the minor. In no event shall the criminal defendant be considered a victim. In criminal cases involving the sale, possession, distribution, or manufacture of controlled substances or driving under the influence of intoxicants, the people of the State of Oregon, represented by the State of Oregon, are the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-9\">\u201c(7) \u2018Relevant evidence\u2019 means evidence having any tendency to prove the charge against the criminal defendant or establish the proper sentence for the criminal defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">The Attorney General certified the following ballot title to the Secretary of State pursuant to ORS 250.067(2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-11\">\u201cNEW CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION GIVES CRIME VICTIMS RIGHTS, EXPANDS ADMISSIBLE EVIDENCE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjF\"><em>\u201cQuestion: </em>Shall new section of constitution give victims rights at criminal and juvenile proceedings, expand evidence court or jury may hear?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-13\">\u201c[Summary]: Adds new section to state constitution. Affects adult and juvenile criminal proceedings involving victims. Victim may attend and be heard at all proceedings. Sentencing and release decisions to be based on protecting victim and public. Victim may demand jury trial of adults. Victim may get information about defendant. Criminal history must treat separately separate crimes against same victim. All relevant evidence is admissable [sic] against criminal defendent [sic], but defendant keeps rights under U.S. Constitution. Defines victim broadly. District Attorney asserts victims\u2019 rights.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>We review the certified ballot title for substantial compliance with the requirements of ORS 250.035<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and ORS 250.039.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ORS 250.085(4). We will approve a certified ballot title which substantially complies with the statutory standards even if we do not believe it to be the best of all possible ballot titles. <em>See Deras v. Roberts, </em>309 Or 250, 254 n 4, 785 P2d 1045 (1990); <em>Wah Chang v. Paulus, </em>295 Or 762, 766, 670 P2d 1021 (1983). The ballot title is subject to \u201crequirements of impartiality, conciseness and accuracy.\u201d ORS 250.039.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">Four different petitioners have challenged various aspects of the certified ballot title. For reasons that will become clear hereafter, we deal with each petitioner separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Petitioner Ransom contends that the certified ballot title fails to inform the voters that the initiative measure would significantly change several provisions of the Oregon Constitution. He argues that: the measure would render Article I, sections 9<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 12<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cmeaningless\u201d; it would amend Arti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>ele I, section ll,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> by eliminating a criminal defendant\u2019s right to waive trial by jury; it would amend Article I, sections 14<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and 16<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cto the extent inclusion of protection of the victim and public is constitutionally required;\u201d and Article I, section 15<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> would be \u201cdeleted from the [Oregon] Bill of Rights.\u201d Ransom also argues that the measure would \u201ceviscerate\u201d the authority of the Oregon Supreme Court by limiting this court\u2019s authority to interpret certain provisions of the Oregon Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">The thrust of Ransom\u2019s arguments is that, while the proposed initiative measure on its face appears to provide certain rights to crime victims, the new measure would, in fact, significantly change the Oregon Constitution and the judicial power of the Oregon Supreme Court to the detriment of all citizens, changes that are nowhere reflected in the certified ballot title.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Ransom proposes the following ballot title:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-4\">\u201cREDUCES CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES, SUPREME COURT AUTHORITY;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Av1\">CHANGES CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS PROCEDURES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\"><em>\u201cQuestion: </em>Shall new section of Constitution reduce citizens\u2019 constitutional guarantees, restrict the Oregon Supreme Court and change criminal proceedings procedures?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\"><em>\u201c[Summary]: </em>Adds section to Oregon Constitution diminishing citizens\u2019 constitutional rights. Restricts Supreme Court authority to interpret Constitution\u2019s Bill of Rights. Adds statutorily-granted victims\u2019 rights. Changes adult and juvenile criminal proceedings procedures; victims may attend and be heard. Protection of victims primary sentencing and release consideration. State may demand jury trial of adults. Criminal histories available to victims. Separate crimes treated separately. Relevant evidence defined to exclude consideration of Oregon Constitution but must be consistent with United States Constitution. Defines victim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">Respondent answers that the ballot title makes it clear that the initiative measure is intended to alter the constitutional rights of citizens, because the title states that the measure is a new constitutional provision relating to all citizens, including criminal defendants and crime victims, and that the measure\u2019s intent in so doing is to \u201cgive victims rights [and to] expand evidence [a] court or jury may hear.\u201d She asserts that the ballot title states most, <em>and the most important, </em>of the constitutional changes which the initiative measure would make, as well as the changes which the measure would make affecting the construction and application of present constitutional provisions. Respondent answers further that the ballot title\u2019s statement, \u201cAll relevant evidence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>admissible against criminal defendant, but defendant keeps rights under U. S. Constitution,\u201d states most of the effect of the measure\u2019s requirement that Article I, sections 9 and 12 shall not \u201cbe construed more broadly than the United States Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Respondent answers further that any reduction of the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s authority under the Oregon Constitution to interpret the \u201cexclusionary rule\u201d more broadly than that rule may be interpreted by the United States Supreme Court is \u201cby far of most significance\u201d to the measure, and her choice to cover that specific provision of the measure relating to admissibility of evidence, rather than the equally important but more general provision relating to judicial construction, having the same effect,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> was reasonable and, therefore, unobjectionable. <em>See Pacific Power &amp; Light v. Paulus, </em>292 Or 826, 830, 643 P2d 871 (1982); <em>Priestley v. Paulus, </em>287 Or 141, 146, 597 P2d 829 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">THE CAPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">ORS 250.035(1)(a) requires a Caption of not more than 10 words which reasonably identifies the <em>subject </em>of the measure. Here, the subject of the measure is the creation of new rights for crime victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">The Attorney General\u2019s Caption reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-8\">\u201cNEW CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS GIVES CRIME VICTIMS RIGHTS, EXPANDS ADMISSIBLE EVIDENCE\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">We conclude that Ransom\u2019s focus on the loss of citizens\u2019 rights is misplaced. That may be the effect of the measure if it is approved. However, it is not the subject of the measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">Ransom\u2019s proposed Caption, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-12\">\u201cREDUCES CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES, SUPREME COURT AUTHORITY; CHANGES CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS PROCEDURES\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4W\">focuses on the measure\u2019s perceived effects; in so doing, it fails to reasonably identify the measure\u2019s subject as required by ORS 250.035(l)(a). We therefore reject Ransom\u2019s Caption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>and approve the certified Caption which, we conclude, substantially complies with the requirement that it reasonably identify the subject of the measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">THE QUESTION</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">ORS 250.035(1)(b) requires a Question of not more than 20 words which plainly phrases the <em>chief purpose</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>of the measure so that an affirmative response to the question corresponds to an affirmative vote on the measure. The chief purpose of the initiative measure here is to give \u201ccrime victims\u2019 rights\u201d constitutional stature at criminal and juvenile proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The certified Question reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-7\"><em>\u201cQuestion: </em>Shall new section of constitution give victims rights at criminal and juvenile proceedings, expand evidence court or jury may hear?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">Ransom asserts that the chief purpose of the initiative measure is \u201ca well-disguised assault on the constitutional rights of the citizens of Oregon,\u201d and he complains that \u201c[n]owhere in the [Question] are the far-reaching purposes of the proposed initiative mentioned.\u201d The sponsors\u2019 <em>motivation </em>in drafting the measure, however, has no place in the ballot title. <em>See Bauman v. Roberts, </em>309 Or 490, 789 P2d 258 (1990). If the measure is placed on the ballot, the voters may consider the arguments of its proponents and opponents about the motives of each and decide the issue for themselves. The voters\u2019 pamphlet also provides space for interested citizens and organizations to make their arguments for or against the measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">Ransom\u2019s proposed Question reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-10\"><em>\u201cQuestion: </em>Shall new section of constitution reduce citizens\u2019 constitutional guarantees, restrict the Oregon Supreme Court and change criminal proceedings procedures?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Here again, his focus is on a perceived loss of constitutional rights, which, as explained earlier, may be the effect of the measure\u2019s passage. It is not, however, the measure\u2019s chief purpose. We therefore reject Ransom\u2019s Question and approve the certified Question which, we conclude, satisfies the statutory standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">THE SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">ORS 250.035(1)(c) requires a concise and impartial statement of not more than 85 words <em>summarizing the measure and its major effect. </em>This is the portion of the ballot title that <em>is </em>intended to focus on a measure\u2019s effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The certified Summary reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\"><em>\u201c[Summary]: </em>Adds new section to state constitution. Affects adult and juvenile criminal proceedings involving victims. Victim may attend and be heard at all proceedings. Sentencing and release decisions to be based on protecting victim and public. Victim may demand jury trial of adults. Victim may get information about defendant. Criminal history must treat separately separate crimes against same victim. All relevant evidence is admissable [sic] against criminal defendent [sic], but defendant keeps rights under U.S. Constitution. Defines victim broadly. District Attorney asserts victims\u2019 rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">We conclude that the certified Summary is deficient in two respects. Something must be said about the effect the measure\u2019s passage would have on existing state constitutional rights, and on the power of this state\u2019s courts to independently interpret the Oregon Constitution. These are important components of the measure which should be mentioned in the Summary if that can be done within the 85-word limit imposed by ORS 250.035(1)(c). We conclude that it can be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">With the foregoing in mind, we modify the certified Summary to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-11\"><em>\u201cSummary: </em>Adds new section to state constitution. Affects adult, juvenile criminal proceedings involving victims. Victim may attend, be heard at proceedings, demand jury trial of adults; get information about defendant. Criminal history must treat separately separate crimes against same victim. Sentencing and release decisions based on protecting victim and public. All relevant evidence admissible against defendant, but defendant keeps federal constitutional rights. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>criminal cases with victims, state courts may not interpret some state constitutional rights to give defendants more rights than given by federal constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Petitioner Shepard also makes several arguments against the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title. Petitioner Kouns moves to dismiss Shepard\u2019s petition because he did not file with the Secretary of State comments and arguments concerning the Attorney General\u2019s draft ballot title.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> That motion is well taken. We dismiss Shepard\u2019s petition. ORS 250.085(5). <em>See McMurdo v. Roberts, </em>309 Or 318, 320-21, 786 P2d 1268 (1990); <em>Kafoury v. Roberts, </em>303 Or 306, 736 P2d 178 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Petitioner Kouns is a chief petitioner for this initiative measure. The <em>only </em>contention she makes in this court is that the word \u201cAMENDMENT\u201d should be substituted for the word \u201cPROVISION\u201d in the Caption. Kouns did not make that argument in her comments to the Secretary of State. She therefore is foreclosed from so arguing now. We dismiss Kouns\u2019s petition. ORS 250.085(5). <em>See McMurdo v. Roberts, supra; Kafoury v. Roberts, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">Petitioner The American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon, Inc. (ACLU), lacks standing to challenge the certified ballot title because the ACLU is not an \u201celector.\u201d We dismiss the ACLU\u2019s petition. ORS 250.085(2); 250.005(2); <em>see Brown v. Roberts, </em>309 Or 667, 791 P2d 488 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">In summary, we certify the following ballot title to the Secretary of State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-11\">\u201cNEW CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS GIVES CRIME VICTIMS RIGHTS, EXPANDS ADMISSIBLE EVIDENCE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-13\"><em>\u201cQuestion: </em>Shall new section of constitution give victims rights at criminal and juvenile proceedings, expand evidence court or jury may hear?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number><em>\u201cSummary: </em>Adds new section to state constitution.

All relevant evidence admissible against defendant, but defendant keeps federal constitutional rights. In criminal cases with victims, state courts may not interpret some state constitutional rights to give defendants more rights than given by federal constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Ballot title certified as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Petitions S36790 and S36793 are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Petition S36784 is dismissed as to petitioner The American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Pursuant to ORAP 11.30(10) and notwithstanding ORAP 9.25(1), this decision will become effective when the appellate judgment issues. The State Court Administrator shall issue the appellate judgment 10 days from the date of this decision, unless a petition for reconsideration is both filed with and physically received by the Office of the State Court Administrator within seven days of the date of this decision.

Nor do these arguments concern language added to or removed from the draft ballot title. Ransom therefore lacks standing to make these arguments now. ORS 250.085(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-15\">We also decline to consider Ransom\u2019s contention that the certified ballot title fails <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>to comply with the ORS 250.039 \u201creadability\u201d test. <em>See Deras v. Roberts, supra, </em>309 Or at 259-60. His only comment to the Secretary of State on readability was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-10\">\u201c[B]ecause of the manner in which the title is couched, it is extremely misleading and confusion can only result.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">That comment was an abstract observation, <em>Kafoury v.

As used in ORS 250.039, readability is a statutory term whose meaning has been defined by the Secretary of State. OAR 164-14-045 adopts and modifies a test which quantifies a document\u2019s \u201creadability\u201d in terms of the average number of syllables per word and the average number of words per sentence. Ransom\u2019s comment is completely unrelated to that standard and, thus, does not preserve a readability challenge.
