If approved by the voters, the amendment would exempt laws regulating the financing of election campaigns from the provisions of Article I, sections 8 and 26, of the Oregon Constitution. We modify the certified ballot title.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The proposed initiative measure provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">\u201cBe It Enacted by the People of the State of Oregon:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-7\"><em>\u201cPARAGRAPH 1. </em>Section 8, Article II of the Constitution of the State of Oregon is amended to read:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-8\">\u201cSec. 8. (1) The Legislative Assembly shall enact laws to support the privilege of free suffrage, prescribing the manner of regulating, and conducting elections, and prohibiting under adequate penalties, all undue influence therein, from power, bribery, tumult, and other improper conduct.

The measure would allow voters and the legislature to enact laws regulating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>election campaign financing that currently would be prohibited by the state constitution\u2019s free expression and free association provisions. Exempts laws that regulate the financing of election campaigns from the effect of Article I, section 8, which prohibits laws that restrain free expression of opinion. Also exempts such laws from Article I, section 26, which prohibits laws that restrain free assembly or access to legislative representatives or the legislature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">All petitioners timely submitted written comments on the Attorney General\u2019s draft ballot title; therefore, they may seek a different title. ORS 250.085(2) and (5).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review the certified ballot title for substantial compliance with the requirements of ORS 250.035<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and ORS 250.039, <em>infra. </em>ORS 250.085(4).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Each petitioner contends that the certified ballot title fails to comply with ORS 250.035 in various respects. We shall not identify or discuss at length contentions that are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>well taken. <em>Nelson v. Roberts, </em>308 Or 417, 421 n 1, 781 P2d 344 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Petitioner Deras argues that the certified ballot title\u2019s caption and question, which state that the measure \u201cexempts\u201d certain laws from \u201cprotections\u201d or \u201cprohibitions * * * restraining,\u201d use \u201cconfusing double or triple negatives which really mean \u2014 and should say \u2014 simply that such laws will be allowed to do what the restrictions prohibit, <em>i.e., </em>limit free speech and assembly.\u201d He also argues that the words \u201cfree speech\u201d or \u201cfreedom of expression\u201d should be substituted for \u201cfree expression\u201d because the former phrases are better understood by most voters and \u201cfree speech\u201d is the term commonly used by the press for this right; that the phrase \u201cBill of Rights\u201d should be used somewhere in the ballot title in place of the word \u201cconstitution\u201d to more readily identify the nature of the proposed changes to be made by the measure; that deleting the word \u201ccampaign\u201d from the caption in the Attorney General\u2019s draft ballot title was \u201cerror\u201d because the measure is aimed at the campaigns which precede elections, not elections themselves; that the reference to \u201cfinance\u201d throughout the ballot title is misleading because it suggests that only <em>money </em>transfers would be affected if the measure is approved whereas, in fact, other transactions also would be affected; and that the statement summarizing the measure does not sufficiently describe the full panoply of rights of expression that enactment of the measure would affect. He asks that the summary separately mention every constitutional right that would be \u201cimplicated\u201d by the measure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Petitioners Paulus and Burton contend that the caption of the certified ballot title does not reasonably identify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>the subject of the measure, which they assert is \u201cto give the people of the state, and the Legislative Assembly, the authority to enact laws regulating the financing of election campaigns.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> They assert that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-4\">\u201c[I]t is questionable now whether the people and the Legislature have this authority. The means used to insure that laws may be enacted regulating election financing are to make clear that the existing constitutional provisions found in Article I, section 8, and Article I, section 26, of the Constitution do not prohibit such regulation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">They also argue that the certified ballot title\u2019s question does not plainly phrase the chief purpose of the measure as required by ORS 250.035(1)(b). They assert that the chief <em>purpose </em>of the measure is \u201cto allow the voters and the Legislature to enact campaign finance laws,\u201d rather than to exempt these laws from the free expression and assembly protections of the Oregon Constitution. They concede, however, that the major <em>effect </em>of the proposed initiative will be to exempt such laws from Article I, sections 8 and 26.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Petitioners Remington and the American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon, Inc. (ACLU) argue that the Attorney General\u2019s caption does not reasonably identify the subject of the measure, which, they assert, is \u201can amendment of the Oregon Constitution to allow certain kinds of future legislation which [are] now absolutely prohibited.\u201d They also argue that the Attorney General\u2019s caption fails to adequately inform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>voters that the proposed \u201cexemption\u201d will, as they assert, restrain free speech and free assembly. They argue that the Attorney General\u2019s question \u201cobfuscates the issue\u201d by addressing the measure\u2019s purpose in terms of \u201cexemptions from prohibitions against restraints.\u201d They assert that the purpose of the measure is \u201cto allow what the constitution would otherwise prohibit.\u201d Finally, they argue that the Attorney General\u2019s statement fails to express fully the measure\u2019s \u201cmajor effect,\u201d which they assert is to \u201cpermit election finance laws that limit free speech, freedom of association and assembly, and freedom to complain to elected officials.\u201d They seek a certified ballot title that affirmatively states that the measure would permit enactment of election finance laws restricting rights that are now protected by Article I, sections 8 and 26, of the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">The Attorney General responds that the certified ballot title is substantially modeled after a ballot title approved by this court in <em>Clark v. Paulus, </em>295 Or 673, 669 P2d 794 (1983), and that, in any event, all the title\u2019s component parts satisfy the requirements of ORS 250.035. With the foregoing in mind, we proceed to consider each of the certified ballot title\u2019s components.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">CAPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The caption must reasonably identify the subject of the measure in not more than ten words. ORS 250.035(1)(a). Here, the subject of the measure is the exemption of \u201claws regulating the financing of election campaigns\u201d from the prohibitions of Article I, sections 8 and 26 of the Oregon Constitution. The Attorney General\u2019s caption reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>\u201cEXEMPTS ELECTION FINANCE LAWS FROM CONSTITUTIONAL FREE EXPRESSION, ASSEMBLY PROTECTION.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">We agree with petitioner Deras that the measure is not aimed at \u201celections,\u201d but, rather, at the campaigns which precede them. We also agree that the word \u201cprotections\u201d may be confusing in light of the words \u201cprohibitions\u201d and \u201crestraining\u201d which follow in the Attorney General\u2019s question. Accordingly, we modify the caption to read:</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u201cEXEMPTS CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS FROM CONSTITUTION\u2019S FREE EXPRESSION, ASSEMBLY GUARANTEES\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">QUESTION</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">The question must plainly phrase the chief purpose<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of the measure in not more than twenty words so than an affirmative response to the question corresponds to an affirmative vote on the measure. ORS 250.035(1)(b). Here, the chief purpose of the measure is to exempt election campaign finance laws from the prohibitions of Article I, sections 8 and 26. The question is whether those prohibitions should be relaxed to allow the enactment of election campaign finance laws that presently would violate those state Bill of Rights prohibitions. The Attorney General\u2019s question reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-8\">\u201cQuestion: Shall election campaign finance laws be exempted from the Oregon Constitution\u2019s prohibitions against laws restraining free expression or free assembly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">We find that the Attorney General\u2019s question plainly phrases the chief purpose of the measure so that an affirmative response to the question corresponds to an affirmative vote on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>the measure. Nevertheless, for \u201creadability\u201d reasons, which will be explained <em>infra, </em>we modify the question to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-4\"><em>\u201cQuestion: </em>Shall election campaign finance laws be exempt from the state constitution\u2019s guarantees of free speech, assembly, and access to legislators?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">STATEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The statement must concisely and impartially summarize the measure and its major effect in not more than 85 words. ORS 250.035(1)(c). The Attorney General\u2019s statement reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\"><em>\u201cExplanation: </em>Amends state constitution. The measure would allow voters and the legislature to enact laws regulating election campaign financing that currently would be prohibited by the state constitution\u2019s free expression and free association provisions. Exempts laws that regulate the financing of election campaigns from the effect of Article I, section 8, which prohibits laws that restrain free expression of opinion. Also exempts such laws from Article I, section 26, which prohibits laws that restrain free assembly or access to legislative representatives or the legislature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">After considering each of petitioners\u2019 objections to specific portions of the Attorney General\u2019s statement, we conclude that it substantially complies with the requirements of ORS 250.035(l)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">FLESCH FORMULA FOR READABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">We next consider petitioner Deras\u2019s contention that the certified ballot title fails to comply with the ORS 250.039 test of readability.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Under the Flesch formula, a ballot title must achieve a \u201creading ease\u201d score of not less than 60, unless this court can affirmatively find no ballot title could both achieve that score and, at the same time, meet \u201cthe needs of impartiality, conciseness and accuracy.\u201d OAR 165-14-045(2). The goal of the readability test is plain and easily understood language. Application of the Flesch Formula to the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title here results in a reading ease score of 22. That means the language is \u201cdifficult to very-difficult\u201d to read and understand. <em>See </em>n 11, <em>supra. </em>During oral argument, respondent conceded with admirable candor that the certified ballot title \u201cflunks\u201d the Flesch test.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">With the foregoing in mind and in order to improve the certified ballot title\u2019s overall \u201creadability,\u201d we modify the Attorney General\u2019s statement to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\"><em>\u201cSUMMARY: </em>This measure would amend the state constitution. It would allow the voters and the state legislature to pass laws that place limits on campaign contributions. It would exempt such laws from sections 8 and 26 of the state Bill of Rights. Those sections forbid laws that restrict the rights of the people to speak, write, and print freely; to assemble; and to have access to the state legislature and its members. The state Supreme Court has said that these sections ban limits on campaign contributions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Application of the Flesch Formula to the modified ballot title results in a reading ease score of 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">In summary, we certify the following ballot title to the Secretary of State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">\u201cEXEMPTS CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS FROM CONSTITUTION\u2019S FREE EXPRESSION, ASSEMBLY GUARANTEES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\"><em>\u201cQUESTION: </em>Shall election campaign finance laws be exempt from the state constitution\u2019s guarantees of free speech, assembly, and access to legislators?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-10\"><em>\u201cSUMMARY: </em>This measure would amend the state constitution.
