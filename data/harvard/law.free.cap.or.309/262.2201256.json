J.</author>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">This case concerns three related property tax appeals. The principal question is whether a person other than the property owner has standing to dispute the exemption of the property owner\u2019s real or personal property from taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The defendants in these actions are: Good Samaritan Hospital and Medical Center (Good Samaritan), Providence Medical Center (Providence), Portland Adventist Center (Adventist), Emanuel Hospital (Emanuel), Metropolitan Hospitals, Inc. (HealthLink)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (hereafter collectively referred to as \u201cthe defendants\u201d) and the Multnomah County Assessor (hereafter \u201cthe assessor\u201d). The defendants are hospitals or hospital-related corporations that operate on a nonprofit basis and who applied for and received exemptions from <em>ad valorem </em>property taxation in Multnomah County.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">From the record and the Tax Court opinion, it appears that the plaintiff, Northwest Medical Laboratories, operates a medical laboratory for profit in Multnomah County. The laboratory receives and analyzes specimens from the patients of local physicians and reports the results to the physicians. So do the defendants. The plaintiff asserts that the defendants are soliciting referrals from local physicians, and are \u201cengaging in a wide range of commercial enterprises utilizing tax exempt property,\u201d including commercial laboratory services for revenue-producing purposes. This, the plaintiff claims, competes with the plaintiff\u2019s business. The plaintiff filed three separate actions in the Oregon Tax Court, each questioning the propriety of some or all of the defendants\u2019 tax exemptions on their respective properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">A. Case 2606 (Mandamus)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">In late 1984, the plaintiff filed a mandamus action in the Tax Court pursuant to ORS 311.215<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> asking the court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>order the assessor to include the defendants\u2019 laboratory properties on the tax rolls in accordance with ORS 311.207 to 311.211<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, or show cause why he had not done so. In December 1985, the Tax Court issued a peremptory writ directing the assessor to give notice as provided in ORS 311.209 and to make a determination as provided in ORS 311.211. After reviewing information supplied by the defendants, the assessor concluded that the defendants\u2019 laboratory properties indeed were exempt from <em>ad valorem </em>taxation and declined to add the properties to the tax rolls.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">The plaintiff appealed the assessor\u2019s decision to the Director of the Department of Revenue (the department). ORS 305.275(1) permits \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved by an act or omission of * * * a county assessor * * * which affects the property of the person and for which there is no other statutory right of appeal, [to] appeal to the Director of the Department of Revenue * * *.\u201d The department dismissed the appeal concluding that the plaintiff lacked standing to appeal under ORS 305.275(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The plaintiff immediately appealed the department\u2019s order of dismissal to the Tax Court. ORS 305.570 allows \u201c[a]ny taxpayer * * * aggrieved by and directly affected by an order of [the department], and any taxpayer whose property is affected by [such] order * * * made to a county assessor\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>appeal to the Oregon Tax Court. Defendants Good Samaritan and Providence intervened and moved to dismiss the complaint arguing that the plaintiff lacked standing to appeal the assessor\u2019s determination to the department and to the Tax Court. The Tax Court granted the motions and dismissed the plaintiffs complaint. The Tax Court then allowed the plaintiffs petition for reconsideration and clarification. At that point the department moved for summary judgment. The Tax Court, again on the basis that the plaintiff lacked standing, ordered its prior order of dismissal withdrawn and granted the department\u2019s motion for summary judgment and the intervenors\u2019 motions to dismiss. The plaintiff appeals from this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">\u201cStanding,\u201d in the context of an administrative appeal, means that the person invoking the jurisdiction of a tribunal or administrative body (here, the Department of Revenue) has met the requirements of the appeal statute. Apart from statute, there is no right of administrative appeal. In this case, as in all cases involving administrative bodies such as the department, a person has \u201cstanding\u201d to invoke the aid of the administrative body if a statute allows the person to do so, and the person meets the standing requirements of the statute. <em>See Benton County v. Friends of Benton County, </em>294 Or 79, 82-83, 653 P2d 1249 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The applicable statute in Case 2606 is ORS 305.275(1). It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">\u201c(1) Any person aggrieved by an act or omission of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">\u201c(c) A county assessor * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">\u201cwhich affects the property of the person and for which there is no other statutory right of appeal, may appeal to the Director of the Department of Revenue * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">To appeal to the department under this statute, the plaintiff must meet three distinct preconditions. The plaintiff must show: (1) that the plaintiff is \u201caggrieved by an act or omission of\u2019 the county assessor; (2) that the act or omission \u201caffects the property\u201d of the aggrieved plaintiff; and (3) that \u201cno other statutory right of appeal\u201d is available. We hold that in Case 2606 the plaintiff has met the statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>1. \u201cAggrieved by an act or omission\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The term \u201caggrieved\u201d appears in many statutes involving appeals from decisions of government bodies. Although a precise and uniform definition has not been given the term \u201caggrieved\u201d in the context of ORS 305.275(1), basic characteristics of \u201caggrievement\u201d have been identified by this court. To be \u201caggrieved\u201d is to be something more than just dissatisfied with a result. It is to have an interest in the outcome \u2014 an interest beyond that shared with the general public \u2014 such as pecuniary or other interest peculiar to the person who claims to be aggrieved. One indication that a person has a sufficient interest in the outcome so as to be \u201caggrieved\u201d is the recognition of that interest by the legislature by a statute granting standing. <em>Marbet v. Portland Gen. Elect., </em>277 Or 447, 453, 457, 561 P2d 154 (1977). <em>See also Jefferson Landfill Comm. v. Marion Co., </em>297 Or 280, 686 P2d 310 (1984) and <em>Benton County v. Friends of Benton County, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Contrary to the general rule that taxpayer status alone does not confer standing,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ORS 311.215 grants standing to any taxpayer to bring a mandamus proceeding to compel an assessor to include omitted property of another taxpayer on the tax roll. The plaintiff is a person recognized by the legislature as appropriate to institute the mandamus proceedings. ORS 311.215 expressly permits any \u201ctaxpayer\u201d to file a mandamus proceeding to compel an assessor to comply with his or her duties under ORS 311.207 to 311.213. The plaintiff here was successful in that it obtained a peremptory writ. It was ultimately unsuccessful, however, because the defendants\u2019 laboratories were not included on the tax rolls. The legislature\u2019s express recognition in ORS 311.215 that the plaintiff could bring the mandamus proceeding and the assessor\u2019s subsequent denial of the relief that the plaintiff was seeking are sufficient to meet the statutory requirement that the plaintiff is \u201caggrieved by an act or omission\u201d of the assessor. As in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number><em>Marbet, supra, </em>277 Or at 457, the plaintiff herein has \u201can interest that the legislature wished to have considered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">\u201cAggrievement\u201d is only the first standing requirement to appeal an assessor\u2019s decision to the department. The plaintiff must also demonstrate that there is something more at stake. We turn then to the second requirement of ORS 305.275(1): the assessor\u2019s act or omission must \u201c[affect] the property of the person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">2. \u201cAffects the property of the person\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Arguably, the plaintiff can establish that its property has been affected by the assessor\u2019s decision because the plaintiff owns property located in the same county as defendants\u2019 property, because the plaintiffs property is devoted to the same use as the property of the defendants that the assessor exempted from taxation, and because the plaintiff and the defendants directly compete against each other for the same business \u2014 obtaining patients\u2019 specimens from local doctors for analysis and reports. Its cost of doing business is greater than that of its competitor as a result of the assessor\u2019s determination, and the plaintiff arguably has standing because of that fact. We need not employ this reasoning, however, for the analysis on the \u201caffects the property\u201d issue is much the same as the analysis on the \u201caggrieved\u201d issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The appeal statute here involved, ORS 305.275, likely was passed without ORS 311.215 in mind. Because the legislature did not provide for taxpayer standing in ORS 305.275(1), but did provide for taxpayer standing in ORS 311.215, it seems likely that the legislature intended that a taxpayer in the position of the plaintiff here \u2014 who obtained a peremptory writ under ORS 311.215, but who ultimately failed to obtain the relief sought upon further consideration by the assessor under ORS 311.207, 311.209 and 311.211 \u2014 would be entitled to appeal under ORS 305.275(1) by reason of taxpayer standing alone. We emphasize that this ruling applies to a small class of cases, cases in which the claim is instituted by a taxpayer as a mandamus claim under ORS 311.215 to place omitted property on the tax roll, who obtains a peremptory writ and who later \u201closes\u201d when the assessor declines to place the property on the tax roll.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>3. \u201cNo other statutory right of appeal\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">The final statutory standing requirement that must be met is that there is no other statutory right of appeal. There is no issue on this point. The parties agree that there is no other statutory right of appeal available to the plaintiff. We agree with the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">B. Case 2271 (Declaratory Judgment)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">In 1985, while the mandamus proceeding was in progress (following the Tax Court\u2019s issuance of the alternative writ, but before the issuance of the peremptory writ and the assessor\u2019s ultimate determination), the plaintiff filed an action in the Tax Court seeking a declaration that the property of defendants Good Samaritan, Providence, Adventist and Emanuel that was and is \u201cused for commercial enterprise\u201d be declared subject to real and personal property tax. The plaintiff also urged the Tax Court to enjoin the assessor from exempting such property from taxation. The Tax Court dismissed the plaintiffs complaint because the plaintiff had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">ORS 305.275(4), absent certain exceptions enumerated in the statute, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-8\">\u201cno person shall appeal to the Oregon Tax Court or other court on any matter arising under the revenue and tax laws administered by the department unless the person <em>first exhausts the administrative remedies </em>provided before the department and the director.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">Because we today acknowledge plaintiffs standing to appeal to the department pursuant to ORS 305.275(1), an administrative remedy, we affirm the Tax Court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint in Case 2271. The plaintiff must first pursue its administrative remedy with the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">C. Case 2607 (Declaratory Judgment)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">In 1987, the plaintiff filed a similar complaint to that filed in 1985, seeking a declaration that the portion of defendant HealthLink\u2019s property that was and is \u201cused for commercial enterprise\u201d be subject to taxation, and requested that the assessor be enjoined from exempting such property. In this complaint the plaintiff alleged that it had \u201cexhausted its administrative remedies,\u201d pointing out that it was foreclosed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>from agency review by the department\u2019s ruling. Again, the Tax Court dismissed the complaint, this time because a second action (Case 2606, the mandamus action) was pending in the Tax Court for the same cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">The Tax Court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint in Case 2607 also is affirmed. The issues raised by the complaint in Case 2607 are asserted in Case 2606.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">D. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The decision of the Tax Court in Case 2606 and the department\u2019s decision in the prior proceeding (Department of Revenue No. 86-1603) are reversed. This case is remanded to the Department of Revenue to consider the merits of the plaintiffs appeal. The decision of the Tax Court in Case 2271 is affirmed. The decision of the Tax Court in Case 2607 is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b299-9\"> After the filing of Case 2271 but before Case 2607 was filed, Metropolitan Hospitals, Inc. changed its name to HealthLink. Metropolitan will therefore be referred to as HealthLink.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b299-10\"> ORS 311.215 in part states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-11\">\u201cIf any officer described in ORS 311.207 to 311.213 fails to comply with ORS 311.207 to 311.213 on the discovery by the officer, or on credible information being furnished by another person, that property has been omitted from taxation, the state, on the relation of any state officer or of any taxpayer of the county in which the failure occurs, may proceed against the officer in any court of competent jurisdiction by mandamus to compel the officer to comply with ORS 311.207 to 311.213.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b300-6\"> We note an ambiguity in the second sentence of ORS 311.215(1). The sentence reads: \u201cIf judgment is rendered that credible information has been discovered by or furnished to the officer, or that the officer has reason to believe that property has been omitted from taxation, the officer shall forthwith <em>place the omitted property on the assessment and tax roll </em>in accordance with ORS 311.207 to 311.215.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Tax Court apparently construed the sentence to mean that the assessor should forthwith proceed under ORS 311.207 to 311.215 to determine whether the property should be placed on the tax roll, and issued a peremptory writ accordingly. We agree with the Tax Court\u2019s construction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">ORS 311.207 provides that upon receipt of \u201ccredible information, or if the assessor has reason to believe that any real or personal property * * * has from any cause been omitted, in whole or in part, from assessment and taxation * * * the assessor shall give notice as provided in ORS 311.209.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">ORS 311.209 requires that the assessor give notice of the assessor\u2019s intention to add omitted property to the assessment rolls and permits the property owner to show cause why his or her property should not be included.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">ORS311.211 states that if the notified party \u2018 \u2018fails to show any <em>good </em>and sufficient cause why the assessment shall not be made, the assessor shall proceed to correct the assessment or tax roll or rolls from which the property was omitted\u201d and to add the property to the tax roll.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b302-6\"> Generally, in the absence of statute, taxpayer standing alone does not create standing to complain of underassessment or overassessment of the property of another. <em>See </em>cases collected in 9 ALR4d 428 (1981). The Tax Court has previously held that merely because a taxpayer has a higher tax burden as a result of an assessor\u2019s ruling concerning other property does not make the taxpayer \u201caggrieved\u201d under a statute that requires aggrievement in order to appeal. <em>Brummell v. Dept. of Rev., </em>4 OTR 168 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
