The proposed measure, which is lengthy and complex, amends existing laws and creates new laws affecting the voters\u2019 pamphlet (ORS 251.065), campaign finance regulation (ORS 260.005, 260.083 and 260.345), and the political contribution tax credit (ORS 316.102). We modify the certified ballot title.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Pursuant to ORS 250.067(2), the Attorney General certified the following ballot title to the Secretary of State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">\u201cLIMITS ELECTION CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL OFFICE CANDIDATES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\"><em>\u201cQUESTION: </em>Shall state law limit cash and in-kind contributions, for state, local office candidates, to candidates and principal campaign committees?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-9\"><em>\u201cEXPLANATION: </em>Amends, enacts laws. Limits cash and in-kind contributions, per election, to: $1,000 for state office candidates, $500 for local office candidates, $200 for each political committee. Limits total yearly contributions for such candidates and political committees to $20,000. Solicited endorsements count as in-kind contributions. Prohibits accepting excess amounts. Prohibits such candidates from contributing to other such candidates, political committees. Violators of limits may be fined up to $500 or three times contribution; knowing violators, $1,000 or five times contribution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">All petitioners timely submitted written comments on the Attorney General\u2019s draft ballot title. They therefore may seek a different title. ORS 250.085(2) and (5).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>We review the certified ballot title for substantial compliance with the requirements of ORS 250.035<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and ORS 250.039, <em>infra. </em>ORS 250.085(4). The power and duty of this court in reviewing a certified ballot title are subject to statute. We are not empowered to change a proposed ballot title solely because we are of the opinion that we can write a \u201cbetter\u201d title. On the pther hand, we have a duty to correct a proposed ballot title that fails to satisfy statutory requirements. <em>Priestley v. Paulus, </em>287 Or 141, 145, 597 P2d 829 (1979); <em>Allison v. Paulus, </em>280 Or 197, 199, 570 P2d 368 (1977). We shall not identify or discuss at length contentions that are not well taken. <em>Deras v. Roberts, </em>309 Or 250, 254-55, 785 P2d 1045 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Each petitioner contends that the certified ballot title fails to comply with ORS 250.035 in some respect. Petitioner Deras argues that the ballot title incorrectly treats the measure solely as a limit on <em>cash </em>contributions because the measure also limits or prohibits many other traditional political activities; that the Summary does not disclose that civil penalties may be imposed for violations without a jury trial; and that the Summary does not adequately cover the broadness of the definition of \u201cin-kind\u201d contributions. Deras also argues that the ballot title fails to comply with the readability standard of ORS 250.039 and OAR 165-14-045 <em>etseq. See Deras v. Roberts, supra, </em>309 Or at 259. Finally, Deras notes that the Summary inaccurately states that the contribution limit for <em>all </em>state office candidates is $1,000, whereas, in fact, the limit for some state offices (judicial and legislative offices) is $500.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Petitioners Paulus and Burton argue only that the certified ballot title\u2019s Summary inaccurately states that a solicited endorsement is counted as an \u201cin-kind\u201d contribution. They ask that the phrase \u201cSolicited endorsements count as in-kind contributions\u201d be stricken from the Summary.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Petitioners Remington and the American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon, Inc. (ACLU) argue that the contribution limits stated in the Summary may be read incorrectly as limits on how much a <em>candidate may accept, </em>rather than limits on how much one <em>donor may give </em>to one candidate or to all candidates. Remington and the ACLU also argue that the Summary should mention the possibilities of forfeiture of a candidate\u2019s right to appear in the voters\u2019 pamphlet for violation of the new law, and of repeal of the political contribution tax credit for certain political committees. Remington and the ACLU agree with petitioner Deras that the certified ballot title is deficient in that it fails adequately to convey that the limits extend beyond cash contributions or to convey the broadness of the definition of \u201cin-kind\u201d contributions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Respondent concedes that the initiative measure limits more than cash contributions and that this fact should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>reflected in the ballot title, but she argues that the measure\u2019s principal effect and purpose is to limit contributions. She also argues that, because existing election finance reporting laws and regulations already provide for imposition of civil penalties without a jury trial for violations, reference to trial without a jury for violations of the new law is unnecessary. Respondent concedes that Deras has identified an error in the contribution limit for certain state offices, and that Remington and the ACLU are correct in arguing that the contribution limits in the Summary may be read incorrectly as limits on how much a candidate may accept, rather than limits on how much one donor may give to one candidate or to all candidates. Respondent agrees with Remington and the ACLU that, if space permits, information about forfeiture of the right to appear in the voters\u2019 pamphlet and the repeal of the political contributions tax credit for certain political committees should be included in the Summary. Concerning the scope of the term \u201cin-kind\u201d contribution, and specifically whether a \u201csolicited endorsement\u201d constitutes an \u201cin-kind\u201d contribution, respondent asserts that she is \u201cunable to determine the reach of Section 8 of the measure, which provides for \u2018independent\u2019 expenditures but defines them very narrowly, with everything else becoming an \u2018in-kind\u2019 contribution.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">THE CAPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The Caption must reasonably identify the subject of the measure in not more than ten words. ORS 250.035(1)(a). Here, the subject of the measure is to place limits on cash and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>\u201cin-kind\u201d contributions, and other forms of support for political candidates for state and local offices. The certified Caption reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-4\">\u201cLIMITS ELECTION CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL OFFICE CANDIDATES\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">We agree with petitioners Deras, Remington and the ACLU that the quoted Caption incorrectly treats the measure solely as a limit on <em>cash </em>contributions. Indeed, respondent concedes the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">We are not satisfied with any of the alternative Captions submitted by petitioners because none seems to focus on the subject of the measure as we understand it. Accordingly, we modify the Caption to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">\u201cLIMITS AMOUNT OF CONTRIBUTIONS AND OTHER SUPPORT TO POLITICAL CANDIDATES\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">THE QUESTION</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\"> The Question must plainly phrase the \u201cchief purpose\u201d of the measure in not more than twenty words so that an affirmative response to the Question corresponds to an affirmative vote on the measure. ORS 250.035(l)(b). The chief purpose of a measure is the most significant aim or end which a measure is designed to bring about. The chief purpose requirement is determined in a manner analogous to legislative determination. The proposed measure is reviewed for its unambiguous language and the context in which it was drafted and for statements made by its sponsors. Context includes the legal context, as well as the more particular circumstances under which a measure is drafted. <em>Glerum v. Roberts, </em>308 Or 22, 28, 744 P2d 1093 (1989); <em>Reed v. Roberts, </em>304 Or 649, 654-55, 748 P2d 542 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">From these sources, we conclude that the chief purpose of the measure is to limit cash and \u201cin-kind\u201d contributions and other forms of support to political candidates for state and local offices and to impose dollar limits on the total contributions a person may make to all state and local candidates and political committees.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">The certified Question reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number><em>\u201cQUESTION: </em>Shall state law limit cash and in-kind contributions, for state, local office candidates, to candidates and principal campaign committees?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Petitioners Paulus and Burton, two of the measure\u2019s three chief sponsors, assert that the certified Question adequately states the measure\u2019s chief puipose. Nevertheless, in response to the other petitioners\u2019 arguments and respondent\u2019s concessions, we conclude that the certified Question must be revised. Again, we are not satisfied with any of the alternative Questions submitted by petitioners because none seems plainly to phrase the chief purpose of the measure as we understand it. Accordingly, we modify the Question to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\"><em>\u201cQUESTION: </em>Shall law limit amount of contributions and other support persons may give to state and local candidates or committees?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">As modified, the Question plainly phrases within the statutory word limitations the chief purpose of the measure so that an affirmative response to the Question corresponds to an affirmative vote on the measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">THE SUMMARY<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">The Summary must concisely and impartially summarize the measure and its major effect in not more than 85 words. ORS 250.035(1)(c). The certified Summary reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-9\"><em>\u201cEXPLANATION: </em>Amends, enacts laws. Limits cash and in-kind contributions, per election, to: $1,000 for state office candidates, $500 for local office candidates, $200 for each political committee. Limits total yearly contributions for such candidates and political committees to $20,000. Solicited endorsements count as in-kind contributions. Prohibits accepting excess amounts. Prohibits such candidates from contributing to other such candidates, political committees. Violators of limits may be fined up to $500 or three times contribution; knowing violators, $1,000 or five times contribution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>After considering each of petitioners\u2019 objections to specific portions of the certified Summary as well as respondent\u2019s concessions, we conclude that the certified Summary does not substantially comply with the requirements of ORS 250.035(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">As requested by petitioners Paulus and Burton, we strike the phrase \u201cSolicited endorsements count as \u2018in-kind\u2019 contributions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">We agree with respondent that the reach of Section 8 of the measure as applied to solicited endorsements is speculative. For the same reason, we reject the other petitioners\u2019 language designed to cover their interpretations of \u201cin-kind\u201d contributions. The examples they offer may or may not be found to be \u201cin-kind\u201d contributions in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">We accept the Deras suggestion that the Summary should accurately reflect that there are two contribution limits for different state offices, and Remington and the ACLU\u2019s suggestions that the summary should mention the possibility that a candidate\u2019s violation of the new law may result in forfeiture of the candidate\u2019s right to appear in the voters\u2019 pamphlet and the possibility of repeal of the political contribution tax credit for certain political committees.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">We modify the Summary to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\"><em>\u201cSUMMARY: </em>Limits cash and \u201cin-kind\u201d contributions and other support to candidates for election to state and local offices: $1,000 per donor to each candidate each election for named offices; $500 for other state and local offices. Limits donor\u2019s contributions and support to $20,000 yearly for all candidates and groups. No limit on gifts from political parties or to federal campaigns. Candidate may not give own campaign funds to other candidates. Provides civil fines. Violators may be barred from voters\u2019 pamphlet. Certain political committee tax credits repealed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">As modified, the Summary accommodates within the statutory word limitations all of petitioners\u2019 well-taken complaints and respondents\u2019 concessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">READABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">We next consider petitioner Deras\u2019s contention that the certified ballot title fails to comply with the readability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>standard of ORS 250.039 and OAR 165-14-045 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Under the Flesch formula, a ballot title must achieve a \u201creading ease\u201d score of not less than 60, unless this court can affirmatively find no ballot title could both achieve that score and, at the same time, meet \u201cthe needs of impartiality, conciseness and accuracy.\u201d OAR 165-14-045(2). The Flesch formula places a premium on short words and short sentences; its goal is plain and easily understood language.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Deras states that attaining a score of 60 here may be impossible because this measure is complicated and requires repeated use of multi-syllable words such as \u201ccontributions,\u201d \u201ccandidates\u201d and \u201cpolitical.\u201d The reference to several dollar amounts also drives the score down. The Flesch reading ease score for the certified ballot title is 9, indicating that the title is \u201cvery difficult to read and understand.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Deras\u2019s proposed ballot title would result in a reading ease score of 34. Our modified ballot title results in a reading ease score of 38, which we find to be the maximum score that can reasonably be achieved in this case consistent with the requirements of impartiality, conciseness and accuracy. ORS 250.039.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">In summary, we certify the following ballot title to the Secretary of State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\">\u201cLIMITS AMOUNT OF CONTRIBUTIONS AND OTHER SUPPORT TO POLITICAL CANDIDATES\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-9\"><em>\u201cQUESTION: </em>Shall law limit amount of contributions and other support persons may give to state and local candidates or committees?\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number><em>\u201cSUMMAR Y: </em>Limits cash and \u201cin-kind\u201d contributions and other support to candidates for election to state and local offices: $1,000 per donor to each candidate each election for named offices; $500 for other state and local offices.

The State Court Administrator shall issue the appellate judgment 10 days from the date of this decision, unless a petition for reconsideration is both filed with and physically received by the Office of the State Court Administrator within seven days of the date of this decision.
