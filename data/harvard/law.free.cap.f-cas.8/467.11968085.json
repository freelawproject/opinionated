She was laden with arms and munitions of war, partly at Havana and partly at Nassau, N. P., and cleared from the latter port for St. John, N. B., on the 24th of May preceding her capture. Her heading was towards the land, off Charleston, when she first discovered the blockading vessel. She then changed her course to east by north. She had been out of the port of Nassau only four or five days when she was captured. She was what is called an auxiliary steamer, using both sails and steam. No satisfactory reason is given for the position of the vessel at the time of her capture; and the inference is irresistible, from the evidence, not in dispute or doubt, that her intention was to run the blockade of Charleston, and that she was in the act of doing so when she discovered the Keystone State, and changed her course.-</p>\n<p id=\"b469-18\">Some irregularities were committed on the part of the captors, and in the proceedings on the part of the government, in the court below, which I should afford an opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>to the claimant to correct, were I not entirely-satisfied, upon the facts which are undisputed, and could not be substantially varied by any further proof offered, that the voyage was in reality intended for the port of Charleston, and not for that of St. John.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\">Decree below affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
