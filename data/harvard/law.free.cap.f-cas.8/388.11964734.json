[15 U. S.] 76; Id., 10 Wheat [23 U. S.] 306; 3 Phillim. Int. Law, p. 189, \u00a7 128; The Elsebe, 5 C. Rob. Adm. 173), and is, accordingly, chargeable with the same liabilities as if it had been owned by individuals, and had been benefited under contracts, direct or implied. Commodore Rowan, of the United States navy, the captor of this prize, was a competent agent of the United States to bind them, as owners of the property, to a fulfilment of this contract for its carriage. The United States, in relation to the proprietorship of real or personal property, have, in their public capacity, like authority and remedies, and are subject to like liabilities in dealing with it, through legal agencies, or otherwise, as natural persons, except, perhaps, in respect to the operation of laws of limitation, or rules resting upon usages under the law merchant.
