This is all he claims, and this claim the court thinks is new and . not too broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">At the time the license was given, June 15, 1853, it was only to the Chicago and Aurora Railroad Company, its successors and assigns, and the reasonable construction of the license is that it extended no further than the road then used, or which the company was then authorized to construct It did not extend to any and all lines of road which the company, under a new name and organization, might thereafter be authorized to build, to lease, or to use.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">An order must be entered referring the case to a master to report the damages, which the plaintiff has sustained, according to the principles here stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-12\">Upon the coming in of the master\u2019s report, at a subsequent term, a decree was entered for complainant for 510,020.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
