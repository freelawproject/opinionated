On appeal, Moore argues that terms within the agreement did not effectively disclaim the implied warranty of title under R.C. 1302.25 (UCC 2-312). Because R.C. 1302.25 provides for a buyer\u2019s basic needs with respect to the type of title he in good faith expects to acquire by his purchase, namely, a good, clean title transferred to him in a rightful manner, we find that the provision lacks sufficient specificity to disclaim the implied warranty of title. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">{\u00b6 2} The facts and procedural history relevant to issues raised on appeal are as follows: In October 1994, Moore drove from his Gross Isle, Michigan residence to Pro Team Corvette Sales, Inc. (\u201cPro Team\u201d), located in Napoleon, Ohio, in order to purchase a Chevrolet Corvette. On October 17, 1994, he signed an agreement to purchase a 1974 Corvette, as well as a separate agreement to trade in his 1975 Corvette. When Moore attempted to register the car with the Michigan Bureau of Motor Vehicles, he learned that the car had been reported stolen in Texas and therefore could not be registered. The Michigan State Police subsequently confiscated the car and returned it to Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">{\u00b6 3} On October 15, 1996, Moore filed suit against Pro Team, arguing that it was negligent in failing to provide good title to the vehicle. He also claimed unjust enrichment, breach of statutory warranties, and violations of Ohio\u2019s Consumer Sales Practices Act. Pro Team denied all liability, claiming that it had excluded all warranties, including the warranty of title, in the purchase agreement. Pro Team also filed a third-party complaint against the dealership that sold the car to Pro Team, as well as the person who sold the car to that dealer, the Michigan State Police, and the Sheriff of San Patricio County, Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">{\u00b6 4} In defending the suit, Pro Team relied upon language in its contract indicating that the Corvette was being sold \u201cas is\u201d and that the all warranties, including the warranty of title, were excluded from the agreement. Moore sought summary judgment, arguing that the language contained in the agreement was not sufficient to constitute a valid disclaimer of statutorily implied warranties of title. This motion was denied. Moore subsequently dismissed all counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>unrelated to the warranty provisions. In February 2002, the trial court dismissed his remaining claims, concluding that the language contained in the agreement was sufficiently specific to permit exclusion of the warranty of title under R.C. 1302.25(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">{\u00b6 5} Moore appeals from the trial court\u2019s judgment, presenting the following single assignment, of error for our review: \u201cThe trial court erred when it concluded that the dealer\u2019s contract properly excluded the warranty of title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">{\u00b6 6} In Ohio, \u201ca seller warrants that he will convey good title free from any security interest or other lien or encumbrance of which the buyer is without knowledge when the contract is made.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This implied warranty of title is codified in R.C. 1302.25, which is identical to and modeled after UCC 2-312, providing as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c(A) Subject to division (B) of this section there is in a contract for sale a warranty by the seller that:</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c(1) The title conveyed shall be good, and its transfer rightful; and</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c(2) the goods shall be delivered free from any security interest or other lien or encumbrance of which the buyer at the time of contracting has no knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c(B) A warranty under division (A) of this section will be excluded or modified only by specific language or by circumstances which give the buyer reason to know that the person selling does not claim title in himself or that he is purporting to sell only such right or title as he or a third person may have.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(C) Unless otherwise agreed a seller who is a merchant regularly dealing in goods of the kind warrants that the goods shall be delivered free of the rightful claim of any third person by way of infringement or the like but a buyer who furnishes specifications to the seller must hold the seller harmless against any such claim which arises out of compliance with the specifications.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">{\u00b6 12} Accordingly, \u201c[u]nless excluded or modified, R.C. 1302.25(A) adds to a sales contract a warranty by the seller that the title conveyed shall be good and its transfer rightful.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As provided by R.C. 1302.25(B), a warranty of title may be excluded or modified by specific language giving the purchaser reasons to know that the vendor is selling only what title he possesses. \u201c[T]his code section provides for a buyer\u2019s basic needs with respect to the type of title he in good faith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>expects to acquire by his purchase, namely, a good, clean title transferred to him in a rightful manner so that he will not be exposed to a lawsuit in order to protect it.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cIn the usual case, the buyer expects to get a good title, and regards disclaimers as affecting only risks with regard to quality.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">{\u00b6 13} The Michigan Court of Appeals, in <em>Jones v. </em>Linebaugh,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> held that \u201cvery precise and unambiguous language must be used to exclude a warranty so basic to the sale of goods as is title.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Specific language is necessary to relieve the buyer of the idea that any disclaimer of warranty relates only to quality.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>In <em>Sunseri v. RKO-Stanley Warner Theatres, Inc.,</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the court found language stating that the seller \u201cshall in nowise be * * * liable * * * upon or under guaranties [sic] or warranties * * * including, but not limited to, the implied warranty] of title\u201d lacked sufficient specificity to disclaim the warranty of title. The court reasoned that the language used was ineffective because it was \u201ccouched in negative terminology, expressing what the seller will not be liable for rather than what the buyer is or is not receiving. The inadequacy of such a caveat is best illustrated by juxtaposing it with title disclaimer provisions suggested by authorities in the subject area. For example, 18 Am.Jur.Legal Forms 2d \u00a7 253:825 (1974), provides: \u2018Seller makes no warranty as to the title to the goods, and buyer assumes all risks of nonownership of the goods by seller.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201c[W]here the language in a purported disclaimer expresses how the seller\u2019s \u2022 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>liability will be limited rather than what title (or lack thereof) the seller purports to transfer, the purported disclaimer is ineffective.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">{\u00b6 14} The relevant portion of the sale contract states: \u201cAll warranties pursuant to O.R.C. 1302.25 (U.C.C.2-312) (warranty of title and against infringement) are hereby excluded from this transaction.\u201d In light of the foregoing discussion, we find this language to be akin to that which expresses how the seller\u2019s liability will be limited, rather than what title the seller purports to transfer, and conclude that the provision lacks sufficient specificity to disclaim the implied warranty of title. Accordingly, Moore\u2019s assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">{\u00b6 15} Having found error prejudicial to the appellant herein, in the particulars assigned and argued, the judgment of the trial court is hereby reversed, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b105-8\">Shaw, P.J., and Thomas F.
