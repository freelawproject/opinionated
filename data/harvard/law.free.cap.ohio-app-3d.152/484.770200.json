(\u201cFOP\u201d), and to issue a complaint against the FOP.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-14\">{\u00b6 2} The matter was referred to a magistrate of this court pursuant to Civ.R. 53(C) and Loc.R. 12(M) of the Tenth District Court of Appeals. The parties filed agreed stipulations of fact along with the record of the administrative proceedings. The magistrate rendered a decision on December 24, 2002, recommending that this court deny relator\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus. (Attached as Appendix A.) Relator has filed an objection to the magistrate\u2019s decision, asserting that the magistrate erred in concluding that relator filed his ULP charge over 90 days after learning of his union\u2019s alleged violation of R.C. 4117.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-15\">{\u00b6 3} The magistrate\u2019s decision sets forth the following findings of fact. On December 8, 1999, relator was hired by Cleveland State University (\u201cCSU\u201d) as a part-time, temporary university police officer. On February 27, 2000, relator was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>appointed to a full-time position as a CSU police officer, subject to a one-year probationary period. On February 18, 2001, relator received an \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d written performance evaluation, and was notified at that time that his employment was terminated for \u201cunsatisfactory performance during probationary period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">{\u00b6 4} A collective bargaining agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d) between CSU and the FOP provided for a five-step grievance procedure. On February 26, 2001, relator filed a grievance under the CBA and requested that the FOP represent him. At \u201cStep 3\u201d of the procedure, involving a meeting with the university police chief, relator\u2019s grievance was denied. The FOP appealed the denial to a Step 4 hearing before a university vice-president. That hearing was conducted on April 17, 2001, and at the conclusion of the hearing, the vice-president orally informed relator that his grievance was denied. The university vice-president issued a written memorandum, dated April 17, 2001, and the memorandum indicates that it was copied to the university chief of police and FOP representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">{\u00b6 5} Relator then requested that the FOP initiate binding arbitration under Step 5. However, according to the FOP, relator\u2019s union representative, Otto Holm, notified relator on May 15, 2001, that the union had made a decision not to arbitrate his grievance. Also during this time, relator hired his own counsel, who sent CSU a letter, dated May 14, 2001, indicating relator\u2019s intent to invoke arbitration. Relator claimed, based upon an affidavit executed by his counsel, that he did not receive a copy of the April 17, 2001 CSU memorandum until September 18, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">{\u00b6 6} On November 21, 2001, relator filed a ULP charge, asserting that he was discharged without just cause and that the FOP breached its duty of fair representation by failing to pursue binding arbitration on the basis that the employee was terminable at will. A SERB labor relations specialist conducted an investigation of the ULP charge and recommended that it be dismissed. On March 25, 2002, SERB dismissed the ULP charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">{\u00b6 7} On April 30, 2002, relator filed his complaint in mandamus with this court. In the magistrate\u2019s decision recommending denial of the requested writ, the magistrate determined that SERB did not abuse its discretion in finding that the ULP charge was untimely filed, agreeing with SERB\u2019S position that the 90-day statute of limitations for the ULP action began to run at least by May 14, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">{\u00b6 8} In his objection, relator argues that he and his counsel were not aware that the CBA provided that only the union could initiate arbitration under Step 5 and that he did not initially appreciate that the FOP\u2019s withdrawal from the proceeding prejudiced his rights or interest in any manner. Relator contends that the doctrine of equitable estoppel should be available under the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>stances of this case, as he maintains that the. FOP lulled him into complacency with inaccurate assurances. Relator asserts that the charging party must appreciate the \u201cactual damage\u201d that has been caused before the 90-day limitation period begins to run.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">{\u00b6 9} Although a determination by SERB whether to issue a complaint in a ULP case is not reviewable by direct appeal, mandamus is available to remedy an abuse of discretion by SERB in dismissing ULP charges. <em>State ex rel. Tritt v. State Emp. Relations Bd., </em>97 Ohio St.3d 280, 2002-Ohio-6437, 779 N.E.2d 226, \u00b6 6. R.C. 4117.12(B) sets forth a 90-day statute of limitations for filing a ULP charge. In <em>Tritt, </em>supra, 97 Ohio St.3d at \u00b6 8, the court discussed the issue of timeliness under R.C. 4117.12(B), stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cUnder R.C. 4117.12(B), SERB \u2018may not issue a notice of hearing based upon any unfair labor practice occurring more than ninety days prior to the filing of the charge with the board.\u2019 This provision requires employees to seek prompt redress for unfair labor practices. <em>State ex rel. Grady v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 181, 184, 677 N.E.2d 343. \u2018The ninety-day time period does not commence until the charging party knew or should have known of the conduct which constituted the improper conduct and actual damage ensued.\u2019 Id., citing <em>Fraternal Order of Police, Ohio Labor Council, Inc. v. Hubbard Twp. Trustees </em>(1990), 68 Ohio App.3d 843, 847, 589 N.E.2d 1386.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">{\u00b6 11} As indicated above, the magistrate found that, by May 14, 2001, the date of relator\u2019s counsel\u2019s letter to CSU\u2019s vice-president attempting to invoke arbitration, relator knew or should have known that the FOP would not pursue his grievance to binding arbitration. The magistrate concluded that, although relator\u2019s counsel was apparently unaware, when he authored the May 14, 2001 letter, that only the FOP could initiate arbitration under the CBA, the letter nevertheless shows that relator was aware that the union would not pursue binding arbitration by that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">{\u00b6 12} Part of the record in this case includes a copy of answers provided by relator to an information-request form. In response to a question asking relator to describe what steps the union took in pursuing the grievance, relator responded in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cWhen the grievant was orally advised that the University was not reversing its decision, he requested that the Union proceed to step 5 to binding arbitration. <em>The Union refused his request </em>and told him that if he wished to pursue step 5 he could obtain his own counsel and do so at his own expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cAs a result of the conversation with Otto Holm the grievant retained counsel who submitted a written demand for arbitration. * * * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>{\u00b6 15} A review of the record supports a finding that, at the time relator\u2019s counsel submitted the letter to CSU on May 14, 2001, expressing an intent to invoke arbitration, the university had advised relator that it was not reversing its decision, and relator had also been informed that the union refused his request to submit the matter to arbitration. Thus, we agree with the magistrate that the letter established the commencement of the running of the statute of limitations. Further, we agree with respondent that any doubt relator may have harbored should have been dispelled by the union\u2019s failure, under the requirements of the CBA, to advance his grievance to Step 5 by May 16, 2001 (30 days following the date the grievance was answered in Step 4, i.e., on April 17, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">{\u00b6 16} Relator, however, argues that his attorney was unaware, at the time he mailed the May 14, 2001 letter, that only the FOP could initiate arbitration under the CBA, and relator thus contends that the doctrine of equitable estoppel should apply. We are unpersuaded. In general, \u201cignorance of legal rights does not toll a statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Larson v. Am. Wheel &amp; Brake, Inc. </em>(C.A.8, 1979), 610 F.2d 506, 510. In the present case, relator retained and consulted with counsel within the statutory period, and counsel presumably had the opportunity to review the CBA. Under such circumstances, where a party has the \u201cmeans of knowledge\u201d of his or her rights, courts have declined to extend statutes of limitations based upon estoppel grounds. <em>Edwards v. Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chem. Sales, Inc. </em>(C.A.5, 1975), 515 F.2d 1195, 1200, fn. 8 (no equitable basis for tolling of statute of limitations where appellant consulted attorney long before statutory period ran; \u201cthe very purpose of consulting an attorney is to ascertain what legal redress arises out of a factual situation encompassing a, supposed wrong\u201d). Further, an employee\u2019s misreading of his contractual rights is not a proper basis for equitable tolling. <em>Trnka v. United Auto Workers Union, Local 688 </em>(N.D.Ill.1991), No. 90 C 1073, 1991 WL 28214.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">{\u00b6 17} Because the record supports the magistrate\u2019s finding that relator knew or should have known of the union\u2019s refusal to assist him by May 2001, the magistrate correctly concluded that relator\u2019s filing of his ULP charge on November 21, 2001, was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">{\u00b6 18} Based upon an examination of the magistrate\u2019s decision and an independent review of the record, this court adopts the magistrate\u2019s decision as its own, including the findings of fact and conclusions of law contained in it. Accordingly, relator\u2019s objection to the magistrate\u2019s decision is overruled, and the requested writ of mandamus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Objection overruled and writ of mandamus denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b519-9\">Klatt and Tyack, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"A2K\">MAGISTRATE\u2019S DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"ANq\">Rendered on December 24, 2002</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">IN MANDAMUS</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">{\u00b6 19} In this original action, relator, Scott Aaron Scherfling, requests a writ of mandamus ordering respondent, State Employment Relations Board (\u201cSERB\u201d), to vacate its March 25, 2002 dismissal of his unfair labor practice (\u201cULP\u201d) charge against his union, Fraternal Order of Police, Ohio Labor Council, Inc. (\u201cFOP\u201d), to issue a complaint against the FOP, and to conduct a hearing on relator\u2019s ULP charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">{\u00b6 20} 1. Effective December 8, 1999, Cleveland State University (\u201cCSU\u201d) hired relator as a \u201ctemporary, part-time\u201d university police officer pursuant to CSU\u2019s written offer of employment dated December 8,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">{\u00b6 21} 2. Effective February 27, 2000, relator was appointed to a full-time position as a CSU police officer under a one-year (365 days) probationary period.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">{\u00b6 22} 3. Probationary police officers at CSU undergo two written performance evaluations during their probationary period. The first evaluation is at midpoint and the second is at the end of the probationary period. At midpoint, in August 2000, relator received a satisfactory evaluation indicating that his \u201c[performance meets standards and continues to become still better.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">{\u00b6 23} 4. On February 18, 2001, relator received an \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d written performance evaluation. The evaluation stated \u201cperformance is unsatisfactory; separation or reduction is recommended.\u201d The evaluation form indicated that relator\u2019s 365-day probationary period would end February 27, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">{\u00b6 24} 5. Effective February 18, 2001, CSU notified relator that his employment was terminated. The reason the notice gave was \u201cunsatisfactory performance during probationary period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-13\">{\u00b6 25} 6. In the meantime, effective January 1, 2001, a collective bargaining agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d) between CSU and the FOP provided for a five-step grievance procedure. Article XII, CBA. Step 4 provides that \u201cthe aggrieved member(s) and/or the Union may file an appeal with the University\u2019s Vice President of Human Resources Development and Labor Relations.\u201d Step 4 provides that the university vice president shall schedule a \u201cgrievance meeting\u201d and he \u201cshall render a written response * * * after the close of the meeting.\u201d Step 4 further provides that \u201c[a] copy of said response shall be sent to the grievant and the Union representative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>{\u00b6 26} 7. The CBA\u2019s Step 5 provision is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cIf the grievance is not satisfactorily settled in Step 4, the Union may submit the matter to binding arbitration by so notifying the Vice President of Human Resources Development and Labor Relations, in writing, within thirty (30) working days following the date the grievance was answered in Step 4 of the grievance procedure. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">{\u00b6 28} 8. Article XVII of the CBA is captioned \u201cPerformance Evaluation.\u201d It provides in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">{\u00b629} \u201cA law enforcement officer who receives an unsatisfactory performance rating during the probationary period may be removed or demoted for just cause in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code and Ohio Administrative Rules. * *</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">{\u00b6 30} 9. Article XXI of the CBA is captioned \u201cProbationary Period.\u201d It provides in part: \u201cThe original appointment as a University Law Enforcement Officer shall be for a probationary period of one year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">{\u00b6 31} 10. On or about February 26, 2001, relator filed a grievance pursuant to the CBA. He also requested that the FOP represent him. The Step 3 procedure involved a meeting with the university chief of police where relator was represented by the FOP. Relator\u2019s grievance was denied at Step 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">{\u00b6 32} 11. The FOP appealed pursuant to Step 4 to the university vice president. The vice president called a grievance meeting at which relator was represented by the FOP. At the conclusion of the April 17, 2001 meeting, relator was verbally advised that his grievance was denied and that there was an opportunity to pursue binding arbitration at Step 5 through his union.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-12\">{\u00b6 33} 12. The university vice president issued a written memorandum dated April 17, 2001, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b521-13\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cSince I believe that the dismissal of Officer Scherfling in no way violates the collective bargaining agreement between Cleveland State University and the CSU-FOP/OLC, the applicable laws of the State of Ohio nor the regulations in the Ohio Administrative' Code and is consistent with applicable rulings of the Ohio Attorney General and decisions of Ohio courts, the grievance related to Scott Scherfling\u2019s dismissal is denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-14\">{\u00b6 35} 13. The April 17, 2001 memorandum itself indicates that it was copied to the university chief of police and the FOP representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-15\">{\u00b6 36} 14. Relator requested that the FOP initiate binding arbitration under Step 5 of the CBA. According to the FOP, on May 15, 2001, relator was notified by his union staff representative, Otto Holm, that the FOP had made the decision not to arbitrate his grievance. Consequently, relator hired his own counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>{\u00b6 37} 15. By letter dated May 14, 2001, relator\u2019s counsel notified CSU\u2019s vice president of relator\u2019s \u201cintention to invoke * * * arbitration.\u201d Apparently, CSU did not respond to the May 14, 2001 letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">{\u00b6 38} 16. According to assertions contained in relator\u2019s brief filed in this action, on July 27, 2001, he filed an action in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas seeking a declaration that he was entitled to binding arbitration under the CBA. (Relator\u2019s brief at 5.) Relator further asserts in his brief that he voluntarily dismissed the common pleas court action on November 20, 2001, after it became clear that only the FOP could request arbitration under the CBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">{\u00b6 39} 17. According to an affidavit executed by relator\u2019s counsel on July 25, 2002, and appended to relator\u2019s brief filed in this action, on September 18, 2001, relator\u2019s counsel received from CSU\u2019s counsel a faxed copy of the April 17, 2001 CSU memorandum. According to the affidavit, neither relator nor his counsel had ever received the CSU memorandum prior to September 18, 2001. The magistrate specifically notes here that counsel\u2019s July 25, 2002 affidavit appended to relator\u2019s brief is not among the documents contained in the stipulations filed by the parties to this action, nor can the \u201cfax cover sheet\u201d dated September 18, 2001, appended to counsel\u2019s affidavit, be found among the stipulations filed in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">{\u00b6 40} 18. On November 21, 2001, relator, through counsel, filed an ULP charge with SERB against the FOP. SERB\u2019s ULP form asks the charging party to provide a \u201cstatement of facts.\u201d Relator wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">{\u00b6 41} \u201c[Relator] was discharged without just cause by the employer, Cleveland State University, at the end of his probationary period as a campus police officer. The applicable collective bargaining agreement superceded [sic] the provisions of the Ohio Revised Code and Administrative Code and expressly provided that probationary employees could only be terminated for cause. The employee\u2019s bargaining representative, the Fraternal Order of Police, breached the duty of fair representation by refusing to pursue binding arbitration on the grounds that the employee was terminable at will. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">{\u00b6 42} 19. On November 30, 2001, a SERB labor relations specialist, i.e., investigator, mailed separate letters to the charging party and the charged party requesting that the parties provide specific information regarding the ULP charge. Both relator and the FOP responded in writing requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">{\u00b6 43} 20. On February 20, 2002, SERB\u2019s labor relations specialist issued his \u201cinvestigator\u2019s memorandum\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">{\u00b6 44} \u201c* * * The Charging Party knew as of May 14, 2001, that FOP was not pursuing the grievance to arbitration * * *. No mitigating circumstances were provided to toll the statute of limitations. The charge was untimely filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>with SERB, well beyond the statute of limitations set forth in ORC \u00a7 4117.12(B) and OAC 4117-7-01(A).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">{\u00b645} 21. On March 25, 2002, SERB dismissed the unfair labor practice charge. SERB\u2019s dismissal order states:</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cPursuant to Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 4117.12, the Board has conducted an investigation of this charge. The investigation reveals no probable cause exists to believe the Charged Party has violated Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 4117.11. Information gathered during the investigation reveals the Charged Party\u2019s decision not to take the grievance to arbitration was based on contract interpretation. The Charged Party\u2019s actions were not arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith. Additionally, knowledge of the alleged violation occurred more than 90 days before the charge was filed with the Board. No mitigating circumstances exist that warrant equitable tolling of the statute of limitations. Accordingly, the charge is dismissed with prejudice for lack of probable cause to believe the statute has been violated and as untimely filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">{\u00b6 47} 22. On April 80, 2002, relator, Scott Aaron Scherfling, filed this mandamus action.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">{\u00b6 48} SERB dismissed relator\u2019s ULP charge on two grounds: (1) that the charged party\u2019s decision to not take the grievance to arbitration was not arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith; and (2) that the ULP charge was untimely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">{\u00b6 49} Because SERB did not abuse its discretion in finding that the ULP charge was untimely filed, and that finding independently supports SERB\u2019s dismissal, it is the magistrate\u2019s decision that this court deny relator\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus, as more fully explained below.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">{\u00b6 50} R.C. 4117.12(B) provides that SERB \u201cmay not issue a notice of hearing based upon any unfair labor practice occurring more than ninety days prior to the filing of the charge with the board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">{II51} The 90-day time period does not commence until the charging party knew or should have known of the conduct which constituted the improper conduct and actual damage ensued. <em>State ex rel. Tritt v. State Emp. Relations Bd., </em>97 Ohio St.3d 280, 2002-Ohio-6437, 779 N.E.2d 226; <em>State ex rel. Grady v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 181, 184, 677 N.E.2d 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-13\">{\u00b652} Here, SERB maintains that the record conclusively shows that, by May 14, 2001, relator knew or should have known that the FOP would not pursue his grievance to binding arbitration. May 14, 2001 is the date of relator\u2019s counsel\u2019s letter to CSU\u2019s vice president attempting to invoke arbitration. SERB <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>also contends that actual damages ensued as of the date of termination i.e., February 18, 2001. Thus, the later date, i.e., May 14, 2001, would begin the running of the 90-day period. Relator did not file his ULP charge until November 21, 2001, more than 90 days later. The magistrate agrees with SERB\u2019S position that the 90-day period began at least by May 14, 2001, and, thus, the ULP charge was untimely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">{\u00b6 53} Although relator\u2019s counsel was apparently unaware when he authored the May 14, 2001 letter that only the FOP could initiate arbitration under the CBA, the letter, nevertheless, shows that, by May 14, 2001, relator was aware that the FOP would not pursue binding arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">{\u00b6 54} Nevertheless, relator maintains that the 90-day period did not begin to run until September 18, 2001, the day that CSU faxed a copy of the April 17, 2001 memorandum to relator\u2019s counsel. Relator\u2019s argument is premised upon the language of Article XII of the CBA, which provides that a copy of the Step 4 decision \u201cshall be sent to the grievant and the Union representative.\u201d According to relator, the 30 \u201cworking days\u201d during which the FOP could initiate binding arbitration did not begin to run until relator, through, his counsel, received the September 18, 2001 fax.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">{\u00b6 55} The language of Article XII of the CBA does not support relator\u2019s position. Article XII provides at Step 5 that the union may submit the matter to binding arbitration \u201cwithin thirty (30) working days following the date the grievance was answered in Step 4 of the grievance procedure.\u201d Relator would apparently read into the terms of the CBA that the Step 4 grievance is not considered \u201canswered\u201d until the grievant actually receives a copy, of the written Step 4 decision; however, those terms are nowhere to be found in the CBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">{\u00b6 56} The record here shows that the Step 4 grievance was answered on April 17, 2001, the date that CSU\u2019s vice president published his memorandum and the date on which relator was verbally informed of the vice president\u2019s decision. Clearly, the record shows that the FOP considered the 30 working days to have run as of April 17, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">{\u00b6 57} Moreover, even if it can be argued that the 30 \u201cworking days\u201d did not begin to run until relator\u2019s counsel received the faxed copy of the April 17, 2001 memorandum, that proposition does not alter the fact that, by May 14, 2001, relator had clearly been informed that the FOP would not pursue binding arbitration and, thus, relator knew of the conduct which constituted the alleged improper conduct and actual damages had already ensued. <em>Tritt, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">{\u00b6 58} In short, SERB did not abuse its discretion in finding that the ULP charge was untimely filed and on that basis dismiss the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>{\u00b6 59} Accordingly, it is the magistrate\u2019s decision that this court deny relator\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">KENNETH W.
