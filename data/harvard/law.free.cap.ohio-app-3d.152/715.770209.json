Painter, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">{\u00b6 1} This case involves an owner of a small restaurant, a bankrupt vendor of automated teller machines (\u201cATMs\u201d), a leasing company that bought an ATM and leased it to the restaurant owner, and an unusual application of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>The lessor is appellant/cross-appellee Information Leasing Corporation, (\u201cILC\u201d) a subsidiary of Provident Bank; the restaurant owner is appellee/crossappellant Cathy L. Chambers, d.b.a. Maplewood Inn (\u201cChambers\u201d), and the vendor is JRA 222, Inc., d/b/a Credit Card Center (\u201cCCC\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">{\u00b6 8} This case (and dozens more) arose from the ashes of CCC\u2019s bankruptcy. CCC\u2019s sales representative had guaranteed Chambers certain revenues if she placed a leased ATM in her restaurant and allowed CCC to service it. When CCC failed to pay Chambers the guaranteed revenues, Chambers stopped making payments to ILC under the lease. ILC sued Chambers under the lease\u2019s acceleration clause for rents past due and all future rents.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">{\u00b6 4} We are asked to answer six questions. The two most important are (1) whether ILC had an obligation to \u201cmitigate\u201d its damages by repossessing and selling or renting the ATM once Chambers informed it that she no longer wanted the machine, and (2) whether CCC\u2019s sales representative was an agent of ILC under the doctrine of apparent agency. We answer the first question with an emphatic <em>yes. No </em>is the answer to the second question.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">\n<em>I. CCC\u2019s Dealings with Chambers</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">{\u00b6 5} Paul McCarthy, one of CCC\u2019s employees, approached Chambers and offered her the opportunity of installing an ATM machine in her restaurant. McCarthy guaranteed a monthly income of $200 and advertising revenue of $55. He also promised her 85 percent of the swipe fee charged to the users of the ATM. Induced by these promises, Chambers agreed to place the ATM at her business. She also admitted that she leased the ATM to make it more convenient for her customers to pay their bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">{\u00b6 6} ILC was aware that CCC\u2019s employees were making these promises. The materials provided to Chambers demonstrated that ILC did not specifically inform her that ILC was not bound by CCC\u2019s guaranteed-revenue promises. And ILC admitted that it did not make such a guarantee in the documents it provided to Chambers because its competitors did not do so. (But ILC and CCC had been negotiating an operating agreement since the beginning of 2000, which was executed in July 2000, two months after Chambers signed the lease. In that agreement, CCC agreed to verbally confirm with the lessee several items prior to each lease transaction, including the fact that CCC and ILC were neither the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>same companies nor agents of each other, and that the lessee\u2019s obligations under the lease were not predicated on either revenue levels or the lessee\u2019s receipt of payment from CCC. According to the operating agreement, CCC also agreed to provide ILC with evidence of compliance with each verbal confirmation.)</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">{\u00b6 7} McCarthy supplied Chambers with a lease application designated at the top \u201cCredit Card Center Lease Application.\u201d Nowhere did the document indicate a specific leasing company. The application identified CCC as the vendor. Chambers signed the application on March 31, 2000. That same day, a \u201cCredit Card Center Merchant Processing Agreement\u201d was \u201cmade\u201d between CCC and Chambers. That document indicated that Chambers would receive 85 percent of each customer\u2019s swipe fees. The document also made reference to the ATM lease and ownership and stated that if Chambers changed the processing of the ATM terminal during the lease, the \u201clease company mfight] call the lease due.\u201d The document named no specific leasing company. (Chambers claimed not to have signed this document until April 18, 2000.) This same document also allowed CCC to retain any money it owed Chambers to cover any delinquent lease payments owed directly to the \u201clessor of the ATM.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">{\u00b6 8} CCC forwarded the lease application to ILC. Upon approval by ILC, ILC prepared a lease and returned it to CCC to forward to Chambers for her signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">{\u00b6 9} On April 18, Chambers signed an ATM Advertising Agreement and a Merchant Information form, both containing CCC\u2019s name and addresses. Neither mentioned ILC. The second document contained an equipment and fee schedule that contained the amount of the monthly lease payments and the requirement that Chambers pay the first and last months\u2019 rent with the application, with a cheek made payable to CCC. She also signed a Merchant Processing Bonus form on CCC letterhead that guaranteed a minimum processing revenue. To qualify, Chambers had to do three things, including maintaining her lease payments or purchase arrangements. The document did not refer to ILC.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">{\u00b6 10} McCarthy also obtained Chambers\u2019s signature on ILC\u2019s lease, ILC\u2019s lease confirmation form, ILC\u2019s certificate of acceptance, and ILC\u2019s form concerning insurance on the ATM. Chambers testified that, except for the credit application, all other documents presented by McCarthy were signed on April 18, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">{\u00b6 11} Since approximately February 2000, ILC was aware that the Merchant Processing Agreement, the ATM Advertising Agreement, the Merchant Processing Bonus, and its lease agreement were being used by CCC to \u201csign up [CCC\u2019s] customers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>{\u00b6 12} George Paris, ILC\u2019s vice-president of collections and recovery, testified that ILC had no authority to control CCC\u2019s conduct in the field. According to Paris, it was standard practice \u201cwith other mid-market lessors within the equipment leasing industry\u201d to have a vendor obtain a credit application from a potential lessee and to obtain the lessee\u2019s signature on the lease when the credit application had been approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">{\u00b6 13} According to Chambers, McCarthy did not tell her to whom the credit application would be sent. McCarthy represented himself as \u201ca sales agent for the ATM,\u201d and Chambers believed that CCC and ILC were the same company. Chambers was not aware that she could have purchased the ATM instead of leasing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">{\u00b6 14} The ATM was installed. ILC then purchased the ATM from CCC and leased it to Chambers.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">\n<em>II. The Lease</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">{\u00b6 15} The lease between ILC and Chambers was a one-page, ten-paragraph document. The top of the left side of the lease contained ILC\u2019s name and address in bold type. A paragraph on the top right side of the lease explained that the lease was written in \u201cplain language\u201d and that it had legal and financial consequences. The paragraph invited the potential lessee to telephone \u201cthe leasing company\u201d before signing the document, and it provided a telephone number for the lessee to call for answers to any questions. The lease identified CCC as the vendor of the ATM and Chambers as the lessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">{\u00b6 16} The term of the lease was for 60 months and required monthly payments of $259. At the signing of the lease, the lessee was to pay certain amounts, including the first and last months\u2019 rent. (For bookkeeping convenience, CCC\u2019s employee collected and retained Chambers\u2019s first and last months\u2019 rent, which was credited to Chambers\u2019s account and used to reduce the total amount owed by ILC to CCC for the ATM. On the date she executed the lease, Chambers wrote a check to CCC for the first and last months\u2019 rent.)</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">{\u00b6 17} The second paragraph of the lease stated in bold type that the lessee could not cancel the lease for any reason. It also stated that the lessee, not the lessor, had accepted the equipment and the vendor; that the lessor was not responsible for equipment failure or the vendor\u2019s acts; that the equipment was being leased \u201cas is,\u201d and that the lessor disclaimed all express and implied warranties. The lessor assigned to the lessee any warranties it had received from the vendor and informed the lessee that it could contact the vendor for a statement of the warranties.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>{\u00b6 18} The fourth paragraph required the lessee to obtain proof of insurance for the leased equipment, with the lessor listed as the loss payee. Chambers signed a lease confirmation form that indicated, among other things, that she was to forward the certificate of insurance to ILC.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">{\u00b6 19} The sixth paragraph of the lease provided that, if the lessee defaulted, ILC could do the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(I) terminate the lease, (II) sue you for all past due payments AND ALL FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER THIS LEASE, plus the Residual Value we have placed on the equipment and other charges you owe us, (III) repossess the equipment at your expense and (IV) exercise any other right or remedy which may be available under applicable law or proceed by court action to enforce the terms of this lease or recover damages. You will also pay for our reasonable collection and legal costs. In the event of your default under this lease, we may retain any security deposits to insure your performance under this lease. * *</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">{\u00b6 21} Under its eighth paragraph, the lease was characterized as a finance lease under Article 2A of the Uniform Commercial Code (\u201cUCC\u201d). Ohio\u2019s version of the UCC is found in R.C. Chapter 1310. Consequently, by signing the lease, Chambers agreed that she had either reviewed, approved, and received a copy of the supply contract or had been informed of the identity of the supplier, that she might have rights under the supply contract, and that she could contact the supplier for a description of those rights. That same paragraph claimed that, to the extent allowed by law, Chambers waived any of her rights and remedies under Article 2A of the UCC. The paragraph also contained an agreement that the lease payments were not subject to any reductions, claims, setoffs, or defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">{\u00b6 22} The agreement concluded with an integration clause stating that the lease constituted the entire agreement \u201cand supercede[d] any prior conflicting agreements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">\n<em>III. After the Installation of the ATM</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">{\u00b6 23} Following the installation of the ATM, ILC\u2019s policy was to call the lessee to confirm that the machine had been delivered and was operating, and that the lessee understood the terms of the lease. On occasion, ILC was unable to make the contact. Because the failure to contact a lessee would delay the process of CCC getting its money from ILC, ILC\u2019s policy was to notify CCC so that CCC could make the contact. Upon CCC\u2019s making contact, a three-way telephone conversation would occur among the lessee, CCC, and ILC. An unidentified person called Chambers to determine whether the ATM was operable. She acknowledged that the ATM had been received and was working.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>{\u00b6 24} Chambers received two checks drawn on CCC\u2019s account for the guaranteed revenues. The third check bounced. Chambers claimed that she quit making the lease payments because the check had bounced. She then received a call from someone who identified himself as an employee of ILC, during which she was asked why she had failed to make her lease payments. Her reason was \u201cyour check bounced.\u201d According to Chambers, the person told her that there was \u201can encoding problem with the checks, and that it would be corrected, and that [she] should continue to send lease payments.\u201d Documentary evidence offered by Chambers indicated that some unidentified ILC employee informed Chambers that the bounced check was from CCC, not ILC, and that the employee had advised Chambers of the reissue date of the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">{\u00b6 25} From that conversation, Chambers stated, she understood that the guaranteed revenues would be coming from ILC. Chambers sent in her lease payment and again received no money on the guarantees. She then made no further lease payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">{\u00b6 26} Both Chambers and her parents requested that ILC remove the ATM. (Apparently, there was a controversy between Chambers and her parents as to who owned the Maplewood Inn. This prompted the requests by Chambers\u2019 parents.) ILC did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">\n<em>TV. The Trial Court\u2019s Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">{\u00b6 27} ILC sued Chambers, alleging that she had breached the lease by not making the required payments. It sought damages of $13,321.74 for past due and future lease payments, late charges, unpaid taxes, and the residual value of the ATM. It also sought an unspecified amount of attorney fees and the return of the ATM. Following a bench trial, the court concluded that the lease was not unconscionable because Chambers was an experienced businessperson who had knowingly and voluntarily entered into the lease. The court indicated that Chambers had been involved in the restaurant business for twelve years and had \u201ca degree of business acumen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">{\u00b6 28} The court further determined that ILC had a duty to mitigate its damages and that Chambers had failed to prove that ILC was bound by CCC\u2019s promises. It also concluded that R.C. Chapter 1310 governed the lease. It awarded ILC a total judgment of $2,896.33, limiting rental payments to the period from the inception of the lease to 90 days from Chambers\u2019s notification to ILC that she intended to breach the lease. It also awarded ILC possession of the ATM and found Chambers liable for the actual recovery and transportation of the ATM. It dismissed her counterclaims, which had been premised on agency principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>\n<em>V. The Assignments of Error on Appeal and Cross-Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">{\u00b6 29} Both ILC and Chambers have appealed. We have consolidated the appeals. ILC raises three assignments of error. It contends that the trial court abused its discretion by imposing a duty on ILC to mitigate damages when such a duty is not recognized in R.C. Chapter 1310. ILC also asserts that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to award it certain damages. In its third assignment, ILC claims that the trial court erred by failing to grant it summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">{\u00b6 30} Chambers also asserts three assignments. She claims that the trial court erred in awarding ILC the cost of retrieving the ATM and its residual value. Chambers also contends that the trial court erred by failing to award her reasonable attorney fees and expenses in connection with her discovery motion. Chambers\u2019s last assignment asserts that the trial court erred by failing to conclude that CCC and ILC were engaged in an agency relationship and by failing to issue specific findings of fact and conclusions of law to support its determination to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">\n<em>VI. ILC\u2019s Assignments of Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">\n<em>A. Was the Trial Court Wrong in Finding that ILC Should Have Minimized its Damages?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">\n<em>1. Finance Lease under Article 2A of the UCC and R.C. Chapter 1310.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">{\u00b6 31} Neither party disputes that the commercial equipment lease in this case was a finance lease that implicated R.C. Chapter 1310. A finance lease differs from other leases. It is \u201ca three-party transaction involving a manufacturer/supplier, a finance lessor (usually a financing company), and a finance lessee (the party that will use the particular personalty that is the subject of the transaction). The finance lessee selects the property that it needs from the supplier. Then either the finance lessee or the supplier approaches a financing company, which purchases the property and, in turn, leases it to the lessee. The sine qua non of a finance lease is that the finance lessor acts as the supplier of money and not as a merchant of goods.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">{\u00b6 32} Under R.C. 1310.01(A)(7), a lease is a finance lease if the lessor does not select, manufacture or supply the goods, and if the lessor acquires the goods in connection with the lease. Further, in the case of non-consumer leases, the lessee, before signing the lease, must be provided with written notice by the lessor of (1) the identity of the supplier, unless the lessee has selected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>supplier and directed the lessor to acquire the goods; (2) the lessee\u2019s entitlement to the promises and warranties under R.C. Chapter 1310 that have been provided to the lessor by the supplier or any third party in connection with or as part of the contract between the supplier and the lessor; and (3) the right of the lessee to communicate with the supplier and to receive an accurate statement of the promises and warranties, including disclaimers, limitations, and remedies. When the elements are satisfied, \u201cthe finance lessor is an \u2018outsider\u2019 with respect to the goods and is only involved as the \u2018banker\u2019 of the transaction.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">{\u00b6 33} The results of characterizing a lease as a finance lease are that the lessee becomes a beneficiary of the supplier\u2019s promises and warranties to the lessor,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that the lessee\u2019s promises under the lease become irrevocable and independent once the lessee has accepted the goods<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and no longer has the limited right to revoke the acceptance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The lessee\u2019s promises are not subject to \u201ccancellation, termination, modification, repudiation, excuse, or substitution without the consent of the party to whom [they] run.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, the lessee\u2019s promise to pay rent is \u201cirrevocable and independent of any conditions as a matter of statutory law.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In other words, \u201cIn a non-consumer lease that qualifies as a finance lease under Article 2A, a lessee who has accepted the goods will have to pay the full rent come \u2018hell or high water,\u2019 as long as he has no right to revoke acceptance.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The lessee may, however, assert \u201ccertain defenses such as fraud or duress [and the law relative to principal and agent, estoppel and misrepresentation] pursuant to general principles of law and equity.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cHell or high water\u201d clauses \u201care standard in [commercial] finance leases because the quality of the leased goods is the responsibility of the supplier whose warranties extend through the lease to the lessee.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>\n<em>2. Minimization of Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">{\u00b6 34} In its first assignment, ILC challenges the trial court\u2019s application of the doctrine of mitigation of damages when R.C. Chapter 1310 did not mandate its application. In its second assignment, it challenges the measure of damages based on the trial court\u2019s failure to apply R.C. Chapter 1310. We address these assignments together.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">{\u00b6 35} Before we begin our analysis, we underscore that what is being challenged is the application of the principle of minimization of damages, which differs from mitigation of damages.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The principle of mitigation of damages \u201callows the defendant to reduce the amount of damages for which it is liable by showing extenuating facts or circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In contrast, the duty to minimize damages, also known as the avoidable consequences rule, requires the plaintiff to \u201cuse reasonable care to avoid loss.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, the defendant cannot be charged with damages that the plaintiff \u201cmight have avoided with reasonable effort without undue risk, expense, or humiliation,\u201d because such harm either was not caused by the defendant or need not have been caused by the defendant.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">\n<em>3. The Contractual Remedy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">{\u00b6 36} Freedom of contract is the basic emphasis of Article 2A of the UCC and R.C. Chapter 1310. Thus, \u201cmost of the provisions of Article 2A can be \u2018drafted out\u2019 of an agreement, so with few exceptions Article 2A serves mainly to fill gaps that the parties did not expressly cover.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Consequently, the parties are free to draft their \u201cown default and remedies sections even if different from Article 2A standards.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">{\u00b6 37} This is an unusual case because normally a lessor would repossess equipment to ensure that it is properly kept and maintained. Here, the lessee requested that the lessor arrange to remove the ATM, but the lessor refused to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>do so. Although ILC argues that it should have been awarded all past and future rents because R.C. Chapter 1310 did not require it to repossess and/or dispose of the ATM, the issue in this case, at least initially, involves a specific contractual provision agreed to by the parties \u2014 the acceleration clause. Before we look to the applicability of minimization principles to any of the remedies provisions in R.C. Chapter 1310, we must determine whether the contract\u2019s acceleration clause was enforceable. If it was, there is no need to apply the \u201cgap filling\u201d remedies of R.C. Chapter 1310.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">{\u00b6 38} The lease agreement allowed ILC to accelerate the lease payments and to repossess the ATM. It also contained a provision stating that the lease payments were not subject to any setoffs or defenses. The lease contained no requirement that ILC minimize its damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">{\u00b6 39} In Ohio, \u201c[acceleration clauses in leases have generally been upheld as long as the lease also requires the lessor to mitigate [minimize] damages.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In the leading case, <em>Frank Nero Auto Lease, Inc. v. Townsend,</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the motor vehicle lease agreement allowed the lessor to accelerate lease payments and to repossess the car. The default provision allowed the lessor to relet or resell the car and collect rents for the entire lease term, thus allowing double payment for the leased car. The court concluded that the clause was against public policy because it bore \u201cno reasonable relationship to the damages incurred.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It held that the lease provision was invalid and unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">{\u00b6 40} In calculating the correct measure of damages where an acceleration clause was found to be unenforceable, the court looked to damages principles applied to bailment and real property cases. It held that where a vehicle is repossessed, the damages consist of all the unpaid rent that had accrued at the time of the repossession, plus interest on those rent payments, and the cost of repossession.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">{\u00b6 41} In <em>Telmark, Inc. v. </em>Liff,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> a case involving a lease entered into after R.C. Chapter 1310 had become effective, the lessor sought damages under an acceleration clause in its lease for a \u201cno-til planter,\u201d after it had repossessed the planter. That acceleration clause required the lessor to minimize its damages by releasing or reselling the equipment. After repossession, the lessor failed to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>lease or sell the planter for two years. The appellate court determined that the lessor was not entitled to the full amount under the acceleration clause because it had failed to minimize its damages. But it concluded that the trial court had erred by awarding no damages at all. Recognizing that a plaintiffs failure to minimize its damages only precludes it from recovering damages that it could have avoided by minimization, the appellate court decreased the full amount due under the acceleration clause by the amount that the lessor could have avoided in damages by minimization. The appellate court in <em>Telmark </em>made no reference to Article 2A of the UCC or to R.C. Chapter 1310.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">{\u00b6 42} <em>Tokai Financial Services v. Mathews, Gallovic, Granito &amp; </em>Co.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> involved an equipment lease that contained an acceleration clause that required the lessor to sell or find a new lease upon the return or repossession of the equipment. The appellate court concluded, \u201cBy the inclusion of such a mitigation clause, a rational relationship between the impact of the acceleration clause and the actual damages sustained is assured. Accordingly the acceleration clause was enforceable as it included a clause obligating the lessor to mitigate its damages.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The court recognized that \u201c[a]t common law and under the U.C.C., the lessor must use reasonable efforts to mitigate its ordinary and expected damages.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">{\u00b6 43} Ohio is not the only state that has concluded that an acceleration clause does not abrogate the common-law duty to minimize damages. Idaho recognized the duty of a lessor to minimize its damages in <em>Industrial Leasing Corporation v. </em>Thomason.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In that case, the court held that such a rule \u201cdiscourage[s] idleness of productive property and [is] in keeping with the generally accepted damages rules in other commercial law transactions.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The Idaho Supreme Court has reaffirmed this holding as recently as 1996.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Other courts ruling the same way include New York<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and Washington.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>{\u00b6 44} We conclude that, under Ohio common law, the acceleration clause in this lease agreement was not enforceable as a matter of public policy because it failed to include an obligation on the part of ILC to minimize its damages. Because the acceleration clause was unenforceable, we must look to R.C. Chapter 1310 to determine what remedies and damages were available to ILC as a result of Chambers\u2019s failure to make the lease payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">\n<em>4. Application of R.C. Chapter 1310 Remedies</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">{\u00b6 45} The application of R.C. Chapter 1310 requires us to address ILC\u2019s contention that because it had no duty under that chapter to repossess and dispose of the ATM, it had no duty to minimize its damages. While we recognize that the rights of repossession and disposition of leased goods under R.C. Chapter 1310 are permissive and not mandatory, we hold that the enactment of R.C. Chapter 1310 did not displace the concept of minimization of damages. We premise our holding on two theories. First, the specific remedy provisions of R.C. Chapter 1310 are written as if the lessor had minimized its damages. Second, the general principles contained in R.C. Chapter 1301, which apply to R.C. Chapter 1310, incorporate the principle of minimization.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">{\u00b6 46} R.C. 1310.69 provides an index of the lessor\u2019s remedies and damages on the lessee\u2019s default. R.C. 1310.73, 1310.74, and 1310.75 provide the means to calculate the lessor\u2019s damages when the lessee\u2019s default has been material. A material default includes the failure to make lease payments.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> R.C. 1310.69(B) provides a remedy when the lessor does not fully exercise its rights or obtain a remedy under specific sections of R.C. Chapter 1310. While there is no \u201cduty\u201d to minimize damages under R.C. Chapter 1310, at least two of the three specific provisions presuppose the lessor\u2019s disposal of the goods and contain the minimization principle in the calculation of applicable damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">{\u00b6 47} Under R.C. 1310.73, it is assumed that the lessor will repossess the goods and dispose of them by a lease that is made in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner and that is substantially similar to the original lease. The damages provided include, in part, accrued and unpaid rent as of the date of the commencement of the new lease and \u201c[t]he present value, as of the same date, of the total rent for the then remaining lease term of the original lease agreement minus the present value, as of the same date, of the rent under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>new lease agreement applicable to that period of the new lease term that is comparable to the then remaining term of the original lease agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">{\u00b6 48} Similarly, R.C. 1310.74 applies to situations where there has also been repossession. Under that provision, the lessor retains the goods, disposes of the goods by some means other than a lease, or re-leases the goods under a lease that is not substantially similar to the original lease. The damages in this provision include accrued and unpaid rent \u201cas of the date of the default, if the lessee has never taken possession of the goods or, if the lessee has taken possession of the goods, as of the date the lessor repossesses the goods or an earlier date on which the lessee makes a tender of the goods to the lessor\u201d and the \u201cpresent value as of the date determined [above] of the total rent for the then remaining lease term of the original lease agreement minus the present value as of the same date of the market rent at the place where the goods are located computed for the same lease term.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">{\u00b6 49} If that measure of damages fails to place the lessor in as good a position as performance under the lease would have, the lessor can collect as damages \u201cthe present value of the profit, including reasonable overhead, the lessor would have made from full performance by the lessee, together with any [allowed] incidental damages * * *, due allowance for costs reasonably incurred, and due credit for payments or proceeds of disposition.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> This measure of damages generally applies to a loss-volume lessor or a lessor who has specialty goods that cannot be re-leased, i.e., a display sign made for a specific company.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> A lessor who buys the goods only after obtaining a lease is a loss-volume lessor where \u201cit would have had an additional lease had the repudiating lessee not repudiated.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> In other words, the lessor must have had the capacity to make an additional profitable lease and would have done so absent the lessee\u2019s breach.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">{\u00b6 50} Under R.C. 1310.75, the lessor may sue for rent. Under this provision, if the lessor holds for the remaining lease term any goods that have been identified in the lease agreement and that are in its control, it may collect the following damages. If the goods have been accepted by the lessee and not repossessed by or tendered to the lessor, the lessor may recover accrued and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>unpaid rent as of the date of judgment in its favor, the present value as of the judgment date of the rent for the remaining lease term and any incidental damages minus expenses saved as a result of the default.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> If, after a reasonable effort, the lessor is unable to dispose of goods identified in the lease at a reasonable price or circumstances indicate that it would be futile to do so, the lessor may collect accrued and unpaid rent as of the date of the judgment, the present value, as of that date, of the rent for the remainder of the lease term, and incidental damages.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">{\u00b6 51} If the goods are disposed of before collection of a judgment for damages and the disposition is before the end of the lease term, R.C. 1310.73 or 1310.74 applies, and the lessor must provide a credit against the judgment to the extent the judgment amount exceeds the recovery available under those sections.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> If the lessee pays a judgment of damages under R.C. 1310.75(A), it is entitled to use and possess the goods for the remainder of the lease term, if they have not been disposed of.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> If a lessor is not entitled to rent, its damages must be calculated for nonacceptance under R.C. 1310.73 or 1310.74.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">{\u00b6 52} According to one commentator, the language \u201cnot repossessed or tendered to the lessor\u201d is in R.C. 1310.75 to make lessors minimize their-damages.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Under 2A-529(1)(b) of the UCC and R.C. 1310.75(A)(1), \u201cif the goods are in the possession of or available to the lessor, and if they have some reasonable lease or sale possibility, the lessor is under a duty to make such a sale or lease. Failing so to re-lease or sell, the lessor loses the rents that it could otherwise recover from the lessee. This section is a large incentive to the lessor to mitigate.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">{\u00b6 53} Official Comment One to Article 2A-529 of the UCC, the counterpart to R.C. 1310.75, is also instructive. This damages provision is proper \u201conly if the lessee retains possession of the goods or the lessor is or apparently will be unable to dispose of them at a reasonable price after reasonable effort. There is no general right in a lessor to recover the full rent from the lessee upon holding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>goods for the lessee. If the lessee tenders goods back to the lessor, and the lessor refuses to accept tender, the lessor -will be limited to the damages it would have suffered had it taken back the goods. * * * In a lease, the lessor always has a residual interest in the goods which the lessor usually realizes upon at the end of a lease term by either sale or a new lease. Therefore, it is not a substantial imposition on the lessor to require it to take back and dispose of the goods if the lessee chooses to tender them back before the end of the lease term; the lessor will merely do earlier what it would have done anyway, sell or relet the goods.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">{\u00b6 54} An action to recover the rent due under the contract is an extraordinary remedy.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> This is because the lessee does not become the true owner of the goods even when it pays the entire rent under the lease agreement.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> When the lessee breaches the lease agreement, the lessor has the right to repossess the goods. To hold the lessee liable for the entire rent due would penalize the lessee out of proportion to the damage to the lessor and would give a windfall to the lessor, who can re-lease or sell the goods.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Thus, an action for rent is limited, unless otherwise agreed, to situations where the lessee intends to retain the goods and the lessor does not repossess them, where conforming goods are lost or damaged after the lessee has assumed the risk of loss, and where the lessor is unable to dispose of the goods after a reasonable effort.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">{\u00b6 55} Finally, under R.C. 1310.69(B), if the lessor does not fully exercise a right of possession or disposal or obtain a remedy to whiqh it is entitled under R.C. 1310.69, the lessor \u201cmay recover the loss resulting in the ordinary course of events from the lessee\u2019s default as determined in any reasonable manner, together with incidental damages, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessee\u2019s default.\u201d This catch-all provision allows a court to craft a proper remedy when the others are unavailable or do not serve to make the lessor whole. The only restraint on the trial court is that the damages must be calculated in a reasonable manner. Obviously, the application of the common-law principle of minimization would not be unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">{\u00b6 56} Even if the remedies and damages provisions of R.C. Chapter 1310 did not specifically incorporate the minimization principle, that principle is embedded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>in the general provisions found in R.C. Chapter 1301.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> R.C. 1310.01(D) states that the terms and principles in R.C. Chapter 1301 are applicable to R.C. Chapter 1310. R.C. 1301.03 states that unless a particular provision displaces principles of law, those principles supplement the provisions. R.C. 1301.06 provides that the remedies of R.C. Chapter 1310 are to be \u201cliberally administered to the end that the aggrieved party may be put in as good a position as if the other party had fully performed, but neither consequential or special nor penal damages may be had except as specifically provided [in R.C. Chapter 1310] or by other rule of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">{\u00b6 57} Official Comment One to 1-106 of the UCC states that the purpose of this section, in part, is \u201cto make it clear that compensatory damages are limited to compensation. They do not include consequential or special damages, or penal damages; and the Act elsewhere makes it clear that damages must be minimized.\u201d The comment then cites to several sections of the UCC, including Section 1-203 (which is R.C. 1301.09). R.C. 1301.09 imposes an obligation of good faith in the enforcement of every contract or duty within R.C. Chapter 1310. \u201cGood faith\u201d is defined in R.C. 1310.01(C)(2) as it is in R.C. 1302.01: \u201chonesty in fact and observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade.\u201d These provisions demonstrate that the UCC and Ohio\u2019s adoption of it have not abrogated the principle of minimization.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">{\u00b6 58} Thus, we conclude that both common law and R.C. Chapter 1310 require a lessor to minimize its damages. We overrule ILC\u2019s first assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">\n<em>B. What Was the Correct Measure of Damages?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">{\u00b6 59} The unique facts in this case involve a situation where the lessee offered the return of the leased equipment to the lessor by requesting several times that the lessor make arrangements to retrieve the ATM. The lessor refused to do so. These facts do not fall directly under R.C. 1310.73 or 1310.74, each of which presupposes possession and subsequent disposal or retention. ILC argues that it was entitled to damages under the acceleration clause as allowed by R.C. 1310.75. But damages did not fall under R.C. 1310.75 because ILC did not repossess the ATM, and because the evidence demonstrates that Chambers did not intend to retain the ATM, choosing instead to make it available to ILC. This is not one of those extraordinary cases to which R.C. 1310.75 applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>{\u00b6 60} The trial court measured damages as allowed under <em>Frank Nero Auto Lease, Inc. v. Townsend.</em><footnotemark><em>51</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It held Chambers liable for rental payments from the inception of the lease to 90 days from her notice of her intent to breach the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">{\u00b6 61} This measure of damages was not based on any of the provisions of R.C. Chapter 1310. This was wrong. ILC\u2019s damages should have been based on R.C. 1310.74(A), as provided by R.C. 1310.75(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">{\u00b6 62} By refusing to obtain the ATM after it was available, ILC should have been treated as a lessor who had retained the goods. Thus, ILC was entitled to accrued and unpaid rent as of the date Chambers made the ATM available to ILC, July 10, 2001, the day her attorney sent the letter requesting its retrieval. It was also entitled to the present value on that date of the total rent for the remaining term of the original lease minus the present value on the same date of the market rent at the place where the goods were located (Athens, Ohio), computed for the same lease term. ILC was also entitled to any incidental damages allowed under R.C. 1310.76, minus expenses saved in consequence of Chambers\u2019s default. Market-rent proof is recognized under R.C. 1310.53. Present value is defined in R.C. 1310.01(A)(21).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">{\u00b6 63} Simply stated, the lessor, ILC, was entitled to the unpaid rent and the present value of the future rent, less the value of the ATM, plus any incidental damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">{\u00b6-64} Although ILC has not explicitly challenged the amount of the award, such a challenge is implicitly raised in its second assignment, which concerns the trial court\u2019s failure to award it damages under R.C. Chapter 1310. Because the trial court failed to use the correct measure of damages, a new hearing on the assessment of damages is required. We must remand this case with instructions that the trial court make a determination in accordance with the correct measure of damages. Accordingly, we sustain ILC\u2019s second assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">\n<em>C. Did the Trial Court Err by Not Granting ILC Summary Judgment?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">{\u00b6 65} In its third assignment, ILC argues that the trial court erred by not granting it summary judgment for the accelerated rent as a result of Chambers\u2019 breach of the lease. Based on our disposition of ILC\u2019s first assignment, we find no merit in this assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">\n<em>VII. Chambers\u2019s Cross-Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AA3S\">\n<em>A. Transportation Costs and Residual Value</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b765-12\">{\u00b6 66} Chambers\u2019s first assignment in her cross-appeal asserts that the trial court erred in awarding ILC the cost of transporting the ATM when it had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>not been removed and the residual value of the ATM where the value had not been proved. R.C. 1310.76 allows as incidental damages \u201cany commercially reasonable charges, expenses, or commissions incurred * * * in the transportation * * * of goods after the lessee\u2019s default, in connection with the return or disposition of the goods, or otherwise in connection with the default.\u201d In this situation, because ILC had not yet repossessed or disposed of the ATM, it had not <em>incurred </em>the expenses of the ATM\u2019s transportation. Further, ILC had not sought incidental damages in its complaint. Thus ILC was not entitled to be paid for coming and getting the ATM because it never came and got it.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">{\u00b6 67} Chambers also challenges the residual value of $972.70. Under the lease, Chambers was obligated to reimburse ILC for the residual value of the machine. But it was ILC\u2019s burden to prove the amount of damages with reasonable certainty.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> The evidence at trial was that the ATM, at the time it was delivered to Chambers, had a manufacturer\u2019s price of $4,500. ILC had paid $11,000 for it. The value of ATMs like the one that had been leased by Chambers has decreased due to technological changes. ILC currently can sell an ATM in the market for $500 to $1,700 depending on its condition. There was no evidence as to the condition of the ATM, and no evidence whatever of the amount of $972.70, except that that amount was stated in the complaint, which is not evidence. Based on the evidence, we conclude that ILC failed to meet its burden. Thus, we sustain Chambers\u2019s first assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">\n<em>B. Attorney Fees for Discovery Violation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">{\u00b6 68} In her second assignment, Chambers contends that the trial court erred in not awarding her reasonable attorney fees and expenses on her discovery motion. This assignment is based on the failure of opposing counsel to provide a witness for a scheduled deposition due to his recording of the deposition on the wrong date. Opposing counsel subsequently appeared with the witness for a deposition in the Athens, Ohio, office of Chambers\u2019s attorney. Chambers moved for discovery sanctions under Civ.R. 37(D) and (B). ILC opposed the motion, and Chambers replied. The total amount sought was $1,269.80. The trial court failed to rule on Chambers\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">{\u00b6 69} Civ.R. 37(D) mandates that when a corporate officer fails to appear for a deposition after proper notice, the court \u201cshall\u201d require the officer, his or her advising attorney or both \u201cto pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees caused by the failure, unless the court expressly finds that the failure was substantially justified or that the circumstances make an award of expenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>unjust.\u201d Thus, \u201c[t]he language of Civ.R. 37(D) mandates an order of reasonable expenses unless the trial court makes an express finding indicating otherwise.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Here, it would have been reasonable for the trial court to conclude that providing the witness at Chambers\u2019s attorney\u2019s office in Athens made the violation moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">{\u00b6 70} In this case, the court failed to rule on the motion. Generally, when a trial court fails to rule on a pretrial motion, it is presumed to have overruled it.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> And, by overruling the motion for discovery sanctions, the trial court would, under Civ.R. 37(D) have needed to make express findings that the failure of ILC\u2019s officer to attend his deposition was substantially justified or that an award of reasonable expenses was unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">{\u00b6 71} But there is another general legal principle that is applicable under these facts, because Chambers failed to bring to the trial court\u2019s attention its failure to rule on her motion. \u201cAn appellate court need not consider any error which the complaining party could have, but did not, call to the trial court\u2019s attention at a time when the error could have been avoided or corrected by the trial court.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Because Chambers failed to bring to the trial court\u2019s attention its failure to rule on her motion and the need to make express findings if it overruled her motion, we conclude that her second assignment is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">\n<em>C. Apparent Agency</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">{\u00b6 72} In her third assignment, Chambers contends that the trial court erred by concluding that McCarthy was not an agent of ILC under the theory of apparent agency, and by failing to make specific findings as to the elements of apparent agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">{\u00b6 73} Obviously, if ILC had a principal-agent relationship with McCarthy and CCC, it might be liable for all the promises and guarantees of the bankrupt company.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">{\u00b6 74} The trial court provided six pages of findings of fact and conclusions of law. Civ.R. 52 mandates that a trial court enter written findings of fact and conclusions of law if, following a bench trial, one of the parties requests them. The purpose of the rule is to adequately allow the reviewing court in \u201cdetermining the validity of the trial court\u2019s judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Chambers\u2019s claim is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>that the findings of fact and conclusions of law were insufficient because the trial court failed to make a specific finding on each of the elements of apparent agency. We do not read Civ.R. 52 so narrowly under these facts. \u201cA trial court ruling which recites various facts and a legal conclusion satisfies the requirements of Civ.R. 52 where, when considered in conjunction with other parts of the trial record, an adequate basis exists upon which an appellate court may conduct its review.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> We can tell from its findings of fact in this case what the trial court considered persuasive \u2014 the language of the lease contract itself. Further, this is not a case where appellate review turns on whether the trial court relied on or disregarded incompetent evidence in reaching its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">{\u00b6 75} That having been said, we turn to the merits of the trial court\u2019s conclusion that McCarthy (and, hence, CCC) was not ILC\u2019s agent for the purpose of his revenue and advertising guarantees.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">{\u00b6 76} Chambers\u2019s theory is that but for the guaranteed revenues, she would not have entered the lease. We have no doubt that is probably the case. Because she believes that CCC and ILC were one and the same, she argues that ILC should have been held liable for the promises made by CCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">{\u00b6 77} In Ohio, \u201cin order for a principal to be bound by the acts of his agent under the theory of apparent agency, evidence must affirmatively show: (1) that the principal held the agent out to the public as possessing sufficient authority to embrace the particular act in question, or knowingly permitted him to act as having such authority, and (2) that the person dealing with the agent knew of those facts and acting in good faith had reason to believe that the agent possessed the necessary authority.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Chambers, as the \u201cparty asserting the existence of an agency relationship, b[ore] the burden of proof.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> \u201cA principal and agent relationship exists \u2018when one party exercises the right of control over the actions of another, and those actions are directed toward the attainment of an objective which the former seeks.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Chambers alleges that ILC fraudulently induced her into entering the lease by guaranteeing certain revenue. By doing so, Chambers is seeking, in effect, to rescind the lease. Thus, we must determine if Chambers demonstrated that ILC held CCC (and, hence, McCarthy) out to the public as having the authority to guarantee revenues on ILC\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>{\u00b6 78} The following facts are undisputed. McCarthy met with Chambers approximately a week before April 18, 2000. (Based on the March 31, 2000, date on the lease application and the Merchant Processing Agreement, that is most likely the date of the first meeting.) There was little conversation, according to Chambers, but she signed the lease application that day. The lease application was provided by CCC and designated as a CCC lease application. It contained no mention of ILC. The lease indicated that she was applying for credit for a business purpose and that CCC was a vendor. Also, the day that Chambers signed the application, McCarthy left her a CCC advertisement on which he had written the guaranteed revenues.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">{\u00b6 79} McCarthy did not inform her to whom the application would be forwarded. He returned on April 18 with ILC\u2019s lease agreement and the accompanying documents, and CCC\u2019s forms, including the numbers for the guaranteed revenues. Chambers claims that she was fraudulently induced to sign the lease because (1) McCarthy did not tell her that ILC was a corporate entity separate from CCC; and (2) she believed the companies were the same because (a) she was not told otherwise, (b) McCarthy used \u201cwe\u201d when he referred to the lease and the guarantees, and (c) McCarthy said that he was a salesperson for the ATM. Chambers also testified that the guaranteed revenues were intended to induce her to sign the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">{\u00b6 80} At the time Chambers signed the lease, ILC was one of 15 leasing companies that CCC used. ILC had no right to control CCC\u2019s conduct in the field. It was aware that CCC had programs available to its ATM users that provided payments to them, including various components of revenue, and ILC\u2019s witness had heard from someone other than CCC that CCC had promised potential lessees up to $200 monthly if the lessees signed leases. One of the reasons that it did not specifically inform lessees that it was not bound by CCC\u2019s promises was that other leasing companies did not. It is undisputed that ILC and CCC had entered into an agreement <em>after </em>Chambers\u2019s lease was executed to ensure that lessees were aware that CCC\u2019s inducements and ILC\u2019s leases were two separate and distinct transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">{\u00b6 81} Further, at the time Chambers entered into the lease, ILC was unaware of any circumstances that would have led it reasonably to conclude that CCC did not intend to honor its agreement with Chambers.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">{\u00b6 82} CCC submitted Chambers\u2019s lease application to ILC for approval. Only ILC could approve the lease. Once ILC approved Chambers\u2019s application, CCC delivered the lease agreement and other documents to Chambers for her signature. CCC then returned the lease and its related documents to ILC. ILC executed the lease. According to Paris, this was \u201ceveryday industry standard practice in the vendor leasing area.\u201d Chambers paid the first and last months\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>rent under the lease by a check made payable to the order of CCC, and that payment was credited to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">{\u00b6 83} If we assume for purposes of argument only that CCC was a limited agent of ILC for the purposes of transferring documents to and from prospective lessees, we must determine whether the above facts established that CCC\u2019s authority was extended under the doctrine of apparent authority to make promises of guaranteed revenue on ILC\u2019s behalf. If it was, ILC was bound by McCarthy\u2019s promises. But \u201ca finding of agency by apparent authority or agency by estoppel must be based upon words or conduct by the principal. * * * The assurances of one who assumes to act as an agent of his authority to bind another are not, standing alone, sufficient to prove his agency.\u201d The putative agent cannot create apparent agency alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">{\u00b6 84} Chambers claims fraudulent inducement, which requires that the following be shown: \u201c(1) an actual or implied false representation concerning a fact or, where there is a duty to disclose, concealment of a fact, material to the transaction; (2) knowledge of the falsity of the representation or such recklessness or utter disregard for its truthfulness that knowledge may be inferred; (3) intent to induce reliance on the representation; (4) justifiable reliance; and (5) injury proximately caused by the reliance.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> In this case, the fraudulent inducement was allegedly the guaranteed revenues.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">{\u00b6 85} There was no evidence that ILC made the representation that ILC and CCC were the same company. There was no evidence that Chambers\u2019s decision to enter into the lease was based on the companies\u2019 being the same company. At the time Chambers was dealing with McCarthy, she believed that he was the sales representative for the ATM.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">{\u00b6 86} There was no evidence at the time Chambers entered into the lease that CCC was to do anything other than serve as a conduit of lease forms between several leasing firms, including ILC, and potential lessees. The evidence showed that McCarthy \u201cat most, was a limited or special agent <em>only </em>acting as a loan-referral source\u201d for ILC.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> In this capacity, McCarthy had no power to bind ILC to a loan agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">{\u00b6 87} In summary, the evidence presented by Chambers was that ILC furnished CCC with the forms it customarily used in its business. \u201cThis fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>alone, however, [was] insufficient to establish an agency relationship * * *. Such a practice is common in the commercial community.\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">{\u00b6 88} The lease clearly indicated that CCC was the vendor, that ILC was the lessor, and that Chambers was the lessee. It stated that ILC was not responsible for the vendor\u2019s acts. It also provided that the lease constituted the entire agreement between the lessee and the lessor. There was no evidence that McCarthy represented that the companies were the same or that ILC was aware that he was doing so. In our view, the trial court was correct in concluding that Chambers had failed to demonstrate that CCC had sufficient apparent authority to make guaranteed promises of revenue on behalf of ILC, or that she had reason to believe that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">{\u00b6 89} Further, even if ILC could have been held liable for McCarthy\u2019s representations under the doctrine of apparent agency, Chambers would not have prevailed under her claim of fraudulent inducement. The evidence failed to demonstrate that, at the time McCarthy presented the lease to Chambers, the guarantees were false, or that he had possessed actual fraudulent intent.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> The only evidence was that sometime after Chambers entered into the service agreement with CCC and the lease with ILC, CCC defaulted on paying the guaranteed revenues and later filed for bankruptcy. Thus, we conclude that Chambers failed to demonstrate fraudulent inducement. We overrule Chambers\u2019s third assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">\n<em>VIII. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">{\u00b6 90} The trial judge got it mainly right. We affirm the judgment for ILC insofar as it concerns Chambers\u2019s underlying liability for damages. But, as to the appeal numbered C-0200461, we reverse that part of the trial court\u2019s judgment (1) awarding ILC transportation costs, and (2) awarding ILC the residual value of the ATM, as that value was not proved. As to the appeal numbered C-020436, we vacate that part of the judgment awarding damages to ILC in the amount of $2,896.33. We remand the case for a recomputation of the damage award and late fees using the measure of damages under R.C. 1310.74. The trial court may in its discretion receive additional evidence as to damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b771-9\">Hildebrandt, P.J., and Sundermann, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b755-12\">.
