Welch, who admitted fault for the accident, was uninsured. At the time of the accident, plaintiff was employed by a subsidiary of Ralston Purina Co. (\u201cRalston\u201d), although she was not riding in a company vehicle nor acting within the scope of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">{\u00b6 3} In October 2000, plaintiff notified Ralston that, pursuant to <em>Scott Pontzer v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 660, 710 N.E.2d 1116, she would be pursuing a claim for uninsured motorist benefits against a business automobile policy issued by Travelers to Ralston and its subsidiaries. This policy provides $2,000,000 in liability coverage but carries a matching $2,000,000 deductible. Under the deductible provision, Travelers is required to \u201cpay any part or all of the deductible amount to effect settlement of any claim or suit,\u201d and Ralston would reimburse Travelers for such amounts. On February 26, 2001, plaintiff brought a claim against Travelers in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas seeking to recover uninsured motorist coverage under the insurance policy issued to Ralston. On March 8, 2002, Travelers moved for summary judgment on the grounds that it had offered, and Ralston had expressly rejected the inclusion of uninsured/underinsured motorist (\u201cUM/UIM\u201d) coverage in the policy at issue; it was not required to offer UM/UIM coverage in the policy pursuant to former R.C. 3937.18,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as the matching deductible provision in the policy rendered Ralston <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>self-insured; and plaintiffs seven-year delay in notifying Travelers of its claim breached notice and subrogation provisions in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">{\u00b6 4} On May 7, 2002, the trial court issued a decision and judgment entry granting Travelers\u2019 motion for summary judgment. In so doing, the trial court held that Ralston\u2019s rejection of UM/UIM coverage in the policy was invalid because Travelers\u2019 offer of such coverage had failed to delineate the premium for such coverage as required under <em>Linko v. Indemn. Ins. Co. of N. Am. </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 445, 449, 739 N.E.2d 338. Nonetheless, the trial court went on to hold that the policy was not subject to the requirements of former R.C. 3937.18, because the matching deductible provision in the policy effectively rendered Ralston self-insured. The trial court did not address Travelers\u2019 argument that plaintiff had violated the policy\u2019s notice and subrogation provisions. Plaintiff appeals from the judgment of the trial court assigning the following error:</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of plaintiff-appellant in sustaining defendant-appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the grounds that Travelers\u2019 insured was self-insured \u2018in a practical sense\u2019 and therefore Travelers policy is exempted from the operation of R.C. 3937.18.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">{\u00b6 6} Because plaintiffs assignment of error arises out of the trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment, we review the trial court\u2019s determination independently and without deference. <em>Brown v. Scioto Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 704, 711, 622 N.E.2d 1153. In conducting our review, we apply the same standard as the trial court, <em>Maust v. Bank One Columbus, N.A. </em>(1992), 83 Ohio App.3d 103, 107, 614 N.E.2d 765: In accordance with Civ.R. 56, summary judgment may only be granted if, viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, no genuine issue of fact exists, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and reasonable minds can only come to a conclusion which is adverse to the nonmoving party. <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">{\u00b6 7} Plaintiffs lone assignment of error challenges the trial court\u2019s determination that Ralston was self-insured and that its policy with Travelers was, therefore, not subject to the requirements of former R.C. 3937.18. Former R.C. 3937.18 provided: \u201cNo automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policy of insurance * * * shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state * * * unless both * * * [UM and UIM motorist coverages] are provided!.]\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In order to comply with this provision, an insurance company was required to provide any purchaser of automobile insurance with a \u201cmeaningful offer\u201d for UM/UIM coverage. <em>Linko, </em>supra. In order to constitute a \u201cmeaningful offer,\u201d an offer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>was required to include a brief description of the UM/UIM coverage, the premium for the coverage, and an express statement of the limits of the coverage. Id. Failure to include a \u201cmeaningful offer\u201d of UM/UIM coverage in an offer to sell automobile insurance resulted in the automatic extension of UM/UIM coverage by operation of law. <em>Gyori v. Johnston Coca-Cola Bottling Group, Inc. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 565, 567, 669 N.E.2d 824. However, the requirements of former R.C. 3937.18 did not apply to self-in,sured entities, i.e., those that satisfied the financial responsibility requirements of R.C. 4509.45 other than by purchasing a contract of liability insurance. <em>Grange Mut. Cas. Co. v. Refiners Transport &amp; Terminal Corp. </em>(1986), 21 Ohio St.3d 47, 49, 21 OBR 331, 487 N.E.2d 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">{\u00b6 8} In the present case, we are faced with the question of whether a company that purchased an automobile insurance policy with a deductible that matches the liability limits of the policy qualifies as a self-insured, such that the requirements of former R.C. 3937.18 do not apply to it. This court recently addressed this precise issue in <em>Dalton v. Wilson, </em>Franklin App. No. 01AP-014, 2002-Ohio-4015, 2002 WL 1813508. We adopt the reasoning therein which contains an excellent discussion of the law relating to this issue. In <em>Dalton, </em>we held that a matching deductible policy does not amount to self-insurance under <em>Gyori. </em>Id. at \u00b6 76. In reaching this conclusion, we noted that the determination of whether an entity is self-insured turns on whether the entity or the insurance company bears the ultimate risk of loss. Id. at \u00b6 64. An entity can be considered self-insured only where it, rather than an insurance company, bears the ultimate risk of loss. Id. In the case of matching deductible policies, the ultimate risk of loss is borne by the insurance company, as it is required to pay claims regardless of whether the insured actually reimburses it or not. Id. at \u00b6 77. Accordingly, the trial court erred in determining that Ralston was self-insured and that the requirements of R.C. 3937.18 did not apply to the insurance policy issued to it by Travelers. As a result, UM/UIM coverage in an amount equal to the policy\u2019s liability coverage is implied into the Travelers policy by operation of law. <em>Gyori, </em>supra. Plaintiffs assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">{\u00b6 9} Travelers argues, however, that the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in its favor should be affirmed on an alternative basis. According to Travelers, it is entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs claim because plaintiffs seven-year delay in notifying Travelers of its claim breached the policy\u2019s notice and subrogation provisions. In support of this argument, Travelers points to the following language that appears in the policy under the heading \u201cBUSINESS AUTO CONDITIONS\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c2. DUTIES IN THE EVENT OF ACCIDENT, CLAIM, SUIT OR LOSS</p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>{\u00b6 11} \u201ca. In the event of \u2018accident,\u2019 claim, \u2018suit\u2019 or \u2018loss,\u2019 you must give us or our authorized representative prompt notice of the \u2018accident\u2019 or \u2018loss.\u2019 Include:</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(1) How, when and where the \u2018accident\u2019 or \u2018loss\u2019 occurred;</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(2) The \u2018insured\u2019s\u2019 name and address; and</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(3) To the extent possible, the names and addresses of any injured persons and witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c5. TRANSFER OF RIGHTS OF RECOVERY AGAINST OTHERS TO US</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cIf any person or organization to or for whom we make payment under this Coverage Form has rights to recover damages from another, those rights are transferred to us. That person or organization must do everything necessary to secure our rights and must do nothing after \u2018accident\u2019 or \u2018loss\u2019 to impair them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">{\u00b6 18} As a preliminary matter, we note that, because the above provisions constitute \u201cconditions\u201d of coverage rather than exclusions, they apply to the UM/UIM coverage that has been implied into the Travelers\u2019 policy by operation of law. <em>Heiney v. Hartford, </em>Franklin App. No. 01AP-1100, 2002-Ohio-3718, 2002 WL 1625571, at \u00b6 29-35, discretionary appeal allowed (2002), 97 Ohio St.3d 1481, 780 N.E.2d 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">{\u00b6 19} Travelers contends that plaintiffs failure to notify it of its claim against the policy for more than seven years after the accident breached the policy\u2019s notice and subrogation provisions. Several weeks after the instant case was argued, the Ohio Supreme Court decided <em>Ferrando v. Auto-Owners Mut. Ins. Co., </em>98 Ohio St.3d 186, 2002-Ohio-7217, 781 N.E.2d 927, which, like the instant case, involved the question of whether a provider of UM/UIM coverage may be released from its obligation to provide coverage due to the failure of a claimant to promptly notify the insurer of a potential claim or to protect the insurer\u2019s subrogation rights. In addressing the issue, the <em>Ferrando </em>court established a clear framework for determining whether a claimant\u2019s alleged breach of a notice or subrogation provision in a UM/UIM policy bars that claimant from recovering UM/UIM benefits under the policy. Specifically, the <em>Ferrando </em>court held that determining whether an alleged breach of a notice or subrogation provision barred recovery required a two-stage inquiry. Id. at \u00b6 89. First, a court must determine whether a notice or subrogation provision has actually been breached. Id. Second, if the court determines that a breach has occurred, it must determine whether the insurer has been prejudiced by that breach. Id. An insurer will be relieved of its obligation to provide UM/UIM coverage as the result of a breach of a notice or subrogation provision only when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>it has been prejudiced by such breach. Id. at \u00b6 1. However, where a breach is found, prejudice is presumed, unless the claimant presents some evidence to rebut that presumption. Id. at \u00b6 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">{\u00b6 20} As stated previously, the trial court did not address the validity, if any, of defendant\u2019s claims that plaintiff had violated the policy\u2019s notice and subrogation provisions to the prejudice of defendant. Consequently, we remand the case to the trial court to consider these defenses in accordance with <em>Ferrando.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Judgment reversed and case remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b390-7\">Bowman and Klatt, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b390-8\">John W.
