Verich (\u201cVerich\u201d), appeals from the judgment entered by the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss filed by appellees, the Vindicator Printing Company, Inc. and Bertram DeSouza.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">{\u00b6 2} The Vindicator Printing Company publishes a daily newspaper called The Vindicator. In the spring of 2000, Verich was running to retain his seat in the Ohio House of Representatives. Verich was initially appointed to serve the unexpired term of his brother, Michael Verich. Verich was unsuccessful in his attempt to retain his position, losing the March 2000 primary election.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">{\u00b6 3} Following the primary election, an article was printed in the March 12, 2000 edition of The Vindicator. The article was printed in the editorial section of the paper, which is titled \u201cViewpoint.\u201d The article contained the following language:</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cMichael Verich, along with the party hierarchy, anointed Chris, who had zero credentials.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cNow, Michael must find Chris a job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">{\u00b6 6} Verich filed this lawsuit for libel naming The Vindicator and the author of the article, Bertram DeSouza. Appellees filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6), for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Verich filed a memorandum contra the motion to dismiss. The trial court granted appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">{\u00b6 7} Verich has timely appealed from this judgment, raising the following assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b159-13\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of plaintiff-appellant in granting defendants-appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-14\">{\u00b6 9} When considering a motion to dismiss pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6), the factual allegations of the complaint must be accepted as true.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff is to be afforded all reasonable inferences derived from the allegations of the complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Then, it must appear beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>no set of facts entitling him to relief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finally, \u201c[t]he determination of whether allegedly defamatory language is opinion or fact is a question of law to be decided by the court.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">{\u00b6 10} Verich attached three exhibits to his motion contra appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss. \u201cWhen a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted presents matters outside the pleading and such matters are not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as a motion for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellees did not rely on matters outside the pleading in their motion to dismiss. The trial court did not convert the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. Finally, in its judgment entry, the trial court did not address any of the exhibits attached to Verich\u2019s motion contra appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss. Accordingly, we will not consider any of Verich\u2019s attached exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">{\u00b6 11} The First Amendment to the United States Constitution imposes limitations on state defamation law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, \u201c \u2018[t]he Ohio Constitution provides a separate and independent guarantee of protection for opinion ancillary to freedom of the press.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\"> {\u00b6 12} \u201cWhen determining whether speech is protected opinion a court must consider the totality of the circumstances. Specifically, a court should consider: the specific language at issue, whether the statement is verifiable, the general context of the statement, and the broader context in which the statement appeared.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">{\u00b6 13} The trial court found that the language at issue in this case is opinion. For the following reasons, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">{\u00b6 14} The specific language at issue in this case was the statements \u201c[n]ow, Michael must find Chris a job\u201d and that Verich had \u201czero credentials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>{\u00b6 15} The trial court reasoned that there are no set requirements for holding the office of state representative. Since there are no specific requirements to hold the office, whether a specific individual has \u201ccredentials\u201d for the office becomes a matter of the writer\u2019s opinion. It is nearly impossible to verify whether an individual has credentials to be a state representative, as none are required. The court noted that a wide variety of individuals have held the office of state representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">{\u00b6 16} The statement that \u201cMichael must find Chris a job\u201d is likewise unverifiable. There is no way to ascertain how Verich will obtain future employment. This statement was only the writer\u2019s opinion of how that employment search could take place.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">{\u00b6 17} The third prong of the test requires an examination of the general context of the statements. The statements at issue appeared in an article entitled \u201cPraise for the losers? Hardly.\u201d The article was DeSouza\u2019s colorful recap of the results of the recent Democratic primary election. In the article, a Mahoning County Commissioner was labeled a \u201cpuppet without a puppetmaster.\u201d Also, a Congressman was called an \u201c800 pound political gorilla.\u201d These references indicated the article\u2019s generally light-hearted character and opinionated nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">{\u00b6 18} Turning to the final prong of the test, we examine the broader context in which the statements appeared. The statements were in the editorial section of the newspaper. This section is entitled \u2018Viewpoint.\u201d There is a presumption that language contained in the editorial section of a newspaper is the opinion of the writer.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">{\u00b6 19} After reviewing the statements at issue under the light of the four-prong test, we agree with the trial court\u2019s determination that the statements were constitutionally protected opinion. Therefore, the trial court did not err by dismissing Verich\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which can be granted. Verich\u2019s assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">{\u00b6 20} The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b161-10\">William M.
