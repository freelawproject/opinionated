For the following reasons, judgment is reversed as to the breach-of-contract claims and judgment entered for appellants on these claims. The matter is to be remanded for further proceedings as to any amounts appellants may owe under the \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d clauses of the contracts. Judgment is also reversed with respect to damages for lost bonding capacity, because appellees did not demonstrate that any other contracts were actually lost or that the parties contemplated lost bonding capacity when entering into these contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">{\u00b6 2} The record reveals that in 1996, Mahoning County became involved in a project to renovate the former Higbee building in downtown Youngstown so that it could be used for government office space. Title to the property was transferred to the county in 1996 to facilitate the project. In June 1996, Terreri Construction Company, Inc. (\u201cTerreri\u201d), put in a .bid to renovate the roof and atrium of the Higbee building (\u201croof/atrium contract\u201d). At the same time, Terreri and Avila Contracting and Supply Company, Inc. (\u201cAvila Supply\u201d), put in a bid, as a joint venture, on another part of the project calling primarily for demolition work in the Higbee building (\u201cdemolition contract\u201d). Terreri and Avila Supply are appellees in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">{\u00b6 3} On July 30, 1997, the Mahoning County Board of Commissioners recommended awarding the roof/atrium contract to Terreri at a cost of $1,580,000, and recommended awarding the demolition contract to the Terreri/Avila Supply joint venture at a cost of $578,000. As part of the bidding process, Terreri filed bid guarantees and performance bonds in the amounts of the proposed contracts. There are documents in the record indicating that Terreri could obtain only a maximum of $3,000,000 worth of performance bonds approved by its insurance company. The record does not indicate that appellants were made aware of Terrerf s bonding capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">{\u00b6 4} The parties all signed the contracts on September 18,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">{\u00b6 5} Both appellees sent appellants a letter on October 10, 1997, requesting a notice to proceed and an increase of 15 percent in the contract price. The contracts had provisions that permitted appellees to begin work only after receiving a \u201cnotice to commence\u201d from appellants. By letter, appellees threat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>ened to withdraw their bid if a notice to proceed or an increase in the contract price was not forthcoming by October 31,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">{\u00b6 6} Appellees sent appellants another letter on October 23, 1997, declaring that if appellants issued a notice to proceed, appellants were also agreeing to an \u201cequitable increase\u201d in the contract price. Appellees once again proposed a 15 percent increase and declared that their bid was being withdrawn if no notice to proceed or letter of understanding was received by November 14,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">{\u00b6 7} On December 1, 1997, appellees declared, by letter, that they were withdrawing from the contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">{\u00b6 8} On December 5, 1997, appellants transferred the title of the Higbee building to the Community Investment Corporation (\u201cCIC\u201d), an organization that facilitates public building projects in the city of Youngstown.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">{\u00b6 9} Sometime between December 6, 1997, and January 6, 1998, Mr. Terreri spoke with Gary Kubic, Mahoning County Administrator, about whether the contracts could be assigned to or renegotiated with CIC. Nothing was resolved in this conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">{\u00b6 10} On January 6, 1998, appellants returned $2,000,000 to the state of Ohio that had been earmarked for the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">{\u00b6 11} Sometime in early April 1998, the CIC announced that it was not going to renovate the Higbee building and was going to build a smaller version of an office tower on property next to the Higbee building.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">{\u00b6 12} Appellees filed a breach-of-contract complaint on April 17, 1998. Appellees named four defendants: the Board of Mahoning County Commissioners (\u201cboard of commissioners\u201d); Gary Kubic (\u201cKubic\u201d), the county administrator; George Tablack (\u201cTablack\u201d), Mahoning County Auditor; and Olsavsky-Jaminet Architects (\u201cOlsavsky\u201d). The first three of these defendants constitute the appellants in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">{\u00b6 13} Appellees\u2019 first cause of action involved an April 1996 contract for the removal of asbestos in the former Higbee building in downtown Youngstown. The second cause of action alleged a breach of the roof/atrium contract. The third cause of action alleged a breach of the demolition contract. The fourth cause of action alleged that appellants failed to release appellees\u2019 construction bond, which prevented them from pursuing other contracting work and which caused lost profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-13\">{\u00b6 14} On May 20, 1999, the trial court filed a judgment entry declaring that count one of the complaint had been settled and dismissing defendant Olsavsky from the case. Count one is not part of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>{\u00b6 15} On June 30, 1999, the remaining defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. They argued that (1) the terms of the contracts prohibited appellees from recovering damages due to any delays preventing completion of the contract, (2) appellees alleged no facts indicating the actual amount of lost profits, requiring the dismissal of count four of the complaint, and (3) Mahoning County Auditor Tablack should be dismissed from the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">{\u00b6 16} On August 2, 1999, appellees filed their motion in opposition to summary judgment. Appellees argued that they were not seeking damages for delays, but, rather, damages from being prevented from doing any work on the contracts. Appellees also presented evidence of their profits and losses from 1992-1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">{\u00b6 17} On August 16, 1999, appellants filed a reply to appellees\u2019 brief in opposition to summary judgment. Appellants argued that the contracts contained \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d clauses that allowed appellants\u2019 to terminate the contracts for no reason upon ten days\u2019 written notice, and, if the contracts so terminated, would create liability only for the percentage of the work already completed plus costs related to the termination. Appellants argued that they were justified in assuming that the termination for convenience clauses were constructively invoked after appellees sent letters stating that they were withdrawing from the contract unless the contract price was increased by 15 percent. Appellants urged the court to use the \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d clause as a basis for granting their motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">{\u00b6 18} The summary judgment motion was presented to a magistrate. The magistrate denied the motion on August 25, 1999. The magistrate also denied the request to have Auditor Tablack dismissed from the case. Appellants filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. The objections were overruled by the trial court on October 29, 1999. Appellants filed an appeal of that decision with this court, which was designated Appeal Case No. 99 CA 296. On February 16, 2000, this court dismissed the appeal for lack of a final, appealable order, in which we held that the denial of motion for summary judgment is not immediately appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">{\u00b6 19} The case went to bench trial on October 25-27, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">{\u00b6 20} On December 11, 2000, the trial court rendered its judgment. The court found that appellants failed to terminate the contracts in writing as required by the \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d clauses. The court found that the \u201cno damages for delay\u201d clauses were inapplicable to a situation where appellants failed to issue a \u201cnotice to proceed.\u201d The court held that appellants\u2019 reliance on federal common law pertaining to \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d did not apply because the contracts provided that Ohio law should apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>{\u00b6 21} The trial court held that appellants were in breach of both contracts, and awarded appellees $237,000 in lost profit damages for the atrium/roofing contract. The court awarded appellees $115,600 in lost profit damages for breach of the demolition contract. The court also awarded appellees $118,500 in lost bonding capacity damages for the delay in releasing the construction bond. Kubic and Tablack were dismissed from the case. The court held that prejudgment interest was inappropriate and awarded interest to be paid from the date of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">{\u00b6 22} On December 14, 2000, appellants filed this timely appeal. Appellees have filed a cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">{\u00b6 23} On December 18, 2000, the trial court granted a stay of execution of the judgment pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">{\u00b624} Although appellants present six assignments of error for review, the-alleged errors can be analyzed as three issues for review: (1) whether the \u201cno damages for delay\u201d clause protected appellants from being in breach of contract; (2) whether the \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d clause protected appellants from being in breach of contract; and (3) whether appellees provided evidence to justify lost profit damages based on appellants\u2019 delay in returning the performance bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">{\u00b6 25} Assignments of Error Nos. I and II deal with the \u201cno damages for delay\u201d and \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d clauses of the contracts:</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cThe trial court erred in finding that appellants breached the atrium and roofing contract and interior demolition contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cThe trial court erred in failing to find a constructive termination for convenience as a matter of law of both the atrium and roofing contract and the interior demolition contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">{\u00b6 28} Appellants argue that at no time have they been in breach of contract due to (1) the \u201cno damages for delay\u201d clauses; (2) the legal theory of \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d; and (3) the legal effect of three letters sent by appellees in October-December 1997, which declared that appellees were withdrawing from their contract responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">{\u00b6 29} Appellants first rely on Article Twelve, Section (b) of the contracts, which sets forth the \u201cno damages for delay\u201d provisions:</p>\n<p id=\"b132-13\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cAny Contractor, Subcontractor, or other Contracting Party, shall have no claim against the County of Mahoning, or any of the agents or employees of the same, individually or collectively, for an increase in the contract price or a payment or allowance of any kind based upon any damage, loss, or additional expense, that such Contractor, Subcontractor, or other Contracting Party may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>suffer as a result of any delays, including delays not contemplated by the parties in prosecuting or completing the work under this contract irrespective of the cause for such delay. It is understood that such Contractor, Subcontractor, or other Contracting Party assumes all risks of delay in prosecuting or completing the work under this contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">{\u00b6 31} Appellants also implicitly rely upon \u201cSchedule \u2018B\u2019: Commencement and Completion of Work,\u201d which states that work could not start until appellants delivered to appellees a written notice to commence. Work was required to be completed in \u201c120 Calendar Days from written notice to commence\u201d with respect to the atrium/roofing contract, and was required to be completed in 90 days for the demolition contract. There is nothing in \u201cSchedule B\u201d or in any other part of the contracts setting any time limits on the delivery of the written notice to commence work.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">{\u00b6 32} Appellants argue that the \u201cno damages for delay\u201d clauses protected them from being in breach during the period of September 18, 1997 (the date the contracts were signed) until May 11, 1998 (the date that appellants returned appellees\u2019 performance bonds). The more important date, though, in determining whether appellants were in breach of contract, is October 10, 1997. This is the date of appellees\u2019 first letter to appellants deckring withdrawal from the contract if the bid price was not increased by 15 percent. If appellants were not in breach during the period of September 18, 1997, to October 10, 1997, then the issue arises as to the effect of appellees\u2019 letter on appellants\u2019 liability under the contract. As will be shown below, appellees\u2019 letter of October 10, 1997, together with their subsequent letters, significantly affect the outcome of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">{\u00b6 33} Appellees argue that the \u201cno damages for delay\u201d clauses do not apply where work is never commenced. Appellees\u2019 essential argument at trial and to this court is that appellants\u2019 delay in delivering a notice to proceed was not a delay contemplated by the \u201cno damages for delay\u201d clause. In other words, appellees contend that only delays that occurred after the start of construction were contemplated by the parties. Whether or not an event was contemplated by the contracting parties is determined first and foremost by examining the words of the contract. <em>Kelly v. Med. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 130, 31 OBR 289, 509 N.E.2d 411, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">{\u00b6 34} The construction of written contracts is a matter of law that is reviewed de novo on appeal. <em>Long Beach Assn. v. Jones </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 574, 576, 697 N.E.2d 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">{\u00b6 35} In Ohio, a \u201cno damages for delay\u201d clause is a valid and enforceable contract provision. <em>Carrabine Constr. Co. v. Chrysler Realty Corp. </em>(1986), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>25 Ohio St.3d 222, 228, 25 OBR 283, 495 N.E.2d 952. The reason for enforcing such clauses is to protect the public:</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c \u2018[T]hey protect public agencies which contract for large improvements to be paid for through fixed appropriations against vexatious litigation based on claims, real or fancied, that the agency has been responsible for unreasonable delays.\u2019 \u201d <em>DiGioia Bros. Excavating, Inc. v. Cleveland Dept. of Pub. Util., Div. of Water </em>(1999), 135 Ohio App.3d 436, 450, 734 N.E.2d 438, quoting <em>Owen Constr. Co., Inc. v. Iowa State Dept. of Transp. </em>(Iowa 1979), 274 N.W.2d 304, 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">{\u00b6 37} In <em>Carrabine Constr., </em>the Ohio Supreme Court upheld summary judgment in favor of Chrysler Corporation because Carrabine Construction Company had entered into a contract with a \u201cno damages for delay\u201d clause. The \u201cno damages for delay\u201d clause in <em>Carrabine Constr. </em>is remarkably similar to the clause at issue in the instant appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cThe Contractor shall have no claim against the Owner for an increase in the contract price or a payment or allowance of any kind based on any damage, loss or additional expense the Contractor may suffer as a result of any delays in prosecuting or completing the work under the contract, whether such delays are caused by the circumstances set forth in the preceding paragraph or by any other circumstances. It is understood that the contractor assumes all risks of delays in prosecuting or completing the work under the contract.\u201d Id. at 227, 25 OBR 283, 495 N.E.2d 952.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">{\u00b6 39} <em>Carrabine </em>held that the broad and comprehensive \u201cno damages for delay\u201d provision was valid and enforceable. Id. at 228, 25 OBR 283, 495 N.E.2d 952.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">{\u00b6 40} Similarly, the \u201cno damages for delay\u201d clauses of the atrium/roofing contract and the demolition contracts are written with very broad language, and there is nothing in the clauses which restrict their application to events occurring only after a \u201cnotice to proceed\u201d has been delivered. As in <em>Carrabine, </em>the \u201cno damages for delay\u201d clauses cover delays in both \u201cprosecuting\u201d and \u201ccompleting\u201d the contracts. The term \u201cprosecuting\u201d is not defined in the contracts. Undefined terms in a contract are interpreted using the plain, ordinary meaning of the words. <em>Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Guman Bros. Farm </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 107, 108, 652 N.E.2d 684. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cprosecute\u201d as \u201c1. To commence and carry out a legal action. 2. To institute and pursue a criminal action. 3. To engage in; carry on.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed.Rev.1999) 1237. From this definition it can be seen that to \u201cprosecute\u201d means to initiate as well as to follow through on a project or activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>{\u00b6 41} , We conclude that the \u201cno damages for delay\u201d provisions in the two contracts sub judice encompassed delays in allowing appellees to begin work on the contracts. Therefore, appellants were not in breach merely because of such delays.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"> {\u00b6 42} Appellees might have been able to request damages for delay despite the \u201cno damages for delay\u201d provisions. There are several recognized exceptions to the enforceability of a \u201cno damage for delay\u201d clause. The exceptions consist of delay that \u201c \u2018(1) was not intended or contemplated by the parties to be within the purview of the provision; (2) resulted from fraud, misrepresentation, or other bad faith on the part of one seeking the benefit of the provision; (3) has extended such an unreasonable length of time that the party delayed would have been justified in abandoning the contract; (4) is not within the specifically enumerated delays to which the clause applies.\u2019 \u201d <em>DiGioia Bros. Excavating, Inc., </em>supra, 135 Ohio App.3d at 450-451, 734 N.E.2d 438, quoting <em>Jensen Constr. Co. v. Dallas Cty. </em>(Tex.App.1996), 920 S.W.2d 761, 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">{\u00b6 43} While the record does not support that any of these exceptions existed, even assuming that all four exceptions apply, appellees cannot prevail here. Exceptions one, two, and four would have given appellees a basis to request damages for delay, but would not have justified the abandonment of the contracts. Only exception three would have allowed appellees to abandon the contracts. The record clearly reflects that appellees did abandon and repudiate the contracts by their letters dated October 10, 1997, October 23, 1997, and December 1, 1997. It is also apparent that, up to the point that appellees repudiated the contracts, any delays in delivering notices to proceed cannot be construed as unreasonable. Based on the above, the record reveals that appellees were in total breach of the contracts by anticipatory repudiation on December 1, 1997, and all subsequent events must be viewed in the light of that breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\"> {\u00b6 44} \u201c[WJhen a contracting party repudiates the contract prior to the time that such party\u2019s performance is due, an \u2018anticipatory breach\u2019 or, more precisely, an \u2018anticipatory repudiation\u2019 occurs, and the injured party has an immediate action for damages for total breach. Farnsworth, Contracts (1982) 627-628, Section 8.20.\u201d <em>Farmers Comm. Co. v. Burks </em>(1998), 130 Ohio App.3d 158, 172, 719 N.E.2d 980. The nonbreaching party may also rely on the anticipatory repudiation as a.defense against a subsequent breach-of-contract claim. <em>Premium Enterprises, Inc. v. T.S., Inc. </em>(Feb. 9, 1999), 9th Dist. No. 2751-M, 1999 WL 61488; 13 Williston on Contracts (4th Ed.2000) 668, Section 39:37.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cAfter acceptance, an attempted withdrawal amounts to an anticipatory breach of contract.\u201d Keyes, Government Contracts (2d Ed.1996) 307, Section 14.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>{\u00b6 46} One form of anticipatory repudiation occurs when a party declares that he or she will not perform the terms of the contract unless the contract price is increased. <em>Nuco Plastics, Inc. v. Universal Plastics, Inc. </em>(1991), 76 Ohio App.3d 137, 141, 601 N.E.2d 152. Anticipatory repudiation does not' rescind a contract, but, rather, constitutes a breach of contract. <em>Am. Bronze Corp. v. Streamway Products </em>(1982), 8 Ohio App.3d 223, 228, 8 OBR 295, 456 N.E.2d 1295.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">{\u00b6 47} Notice of anticipatory repudiation gives the offended party the freedom to cancel its obligations under the contract. Farnsworth, Contracts (1982) 627-628, Section 8.20; <em>Farmers Comm. Co., </em>supra, 130 Ohio App.3d at 172, 719 N.E.2d 980.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">{\u00b6 48} \u201c[W]hen one party to a contract repudiates the contract, or gives notice to the other party before the latter is in default that he or she will not perform, the nonrepudiating party is entitled to enforce the contract without previously performing or offering to perform the provisions of the contract in favor of the repudiating party. The repudiating party, by contrast, cannot demand performance from the nonrepudiating party, and may not sue the nonrepudiating party for nonperformance. Finally, when an action is brought by the repudiating party, anticipatory repudiation is not an affirmative defense that is required to be specifically pleaded in response.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) 13 Williston (4th Ed.2000) at 668, Section 39:37.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">{\u00b6 49} Although appellants do not specifically refer to the phrase \u201canticipatory repudiation,\u201d their posture during the trial of this case was that appellees breached the contracts by the declarations contained in the October 10, 1997, October 23, 1997, and December 1, 1997 letters, and that appellants\u2019 subsequent actions were, in part, an effort to salvage and protect their rights under those contracts. Thus, appellants\u2019 legal theory at trial was, at least in part, based on the doctrine of anticipatory repudiation.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">{\u00b6 50} If appellees were justified in abandoning the contracts, pursuant to the third factor mentioned in <em>DiGioia, </em>supra, then the law governing anticipatory repudiation would not apply. As previously stated, the third <em>DiGioia </em>factor requires a determination as to whether the contract delays extended such an unreasonable length of time that the aggrieved party was justified in abandoning the contract. <em>DiGioia Bros. Excavating, Inc., </em>supra, 135 Ohio App.3d at 450-451, 734 N.E.2d 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">{\u00b6 51} On review we must first determine the time frame within which to judge the reasonableness of appellants\u2019 actions in delaying the delivery of the notices to proceed. Logically, we first determine the date the contracts became binding on the parties: September 18, 1997. Although the parties had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>involved in the bidding process from June 1996, there were no binding contracts until all the parties signed them on September 18,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">{\u00b6 52} The next significant event occurred on October 10, 1997, when appellees sent appellants their first letter demanding a 15 percent increase in the contract price. The entire letter reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cDear Sirs:</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cSixteen months have passed since this project was bid. For that reason, we are hereby requesting an increase of 15% on our base bid, if a notice to proceed is not issued by October 31, 1997. With this increase, we can extend our bid until June 30,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cIf neither a Letter of Understanding by which the county can commit to extending their option by these terms, nor a Notice to Proceed is issued as stated, please withdraw our bid and return our bond with its Power Of Attorney as soon as possible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">{\u00b6 56} The existence and content of this letter are not in controversy. In this letter, appellees state that they would waive any alleged error or breach caused by the delay in receiving a \u201cnotice to commence\u201d if the notice was delivered by October 31, 1997. Appellees also appear to believe that they were not bound by the contracts and that the contracts were still in the bidding stage. The terms and assumptions contained within this letter have no basis in the language of the original contracts. Although the contracts did contain certain provisions for. appellees to request adjustments in the contract price, none of those provisions allowed appellees to abandon the contracts. By denying the finality and legitimacy of the contracts, appellees\u2019 October 10,1997 letter constitutes their first step in repudiating the contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">{\u00b6 57} On October 23, 1997, appellees sent appellants another letter, the complete text of which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cDear Sirs:</p>\n<p id=\"b137-12\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cAs per today\u2019s conversation with the project architect, Mr. Ray Jaminet, we hereby extend our bid until November 14, 1997 \u2014 with the understanding an equitable increase will be negotiated at the time the Notice to Proceed is issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-13\">{\u00b6 60} \u201cPlease understand that there is a home office overhead cost in holding a contract open. Therefore, we cannot hold this contract open indefinitely without the assurance we will be compensated for these costs. We will use an industry standard, such as the \u2018Eicheley Method\u2019 to calculate this cost along with changes in conditions of the work, labor increases and material increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>{\u00b6 61} \u201cIf by November 14, 1997, neither a Notice to Proceed nor a Letter of Understanding (accepting the 15% increase) is issued, please withdraw our bid and return our bond with the Power of Attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">{\u00b6 62} It is clear from this letter that appellees no longer intended to waive their objections to the alleged delay in receiving the notices to proceed. It is also clear that, if appellants issued the notices to proceed, appellees would interpret that step as an agreement to increase the contract price. Once again, appellees attempted to impose conditions and terms upon appellants that were not part of the original signed contracts. If appellants issued a notice to proceed after receiving the October 23, 1997 letter, they risked being liable for appellees\u2019 demand for a 15 percent increase in price. Therefore, appellees\u2019 October 23,1997 letter constitutes the second step in their repudiation of the contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">{\u00b6 63} There was no evidence at trial revealing any customary time period for issuing a notice to proceed. This lack of evidence, though, is not particularly germane, because appellees\u2019 October 10, 1997 letter issued only one month after the contracts were signed gave appellants a deadline of October 31,1997, to issue the notices to proceed. In essence, appellees were defining what they considered to be a reasonable time for appellants to issue the notice to proceed. Instead of waiting until October 31,1997, appellees sent a letter on October 23,1997, linking the notice to proceed with a promise to increase the price of the contract and declaring that they would repudiate the contracts if the notices to proceed and an increase in the price were not received by November 14, 1997. It was not reasonable for appellees to believe that appellants would issue a notice to proceed after October 23, 1997, without first resolving the issues raised by the October 23, 1997 letter. Then, in a letter dated December 1, 1997, appellees announced, without conditions, that they were unilaterally revoking their obligations under the contracts: \u201c[P]lease withdraw our bid and return our bond, including the Power of Attorney.\u201d Thus, after December 1, 1997, it would have been a useless gesture for appellants to issue a notice to proceed, as appellees had made their repudiation of the contracts absolute. Therefore, the third and final step in appellees\u2019 repudiation of the contracts occurred on December 1, 1997. When looking at this time line realistically from the time the parties signed these contracts, it is difficult if not impossible to determine that a delay occurred, much less that such delay could be called unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">{\u00b6 64} Based on appellees\u2019 letters, the record reflects that appellants were acting reasonably at all times in withholding the notice to proceed. Because any delays in issuing a \u201cnotice to proceed\u201d that occurred prior to December 1, 1997, were reasonable, the third <em>DiGioia </em>exception does not apply and appellees had no legal basis to abandon the contracts. After December 1, 1997, any failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>deliver the notices to proceed were unequivocally caused by appellees\u2019 repudiation of the contracts on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">{\u00b6 65} Appellees also argue that the \u201cno damages for delay\u201d clauses were not enforceable because they were ambiguous and were drafted by appellants. Appellees contend that contract ambiguities must be construed against the drafter of the ambiguous sections, citing <em>Graham v. Drydock Coal Co. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 311, 313, 667 N.E.2d 949. Although appellees correctly state a general rule of contract interpretation, their argument fails for two reasons. First, we have not found any material ambiguities in the contracts. Second, this argument is usually reserved to work in favor of unsophisticated parties, with unequal bargaining power, who are bound to the terms of an adhesion contract. <em>Wall v. Firelands Radiology, Inc. </em>(1995), 106 Ohio App.3d 313, 327, 666 N.E.2d 235. Appellees are seasoned government contractors:</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cMen who take million-dollar contracts for Government buildings are neither unsophisticated nor careless. Inexperience and inattention are more likely to be found in other parties to such contracts than the contractors, and the presumption is obvious and strong that the men signing such a contract as we have here protected themselves against such delays as are complained of by the higher price exacted for the work.\u201d <em>Wells Bros. Co. v. United States </em>(1920), 254 U.S. 83, 87, 41 S.Ct. 34, 65 L.Ed. 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">{\u00b6 67} Based on the foregoing analysis, we conclude that appellants were protected by the \u201cno damages for delay\u201d provisions in the two contracts and that they are not liable for damages arising from any alleged delay or failure in delivering the notices to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">{\u00b6 68} There are additional reasons found in the record for sustaining appellants\u2019 first assignment of error. Even if appellants were not able to rely on the \u201cno damage for delay\u201d clauses, the trial court erred by failing to enforce the \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d clauses of the contracts. Article 18(c) of the contracts states:</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">{\u00b6 69} \u201c(c) For Convenience:</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">{\u00b6 70} \u201cIn addition to the provision of paragraph (a), the County shall have the right to terminate this Agreement without cause upon ten (10) days written notice to the Contractor, but in that event County shall pay to the Contractor a proportionate amount of the Agreement Price, as amended, based upon the percentage of the completion of the work under this Agreement and any amendment thereto, plus cost directly resulting from the termination, subject to County\u2019s right to audit Contractor\u2019s books and records.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">{\u00b6 71} Appellants argue that \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d clauses have been recognized and upheld in Ohio. <em>Refreshment Serv. Co., Inc. v. Cleveland </em>(1980), 63 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Ohio St.2d 89, 92, 17 O.O.3d 54, 406 N.E.2d 1115; <em>Jeffrey B. Peterson &amp; </em>Assoc. <em>v. Dayton Metro. Hous. Auth. </em>(July 21, 2000), 2d Dist. No. 17306, 2000 WL 1006562. Appellants argued at trial and in this appeal that they sent the equivalent of written notices of termination when they returned appellees\u2019 bonds on May 11, 1998. The letters accompanying the returned bonds stated, in their entirety:</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">{\u00b6 72} \u201cTO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">{\u00b6 73} \u201cThank you for your recent bid proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">{\u00b6 74} \u201cWe are returning your bid/performance bond(s).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">{\u00b6 75} \u201cThe Board of Mahoning County Commissioners appreciates your interest in the County\u2019s bidding process. We encourage your continued participation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">{\u00b6 76} Appellees are correct that these letters do not expressly state that the contracts are being terminated. It is clear from the record, though, that' appellees had both constructive and actual notice of termination of the contracts by a number of means. The failure to follow the \u201cwritten notice\u201d provisions of a construction contract can be construed as harmless if there is evidence of constructive or actual notice. <em>Roger J. Au &amp; Son, Inc. v. Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer Dist. </em>(1986), 29 Ohio App.3d 284, 292, 29 OBR 349, 504 N.E.2d 1209 (construing a government construction contract); <em>Brinderson Corp. v. Hampton Rds. Sanitation Dist. </em>(C.A.4, 1987), 825 F.2d 41, 44; <em>Seaboard Lumber Co. v. United States </em>(1999), 45 Fed.Cl. 404, 407. Since appellees themselves declared in their letters of October 10, October 23, and December 1, 1997, that the contracts were terminated, the record certainly demonstrates that appellees knew that the contracts were terminated. Further, the return of appellees\u2019 performance bonds provided constructive notice of termination, given appellees\u2019 arguments at trial about the importance of these bonds, and given appellees\u2019 letters of October 10 and 23, 1997, linking the return of the bonds with the withdrawal of appellees\u2019 bids.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">{\u00b6 77} It has also been established that the right to literal compliance with contract provisions may be waived. <em>Foster Wheeler Enviresponse, Inc. v. Franklin Cty. Convention Facilities Auth. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 353, 360, 678 N.E.2d 519. This waiver may be express or implied. <em>Griffith v. Linton </em>(1998), 130 Ohio App.3d 746, 751, 721 N.E.2d 146. Under the doctrine of \u201cwaiver by estoppel\u201d or implied waiver, a party to a contract may waive the right to literal compliance with the terms of the contract by engaging in actions or a course of conduct inconsistent with literal compliance. 13 Williston (4th Ed.2000), at 628, Section 39:29. Once again, appellees\u2019 three letters declared that they considered the contracts not to be binding and that they terminated these contracts. It is inconsistent for appellees to argue that appellants did not strictly comply with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>notice requirements of the \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d clauses of the contracts when appellees themselves sent written notice that the contracts were terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">{\u00b6 78} Finally, as previously stated, a party who breaches a contract through anticipatory repudiation may not demand performance of the contract by the nonrepudiating party. 18 Williston (4th Ed.2000), at 668, Section 39:37. Appellees\u2019 anticipatory repudiation alleviated the need for appellants to comply with the literal terms of the \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">{\u00b6 79} Appellants rely, in the alternative, on the argument that this court should constructively apply the \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d clause ex post facto. Although constructive \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d has never been applied in any appellate or Supreme Court opinion in Ohio, appellants do point to federal common-law cases for support. The trial court, in the case now under review, refused to rely on federal common-law cases because the contracts had \u201cchoice of law\u201d clauses designating Ohio law as binding. The trial court was incorrect in rejecting federal common law as persuasive authority. The fact that Ohio law is binding in this case does not prohibit a trial court or this court from considering, as persuasive authority, federal common law when Ohio case law is silent on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">{\u00b6 80} \u201c \u2018[Constructive termination for convenience\u2019 began as a judicial doctrine that allowed an actual breach by the government to be retroactively justified.\u201d <em>Peterson, </em>supra, citing <em>Linan-Faye Constr. Co., Inc. v. Hous. Auth. of Camden </em>(C.A.3, 1994), 49 F.3d 915, 923. The doctrine arose out of cases dealing with government procurement contracts entered into during World War I. See <em>College Point Boat Corp. v. United States </em>(1925), 267 U.S. 12, 45 S.Ct. 199, 69 L.Ed. 490. The <em>College Point Boat Corp. </em>case involved a Navy contract for the manufacture of collision mats. After the war was over, the Navy decided that it did not need the mats and tried to negotiate a termination of the contract. The contractor did not want to terminate the contract and eventually sued to enforce the contract. During the litigation, the Navy discovered a statute which would have allowed for termination prior to the manufacturer\u2019s filing its complaint. In response, the manufacturer argued that because the Navy never terminated the contract pursuant to the statute, it was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">{\u00b6 81} The United States Supreme Court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">{\u00b6 82} \u201cA party to a contract who is sued for its breach may ordinarily defend on the ground that there existed, at the time, a legal excuse for nonperformance by him, although he was then ignorant of the fact. He may, likewise, justify an asserted termination, rescission, or repudiation, of a contract by proving that there was, at the time, an adequate cause, although it did not become known to him until later.\u201d Id. at 15-16, 45 S.Ct. 199, 69 L.Ed. 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>{\u00b6 83} Based on <em>College Point Boat Corp., </em>the rule has been established in federal courts that \u201cif [a] contract contains a termination for convenience clause and the contracting officer could have invoked the clause instead of terminating, rescinding or repudiating the contract on some other invalid basis, the court will constructively invoke the clause to retroactively justify the government\u2019s actions, avoid breach and limit liability.\u201d <em>Best Foam Fabricators, Inc. v. United States </em>(1997), 38 Fed.Cl. 627, 638. \u201cIn the absence of bad faith or clear abuse of discretion, the effect of the constructive termination for convenience is to moot all breach claims and to limit recovery to costs which would have been allowed had the contracting officer actually invoked the clause.\u201d <em>Kalvar Corp. v. United States </em>(1976), 211 Ct.Cl. 192, 204, 543 F.2d 1298.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">{\u00b6 84} The basic principle to be gleaned from the constructive termination cases is:</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">{\u00b6 85} \u201c[0]ne whose government contract is terminated may not recover more than would have been available if the government exercised all of the rights available to it, irrespective of any errors or omissions by the government contracting officer. And this principle makes considerable good sense. There is little reason, after all, why the taxpayers should bear additional economic burdens because a government contract officer misapprehended the legal rights available to the government.\u201d <em>A/S Dampskibssetskabet Torm v. United States </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1999), 64 F.Supp.2d 298, 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">{\u00b6 86} In sustaining appellants\u2019 first assignment of error, we do not need to determine whether constructive termination for convenience must be invoked here. Appellees\u2019 repudiation of the contracts creates the same effect for all intents and purposes as would result from the doctrine of constructive termination for convenience. We address the issue as an example of the several reasons why appellants were not in breach in the matter before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">{\u00b6 87} Although we hold that appellants were not in breach of the contracts, this matter must be remanded to determine whether appellees are entitled to any reimbursement under the terms of the contracts. It is clear that appellees are not entitled to damages for delay, but they may have a claim for reimbursement under the \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d provisions of the contracts. The record demonstrates that the contracts were effectively terminated on December 1, 1997. Although appellants did not invoke the \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d clauses directly, these contract clauses provided the underlying basis for appellants\u2019 defense of the breach-of-contract claims. Therefore, the \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d clauses may be enforced up to the point that appellees\u2019 own actions caused the contracts to be terminated, which was December 1,1997. These clauses provide for reimbursement for work already completed and for \u201ccost[s] directly resulting from the termination,\u201d if any. It does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>appear that \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d costs were ever considered by the trial court, because it held that the \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d provisions did not apply. Upon remand, appellees may present evidence of costs prior to the termination itself, including work already accomplished up to and including December 1, 1997. Any damages based on lost bonding capacity, though, cannot be included in a determination of costs as more fully discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">{\u00b6 88} Given our reasoning as stated above, assignments of error numbers three, four, and six are rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">{\u00b6 89} Appellants\u2019 fifth assignment of error asserts:</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">{\u00b6 90} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion in finding that appellee, Terreri Construction Company, Inc. presented sufficient evidence of lost future profit damages based on lost bonding capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">{\u00b6 91} While we have ruled in favor of appellants on the breach of contract claims stemming from their delay in issuing notices to proceed and the lack of an express written notice of termination under the \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d clauses, appellees\u2019 claim for damages based on lost or impaired bonding capacity presents a separate and distinct claim. This claim was founded on appellees\u2019 allegations that appellants were in breach of miscellaneous contract provisions or, alternatively, as a reimbursement under the \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d clauses. Appellants argue that a plaintiff must prove damages of lost or impaired bonding capacity by establishing with reasonable certainty that specific job opportunities were lost and that a net profit would have been made on those specific job opportunities which were lost, citing <em>Royal Elec. Constr. Corp. v. Ohio State Univ. </em>(Dec. 21, 1993), 10th Dist. Nos. 93AP-399 and 93AP-424, 1993 WL 532013, reversed on other grounds (1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 110, 652 N.E.2d 687. Appellees assert in rebuttal that they proved that they generally made 15 percent profit on their contracts and that they obtained $2,400,000 in government contracts immediately after their bonds were returned. Appellees contend that this proof was sufficient to sustain the trial court\u2019s award of damages on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">{\u00b6 92} Appellants overstate the holding of <em>Royal Elec. Constr. Corp. </em>In that case, the Tenth District Court of Appeals upheld a trial court decision denying an award for lost profits premised on a claim of lost bonding capacity. The appellate court upheld the decision both because (1) the plaintiff was unable to demonstrate that it had lost specific jobs due to reduced bonding capacity and (2) the plaintiffs evidence did not show that the parties contemplated lost bonding capacity damages as being part of the contracts at issue. Id. <em>Royal Elec. Constr. Corp. </em>did not hold that lost profit damages could be proved <em>only </em>by evidence of specific contracts lost due to impaired bonding capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>{\u00b6 93} That said, while there are no Ohio cases denying lost-profit damages due to impaired bonding capacity specifically because the contractor lacked proof of specific lost contracts, the general rules governing lost-profit damages support appellants\u2019 position. A party claiming lost profits due to impaired bonding capacity must prove the existence and the amount of damages with reasonable certainty; they may not be speculative. <em>Gahanna v. Eastgate Properties, Inc. </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 65, 521 N.E.2d 814, syllabus. The proof or lack of proof of specific lost contracts due to the impairment of bonding capacity is one factor that should be considered in determining lost-profit damages because of the contractor\u2019s impaired bonding capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">{\u00b6 94} \u201cThere must be more than a conclusory statement as to the amount of lost profits. An explanation of how that sum was determined is required. Lost profits must be substantiated by calculations based on facts available or in evidence, otherwise they are speculative and uncertain.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Rhodes v. Rhodes Indus., Inc. </em>(1991), 71 Ohio App.3d 797, 809, 595 N.E.2d 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">{\u00b6 95} The type of loss at issue must also have been contemplated by the parties at the time the contract was entered into and must have been reasonably foreseeable. <em>Charles R. Combs Trucking, Inc. v. Internal. Harvester Co. </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 241, 244, 12 OBR 322, 466 N.E.2d 883; see, also, <em>Royal Elec. Const. Corp., </em>supra; <em>Great Oaks Co. v. Cincinnati Ins. Co. </em>(Mar. 29, 1984), 10th Dist. No. 83AP-42, 1984 WL 7636; <em>Rocky Mountain Constr. Co. v. United States </em>(1978), 218 Ct.Cl. 665, 666, 1978 WL 8468; <em>Rush Presbyterian St. Luke\u2019s Med. Ctr. v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Am. </em>(N.D.Ill.1989), 722 F.Supp. 485, 494. In these cases, the most common reason for denying a claim for lost bonding capacity damages is lack of proof that the parties ever contemplated that the defendant would be hable for these types of losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">{\u00b6 96} Courts also deny damages for lost bonding capacity because \u201c[r]eceipt or non-receipt of future contracts is both speculative in nature and dependent on many factors not related to bonding [capacity].\u201d <em>Olin Jones Sand Co. v. United States </em>(1980), 225 Ct.Cl. 741, 744, 1980 WL 13211.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">{\u00b6 97} In some cases a party claiming lost-profit damages for impaired bonding capacity may be required to prove the accuracy of the bidding process and that it had experience in profitably completing the types of contracts supposedly lost. <em>S.C. Anderson, Inc. v. Bank of Am. </em>(1994), 24 Cal.App.4th 529, 536-537, 30 Cal.Rptr.2d 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">{\u00b6 98} The record before us reveals a complete lack of evidence that the parties ever contemplated the effects of lost bonding capacity when they entered into their contracts. Certainly, there is nothing in the contracts themselves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>discussing damages for impaired bonding capacity or setting a time for return of the bonds. There was specific evidence by appellees\u2019 insurance agent that no party receiving bids from appellees received information about their bonding capacity. If appellants never knew the extent of appellees\u2019 bonding capacity, it is difficult to understand how they could have understood the specific effects of this contract as to the loss or impairment of that capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">{\u00b6 99} There was also no evidence presented that appellees attempted to procure any specific contracts during the period they claim to have incurred lost bonding damages. There was no evidence that any specific contracts were lost because of inadequate bonding capacity. Appellees did not even allege, much less prove, what types of contracts they may have lost. The record contains only a broad, general allegation of lost contracts. Needless to say, appellees also did not produce evidence as to their ability to profitably complete the type of contracts they allegedly lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">{\u00b6 100} Appellees\u2019 expert witness, Mr. Gett, testified that he did not consider any specific contract and in fact never saw any specific contract, in coming to his conclusions about appellees\u2019 lost profit damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">{\u00b6 1} Mr. Terreri testified that \u201c[t]here were a hundred jobs out there that I passed on that I could have bid.\u201d He never attempted to specify what jobs he passed up or was rejected for because of bonding problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">{\u00b6 102} Even more surprising is the lack of any evidence that appellees actually used the bonding capacity remaining available to them (which, according to appellees, was about $800,000) during the period they are claiming loss-of-bonding damages. Appellees submitted a trial exhibit listing 42 bidding opportunities from September 18, 1997, until March 3, 1998. Of this list, 30 of the opportunities were for projects valued at less than $800,000. If appellees were unable to procure any of these 30 contracts, it could not have been due to a lack of bonding capacity. Therefore, without evidence showing that appellees actually used their remaining bonding capacity, or some credible and substantiated theory why it was not used, it is reasonable to conclude that-factors other than lack of bonding capacity prevented appellees from successfully bidding on at least those 30 projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">{\u00b6 103} Based on the foregoing considerations, appellees\u2019 award for damages arising out of lost bonding capacity must be reversed as being unsupported by the evidence. Although appellees\u2019 lack of evidence of specific lost contracts does not, standing alone, defeat their claim for lost bonding damages, the complete lack of any real evidence of lost opportunities and evidence which ties these lost opportunities to the lost bonding capacity, or that lost bonding damages were contemplated by the parties at all, leads us to conclude that appellees have not met their burden of proof. Appellants\u2019 fifth assignment of error is sustained. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>remand the issue of lost or impaired bonding capacity may not be considered in any award of lost damages, costs, or expenses to appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">{\u00b6 104} Based on all of the foregoing, appellees\u2019 cross-appeal wherein they argue that they should be entitled to prejudgment interest is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">{\u00b6 105} In conclusion, we sustain appellants\u2019 first assignment of error and reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment with respect to the breach of contract claims arising out of the second and third counts of appellees\u2019 complaint. We reverse the award of lost profit damages of $237,000 arising from count two and enter judgment in favor of appellants. We reverse the award of lost profit damages of $115,600 arising from count three and enter judgment in favor of appellants. We also sustain appellants\u2019 fifth assignment of error and reverse the trial court judgment with respect to appellees\u2019 claim for damages arising out of lost or impaired bonding capacity. We reverse the award of lost-profit damages of $118,500 arising from count four of the complaint and enter judgment in favor of appellants. We further remand this case to the trial court for a determination of appellees\u2019 costs, if any, directly relating to and arising prior to the termination of the contracts on December 1, 1997, pursuant to the \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d provisions of the contracts; however, the trial court shall not award appellees any costs or damages relating to lost or impaired bonding capacity in this remand. Appellants\u2019 second, third, fourth, and sixth assignments of error and appellees\u2019 cross-assignment of error are rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b146-8\">Yukovich and DeGenaro, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
