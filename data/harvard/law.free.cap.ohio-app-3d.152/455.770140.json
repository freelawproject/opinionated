Archer ultimately received a $100,000 policy-limits settlement from the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer, Westfield Insurance Company, in June 2001. Although Archer was then employed by Speedway Super America (\u201cSpeedway\u201d), it is undisputed that at the time of the accident, she was operating her own vehicle and was not acting in the course and scope of her employment. This case arises from Archer\u2019s attempts to obtain uninsured/under-insured motorist (\u201cUM/UIM\u201d) benefits through Speedway\u2019s various insurance policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>In October 2000, a complaint was filed on behalf of Christina Archer in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas seeking, inter alia, declaratory relief; specifically, she sought a determination as to the availability of UIM coverage from any or all insurance companies named as defendants. The defendants were named in the following capacities. Speedway is a retail gasoline outlet owned by Marathon Ashland Petroleum, L.L.C. (\u201cMAP\u201d). MAP, in turn, is owned in part by Marathon Oil, a subsidiary of USX. Pacific Employers Insurance Company (\u201cPacific\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> issued a business auto policy to USX. American International Group, Inc. (\u201cAIG\u201d) issued a general liability insurance policy to USX. Finally, American Alternative Insurance Company (\u201cAAIC\u201d) issued a commercial comprehensive catastrophic liability policy to Ashland, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">{\u00b6 3} The parties eventually filed cross-motions and memoranda seeking summary judgment. A motion to dismiss was also filed on behalf of AAIC. The trial court ultimately sustained the summary judgment motions filed on behalf of AIG and Pacific. The court granted AAIC\u2019s motion to dismiss it from the lawsuit and, as a result, held that its summary judgment motion was moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">{\u00b6 4} Christina Archer (\u201cappellant\u201d) has timely appealed, assigning two errors for our consideration:</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cI. The trial court erred in determining appellees AIG and Pacific are not subject to R.C. 3937.18 because they are self-insurers in the practical sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cII. The trial court erred in determining there was no justiciable controversy as to claims against appellee AAIC.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">{\u00b6 7} Preliminarily, we set forth the well-established standards by which we are bound in reviewing Civ.R. 56 summary judgments. In considering a motion for summary judgment, the evidence must be construed in favor of the nonmov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>ing party. Summary judgment should be granted only if no genuine issue of fact exists, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, which conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party. <em>State ex rel. Grady v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 181, 677 N.E.2d 343. <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46. A motion for summary judgment first compels the moving party to inform the court of the basis of the motion and to identify portions in the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. If the moving party satisfies that burden, the nonmoving party must then produce evidence as to any issue for which that party bears the burden of production at trial. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 662 N.E.2d 264; <em>Wing v. Anchor Media, Ltd. of Texas </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 108, 570 N.E.2d 1095. Finally, it is well established that an appellate court reviews summary judgments de novo; we review such judgments independently and without deference to the trial court\u2019s determination. <em>Brown v. Scioto Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 704, 622 N.E.2d 1153; <em>Coventry Twp. v. Ecker </em>(1995), 101 Ohio App.3d 38, 654 N.E.2d 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">{\u00b6 8} By her first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in concluding that AIG and Pacific are not subject to R.C. 3937.18, Ohio\u2019s financial responsibility statute outlining circumstances under which UM7 UIM benefits must be offered by insurance companies. As discussed below, \u201cself-insurers\u201d are now generally excepted from the R.C. 3937.18 UM/UIM coverage requirement. Appellant first takes issue with the trial court\u2019s finding that AIG and Pacific are \u201cself-insurers in the practical sense\u201d and, thus, exempt from R.C. 3937.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">{\u00b6 9} As an initial matter, we note that the version of R.C. 3937.18 applicable to the instant case is that version effective September 3, 1997.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Former R.C. 3937.18 provided that \u201c[n]o automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policy of insurance * * * shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state * * * unless both [UM/UIM] coverages are offered to persons insured under the policy * * * \u201d R.C. 3937.18(A)(1). Further, R.C. 3937.18(A)(1) and (2) provided, in part, that the UM/UIM coverages must be \u201cin an amount of coverage equivalent to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>automobile liability or motor vehicle liability coverage * * *.\u201d Failure to offer UM/UIM coverage generally resulted in the automatic extension of that coverage by operation of law. See <em>Abate v. Pioneer Mut. Cas. Co. </em>(1970), 22 Ohio St.2d 161, 51 O.O.2d 229, 258 N.E.2d 429, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">{\u00b6 10} Also critical to this case is R.C. 4509.45, which governs the means by which entities may provide proof of financial responsibility as required in Ohio. In pertinent part, R.C. 4509.45 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cProof of financial responsibility * * * may be given by filing any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(A) A financial responsibility identification card * * *;</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(B) <em>A certificate of insurance </em>* * *;</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(C) A <em>\u00a1financial surety] bond </em>* * *;</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(D) A certificate of deposit of money or securities * * *;</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(E) <em>A certificate of self-insurance </em>* * * supplemented by an agreement by the self-insurer that, with respect to accidents occurring while the certificate is in force, he will pay the same amounts that an insurer would have been obligated to pay under an owner\u2019s motor vehicle liability policy if it had issued such a policy to the self-insurer.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">{\u00b6 17} Appellant initially predicated her claim of entitlement to UIM coverage upon the Supreme Court of Ohio\u2019s decision in <em>Scott-Pontzer v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 660, 710 N.E.2d 1116. Appellant submitted that <em>Scott-Pontzer </em>and its progeny establish, as a threshold matter, that she is an \u201cinsured\u201d under the policies at issue here and is entitled to UIM coverage as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">{\u00b6 18} In <em>Scott-Pontzer, </em>the Supreme Court of Ohio followed a fundamental principle in the application of contract law \u2014 interpreting ambiguous terms and language strictly against the drafter of the contract and liberally in favor of the \u201cinsured.\u201d In particular, the court examined the definitional provision of an insurance contract issued to a corporation, which defined \u201cinsured\u201d as \u201c1. You; 2. If you are an individual, any family member.\u201d The court found that this definition of an insured as \u201cyou\u201d created ambiguity; since a corporation can act only through real persons, one reasonable interpretation of \u201cyou\u201d included the corporation\u2019s employees. Accordingly, the corporate employee was held to be an insured as a result of the ambiguous definition and, ultimately, UM/UIM coverage arose by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">{\u00b6 19} In the instant case, Pacific and AIG countered appellant\u2019s <em>ScottPontzer </em>claim with the contention that because they are \u201cself-insurers\u201d and thus not subject to R.C. 3937.18, UM/UIM coverage does not arise by operation of law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>The trial court agreed and, as a result, did not reach the <em>Scott-Pontzer </em>analysis or any further related inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">{\u00b6 20} The corporate structure and insurance design with respect to Pacific and AIG are particularly significant to the primary issue before us. The trial court, owing to the interpretations of the defendants, set forth the following summary:</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cDefendants Pacific and AIG explain * * * that they are \u2018self-insured.\u2019 The Pacific policy * * * has a * * * five million per occurrence liability limit. * * * The policy also has a per occurrence [matching] deductible of $5 million dollars. * * * Further, the Director of Insurance for Marathon Oil Corp. * * * stated that USX, Marathon Oil, MAP and Speedway did not transfer any risk to Pacific through the policy. * * * Nor has Pacific paid any claims; Speedway has.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cAIG issued a policy with ten million per occurrence liability limits. * * * However, no risk transferred under the policy. * * * AIG has retained the risk and Marathon Oil and its subsidiaries pay them; they do not submit claims to AIG. * * * In addition, Marathon Oil\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary, Old Main, has reinsured the AIG policy and has assumed the risk through a Facultative Reinsurance Agreement. * * * Further, a bank-issued letter of credit has been provided to AIG * * * which guarantees Old Main\u2019s performance up to the sum of $13,000,000. * * * \u201d (Summary Judgment Decision at 3-4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">{\u00b6 23} In its decision, the trial court relied exclusively upon language contained in <em>Grange Mut. Cas. Co. v. Refiners Transport &amp; Terminal Corp. </em>(1986), 21 Ohio St.3d 47, 21 OBR 331, 487 N.E.2d 310, in which the Supreme Court of Ohio addressed, arguably indirectly via its text, the applicability of R.C. 3937.18 to self-insurers. In <em>Grange, </em>the court determined that an employer satisfied state financial responsibility requirements by purchasing both a financial surety bond and excess insurance coverage, none of which contained UM/UIM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">{\u00b6 24} The <em>Grange </em>court narrowly framed the issue before it as being:</p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c* * * whether an employer, who meets Ohio\u2019s financial responsibility laws other than by purchasing a contract of liability insurance, must comply with the requirements concerning uninsured motorist coverage contained in R.C. 3937.18 relative to employees injured in the course of employment while driving or occupying a vehicle owned by the employer.\u201d Id. at 48, 21 OBR 331, 487 N.E.2d 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-13\">{\u00b6 26} Significantly, the <em>Grange </em>court emphasized that the defendant-employer involved in the case before it:</p>\n<p id=\"b490-14\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c* * * sought to meet its financial responsibility requirements and to protect itself from claims, in part by purchasing a financial responsibility surety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>bond * * *. As such, it was not a \u2018self-insurer\u2019 in the legal sense contemplated by R.C. 4509.45 * * * and 4509.72, <em>but rather in the practical sense </em>in that [defendant] was ultimately responsible under the term of its bond either to a claimant or the bonding company in the event the bond company paid any judgment claim.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at 49, 21 OBR 331, 487 N.E.2d 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">{\u00b6 28} The <em>Grange </em>court, quoting <em>Snyder v. Roadway Express, Inc. </em>(1982), 7 Ohio App.3d 218, 7 OBR 279, 455 N.E.2d 11, also added the following relative to self-insurers:</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">{\u00b629} \u201c* * * The <em>[Snyder] </em>court recognized * * * that if the statute did apply to self-insurers, in addition to insurance carriers authorized to write motor vehicle liability insurance policies, it would result in the absurd \u2018situation where one has the right to reject an offer of insurance to one\u2019s self * * *\u2019; even if applicable, we believe the insured\u2019s rejection must be presumed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Grange, </em>supra, at 48-49, 21 OBR 331, 487 N.E.2d 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">{\u00b6 30} Notwithstanding the narrow positing of the issue presented, the <em>Grange </em>court\u2019s syllabus broadly holds that the \u201cuninsured motorist provisions of R.C. 3937.18 do not apply to either self-insurers or financial responsibility bond principals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">{\u00b6 31} In the instant case, the trial court seized upon the foregoing emphasized language, summarily agreeing with the defendants\u2019 contention that they were self-insurers \u201cin the practical sense.\u201d The court deemed dispositive of the \u201cself-insured\u201d analysis the matching deductible/fronting agreement terms of the insurance contracts. As a result, the trial court concluded that these self-insurers are not required to comply with R.C. 3937.18\u2019s UM/UIM provisions. In so holding, the trial court extended <em>Grange </em>to non-bond holders, the net effect of which was to relieve such entities from complying with the R.C. 4509.45 et seq. provisions regarding proof of financial responsibility \u2014 for example, filing a certificate of self-insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">{\u00b6 32} Appellant argues that the trial court\u2019s reliance upon <em>Grange </em>was misplaced, as the bond situation in that case is readily distinguishable from the insurance scenario at issue here. Appellant also emphasizes the fact that neither AIG nor Pacific complied with R.C. 4509.45\u2019s \u201cself-insurance\u201d requirements because they failed to file certificates of self-insurance. As such, appellant argues, AIG and Pacific should not be considered self-insured. Specifically, appellant contends that the trial court erred in relying wholly upon the \u201cin the practical sense\u201d language of <em>Grange, </em>offering as its exclusive rationale the so-called matching deductible/fronting agreement/retained risk terms of the insurance contracts, which agreements are discussed below in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>{\u00b6 33} Appellant relies upon this court\u2019s decision in <em>Dalton v. Wilson, </em>Franklin App. No. 01AP-1014, 2002-Ohio-4015, 2002 WL 1813508,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in which we addressed nearly identical issues. The defendants, on the other hand, urge us instead to reconsider <em>Dalton. </em>However, as recently as March 31, 2003, this court continued to follow <em>Dalton. </em>See <em>Stout v. Travelers Prop. Cas. Ins. Co., </em>152 Ohio App.3d 355, 2003-Ohio-1643, 787 N.E.2d 725.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">{\u00b6 34} In <em>Dalton, </em>this court examined an analogous situation involving insurance carriers that underwrote and issued various policies to plaintiffs employer and claimed that such policies were nothing more than \u201cself-insurance\u201d based upon \u201cmatching deductible\u201d or \u201cfronting\u201d agreements. A \u201cmatching deductible\u201d or \u201cfronting\u201d agreement is, in short, an arrangement whereby a corporate entity essentially rents an insurance company\u2019s licensing and filing capabilities in a particular state or states in order to comply with state financial responsibility laws. Id. at \u00b6 26. In both <em>Dalton </em>and the instant case, premiums are paid by corporate entities to insurers which, in turn, file the proof of insurance required' by Ohio\u2019s various governmental agencies. The insurer named in the governmental filings provides liability coverage on a \u201cfirst dollar\u201d basis; the liability limits \u201cmatch\u201d the deductible. In other words, the insurer files proof that the corporation is insured up to its matching or self-retained limit. In the event the insurer is required to satisfy a claim, the corporation, pursuant to an indemnity agreement, automatically reimburses the insurer in an amount up to the self-retained limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">{\u00b6 35} The <em>Dalton </em>decision ultimately draws a distinction between insurers such as those present in the instant case, and bond principals or certificated self-insurers as contemplated by <em>Grange, </em>supra. <em>Dalton </em>comprehensively explains the distinction between insurance and \u201cself-insurance\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cIn determining whether an entity is self-insured, courts look at who bears the risk of loss. \u2018Self-insurance is not insurance; it is the antithesis of insurance.\u2019 <em>Physicians Ins. Co. of Ohio v. Grandview Hosp. &amp; Med. Ctr. </em>(1988), 44 Ohio App.3d 157, 158, 542 N.E.2d 706. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c While insurance shifts the risk of loss from the insured to the insurer, self-insurance involves no risk-shifting. Rather, in the self-insurance context, the risk is borne by the one [on] whom the law imposes it. The defining characteristic of insurance, the assumption of specific risks from customers in consideration for payment, is entirely absent where an entity self-insures. * * *\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>{\u00b6 38} \u201c\u2022* * * [T]herefore, * * * \u2018self-insurance\u2019 is the legal equivalent of no insurance for purposes of the distribution of UM/UIM benefits in accordance with R.C. 3937.18(A).\u201d Id. at \u00b6 64-66, quoting <em>Jennings v. Dayton </em>(1996), 114 Ohio App.3d 144, 148, 682 N.E.2d 1070.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">{\u00b6 39} <em>Dalton </em>distinguishes the facts present in both that and the instant case and that of a Grange-type situation involving a bond principal, which by virtue of statute complies with Ohio\u2019s financial responsibility laws; moreover, <em>Dalton </em>unequivocally refused to extend <em>Grange </em>\u201cwell beyond its holding.\u201d R.C. 4509.45(C); <em>Dalton, </em>supra, at \u00b6 38. As we deem <em>Dalton </em>dispositive of the narrow issue presented before us, we quote its interpretation and application of <em>Grange </em>at length:</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">{\u00b640} \u201c* * * The <em>Grange </em>court ultimately determined that [the employer] Refiners\u2019 status as a bond principal made it a self-insurer \u2018in a practical sense,\u2019 even though Refiners had not obtained a certificate of self-insurance. The court recognized that proof of financial responsibility may be satisfied by filing a surety bond without having to obtain a certificate of self-insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cIn contrast, the * * * instant case do[es] not involve either bond principals or certificated self-insurer; rather, * * * fit] <em>involvefs] entities who entered into fronting/matching deductible agreements\u2019 with insurance companies in an apparent effort to avoid meeting the statutory requirements to qualify as a self-insurer. The issue of whether fronting/matching deductible agreements\u2019 constitute self-insurance was not addressed, or even contemplated, in Grange. </em>Thus, we find it improper to extend <em>Grange </em>to include as self-insurers entities who enter into \u2018fronting/matching deductible agreements.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cFurther, we do not believe that the \u2018fronting/matching deductible agreement\u2019 * * * constitutes a self-insured scheme. We reiterate that [the employer] admits that it did not file a certificate of self-insurance in accordance with R.C. 4509.45 * * *. Despite its admitted failure to comply with the statutory requirements for invoking self-insured status, [the employer] seeks to declare itself a self-insurer for purposes of avoiding the requirements of the UM/UIM statute. It is our view that [the employer] cannot have it both ways.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id at \u00b6 74-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">{\u00b643} Specifically addressing the policy language at issue in that case, <em>Dalton </em>is factually indistinguishable for our purposes. This court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cUpon review of the policy language, including that contained in the \u2018Claims Services Contract\u2019 and the \u2018Deductible Agreement,\u2019 we conclude that the agreement between [the insurer and employer] constitutes an insurance policy. Both the \u2018Claims Services Contract\u2019 and the \u2018Deductible Agreement\u2019 refer to the policy as a \u2018policy of insurance.\u2019 Moreover, when a liability claim arises against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>[the employer], [the insurer] is required to pay the entire loss and is then reimbursed by [the employer]. However, the ultimate risk for the loss remains with [the insurer], if [the employer] either refuses or is financially unable to reimburse [the insurer] for the loss.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">{\u00b6 45} Finally, <em>Dalton </em>concluded, as must we:</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">{\u00b6 46} \u201c* * * [T]his type of reimbursement arrangement is [not] enough to make [the employer] \u2018self-insured in the practical sense.\u2019 Because [the employer] neither obtained a certificate of self-insurance certifying that it is of sufficient financial ability to pay judgments against it (as contemplated * * * [by <em>Grange </em>]), [the employer] may not be considered a self-insurer. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">{\u00b6 47} \u201c \u2018It may be well and good and entirely lawful for a \u2018fronting agreement\u2019 * * * to spare [an entity] the expense and potential administrative quagmires of formal registration in every state, territory and country where it does business and for these \u2018devices\u2019 to provide [an entity] the use of [an insurer\u2019s] filings and claims service, but they do not paralyze or mute the walking and quacking duck of insurance coverage.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) Id. at \u00b6 77-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">{\u00b6 48} In summary, as ultimately decided by this court in <em>Dalton, </em>while fronting, matching deductible and other reimbursement arrangements may well provide for ease of administration, such arrangements do not alleviate an entity\u2019s obligation to register formally as a self-insurer in states in which it chooses to conduct business. An insurance company may not avoid compliance with R.C. 3937.18 by claiming that the policy it issues to a corporate entity is \u201cself-insurance\u201d despite that entity\u2019s failure to comply with R.C. 4509.45. Furthermore, an insurance company may not avoid compliance with R.C. 3937.18 by simply claiming that the policy it issues to a corporate entity is \u201cself-insurance\u201d in direct contravention to the express terms and provisions of said policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">{\u00b6 49} AIG alternatively contends that it qualifies as a \u201cself-insurer\u201d because a letter of credit issued by a reinsurer is tantamount to a bond and, therefore, satisfies the financial responsibility requirement of R.C. 4509.45. However, as appellant points out, AIG failed to file this letter of credit as such a \u201cbond\u201d in accordance with the statute and, accordingly, the rationale of <em>Dalton </em>applies with equal force.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">{\u00b6 50} Finally, counsel for AIG next directs our attention to the December 13, 2002 case decided by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Hillyer v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. </em>(2002), 97 Ohio St.3d 411, 2002-Ohio-6662, 780 N.E.2d 262, for the proposition that the AIG policy is not an auto policy. Consistent with the <em>Dalton </em>court\u2019s treatment of the identical proposition advanced by the carrier of the commercial general liability policy, this issue should be addressed by the trial court for its determination in the first instance. As did the trial court in <em>Dalton, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>the trial court here limited its findings to a dispositive determination of the \u201cself-insured\u201d issue and, as a result, declined to determine all other issues. Therefore, upon remand, the trial court must determine the remaining issues, including, inter alia, whether the AIG policy constitutes a motor vehicle policy of insurance subject to the requirements of former R.C. 8937.18 and, if so, whether appellant qualifies as a \u201cnamed insured\u201d under the policy. If appellant is determined to be a \u201cnamed insured\u201d within the meaning of <em>Scoti&gt;-Pontzer, </em>supra, and its progeny, the court must also visit remaining liability issues, i.e., whether there was a valid offer and/or rejection of UM/UIM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">{\u00b6 51} Based upon the record before us, the trial court erred as a matter of law in finding that AIG and Pacific are \u201cself-insurers in the practical sense,\u201d thereby precluding appellant\u2019s right to assert a claim for UM/UIM benefits under their respective policies. Accordingly, the first assignment of error is sustained.'</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">{\u00b6 52} By her second and final assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in finding that there was no justiciable controversy as to AAIC based upon appellant\u2019s failure to show damages exceeding the monetary level necessary to trigger coverage under the AAIC policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">{\u00b6 53} The trial court apparently granted AAIC\u2019s motion to dismiss based solely upon appellant\u2019s purported failure to prove that her damages would exceed $10,000,000, thereby triggering coverage under the AAIC policy in the event she were deemed to qualify as an insured. However, appellant directs our attention to an earlier entry journalized by the trial court by which it expressly prohibited the parties from addressing damage issues until such time as the coverage issue had been decided. Given the posture of this case upon remand, in our view, dismissal of AAIC was, at best, premature based solely upon the reason provided by the trial court. Assuming arguendo that appellant is ultimately deemed entitled to damages on remand, the trial court\u2019s outright dismissal of AAIC directly contravened its earlier order and, therefore, appellant should not be precluded from presenting evidence on damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">{\u00b6 54} The second assignment of error is also sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">{\u00b6 55} Having sustained both assignments of error, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this cause to that court to conduct further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b495-11\">Bowman and Peggy Bryant, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b487-12\">.
