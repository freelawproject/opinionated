Kahoots, appeals from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas affirming the decision of appellee, Columbus Board of Zoning Adjustment (\u201cBZA\u201d), finding appellant in violation of the city\u2019s zoning code. For the reasons that follow, we reverse that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>{\u00b6 2} Appellant operates \u201cKahoots\u201d at 4522 Kenny Road in Columbus, Ohio. That business is in a Commercial Planned Development District (\u201cCPDD\u201d), which prohibits, among other things, the operation of an \u201cadults only entertainment establishment.\u201d An \u201cadults only entertainment establishment\u201d was defined in former Columbus City Code (\u201cC.C.\u201d) 3303.01 as \u201can establishment which features totally nude, topless, bottomless, strippers, male or female impersonators, or similar entertainment or services which are obscene or harmful to juveniles as defined by Ohio Revised Code Section 2907.01(E) and (F) and Columbus City Codes Section 2307.01(E) and (F).\u201d C.C. 3303.01 has recently been amended, although the amendment is not relevant to the present matter. \u201cBottomless\u201d is defined in the code to mean \u201cless than a full opaque covering of male or female genitals, pubic area or buttocks.\u201d Id. at C.C. 3303.02. \u201cTopless\u201d is defined to mean \u201cless than a full opaque covering below the top of the nipple.\u201d Id. at C.C. 3303.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">{\u00b6 3} Mike Farrenkopf, an investigator for the Columbus Building and Development Code Enforcement Section, visited Kahoots twice in June 1999. In his first visit to Kahoots, Farrenkopf sat in a large dining room with booths on either side. In the middle of the room, he \"witnessed several female dancers wearing bikinis or thong-type bikini bottoms. He described the bikinis as having very little back covering so as to expose the dancers\u2019 buttocks. He also testified that he witnessed dancers performing topless. He witnessed several of the dancers going into another room north of the main dining room (\u201cthe Safari Room\u201d), in which the dancers removed their bikini tops and danced for a patron. Farrenkopf later witnessed a parade of dancers coming out of the Safari Room and into the main dining room. During that parade, several dancers\u2019 jackets opened up thereby exposing their breasts or nipples. In his second visit to Kahoots, Farrenkopf was taken to another room, the Champagne Room, where patrons could watch topless dancing for an extended period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">{\u00b6 4} As a result of these visits, appellant was served with a Zoning Code Violation Order, alleging that Kahoots was operating an adult entertainment establishment in violation of the CPDD. At a hearing before the BZA, appellant argued that, pursuant to the former C.C. 3303.01, there must be a determination that any topless or bottomless dancing was \u201cobscene or harmful to juveniles\u201d for Kahoots to be classified as an adults-only entertainment establishment. In contrast, the city of Columbus (\u201cthe city\u201d) contended that Kahoots was an adults-only entertainment establishment because it featured topless or bottomless dancing. The city argued that the phrase \u201cobscene or harmful to juveniles\u201d contained in former C.C. 3303.01 modified only the words \u201csimilar entertainment or services\u201d and did not modify the words \u201ctopless\u201d or \u201cbottomless.\u201d A majority of the BZA determined that appellant was operating an adults-only entertainment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>establishment and, accordingly, was in violation of the CPDD. No evidence was presented to establish that the conduct at issue was obscene or harmful to juveniles, and the BZA made no such determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">{\u00b6 5} Appellant appealed that decision to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, which affirmed the BZA\u2019s decision. The lower court determined that the definition of an adults-only entertainment establishment contained in former C.C. 3303.01 was not ambiguous. The court further concluded that proof of topless or bottomless dancing was sufficient to meet the definition of an adults-only entertainment establishment, and the city did not need to prove that the dancing was obscene or harmful to juveniles to establish a violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">{\u00b6 6} Appellant now appeals, assigning the following error:</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe common pleas court erred in sustaining the decision of the city of Columbus Board of Zoning Appeals interpreting the Columbus City Code in a way that justified the conclusion that on the two dates in question the activity observed in appellant\u2019s place of business constituted \u2018adult entertainment\u2019 as defined in said code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">{\u00b6 8} Initially, we note that appellant\u2019s appeal is from a decision of the BZA that is governed by R.C. Chapter 2506. The standard of review in such a case has been set forth by the Ohio Supreme Court as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c* * * In an R.C. Chapter 2506 administrative appeal of a decision of the board of zoning appeals to the common pleas court, the court, pursuant to R.C. 2506.04, may reverse the board if it finds that the board\u2019s decision is not supported by a preponderance of reliable, probative and substantial evidence. An appeal to the court of appeals, pursuant to R.C. 2506.04, is more limited in scope and requires that court to affirm the common pleas court, unless the court of appeals finds, as a matter of law, that the decision of the common pleas court is not supported by a preponderance of reliable, probative and substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Kisil v. Sandusky </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 30, 34, 12 OBR 26, 465 N.E.2d 848. See, also, <em>Elbert v. Bexley Planning Comm. </em>(1995), 108 Ohio App.3d 59, 66, 670 N.E.2d 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">{\u00b6 10} Appellant contends in its sole assignment of error that, in order to satisfy the definition of adults-only entertainment establishment, there must be a showing that the establishment featured conduct of the type listed in the code provision and a showing that such conduct was obscene or harmful to juveniles. Because the city presented no proof that the topless or bottomless dancing at issue was obscene or harmful to juveniles, and because the BZA made no such determination, appellant argues that it was error to find Kahoots an adults-only entertainment establishment under former C.C. 3303.01. Appellant does not challenge the constitutionality of this code section.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>{\u00b6 11} The city argues that the phrase \u201cobscene or harmful to juveniles\u201d modifies only the last category of conduct identified in the code provision\u2014 \u201csimilar entertainment or services\u201d; therefore, the BZA was not required to find that the topless and bottomless conduct at issue here was obscene or harmful to juveniles. According to the city, it is irrelevant that the words \u201cnude,\u201d \u201ctopless\u201d and \u201cbottomless,\u201d as they appear in C.C. 8303.01, are adjectives that do not appear to modify a particular noun. The city reasons that, because the dancers in question performed in a manner fitting the code\u2019s definition of \u201ctopless\u201d and \u201cbottomless,\u201d the entertainment in question constituted \u201cadults only entertainment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">{\u00b6 12} The validity of appellant\u2019s argument turns on the interpretation of former C.C. 3303.01, which defines \u201cadults only entertainment establishment.\u201d Because zoning regulations constitute derogation of a person\u2019s property rights, they should' be given a fair and reasonable construction with due regard for the conflicting interests involved. <em>State ex rel. Scadden v. Willhite </em>(Mar. 26, 2002), Franklin App. No. 01AP-800, 2002 WL 452472. A court should give the words in a zoning regulation the meaning commonly attributed to them unless a contrary intention appears in the regulation. <em>Akwen, Ltd. v. Ravenna Zoning Bd. of Appeals </em>(Mar. 29, 2002), Portage App. No. 2001-P-0029, 2002 WL 480041. The meaning of the relevant provisions of the code must be derived from the \u201ccontext of the entire ordinance.\u201d <em>Scadden, </em>supra, citing <em>In re Univ. Circle, Inc. </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 180, 184, 10 O.O.3d 346, 383 N.E.2d 139. Nevertheless, where there is ambiguity, courts must strictly construe restrictions on the use of real property in favor of the property owner. <em>Saunders v. Clark Cty. Zoning Dept. </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 259, 261, 20 O.O.3d 244, 421 N.E.2d 152; <em>Mishr v. Poland Bd. of Zoning Appeals </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 238, 241, 667 N.E.2d 365; <em>BP Oil Co. v. Dayton Bd. of Zoning Appeals </em>(1996), 109 Ohio App.3d 423, 432, 672 N.E.2d 256; <em>Liberty Sav. Bank v. Kettering </em>(1995), 101 Ohio App.3d 446, 451, 655 N.E.2d 1322. This is because such restrictions are in derogation of the common law and deprive a property owner of certain uses of his land to which he would otherwise be lawfully entitled. <em>Saunders, </em>supra, 66 Ohio St.3d at 261, 20 O.O.3d 244, 421 N.E.2d 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">{\u00b6 13} When an ordinance is unambiguous and conveys a clear meaning, a court must only read and follow the words of the ordinance. See <em>Fairborn v. DeDomenico </em>(1996), 114 Ohio App.3d 590, 593, 683 N.E.2d 820; <em>State v. Waddell </em>(1995), 71 Ohio St.3d 630, 631, 646 N.E.2d 821. In such a case, there is no need to apply the rules of construction. <em>Cline v. Ohio Bur. of Motor Vehicles </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 93, 96, 573 N.E.2d 77; <em>BP Oil Co., </em>supra. An ordinance is ambiguous when it is subject to various interpretations. Id. Specifically, an ambiguity exists if a reasonable person can find different meanings in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>ordinance and if good arguments can be made for either of two contrary positions. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">{\u00b6 14} Appellant contends that the phrase \u201cobscene or harmful to juveniles\u201d modifies all that precedes it, both the catchall category of \u201csimilar entertainment or services\u201d and the words \u201ctotally nude, topless, bottomless, strippers, male or female impersonators.\u201d Appellant points out that other adult-themed prohibitions in the CPDD, such as adult bookstores and adult motion picture theaters, require a showing that the majority of the establishment\u2019s income be derived from adult material which is obscene or harmful to juveniles. Therefore, appellant argues that the subject code provision should also be read to require a showing of obscenity or harm to juveniles to prove an adults-only entertainment establishment. Furthermore, appellant contends that the phrase \u201cobscene or harmful to juveniles\u201d must apply to all of the conduct listed in the subject code provision because it would be illogical to classify all male or female impersonators as adults-only entertainment regardless of the type of impersonation.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">{\u00b6 15} R.C. 1.47 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cIn enacting a statute, it is presumed that:</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(A) Compliance with the constitutions of the state and of the United States is intended;</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(B) The entire statute is intended to be effective;</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(C) A just and reasonable result is intended!.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">{\u00b6 20} In determining a fair and reasonable construction of the definition of an \u201cadults only entertainment establishment,\u201d we must look at that definition in the context of the other provisions relating to adult-themed businesses. <em>Scadden. </em>Also prohibited in the CPDD are adult bookstores and adult motion picture theaters. The definitions of both of these adult businesses require a showing that they derive a majority of their income from materials which are obscene or harmful to juveniles before they are to be considered adult for purposes of the code. It is reasonable to interpret the definition of an \u201cadults only entertainment establishment\u201d to require the entertainment to be obscene or harmful to juveniles when the other adult-themed prohibitions in the code require the same showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">{\u00b6 21} Moreover, the city\u2019s preferred interpretation of the code section would result in the absurd conclusion that male or female impersonators are per se \u201cadults only entertainment.\u201d There is nothing per se \u201cadult\u201d about a male or female impersonator. Such an interpretation would include many forms of entertainment normally not associated with \u201cadult entertainment,\u201d such as the film \u201cSome Like it Hot,\u201d in which Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon dress as women, or \u201cTootsie,\u201d featuring Dustin Hoffman posing as a woman, or the musical \u201cHairspray,\u201d in which Harvey Fierstein plays a woman, or \u201cVictor/Victo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>ria,\u201d in which the lead character is a woman posing as a man performing as a woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">{\u00b6 22} Further, we must note that the city\u2019s interpretation not only flies in the face of grammatical rules but also ignores common sense. At one point the city\u2019s brief states: \u201cIn the context of the Columbus City Code, it makes perfect sense to say that one went to an adults only entertainment establishment yesterday and saw bottomless.\u201d The city\u2019s reading of the code section produces the circular conclusion that, because the dancing was adults-only entertainment, the establishment was an adults-only entertainment establishment. Yet the crux of this appeal \u2014 the question the court is being asked to decide \u2014 is what constitutes \u201cadults only entertainment\u201d and whether the code section gives adequate notice to all would-be purveyors of such entertainment. The city\u2019s reading of the code does not assist this court in answering that question but merely proposes a \u201cyou\u2019ll know a violation when you see one\u201d standard of proof. We are left with many unanswered questions: Are both topless men and women prohibited? Is it only nude, topless, or bottomless <em>dancing </em>which is proscribed, or is the exposure itself the problem? Should the word \u201centertainment\u201d in the latter part of the sentence have been inserted behind each of these adjectives? If nudity is not intended to be entertainment, would it be protected? The only reasonable interpretation of the code that would resolve this ambiguity is to read the phrase \u201cobscene or harmful to juveniles\u201d as applying to all of the preceding portions of the code section.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">{\u00b6 23} Finally, the city\u2019s interpretation of an \u201cadults only entertainment establishment\u201d would require application of a more stringent standard of proof only where the catchall category of \u201csimilar entertainment or services\u201d is implicated. It is not reasonable to require a showing that a form of entertainment is obscene or harmful to juveniles in every adult-themed prohibition in the CPDD except for \u201ctotally nude, topless, bottomless, strippers,\u201d or \u201cmale or female impersonators.\u201d The more reasonable interpretation would require topless or bottomless dancing to be obscene or harmful to juveniles in order to be categorized as \u201cadults only entertainment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">{\u00b6 24} Strictly construing the \u201cadults only entertainment establishment\u201d definition in favor of the landowner, we find that the BZA and the lower court erred as a matter of law in finding that Kahoots was an \u201cadults only entertainment establishment\u201d as that term is defined in the former Columbus City Code. A fair and reasonable construction of that definition requires that the phrase \u201cobscene or harmful to juveniles\u201d modify all that comes before it and not simply the preceding phrase \u201csimilar entertainment or services.\u201d Therefore, a showing that the activity at Kahoots was obscene or harmful to juveniles must be made before Kahoots can be considered an \u201cadults only entertainment establishment.\u201d There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>was no such finding made by the BZA or the lower court. Appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is sustained. The judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is reversed, and this matter is remanded to the BZA to determine whether the activities in Kahoots were obscene or harmful to juveniles so as to render Kahoots an \u201cadults only entertainment establishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b563-6\">McCormac, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b563-7\">Klatt, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b563-8\">John W.

Words and phrases shall be read in context and construed according to the rules of grammar and common usage. R.C. 1.42. Normally, modifying words or phrases \u201c \u2018only apply to the words or phrases immediately preceding or subsequent to the word, and will not modify the other words, phrases, or clauses more remote, unless the intent of the legislature clearly require[s] such an extension.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Bowen </em>(2000), 139 Ohio App.3d 41, 44, 742 N.E.2d 1166, citing <em>In re Shaffer </em>(N.D.Ohio 1998), 228 B.R. 892, 894. Applying this general rule of construction to the code section at issue, the phrase \u201cobscene or harmful to juveniles\u201d modifies only the category of conduct which immediately precedes it, \u201csimilar entertainment or services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">{\u00b6 26} Moreover, it should be noted that there is no comma or other connecting words between the catchall category \u201csimilar entertainment or services\u201d and the subsequent modifying phrase \u201cwhich are obscene or harmful to juveniles.\u201d The use of a comma or a connecting word, such as \u201cand,\u201d between these phrases would have indicated an intent to modify more than just the immediately preceding catchall category. <em>Edward H. Everett Co. v. Jadoil, Inc. </em>(Jan. 26, 1987), Licking App. No. CA-3211, 1987 WL 5766. Because these devices were not used, it is apparent that the modifying phrase \u201cwhich are obscene or harmful to juveniles\u201d was intended to modify only the preceding phrase \u201csimilar entertainment or services\u201d and not the more remote language contained in that code provision. <em>Bowen, </em>supra; see, also, <em>In re Bush </em>(S.D.Ohio 2000), 253 B.R. 863, 865. This court must give effect to the legislative intent reflected in the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>used. <em>State ex rel. Pennington v. Gundler </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 171, 173, 661 N.E.2d 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">{\u00b6 27} Additionally, the Supreme Court of Ohio has held that the word \u201cor\u201d indicates an alternative between different or unlike things. <em>Pizza v. Sunset Fireworks Co., Inc. </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 1, 4-5, 25 OBR 1, 494 N.E.2d 1115. These alternatives must be treated completely separate from one another. <em>Shaffer, </em>supra In C.C. 3303.01, the catchall category \u201csimilar entertainment or services\u201d is separated from the preceding list of conduct by the word \u201cor.\u201d Therefore, it appears that the \u201csimilar entertainment or services\u201d catchall category was intended to be distinct from the other conduct in that provision. <em>Bowen, </em>supra; <em>Shaffer, </em>supra. This lends further support to the city\u2019s contention that the drafters of this definition intended the phrase \u201cobscene or harmful to juveniles\u201d to modify only the catchall category.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">{\u00b6 28} This interpretation is also consistent with common sense. It is hard to imagine any form of topless or bottomless dancing that would not be considered adults-only entertainment. However, because of the broad nature of the phrase \u201csimilar entertainment or services,\u201d it is not surprising that the city sought to limit that catchall category to entertainment or services \u201cwhich are obscene or harmful to juveniles.\u201d This limitation is not necessary for topless or bottomless entertainment that, by its very nature, is adults-only. The fact that the city also defined adults-only entertainment to include \u201cmale or female impersonators\u201d does not demonstrate a different legislative intent, although the wisdom of including that category of entertainment with \u201cnude, topless, bottomless, strippers\u201d might well be questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">{\u00b6 29} Because I find that C.C. 3303.01 is unambiguous and conveys a clear and definite meaning, I would give effect to the language used. <em>Meeks v. Papadopulos </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 187, 190, 16 O.O.3d 212, 404 N.E.2d 159; <em>BP Oil Co., </em>supra. C.C. 3303.01 defines topless or bottomless entertainment as adults-only entertainment and does not require a showing of obscenity or harm to juveniles. This is the interpretation of C.C. 3303.01 utilized by the BZA and the trial court. I therefore would find no error in the trial court\u2019s affirmance of the BZA\u2019s decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
