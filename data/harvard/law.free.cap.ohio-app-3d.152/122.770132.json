Appellant asserts the following assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b153-13\">{\u00b6 2} \u201cI. The trial court improperly denied defendants [sic] motion to dismiss for lack of territorial jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-14\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cII. The trial court improperly denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress field sobriety tests and all subsequent evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-15\">{\u00b6 4} A suppression hearing commenced on March 8, 2002. Officer Robert Snow of the Sylvania Township Police Department testified that he was on duty in the early morning hours of December 7, 2001, when he observed appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>driving a^Ford vehicle very slowly on Central Avenue. Officer Snow, stating that he was concerned that appellant may have been driving in and out of closed car dealership lots, called appellant\u2019s license plate number in to his dispatcher. Officer Snow continued to follow appellant\u2019s vehicle. By the time the dispatcher responded to Officer Snow with the license plate information, Officer Snow and appellant had entered the city of Toledo. The dispatcher told Officer Snow that the plate was registered to a Mitsubishi vehicle rather than a Ford. Officer Snow then activated his overhead lights and appellant stopped his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">{\u00b6 5} Officer Snow testified that he approached the driver\u2019s side door and could smell alcohol. Officer Snow stated that appellant appeared sluggish, had bloodshot eyes, and admitted that he had been drinking. When appellant failed a series of field sobriety tests, he was arrested for driving while under the influence of alcohol and was transported to the Sylvania Township Police Department for a breathalyzer test.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">{\u00b6 6} In his first assignment of error, appellant alleges that the trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress. Specifically, appellant contends that Officer Snow\u2019s extraterritorial stop of appellant\u2019s vehicle violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">{\u00b6 7} When considering a motion to suppress, the trial court assumes the role of the trier of fact and is therefore in the best position to resolve factual questions and evaluate the credibility of a witness. <em>State v. Mills </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 357, 366, 582 N.E.2d 972. Consequently, in its review, an appellate court must accept the trial court\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by competent, credible evidence. <em>State v. Guysinger </em>(1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 592, 594, 621 N.E.2d 726. Accepting the facts as found by the trial court as true, the appellate court must then independently determine as a matter of law, without deferring to the trial court\u2019s conclusions, whether the facts meet the applicable legal standard. <em>State v. Klein </em>(1991), 73 Ohio App.3d 486, 488, 597 N.E.2d 1141.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">{\u00b6 8} The investigative stop exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement allows a police officer to conduct a brief investigative stop (a <em>\u201cTerry </em>stop\u201d) if the officer possesses a reasonable suspicion, based upon specific and reasonable facts, which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, warrants the belief that criminal behavior is imminent. <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889; <em>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce </em>(1975), 422 U.S. 873, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607; <em>State v. Andrews </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 86, 565 N.E.2d 1271.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">{\u00b6 9} Appellant contends that the trial court erroneously relied on <em>State v. Weideman </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 501, 764 N.E.2d 997, in rejecting appellant\u2019s jurisdictional argument. In <em>Weideman, </em>an officer observed a vehicle traveling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>left of center, leave the road twice, and again travel left of center. The officer, an employee of the Ravenna, Ohio Police Department, was a half mile out of his jurisdiction when he made these observations. The Ravenna officer stopped the vehicle and requested assistance from the Ohio State Highway Patrol because he was outside his jurisdiction. The Ravenna officer then observed that the driver of the vehicle had bloodshot eyes and smelled of alcohol. The driver, Weideman, was subsequently arrested by a Highway Patrol officer for driving while under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">{\u00b6 10} Weideman filed a motion to suppress, arguing that the Ravenna officer conducted an illegal stop because he was outside his jurisdiction. Citing R.C. 2935.03(A)(1), the Ohio Supreme Court noted that the Ravenna officer had violated a state statute in stopping Weideman\u2019s vehicle outside of his jurisdiction. However, employing the balancing test of <em>Wyoming v. Houghton </em>(1999), 526 U.S. 295, 119 S.Ct. 1297, 143 L.Ed.2d 408, to determine whether a governmental action violates the reasonableness requirement of the Fourth Amendment, the Supreme Court concluded that \u201c[t]he state\u2019s interest in protecting the public from a person who drives an automobile in a manner that endangers other .drivers outweighs Weideman\u2019s right to drive unhindered. These two factors demonstrate that [the officer\u2019s] violation of R.C. 2935.03 does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.\u201d Id. at 506, 764 N.E.2d 997.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">{\u00b6 11} The <em>Weideman </em>syllabus reads as follows: \u201c[W]here a law enforcement officer, acting outside the officer\u2019s statutory territorial jurisdiction, stops and detains a motorist for an offense committed and observed outside the officer\u2019s jurisdiction, the seizure of the motorist by the officer is not unreasonable per se under the Fourth Amendment. Therefore, the officer\u2019s statutory violation does not require suppression of all evidence flowing from the stop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">{\u00b6 12} The facts in the instant case are distinguishable from <em>Weideman. </em>As discussed above, the officer in <em>Weideman </em>observed defendant\u2019s vehicle leave the road twice and twice drive left of center before he conducted an investigative stop. Clearly the defendant was an immediate danger to other motorists. As stated in <em>Weideman, </em>\u201c[T]he government\u2019s interest in promoting public safety by stopping and detaining persons driving erratically outweighs the momentary restriction of the driver\u2019s freedom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">{\u00b6 13} <em>Weideman </em>also differs from the instant case in that the Ravenna officer notified the Ohio State Highway Patrol that he had made an extraterritorial stop right after he stopped the defendant\u2019s vehicle. The Ravenna officer detained the defendant until an officer with jurisdictional authority could arrive to conduct the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">{\u00b6 14} In the instant case, Officer Snow merely observed appellant\u2019s vehicle \u201cmoving kind of slow.\u201d There is no testimony suggesting that appellant\u2019s manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>of driving presented a danger to other motorists. Officer Snow had no reasonable suspicion of criminal activity on behalf of appellant until after he had left his jurisdiction. Even then there is no evidence that appellant\u2019s possession of illegal plates, a fourth-degree-misdemeanor violation, presented an imminent safety danger to other motorists. Given the lack of urgency, we see no reason why Officer Snow could not have alerted Toledo police to the general location of appellant\u2019s vehicle and allowed officers with jurisdictional authority to stop appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">{\u00b6 15} We conclude that the government\u2019s interest in making an extraterritorial stop and arrest for a fourth-degree-misdemeanor violation is minimal and outweighed by the serious intrusion upon a person\u2019s liberty and privacy that necessarily arises out of a stop and arrest. Therefore, Officer Snow\u2019s action in making an extraterritorial stop of appellant\u2019s vehicle violates the reasonableness requirement of the Fourth Amendment. Officer Snow\u2019s statutory violation in this case does require suppression of all evidence flowing from the stop. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">{\u00b6 16} In his second assignment of error, appellant contends that the court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the results of appellant\u2019s field sobriety tests. Having already determined that the trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, we find appellant\u2019s second assignment of error to be moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">{\u00b6 17} On consideration whereof, the court finds that substantial justice has not been done the party complaining, and the judgment of the Sylvania Municipal Court is reversed and remanded. Appellant\u2019s conviction is ordered vacated. Costs assessed to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b156-9\">Richard W. Knepper and Mark L. Pietrykowski, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b156-10\">George M. Glasser, J., retired, of the Sixth Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
