Wyeth (\u201cAHP\u201d), appeals from a decision of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d), which sustained a determination by appellee Roger W. Tracy, the Ohio Tax Commissioner, denying part of a corporate franchise tax refund claimed by one of AHP\u2019s subsidiaries, A.H. Robins Company, Inc. (\u201cRobins II\u201d). Robins II is the successor pursuant to bankruptcy reorganization proceedings to the original A.H. Robins Company, hereinafter referred to as \u201cRobins I.\u201d The partial denial of the refund sought by AHP and its subsidiaries was based on a denial by the commissioner of a carry-forward net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) for the last year of business for Robins I.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">{\u00b6 2} Robins II was incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of AHP for the purpose of undertaking the acquisition by AHP of the assets of Robins I, a manufacturer of prescription drugs and over-the-counter medications. Robins I, which was apparently an otherwise successful ongoing concern, was forced to seek reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code because of thousands of product liability lawsuits arising from its manufacture and distribution of an intrauterine birth control device known as the Daikon Shield. The petition for bankruptcy was filed in 1985 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Richmond Division. Because of the multiplicity of issues engendered by the Daikon Shield tort litigation, the district court retained its original jurisdiction, and the matter was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>heard before a district court judge and bankruptcy judge concurrently. Three years after the petition was filed, the court approved the sixth and final proposed reorganization plan. <em>In re A.H. Robins </em>(E.D.Va.1988), 88 B.R. 742, affirmed sub nom. <em>Menard-Sanford v. Mabey </em>(C.A.4, 1989), 880 F.2d 694, certiorari denied, and <em>Menard-Sanford v. A.H. Robins </em>(1989), 498 U.S. 959, 110 S.Ct. 376, 107 L.Ed.2d 362. The principal aspect of this plan was to create a claimants\u2019 trust that would be used to pay the product liability claims in the Daikon Shield litigation. The other ongoing businesses of Robins I were acquired by AHP through Robins II, by means of a merger of the two companies. The acquisition price included stock and a large cash payment that was used partially to fund the claimants\u2019 trust. With the exchange of stock on the effective date of merger of December 15, 1989, Robins I ceased to exist and Robins II carried on the surviving aspects of the business, free from further liability for the Daikon Shield claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">{\u00b6 3} The order entered by the bankruptcy court approving the reorganization plan provided that all assets of Robins I would be transferred to Robins II. It did not specifically mention NOL\u2019s as assets to which Robins II would succeed, although the bankruptcy court in later proceedings indicated that the property transferred to Robins II would include \u201csuch rights to use and benefit from the NOL as Robins I would have had.\u201d <em>In re A.H Robins Co. </em>(E.D.Va.1999), 235 B.R. 406, 408. None of the orders entered by the bankruptcy court identified the years or specified the amounts of such NOL\u2019s to which Robins II would succeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">{\u00b6 4} For purposes of the present case, it is important to note that the state of Ohio, as a creditor of Robins I, was fully notified of the proceedings in the bankruptcy court and given the opportunity to participate in hearings and bring objections to the reorganization plan ultimately adopted. The record reflects that the state filed no objections to the plan and did not join in subsequent appeals from the bankruptcy court\u2019s order brought by various other parties to the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">{\u00b6 5} Robins II and other AHP subsidiaries subsequently attempted to claim a deduction for Ohio franchise tax purposes for NOL\u2019s incurred by Robins I in prior years. The Tax Commissioner allowed some NOL carry forward, but disallowed those portions of the NOL based on losses incurred by Robins I during the period of January 1, 1989, through the termination of the corporation on December 15, 1989. The commissioner based this denial on the fact that, Robins I having merged out of existence on December 15, 1989, was not a \u201ctaxpayer\u201d as defined under Ohio franchise tax law for the 1990 tax year. Because Robins I was not a \u201ctaxpayer\u201d during the 1990 tax year, it could not record an NOL for the preceding year that could be transferred to, and claimed by, Robins II in subsequent years.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>{\u00b6 6} Believing that the commissioner\u2019s order contradicted the terms of the reorganization plan approved by the bankruptcy court, AHP twice sought an order from the bankruptcy court under that court\u2019s continuing jurisdiction to interpret the approved plan of reorganization. The state of Ohio and the state of New Jersey, which had also denied an NOL carryover under state tax-law grounds, filed motions to dismiss on the basis that the federal judiciary, including the bankruptcy court, was barred by the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution from exercising jurisdiction over the matter:</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">{\u00b6 <em>rjy </em>\u201cThe judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\u201d Eleventh Amendment, United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">{\u00b6 8} The bankruptcy court found the Eleventh Amendment applicable and dismissed the motions for lack of jurisdiction. <em>In re A.H. Robins Co. </em>(1999), supra; <em>In re A.H. Robins Co. </em>(E.D.Va.2000), 251 B.R. 312. These decisions contain some dicta (some of which we have quoted earlier with respect to NOL\u2019s) from which the parties to the present appeal draw, not surprisingly, diametrically opposed inferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">{\u00b6 9} AHP thereafter appealed from the commissioner\u2019s decision to the Ohio BTA. The BTA rendered a decision upholding the commissioner\u2019s determination, and AHP has timely appealed, bringing the following single assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe Ohio Board of Tax Appeals erred in sustaining the Tax Commissioner\u2019s decision to assess American Home Products Corporation, n.k.a. Wyeth, as successor in interest to A.H. Robins Company, Incorporated for its use of an Ohio Net Operating Loss acquired as part of a Bankruptcy Plan of Reorganization of A.H. Robins Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">{\u00b6 11} Several issues are raised under AHP\u2019s sole assignment of error. First, AHP asserts that the BTA erred in failing to give res judicata effect to the bankruptcy court order approving the reorganization plan, which specified that all property of Robins I (which AHP asserts would include the NOL for 1989) would be transferred to Robins II. AHP also asserts that the BTA erred in failing to acknowledge that certain Bankruptcy Code provisions, particularly 11 U.S. Bankruptcy Code Section 1123(a), would control the transfer of property and give the successor entity the right to the 1989 NOL, notwithstanding any Ohio tax law to the contrary. AHP further asserts that the BTA erred in finding that Robins I did not posses an NOL for franchise tax purposes for 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">{\u00b6 12} Our standard of review upon appeal from the BTA is simply defined: The decision of the BTA will be affirmed unless it is found to be unreasonable or unlawful. R.C. 5717.04; <em>Ohio Natl. Bank v. Franklin Cty. Bd. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number><em>of Revision </em>(Mar. 30, 2001), Franklin App. No. 00AP-1161, 2001 WL 309403. If this court finds the decision of the BTA to be unreasonable or unlawful, we may reverse the decision or modify it and enter final judgment in accordance with the modification. <em>Compuserve, Inc. v. Limbach </em>(1994), 93 Ohio App.3d 777, 782, 639 N.E.2d 1227.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">{\u00b6 13} AHP\u2019s first argument asserts that the 1988 bankruptcy court order confirmed the plan of reorganization under which all assets of Robins I, including the NOL, would be transferred to Robins II, and that principles of res judicata, specifically the doctrine of collateral estoppel, should bar any attempt by the commissioner \u201cfrom challenging the transfer of this asset.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">{\u00b6 14} The term res judicata encompasses both the doctrines of claim preclusion and issue preclusion. It is the latter which is at issue in this case. Issue preclusion, or collateral estoppel, precludes the relitigation of matters in a subsequent proceeding between the parties to a prior action or those in privity with them. <em>Whitehead v. Gen. Tel. Co. </em>(1969), 20 Ohio St.2d 108, 49 O.O.2d 435, 254 N.E.2d 10, paragraph one of the syllabus. This bar upon re-litigation applies even to instances in which a party is prepared to present new evidence or new causes of action not presented in the first action, or to seek remedies or forms of relief not sought in the first action. <em>Grava v. Parkman Twp. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 379, 383, 653 N.E.2d 226:</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cA valid, final judgment rendered upon the merits bars all subsequent actions based upon any claim arising out of the transaction or occurrence that was the subject matter of the previous action. (Paragraph two of the syllabus of <em>Norwood v. McDonald </em>[1943], 142 Ohio St. 299, 27 O.O. 240, 52 N.E.2d 67, overruled; paragraph two of the syllabus of <em>Whitehead v. Gen. Tel Co. </em>[1969], 20 Ohio St.2d 108, 49 O.O.2d 435, 254 N.E.2d 10, overruled to the extent inconsistent herewith; paragraph one of the syllabus of <em>Norwood, supra, </em>and paragraph one of the syllabus of <em>Whitehead, supra, </em>modified; 1 Restatement of the Law 2d, Judgments [1982], Sections 24-25, approved and adopted.)\u201d Id., syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">{\u00b6 16} This bar on relitigation, of course, applies even where the initial litigation forum was in federal court and subsequent litigation was undertaken in state court:</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c[A] claim litigated to finality in the United States district court cannot be relitigated in a state court when the state claim involves the identical subject matter previously litigated in the federal court, and there is present no issue of party or privity.\u201d <em>Rogers v. Whitehall </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 67, 70, 25 OBR 89, 494 N.E.2d 1387.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">{\u00b6 18} We must note, however, that the Ohio Supreme Court has not completely abandoned, despite the broadened scope of collateral estoppel enunciated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>in <em>Grava, </em>all exceptions to the general rule of issue preclusion. <em>Grava </em>specifically relied on the restatement, which itself contains exceptions that were noted by the Supreme Court in a subsequent decision:</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">{\u00b6 19} <em>\u201c[R]ecognized exceptions </em>to the <em>general rule </em>of <em>issue preclusion </em>apply to the case at bar. Specifically, 1 Restatement of the Law 2d, Judgments (1980) 273-274, Section 28, states:</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c \u2018Although an issue is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, and the determination is essential to the judgment, relitigation of the issue in a subsequent action between the parties is not precluded in the following circumstances:</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c(5) There is a clear and convincing need for a new determination of the issue (a) because of the potential adverse impact of the determination on the public interest or the interests of persons not themselves parties in the initial action, (b) because it was not sufficiently foreseeable at the time of the initial action that the issue would arise in the context of a subsequent action, or (c) because the party sought to be precluded, as a result of the conduct of his adversary or other special circumstances, did not have an adequate opportunity or incentive to obtain a full and fair adjudication in the initial action.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Williams </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 290, 295, 667 N.E.2d 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">{\u00b6 23} Keeping in mind that under <em>Williams </em>and <em>Grava </em>there will subsist many possible circumstances in which claim preclusion will not apply to issues not fully litigated or specifically passed upon in a prior action, and even those that were fully passed upon, we recognize that the scope of claim preclusion is particularly difficult to establish where the initial proceeding took place in federal bankruptcy court, because of the extraordinarily wide scope of issues typically presented in bankruptcy proceedings. This proposition was noted in <em>E. Minerals &amp; Chem. Co. v. Mahan </em>(C.A.3, 2000), 225 F.3d 330:</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cA bankruptcy case is not a discrete lawsuit. It is commenced by the filing of a petition for relief, which then provides a forum in which any number of adversary proceedings, contested matters, and claims will be litigated. Claim preclusion only bars claims arising from the same cause of action previously raised, not every conceivable claim that could have been brought in the context of a bankruptcy case over which the court would have had jurisdiction. <em>* * </em>* Claim preclusion would have a broad scope indeed if it barred every claim over which a bankruptcy court might have had jurisdiction.\u201d Id. at 337, and fn. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">{\u00b6 25} In the present case, the principal order of the bankruptcy court confirming the reorganization clearly contemplated the transfer of all assets of Robins I, including any NOL carryover to which Robins I would be entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Robins II. The BTA\u2019s determination, however, was not that there was a bar to <em>transfer </em>of the NOL, as appellant\u2019s brief seems to assert, but, rather, that no NOL could be claimed by Robins I for 1989, based upon termination of the corporation on December 15, 1989, and thus there was no NOL to which the successor corporation could succeed. As the BTA pointed out, the commissioner allowed Robins II a deduction for carry forward NOL\u2019s for taxable years prior to 1989 and only disallowed the NOL carryover for 1989 itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">{\u00b6 26} We agree with the BTA that, while the right to transfer any NOL to which Robins I was entitled is implicit in the confirmed reorganization plan, the existence and amount of an NOL for each of the various years involved is not set forth in the bankruptcy court order, and must be defined under state law. While Robins II clearly retained \u201csuch rights to use and benefit from the NOL as Robins I would have had,\u201d as the bankruptcy court stated in its 1999 decision on motions, this language is equally supportive of the converse proposition that Robins II could not succeed to any NOL rights which Robins I did not possess.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cProperty interests are created and defined by state law. Unless some federal interest requires a different result, there is no reason why such interests should be analyzed differently simply because an interested party is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding. Uniform treatment of property interests by both state and federal courts within a State serves to reduce uncertainty, to discourage forum shopping, and to prevent a party from receiving \u2018a windfall merely by reason of the happenstance of bankruptcy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Butner v. United States </em>(1979), 440 U.S. 48, 55, 99 S.Ct. 914, 59 L.Ed.2d 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">{\u00b6 28} <em>Butner </em>has been widely relied upon, albeit with differing results depending on the facts and local law, in subsequent cases involving interpretation of bankruptcy court orders. See, e.g., <em>Abele v. Phoenix Suns Ltd. Partnership </em>(C.A.9, 1995), 73 F.3d 218, 219: \u201cSince the Bankruptcy Code itself does not determine the existence and scope of a debtor\u2019s interest in property, these threshold issues are properly resolved by reference to state law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">{\u00b6 29} On the facts before us, considering applicable Ohio tax statutes, the chronology of proceedings, and the bankruptcy court\u2019s order, we conclude that res judicata does not bar the Ohio Tax Commissioner from making an independent determination of the tax matters raised and finding under Ohio law that Robins I had no NOL in 1989 to transfer to Robins II. While the bankruptcy court order approved a plan that provided in general terms that Robins II would succeed to the assets of Robins I (which can certainly be assumed to include any NOL available to Robins I), that order did not explicitly define the scope of such an NOL. Pursuant to <em>Butner, </em>we must assume that the bankruptcy court did not presume to create a tax benefit to either Robins I or Robins II that would not have existed under Ohio tax law absent the bankruptcy proceedings, at least not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>without specific delineation of such a benefit to which the Ohio tax authorities would explicitly have consented as parties to the bankruptcy proceedings. No such specific description of the NOL exists in the reorganization plan or the bankruptcy court\u2019s 1988 order adopting the plan, and thus the determination of the availability of an NOL for 1989 was properly left for determination by the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">{\u00b6 30} We next examine AHP\u2019s contention that the provisions of 11 U.S. Bankruptcy Code Section 1123(a), by operation of the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, preempts state taxation law and entitles AHP to the NOL carryover from 1989. The relevant provisions of that section of the Bankruptcy Code state as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cNotwithstanding any otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy law, a plan shall\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c(1) designate, subject to section 1122 of this title, classes of claims, other than claims of a kind specified in section 507(a)(1), 507(a)(2), or 507(a)(8) of this title, and classes of interests;</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c(2) specify any class of claims or interests that is not impaired under the plan; \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c(3) specify the treatment of any class of claims or interests that is impaired under the plan;</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c(4) provide the same treatment for each claim or interest of a particular class, unless the holder of a particular claim or interest agrees to a less favorable treatment of such particular claim or interest;</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c(5) provide adequate means for the plan\u2019s implementation, such as\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c(A) retention by the debtor of all or any part of the property of the estate;</p>\n<p id=\"b305-13\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c(B) transfer of all or any part of the property of the estate to one or more entities, whether organized before or after the confirmation of such plan;</p>\n<p id=\"b305-14\">{\u00b6 39} \u201c(C) merger or consolidation of the debtor with one or more persons;</p>\n<p id=\"b305-15\">{\u00b6 40} \u201c(D) sale of all or any part of the property of the estate, either subject to or free of any lien, or the distribution of all or any part of the property of the estate among those having an interest in such property of the estate[.] * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-16\">{\u00b641} AHP does not directly attack the BTA\u2019s interpretation of Ohio\u2019s statutory tax scheme under which the commissioner determined that neither Robins I nor Robins II was entitled to an NOL carryover based on losses incurred by Robins I in 1989. We will therefore not undertake a complete reiteration of Ohio\u2019s governing franchise tax statutes. In brief, pursuant to R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>5733.04(E), the Ohio NOL deduction is permitted only for a taxpayer\u2019s allocated and apportioned loss, as incurred during a taxable year. R.C. 5733.04 defines the term \u201ctaxpayer\u201d and \u201ctaxable year\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">{\u00b6 42} \u201c(B) \u2018Taxpayer\u2019 means a corporation subject to the tax imposed by section 5733.06 of the Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">{\u00b6 43} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">{\u00b6 44} \u201c(E) \u2018Taxable year\u2019 means the period prescribed by division (A) of section 5733.031 of the Revised Code upon the net income of which the value of the taxpayer\u2019s issued and outstanding shares of stock is determined under division (B) of section 5733.05 of the Revised Code or the period prescribed by division (A) of section 5733.031 of the Revised Code that immediately precedes the date as of which the total value of the corporation is determined under division (A) or (C) of section 5733.05 of the Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">{\u00b6 45} \u201c(F) \u2018Tax year\u2019 means the calendar year in and for which the tax imposed by section 5733.06 of the Revised Code is required to be paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">{\u00b6 46} The income from the proceeding year is used in determining a corporation\u2019s franchise tax, but only if the corporation was a \u201ctaxpayer\u201d as defined under the statute. If the corporation was not a \u201ctaxpayer\u201d on January 1 of the ensuing tax year, the proceeding period would not be a \u201ctaxable year\u201d and net income from that period would not be subject to Ohio franchise tax. The corollary which applies to the present case is that, if the corporation is not subject to Ohio franchise tax for the ensuing year, losses from the previous year could not be used as a deduction by the corporation or a successor pursuant to merger. <em>Gulf Oil Corp. v. Lindley </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 23, 30-31, 15 O.O.3d 42, 398 N.E.2d 790.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">{\u00b647} \u201cHad [the subject corporation] existed on January 1, 1975, this accounting period would have been for the fiscal and taxable year ending July 28, 1974. But [the subject corporation] was not in business on January 1, 1975. Thus the fiscal year ending July 28,1974, was not a taxable year for it under R.C. 5733.04(I)(1); consequently, these losses did not occur in a taxable year and cannot be deducted. Despite [the subject corporation\u2019s] incurring of a net operating loss, the franchise tax does not recognize the loss as a deduction. Therefore, neither it nor its successor may deduct the loss.\u201d <em>Litton Industrial Products, Inc. v. Limbach </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 169, 171, 569 N.E.2d 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">{\u00b648} Similarly, if Robins I had existed on January 1, 1990, in the present case, it would have been a taxpayer for the 1990 tax year, and the calendar year ending December 31, 1989, would have been a taxable year for Robins I. Since, however, Robins I was not in business on January 1, 1990, Robins I was not a taxpayer for the 1990 tax year, and the period of January 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>1989, to December 15, 1989, was not a taxable year for Robins I. Pursuant to <em>Gulf Oil </em>and <em>Litton, </em>the loss incurred during that period did not occur in a taxable year, and neither Robins I nor its successor, Robins II, had a right to deduct the NOL.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">{\u00b6 49} Although neither <em>Gulf Oil </em>nor <em>Litton </em>involved a bankruptcy reorganization, no distinction is made under Ohio tax law regarding the form of reorganization. Corporations merged out of existence during the course of the tax year are not \u201ctaxpayers\u201d for franchise tax purposes for losses incurred during the year in which the corporation ceased to exist, and the NOL incurred in the final year will not be carried forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">{\u00b6 50} The only distinction which could be made from a bankruptcy proceeding, and the one that is here argued by AHP, is that the language of 11 U.S. Bankruptcy Code Section 1123(a), \u201c[notwithstanding any otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy law,\u201d refers to both federal and state law and supersedes state tax law in the present case in permitting continuity of property interests without impairment deriving from the corporate transition imposed by the reorganization plan. The NOL having been enumerated as property to be transferred to the successor corporation, AHP argues, no state tax principles that would subject Robins II to a decrease in the NOL amount allowed should be permitted. We do not find this argument persuasive. There is no indication that Congress intended the Bankruptcy Code to supersede any relevant state statute which might peripherally be interpreted to conflict with a bankruptcy order, even where the statute and bankruptcy order could be harmonized, as they can in the present case. The holding in <em>Butner </em>is ample support for the concept that \u201cthere is no reason why [property interests] should be analyzed differently simply because an interested party is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding.\u201d <em>Butner </em>at 55, 99 S.Ct. 914, 59 L.Ed.2d 136. The kind of massive preemption of all state law regulating property interests, including tax law, which AHP advocates, would have imponderable consequences. By far the better reasoning, as was adopted by the BTA, is that, while property may be allocated in a bankruptcy proceeding, the extent and nature of that property, unless specifically defined, enumerated, and stipulated to before the bankruptcy court by interested parties, may yet be determined under applicable state law. We accordingly find that the BTA did not err in determining the amount of NOL applicable under state law and that this determination did not conflict with applicable provisions of the federal Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">{\u00b6 51} In summary, we find that the BTA did not err in refusing to give res judicata effect to the confirming order of the bankruptcy court; that the BTA did not err in concluding that applicable federal bankruptcy statutes did not preempt Ohio tax law on these facts; and that the BTA did not err in finding that neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Robins I nor Robins II was entitled to an NOL to be carried forward from 1989. The decision of the BTA is therefore reasonable and lawful, and is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b308-6\">Bowman and Tyack, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
