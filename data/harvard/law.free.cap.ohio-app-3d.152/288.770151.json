Rocco, Administrative Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b319-15\">{\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant Sotorios Georgakopoulos appeals from the sentence imposed upon him after he entered a guilty plea to 25 criminal counts that included engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, operating a gambling house, and money laundering.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>{\u00b6 2} Appellant asserts that his sentence is improper, arguing that the trial court failed to follow that part of the plea agreement that had been reached by the parties, and also failed to make the appropriate statutory findings before imposing upon him a term longer than the minimum one available for a first-time offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">{\u00b6 8} Since, however, appellant\u2019s arguments find no support in the record, his sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">{\u00b6 4} Appellant\u2019s sentence results from his original indictment on 107 counts. The first count alleged that appellant had violated R.C. 2923.32, engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity. The remaining counts detailed the alleged pattern of that corrupt activity: appellant and three of his family members conducted a criminal enterprise over a period of a year and a half that consisted of committing the following offenses: 21 counts of theft of money in amounts between $5,000 and $100,000, R.C. 2913.02; 21 counts of gambling, R.C. 2915.02; 21 counts of operating a gambling house, R.C. 2915.03; 42 counts of money laundering, R.C. 1815.55; and one count of possessing criminal tools, R.C. 2923.24.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">{\u00b6 5} Following the period of discovery, the parties negotiated a plea agreement. The prosecutor outlined its terms for the trial court at appellant\u2019s plea hearing: in exchange for appellant\u2019s plea of guilty to the first count, which was a first-degree felony, along with 24 of the others, the state would dismiss the remaining counts and also would recommend imposition of a sentence of the minimum amount of incarceration for the most serious offense, i.e., a total of only three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">{\u00b6 6} The prosecutor proceeded to outline the potential penalties involved with regard to the offenses to which appellant would plead guilty. As to engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, the length of incarceration ranged from the minimum three to the maximum ten years. As to the three counts of money-laundering, third-degree felonies, the length of incarceration ranged from one to five years. As to the 21 counts of operating a gambling house, all misdemeanors, appellant could be jailed for up to six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">{\u00b6 7} The prosecutor reiterated, however, that as a part of the plea agreement, \u201cat the time of sentencing * * * [t]he State would recommend that the minimum sentence be imposed on Count one [and the third-degree felony] Counts, and the minimum sentence be concurrent.\u201d In response to the trial court\u2019s subsequent query, both defense counsel and appellant acknowledged that the prosecutor accurately had set forth the \u201cunderstanding\u201d that they all had reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">{\u00b6 8} The trial court thereupon conducted a model colloquy with appellant in strict compliance with Crim. R. 11. During this exchange, appellant indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>that no \u201cpromises\u201d had been made to him with regard to the change in his plea, he understood the rights he was relinquishing, and he was aware of the potential penalties involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">{\u00b6 9} The trial court specifically asked appellant whether he understood that if sentenced \u201cto the maximum term allowable by law,\u201d he faced \u201ca total possible period of 25 years in prison.\u201d Appellant responded, \u201cYes.\u201d Appellant further indicated his understanding that, alternatively, the trial court had the authority to impose the terms concurrently rather than consecutively. \u2022 Finally, the trial court asked appellant, \u201cDo you understand there is no promise of a particular sentence?\u201d Again, appellant answered, \u2018Tes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">{\u00b6 10} Appellant at that time entered his plea of guilty to the 25 counts as agreed, which the trial court accepted. After noting that it had \u201cbeen advised there [was] a recommended sentence,\u201d the trial court scheduled appellant\u2019s sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">{\u00b6 11} The hearing took place four days later. At its outset, the trial court remarked that \u201cthe Defendant and the State ha[d] made a recommendation\u201d to it regarding sentence, but reminded the parties that it was \u201cnot bound by the recommendations,\u201d but would \u201cconsider\u201d that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">{\u00b6 12} Defense counsel proceeded to address the court. He offered reasons for the trial court to accept the recommendation, in part by asserting that appellant lacked a \u201cprior record\u201d and that the other family members also were culpable in the criminal enterprise. Counsel concluded by stating his \u201chope\u201d that the suggested sentence \u201cwould be prevailing upon the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">{\u00b6 13} The trial court then invited the prosecutor to place upon the record the police investigation of the case. According to his account, the detectives discovered that appellant had been \u201crunning Las Vegas nights\u201d at local meeting halls which had been advertised as events given on behalf of many different charities; however, the charities appellant listed either eventually became defunct, or remained unaware of the use of their names, or received only a small fraction of the money appellant collected. Appellant\u2019s enterprise, on the other hand, had deposited into its bank account over a million dollars; while appellant paid his \u201cworkers\u201d some cash, the detectives had been unable to \u201cfind\u201d a large portion of the money he had obtained through the criminal activities. The prosecutor indicated that appellant\u2019s operation \u201churt\u201d legitimate charities and those people they served.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">{\u00b6 14} During his address to the court, defense counsel indicated that appellant had accepted responsibility for his actions, and reminded the court that the state and the detectives had agreed with the recommended sentence. Neverthe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>less, in sentencing appellant, the trial court addressed him with the following observations:</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cI do believe that a minimum sentence, which was recommended to the Court, is inappropriate for the crime you committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cClearly this was organized criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cMr. Georgakopoulos, you are a financial predator. There is no other way to describe you, except to say that you preyed upon people. You are a greedy man. You are a thief.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cYou are someone who used your wit and cleaverness [sic] to steal a great deal of money from people.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cThis is a state where * * * [s]omeone who steals from a store goes to prison from two years to five years as a minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cSo three years, I think, is outrageous. You have personally profited.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cAnd I\u2019m guessing that you used illegal property through a business to pay your bond, which I believe was $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cYou had no other activity, as far as employment, other than this.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cClearly, for these reasons, the Court believes that the minimum sentence of three years is improper. It does not adequately punish you and does not certainly protect the citizens of the State of Ohio from your predator [sic] nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">{\u00b6 24} The trial court thereupon ordered appellant to serve concurrent sentences as follows: six years on count one, three years on each of the counts of money laundering, and six months on each of the counts of operating a gambling house.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-14\">{\u00b6 25} Appellant\u2019s appeal from the foregoing order of sentence presents this court with two assignments of error, which state:</p>\n<p id=\"b322-15\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cThe trial court, after agreeing to accept a negotiated plea bargain, erred by not following the negotiated plea at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-16\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cThe sentencing court errer [sic] when it sentenced the defendant to six years instead of the statutory minimum three years without any findings consistent with R.C. 2929.14(B).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-17\">{\u00b6 28} Appellant argues that the sentence he received was improper. He bases his argument on two contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-18\">{\u00b629} Initially, he contends that the trial court \u201cbreached the plea agreement\u201d; appellant makes this contention without having filed any motions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>withdraw his plea. Second, appellant contends that the trial court failed to comply with statutory requirements in imposing sentence. This court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">{\u00b6 30} Appellant acknowledges that the trial court ordinarily is vested with discretion in implementing plea agreements. <em>Akron v. Ragsdale </em>(1978), 61 Ohio App.2d 107, 15 O.O.3d 107, 399 N.E.2d 119. He claims that that principle is inapplicable in this case because the trial court became a party to the agreement in that it \u201crepresented\u201d that it would sentence him consistently with the agreement, and then \u201cengaged in ex parte communications with the prosecution regarding its decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">{\u00b6 31} Appellant, however, presents nothing to support this serious claim; moreover, nothing in the record suggests the truth of this serious claim. The record instead demonstrates that the trial court informed appellant several times prior to accepting his plea that in imposing sentence it neither could nor would be bound by the agreement reached by the parties, and, further, appellant fully understood the court\u2019s cautionary statements. Under these circumstances, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error remains unfounded. <em>State v. Darmour </em>(1987), 38 Ohio App.3d 160, 529 N.E.2d 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">{\u00b6 32} Appellant\u2019s second contention similarly lacks merit. He claims that as an offender who previously had not served a prison sentence, he did not deserve a term longer than the minimum allowable for the most serious offense. Appellant, however, presents nothing to support his claim that he is such an offender; since he did not request the preparation of a presentence report prior to the conclusion of his plea hearing, he cannot now assert that the trial court committed any error in failing to order one. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">{\u00b6 33} In any case, assuming that appellant is correct about his status, his claim remains unpersuasive. Although he additionally asserts that the trial court made neither of the necessary statutory findings to justify imposing a total term of six years, appellant points only to the judgment entry of sentence. The transcript of appellant\u2019s sentencing hearing, however, demonstrates that the trial court deviated from the minimum because it specifically found \u201cboth of the two statutorily-sanctioned reasons\u201d warranted that decision. <em>State v. Edmonson </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 324, 715 N.E.2d 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">{\u00b6 34} In accordance with R.C. 2929.14(B), the trial court stated that in appellant\u2019s case, the shortest prison term would not adequately protect the public from his financially predatory nature. The court added that a term of only three years also would not adequately punish him for the organized and venal nature of the crimes he had committed, thus clearly implying that such a term would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>demean the seriousness of his conduct. See, e.g., <em>State v. Maynard </em>(Mar. 16, 2000), Cuyahoga App. No. 75722, 2000 WL 283076.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">{\u00b6 35} For the foregoing reasons, the trial court committed no error in pronouncing sentence in this case. Appellant\u2019s assignments of error, therefore, are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">{\u00b6 36} Appellant\u2019s convictions and sentences are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b324-8\">Jambs J. Sweeney and Sean C. Gallagher, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
