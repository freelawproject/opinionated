The demeanor of the trial court before and during trial and its conduct of the proceedings raise questions as to its impartiality and ability to provide a fair trial to appellants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">{\u00b6 6} Having reviewed the record and pertinent law, we affirm the judgment of the trial court regarding Rocco Pollutro, the city\u2019s police chief at the time of the incident, but reverse its judgment regarding the city of Cleveland, and accordingly remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The apposite facts follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">{\u00b6 7} On April 10, 1998, at the opening game of the Cleveland Indians baseball season, Vernon Bellecourt, Juan Reyna, James Watson, Charlene Teters, and Zizwe Tchiguka<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> participated in a demonstration outside Jacobs Field to protest the Cleveland baseball team\u2019s use of the name \u201cCleveland Indians\u201d and its use of \u201cChief Wahoo\u201d as the team mascot.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These demonstrators marched to Jacobs Field carrying signs, then made speeches on a sidewalk outside Jacobs Field on Ontario Street, an area cordoned off with metal barricades and also surrounded by individuals from the city\u2019s community relations department, who acted as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>\u201cpeacekeepers\u201d for the demonstration. Half a dozen firemen from the city\u2019s fire department were on duty at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">{\u00b6 8} Following the march and speeches, the demonstrators attached an effigy of \u201cChief Wahoo\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and an effigy of \u201cBlack Sambo\u201d to poles. Bellecourt then poured lighter fluid on the \u201cChief Wahoo\u201d effigy and set it on fire, which the firemen promptly extinguished. Officers Daniel Nuti and David O\u2019Reilly of the Cleveland Police Department, under the order of Commander David Regetz, arrested Bellecourt, Reyna, and Tchiguka. When Watson proceeded to set the effigy of \u201cBlack Sambo\u201d on fire, the fireman also extinguished it and the officers arrested Watson and Teters. These demonstrators were handcuffed and taken to the Cleveland Police Department, where they were held for 24 hours before the police released them. Although they were arrested for the offense of aggravated arson, the city never filed charges against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">{\u00b6 9} On April 9,1999, Bellecourt, Reyna, Watson, Teters, and Tchiguka filed a complaint in the common pleas court against the arresting officers Nuti and O\u2019Reilly, then Police Chief Pollutro, and the city of Cleveland, raising several claims pursuant to Section 1983. The plaintiffs later amended their complaint, adding Commander Regetz as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">{\u00b6 10} Nuti and O\u2019Reilly subsequently moved for summary judgment, which the court granted. The city and Pollutro also moved for summary judgment, but the court denied the motion. The court, moreover, granted Regetz\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that the statute of limitations had already expired when the plaintiffs sought to add him as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">{\u00b6 11} At the trial that followed, the remaining defendants, the city of Cleveland and Pollutro, moved for a directed verdict at the close of all evidence, and the court granted that motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">{\u00b6 12} We address the plaintiffs\u2019 third assigned error first, in which they challenge the court\u2019s directed verdict in favor of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">{\u00b6 13} Under Civ.R. 50(A)(4), a motion for a directed verdict should be granted when, after construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is directed, the reviewing court finds that reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion upon the evidence submitted and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>{\u00b6 14} A motion for directed verdict raises the legal question of whether the plaintiff presented evidence legally sufficient to submit the case to the jury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the court must not consider the weight of the evidence or the credibility of the witnesses.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201c[I]f there is substantial competent evidence to support the party against whom the motion is made, upon which evidence reasonable minds might reach different conclusions, the motion must be denied.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">{\u00b6 15} Because the plaintiffs seek relief under Section 1983, our inquiry necessarily begins with a review of that statute, which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">{\u00b6 17} A Section 1983 violation must be predicated on a deprivation of constitutional rights.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, we first determine whether the city deprived the plaintiffs of a constitutional right. The plaintiffs argue that their effigy-burning is \u201cspeech\u201d protected by the First Amendment and, therefore, the arrest of them based on that conduct deprived them of their rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The city, however, contends that the police lawfully arrested the plaintiffs, arguing that it had probable cause to arrest these demonstrators based on their conduct, which was the effigy-burning.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">{\u00b6 18} Courts have long recognized that the First Amendment\u2019s protection does not end at the spoken or written word.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Obviously, not all conduct that is engaged in with an intention to express an idea warrants that protection.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">{\u00b6 19} In <em>Texas v. Johnson, </em>the United States Supreme Court considered whether burning of the American flag fell within the ambit of the First Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>ment. The court held that the proper inquiry in this context is whether the activity was \u201c \u2018sufficiently imbued with elements of communication\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to bring the First Amendment into play. The test for determination is \u201cwhether an intent to convey a particularized message was present, and whether the likelihood was great that the message would be understood by those who viewed it.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The <em>Johnson </em>court instructed that the analysis of whether a conduct is expressive for First Amendment purposes must be made in the context in which the conduct occurs. The court explained that, under this standard, it had previously recognized as expressive conduct such activities as students wearing armbands to protest American military involvement in Vietnam, a sit-in by blacks in a \u201cwhites only\u201d area to protest segregation, and picketing about a wide variety of causes.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">{\u00b6 20} Applying this analysis, the Supreme Court held in <em>Johnson </em>that flag burning is sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to implicate the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">{\u00b6 21} The First Amendment analysis in <em>Johnson, </em>however, did not end there. Where \u201cspeech\u201d and \u201cnonspeech\u201d elements are combined in the' same conduct, the court, citing <em>United States v. </em>O\u2019Brien,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> reiterated the rule that a sufficiently important governmental interest in regulating a nonspeech element of conduct can justify incidental limitations on First Amendment freedom.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This rule comes into play, however, only when the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, where \u201can interest asserted by the State is simply not implicated on the facts before us, we need not ask whether the <em>O\u2019Brien </em>test applies.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">{\u00b6 22} In the instant case, we have little difficulty identifying the communicative elements in plaintiffs\u2019 conduct of burning an effigy of Chief Wahoo. At trial, the plaintiffs offered testimony that the Cleveland Indians\u2019 mascot is seen by many in the Native American community as a discriminatory emblem which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>parodies and denigrates Native Americans and their culture. Our review of the record, which includes a videotape of the entire event, reflects that the demonstrators marched with signs and made speeches with bullhorns protesting the allegedly racist use of the Chief Wahoo mascot, before proceeding to burn the effigy of Chief Wahoo as a part of their demonstration. Under these circumstances, the demonstrators\u2019 intent to convey their perception of the racist use of the Wahoo logo is apparent. Equally obvious is the likelihood of that message being understood by those who viewed this conduct. We therefore conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 burning of the effigies was conduct \u201csufficiently imbued with the elements of communication\u201d to implicate the First Amendment.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">{\u00b6 23} The city claims to have properly arrested the plaintiffs to enforce its interest in preventing a safety hazard. However, the record shows that the demonstration took place in a paved area cordoned off with metal barricades and surrounded by police officers as well as six fire fighters equipped with fire extinguishers. Moreover, the public was rerouted away from the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">{\u00b6 24} Under these circumstances, we do not find the state\u2019s asserted interest of preventing a safety hazard implicated on the facts before us. In accordance with <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Lessin, </em>therefore, we conclude that the officers\u2019 arrest of the plaintiffs interfered with their freedom of expression guaranteed by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">{\u00b6 25} Having determined that the city violated the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights, we now address whether the plaintiffs \u2022 are entitled to relief under Section 1983. The plaintiffs, relying on <em>Canton v. Harris,</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>predicate the city\u2019s Section 1983 liability on its failure to adequately train its police personnel regarding proper responses to demonstrations involving ritual burnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">{\u00b6 26} In <em>Harris, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the inadequacy of police training may serve as a basis for Section 1983 liability, but only where the failure to train amounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the police come into contact.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">{\u00b6 27} Furthermore, the court in <em>Harris </em>explained that evidence of deliberate indifference need not be direct, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c[I]t may happen that in light of the duties assigned to specific officers or employees the need for more or different training is so obvious, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>inadequacy so likely, to result in the violation of constitutional rights, that the policymakers of the city can reasonably be said to have been deliberately indifferent to the need.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">{\u00b6 29} In applying this standard of liability, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, in <em>Bills v. Aseltine,</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>required plaintiffs to produce more than \u201cmerely colorable evidence\u201d of a city\u2019s failure to train its officers and of its deliberate indifference to the rights of individuals.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">{\u00b6 30} Here, the record indicates the plaintiffs offered evidence to show that the city inadequately trained its police officers and that that inadequacy amounted to deliberate indifference to individuals\u2019 constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">{\u00b6 31} In particular, Commander Regetz testified that he was aware of a prior demonstration at Jacobs Field in October 1997 during the World Series, where Bellecourt engaged in a similar effigy-burning activity and was arrested for it. He also testified that he did not receive any training on flag-burning or effigy-burning activities. Robert Schindler, Assistant Chief of the Cleveland Fire Department, who was on duty at the scene of the demonstration, testified that he had received no training on the constitutional issues regarding citizens\u2019 exercise of free speech involving the ritual burning of symbols such as flags or effigies. He also testified that he was unaware of any policy or protocol instituted to safeguard these rights or to protect the safety of the spectators in such events.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">{\u00b6 32} As we have determined, the First Amendment as interpreted by the courts sanctions the ritual burning of flags and other similarly symbolic objects. The city of Cleveland, which had a prior experience with effigy-burning in a similar setting, failed, however, to institute any policy safeguarding this exercise of free expression or otherwise train its safety forces for proper responses to a demonstration involving ritual burning. Instead, the city arrested individuals engaging in this protected activity for aggregated arson.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>{\u00b6 83} Our review of the record therefore indicates that the plaintiffs have at a minimum presented evidence upon which reasonable minds might reach different conclusions as to the city\u2019s Section 1983 liability based on its alleged failure to adequately train its safety forces, which amounted to deliberate indifference to individuals\u2019 rights under the law. In accordance with Civ.R. 50(A)(4), therefore, we conclude that the court erred in directing a verdict in favor of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">{\u00b6 34} Regarding Pollutro, our review of the brief submitted by the appellants indicates they do not challenge the court\u2019s directed verdict granted in favor of Pollutro, having presented no claim on appeal regarding this defendant for our review. Accordingly, we affirm the court\u2019s judgment in favor of Pollutro.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">{\u00b6 35} In their first and second assignments of error, the plaintiffs challenge, respectively, the court\u2019s granting of Regetz\u2019s motion for summary judgment and its ruling on the city\u2019s motion in limine to exclude testimony regarding the plaintiffs\u2019 participation in a prior effigy-burning demonstration.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">{\u00b6 36} The city asserts that because the appellants failed to designate these orders in their notice of appeal, this court is without jurisdiction to review either of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">{\u00b6 37} Our review of the record indicates that we lack jurisdiction to review the assigned error regarding summary judgment granted in favor of Regetz; the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of error regarding the court\u2019s ruling on the city\u2019s motion in limine, however, as we explain below, is properly before us for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">{\u00b6 38} The record shows that the notice of appeal filed in this case designated only the trial court\u2019s August 7, 2001 order granting the defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict. The appellants did not designate or otherwise refer to the order granting summary judgment in favor of Regetz that they now assign as error. This court has interpreted App.R. 3(D) to require an appellant to designate judgments or orders in the notice of appeal.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> App.R. 3(D) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">{\u00b6 39} \u201c(D) Content of the notice of appeal. The notice of appeal shall specify the party or parties taking the appeal; shall designate the judgment, order or part thereof appealed from; and shall name the court to which the appeal is taken. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>{\u00b6 40} In accordance with this rule, we have consistently declined jurisdiction to review a judgment or order that is not designated in the notice of appeal. Therefore, the plaintiffs\u2019 first assigned error relating to the summary judgment granted in favor of Regetz is not properly presented to us for an appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">{\u00b6 41} Regarding the second assignment of error, which challenges the court\u2019s granting of the city\u2019s motion in limine to exclude evidence proffered by the plaintiffs, the record reflects that the court heard arguments prior to trial on this motion but did not rule on it. During trial, after hearing additional arguments from the parties, the court orally granted the motion without journalizing any order regarding this motion. Because the court made the ruling as part of the trial, this ruling is subsumed by the court\u2019s final judgment in this case for the purposes of App.R. 3(D). Accordingly, our review of this alleged error is permitted by App.R. 3(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">{\u00b6 42} The evidence the city sought to exclude in its motion in limine related to the participation in a similar demonstration by two of the plaintiffs at a World Series game on October 23, 1997, outside Jacobs Fields. In that demonstration, these two individuals also burned an effigy and were arrested and charged with misdemeanor offenses including criminal endangering, resisting arrest, aggravated disorderly conduct, and criminal trespass. The trial court in that case subsequently acquitted them of those charges pursuant to Crim.R. 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">{\u00b6 43} The record reflects that the court granted the motion in limine because it reasoned that the October 23, 1997 arrests were made under different circumstances. It also noted that the plaintiffs in that case were arrested by police officers who, although wearing the police uniforms, were working off-duty for a private security company on the day of the incident. The court in addition stated that the plaintiffs on that occasion were arrested for different offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">{\u00b6 44} As we have explained in our analysis of the plaintiffs\u2019 third assigned error, in order to establish the city\u2019s Section 1983 liability based on inadequate training of its police officers, the plaintiffs need to show that the inadequacy amounted to deliberate indifference. Therefore, the city\u2019s prosecution of the plaintiffs for a prior identical effigy-burning activity and their subsequent acquittals is probative evidence offered to show that the city, despite its knowledge of the plaintiffs\u2019 ritual burning activities, were deliberately indifferent to their rights in failing to adequately train its safety forces for proper responses. Accordingly, we conclude that the court improperly excluded this evidence.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>{\u00b6 45} Finally, in connection with the plaintiffs\u2019 fourth assignment of error claiming the court\u2019s lack of impartiality deprived them of a fair trial, our disposition of this appeal renders moot an analysis of that claim.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">{\u00b6 46} In that assignment of error, the appellants also request, without citing any authority, that we give an instruction upon remand for a transfer of this case to the docket of a different judge. They essentially ask us to disqualify the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">{\u00b6 47} In <em>Howard Gralnick, Inc. v. </em>Turner,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> we were confronted with a similar claim and concluded that we lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review a claim of this distinction, after observing:</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cSection 5(C) of Article IV of the Ohio Constitution, reserves to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court the sole authority to pass upon the disqualification of any judge of the court of common pleas. The Supreme Court has held that a court of appeals is without authority to pass upon disqualification * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">{\u00b6 49} Similarly here, we have no subject matter jurisdiction to address the plaintiffs\u2019 request to disqualify the trial judge. This assignment is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">{\u00b6 50} Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings' consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b728-11\">Diane Karpinski, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b728-12\">Kenneth A.

In my view, the trial court properly directed the verdict because appellants did not prove that the city of Cleveland\u2019s failure to train its police officers was the result of deliberate indifference to appellants\u2019 first amendment rights. Therefore, I would affirm the judgment below. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>{\u00b6 52} There is little doubt that the burning of the effigy of the Cleveland Indians\u2019 mascot, \u201cChief Wahoo,\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> was expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment, and that appellants\u2019 arrest without probable cause to believe a crime was being committed deprived them of their First Amendment rights. In order to hold the city liable for this deprivation, however, appellants had to prove not only a violation of their constitutional rights, but also that the violation was the result of a custom or policy of the city. <em>Monell v. Dept. of Social Serv. of New York City </em>(1978), 436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611. Appellants claim that the city\u2019s failure to train its police officers in how to handle \u201critual burnings\u201d demonstrated the city\u2019s deliberate indifference to the First Amendment rights of its citizens, thus proving that the constitutional deprivation was the result of a city policy. <em>Canton v. Harris </em>(1989), 489 U.S. 378, 390, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412. In this case, however, failure to train did not show deliberate indifference.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cDeliberate indifference\u201d is a stringent standard which requires proof that the municipality disregarded a <em>known or obvious risk. Bryan Cty. Bd. of Commrs. v. Brown </em>(1997), 520 U.S. 397, 410, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 137 L.Ed.2d 626. The Supreme Court has held that there are two ways to demonstrate deliberate indifference through proof of inadequate police training. First, repeated constitutional violations in the past may demonstrate such a need for training that the municipality\u2019s failure to provide it shows a conscious disregard for the rights of its citizens. <em>Canton, </em>489 U.S. at 390, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412. Alternatively, if there is an obvious potential for constitutional violations in recurring situations, the city\u2019s failure to provide training to avoid that potential can be said to be deliberately indifferent to the need. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">{\u00b6 54} The evidence in this case showed that effigy-burning incidents occurred in the past and that police officers had received no training in how to handle such incidents. These facts alone do not demonstrate that the city was deliberately indifferent to the constitutional rights of its citizens. To satisfy this branch of the <em>Canton </em>analysis, there must be evidence that constitutional violations occurred during the prior incidents so that the city knew that training was required. There was no such evidence here.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">{\u00b6 55} Nor was the alternative branch of the <em>Canton </em>analysis met. The effigy-burning situation does not present such an obvious potential for violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>constitutional rights that the city\u2019s failure to recognize a need for training amounted to deliberate indifference. A high degree of predictability is essential to this branch of the <em>Canton </em>analysis: \u201cThe likelihood that the situation will recur and the predictability that an officer lacking specific tools to handle that situation will violate citizens\u2019 rights could justify a finding that policymakers\u2019 decision not to train the officer reflected \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 to the obvious consequence of the policymaker\u2019s choice \u2014 namely, a violation of a specific constitutional or statutory right.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>520 U.S. at 409, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 137 L.Ed.2d 626. I simply do not see any obvious likelihood that police will violate citizens\u2019 First Amendment rights if they are not specially trained in the handling of effigy burnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">{\u00b6 56} In my view, appellants did not present any evidence that the city\u2019s failure to train its police officers demonstrated a deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of its citizens. Accordingly, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment for the city on appellants\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">{\u00b6 57} I would further hold that the trial court order granting the city\u2019s motion in limine and excluding evidence of appellants\u2019 prior prosecution is a moot issue. In its cross-examination of appellant Bellecourt, the city opened the door to testimony about the prior prosecution of appellants. As a result, the prior prosecution was thoroughly explored on redirect and recross-examination. Therefore, the purported exclusion of this testimony does not justify retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">{\u00b6 58} I agree with the majority that we should not consider appellants\u2019 challenge to the order granting summary judgment to defendant Regetz, but I do not agree that we lack jurisdiction to address this question. The only jurisdictional aspect of the notice of appeal is the timing; the content can be amended within the discretion of the court of appeals and upon such terms as the court deems just. App.R. 3(A) and (E). Nonetheless, appellants did not designate this order in their notice of appeal or in any motion to amend the notice, and thus failed to apprise the defendants that they were appealing from the summary judgment. See App.R. 3(D); <em>Transamerica Ins. Co. v. Nolan </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 320, 324, 649 N.E.2d 1229; <em>Maritime Mfrs., Inc. v. Hi-Skipper Marina </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 257, 436 N.E.2d 1034. This argument involves a different defendant, a different substantive issue, and a different procedural point in the case than the order actually designated in the notice of appeal. Therefore, it would be unfair to allow appellants.to argue the issue now.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">{\u00b6 59} Finally, I agree that we lack jurisdiction to disqualify a trial judge and therefore cannot address the issue raised in appellants\u2019 fourth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">{\u00b6 60} Accordingly, I concur and dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b729-8\">.
