Mrs. Click contends that she is entitled to receive death benefits because her husband\u2019s previously allowed work-related injury caused his heart attack. We find that the affidavit of Mr. Click\u2019s psychiatrist, which Mrs. Click relies on to establish causation, is insufficient to overcome appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment because it fails to establish that he is competent to testify as to the cause of Mr. Click\u2019s heart attack. Moreover, while the psychiatrist\u2019s affidavit sets forth his conclusion regarding causation, it fails to disclose any specific facts supporting that conclusion. Accordingly, we find that the trial court properly granted summary judgment to appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>{\u00b6 2} In October 1981, while employed as a correctional officer at Southern Ohio Correctional Facility, Mr. Click suffered an industrial injury. The Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation ultimately allowed Mr. Click\u2019s benefits claim for contusion of right upper abdomen, right sacroiliac sprain with neuralgia in the right lower extremity, and dysthymic disorder (chronic depression).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">{\u00b6 3} As a result of his physical and psychological conditions, Mr. Click filed a claim for permanent total disability benefits. On December 1, 2000, Mr. Click received a letter notifying him that the Industrial Commission had denied his claim for permanent total disability. According to Mrs. Click, Mr. Click became very distressed upon learning about the rejection of his claim. In the early morning hours of December 2, 2000, Mr. Click suffered a heart attack and died.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">{\u00b6 4} Following Mr. Click\u2019s death, Mrs. Click filed a claim with the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation seeking death benefits. The Industrial Commission denied Mrs. Click\u2019s claim, and she appealed to the Scioto County Common Pleas Court. In August 2002, appellees filed motions for summary judgment, which the trial court ultimately granted. Mrs. Click appeals from that decision, raising the following assignment of error: \u201cThe trial court erred in granting appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment and denying appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment when the only evidence presented to the trial court related Mr. Click\u2019s heart attack and death to the previously recognized conditions in the claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">{\u00b6 5} In reviewing a summary judgment, the lower court and the appellate court utilize the same standard, i.e., we review the judgment independently and without deference to the trial court\u2019s determination. <em>Midwest Specialties, Inc. v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1988), 42 Ohio App.3d 6, 8, 536 N.E.2d 411. Summary judgment is appropriate when the following have been established: (1) that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact; (2) that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, that party being entitled to have the evidence construed most strongly in its favor. <em>Bostic v. Connor </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 144, 146, 524 N.E.2d 881, citing <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46; cf., also, <em>State ex rel. Coulverson v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 12, 14, 577 N.E.2d 352; Civ.R. 56(C). The burden of showing that no genuine issue exists as to any material fact falls upon the moving party in requesting summary judgment. <em>Mitseff v. Wheeler </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 112, 115, 526 N.E.2d 798. If the moving party satisfies this burden, \u201cthe nonmoving party then has a reciprocal burden outlined in Civ.R. 56(E) to set forth specific facts shoving that there is a genuine issue for trial and, if the nonmovant does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Kulch v. Structural </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number><em>Fibers, Inc. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 134, 145, 677 N.E.2d 308, citing <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 295, 662 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">{\u00b6 6} Mrs. Click contends that Mr. Click\u2019s previously allowed work-related injury was the proximate cause of his heart attack. She argues that the heart attack was a \u201cflow-through\u201d injury caused by his previously allowed condition. She also argues that the stress from reading the letter combined with the allowed physical and psychological conditions caused Mr. Click\u2019s heart attack. Moreover, Mrs. Click argues that although Mr. Click suffered from underlying coronary artery disease and/or heart disease, the previously allowed injury contributed to his heart attack. She contends that the principle of dual causation permits her to recover despite the fact that Mr. Click\u2019s underlying coronary artery disease may have also contributed to his heart attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">{\u00b6 7} Appellees argue that Mrs. Click is not entitled to receive death benefits because Mr. Click\u2019s death did not arise from his employment. Appellees contend that Mrs. Click is unable to establish the necessary causal connection between Mr. Click\u2019s employment and his heart attack. In addition, appellees argue that Mrs. Click failed to establish a prima facie case for recovery of death benefits as a result of an injury that aggravated a pre-existing medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">{\u00b6 8} To receive death benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, a claimant must establish that the employee\u2019s injury was the proximate cause of his death. <em>Murphy v. Carrollton Mfg. Co. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 585, 587, 575 N.E.2d 828, citing <em>Aiken v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1944), 143 Ohio St. 113, 28 O.O. 50, 53 N.E.2d 1018. The definition of and principles that govern the determination of proximate cause in the field of torts are equally applicable in workers\u2019 compensation cases. <em>Oswald v. Connor </em>(1985), 16 Ohio St.3d 38, 42, 16 OBR 520, 476 N.E.2d 658, citing <em>Aiken, </em>supra. \u201c[T]he proximate cause of an event is that which in a natural and continuous sequence, unbroken by any new, independent cause, produces that event and without which that event would not have occurred.\u201d <em>Aiken, </em>143 Ohio St. at 117, 28 O.O. 50, 53 N.E.2d 1018. Thus, in order to qualify for death benefits, Mrs. Click must establish that her husband\u2019s heart attack was proximately caused by his previously allowed injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">{\u00b6 9} Mrs. Click argues that her husband\u2019s heart attack is a flow-through, or residual, injury resulting from his previously allowed injury. A flow-through injury is one that subsequently develops in a body part not originally alleged under R.C. 4123.84(A)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Dent v. AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc. </em>(1988), 38 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Ohio St.3d 187, 527 N.E.2d 821. In order to receive benefits for flow-through injuries, a claimant must establish that the previously allowed injury was the proximate cause of the new injury. See <em>Fox v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1955), 162 Ohio St. 569, 55 O.O. 472, 125 N.E.2d 1, paragraph one of the syllabus. Therefore, Mrs. Click\u2019s burden under a flow-through analysis is the same as her burden for establishing her entitlement to death benefits, i.e., she must show that Mr. Click\u2019s previously allowed injuries proximately caused his heart attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">{\u00b6 10} Appellees contend that Mrs. Click failed to establish a prima facie case for recovery based on aggravation of a pre-existing disease. They argue that under such a theory, Mrs. Click must establish that Mr. Click died from a preexisting disease and that his death was substantially accelerated as a direct and proximate result of a work-related injury. In her response to appellees\u2019 summary judgment motions, which also contained a cross-motion for summary judgment, Mrs. Click argued that the legal principles of dual causation and aggravation applied to her claim. While she continues to advance the applicability of dual causation on appeal, she has abandoned her argument concerning aggravation. Mrs. Click argues that the underlying coronary artery disease and/or heart disease, previously allowed physical and psychological conditions, and stress from reading the letter combined to cause Mr. Click\u2019s heart attack. In essence, she argues that the previously allowed work-related injury was one, but not the only, proximate cause of Mr. Click\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">{\u00b6 11} Responding to appellees\u2019 summary judgment motions, Mrs. Click provided a copy of Mr. Click\u2019s death certificate and an affidavit from Dr. Borders, Mr. Click\u2019s psychiatrist.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The death certificate lists Mr. Click\u2019s immediate cause of death as acute myocardial infarction. It then lists the conditions leading to the cause of death as coronary artery disease due to diabetes. In his affidavit, Dr. Borders indicates that he had been treating Mr. Click since 1983. His affidavit states, in part: \u201c4. That Mr. Click\u2019s history includes a work-related injury on October 9, 1981 * * *. 5. That Mr. Click further suffered from dysthymic disorder or a chronic depression related to his chronic pain, his inability to adjust to his chronic pain, and nonacceptance of his inability to function with such chronic pain. 6. That due to the dysthymic disorder, Mr. Click suffered from significant distress and impairment in social, occupational, and essentially all areas of functioning. * * * 9. That although Mr. Click had no known coronary artery disease, he did have diabetes, which predisposes him to arteriosclerosis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>which may have contributed to the cause of the heart attack. 10. That it is my opinion based on a reasonable degree of medical and psychiatric certainty that the dysthymic disorder and chronic pain contributed to a pre-existing coronary artery disease and/or heart disease thereby contributing to the heart attack and resulting death. 11. That based on a reasonable degree of medical and psychiatric certainty the dysthymic disorder and chronic pain contributed to Mr. Click\u2019s death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">{\u00b6 12} When an expert\u2019s affidavit is offered to support or oppose summary judgment, the affidavit must comply with Civ.R. 56(E) as well as Evid.R. 702 through 705, which govern expert opinion testimony. <em>Lawson v. Song </em>(Sept. 23, 1997), Scioto App. No. 97CA2480, 1997 WL 596293. See, also, <em>Naugle v. Campbell Soup Co. </em>(June 20, 1986), Henry App. No. 7-84-24, 1986 WL 7312; <em>Miltenberger v. Exco Co. </em>(Nov. 23, 1998), Butler App. No. CA98-04-087,1998 WL 812910. Under Civ.R. 56(E), an affidavit must be based on personal knowledge, set forth facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant is competent to testify as to the matter. In order to be competent to testify about a matter, an expert witness must have sufficient knowledge, skill, experience, training, and education in the subject matter of his or her testimony to satisfy Evid.R. 702. See Evid.R. 702(B); <em>Ratliff v. Morekead </em>(May 19, 1998), Scioto App. No. 97CA2505, 1998 WL 254031.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">{\u00b6 13} The only evidence offered to establish a causal connection between Mr. Click\u2019s previously allowed work-related injury and his heart attack is the affidavit of Dr. Borders, Mr. Click\u2019s psychiatrist. In his affidavit, Dr. Borders indicates that Mr. Click\u2019s previously allowed injury contributed to his death. However, Dr. Borders\u2019s affidavit does not affirmatively establish any specialized training, skill, experience, or knowledge regarding heart attacks. While Dr. Borders is a licensed medical doctor, \u201c[a] mere showing that the physician is licensed does not always satisfy the requirement that the witness be \u2018qualified by specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ratliff </em>quoting Evid.R. 702. Dr. Borders\u2019s affidavit indicates that he possesses specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education in the field of psychiatry. However, the affidavit does not affirmatively establish that Dr. Borders is qualified to offer an opinion above and beyond Mr. Click\u2019s psychiatric treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">{\u00b6 14} Moreover, while Dr. Borders concludes that Mr. Click\u2019s previously allowed injury contributed to his death, he fails to set foi\u2019th any specific facts supporting that conclusion. As we recognized in <em>White v. Turner, </em>Scioto App. No. 01CA2802, 2002-Ohio-116, 2002 WL 59632, at \u00b6 4, \u201cConclusory allegations are insufficient to overcome a properly supported summary judgment motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>{\u00b6 15} We conclude, therefore, that Dr. Borders\u2019s affidavit does not provide competent evidence as to causation, which is the essential issue in this case. Because Mrs. Click failed to present a genuine issue for trial, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b597-5\">Peter B.
