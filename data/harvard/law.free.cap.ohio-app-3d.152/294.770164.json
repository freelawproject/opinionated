In his seven assignments of error, he contends as follows: (1) that his prosecution for the offenses was barred by the statute of limitations; (2) that retroactive application of the amendment to R.C. 2901.13(A)(3), effective March 9, 1999, enlarging the statute of limitations from six to twenty-two years for the indicted offenses, violates Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution; (3) that his defense counsel was ineffective; (4) that his convictions were against the weight and sufficiency of the evidence; and (5) that his adjudication as a sexual predator was against the weight and sufficiency of the evidence. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>The victim of the charged offenses testified at trial that, on November 19, 1993, about 4:45 a.m., a man broke into her apartment in downtown Cincinnati while she slept. The intruder pulled off her blanket and placed a knife, obtained from her kitchen, to her throat. As she struggled to defend herself, she sustained severe cuts to her hands and fingers. The intruder then forcibly raped her. When he left the victim\u2019s apartment, her assailant took a portable stereo, a jacket, and the knife, which was never recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">{\u00b6 3} Police responded to the victim\u2019s 911 call. She was transported to University Hospital, where a doctor, assisted by a nurse, conducted a pelvic examination. The nurse collected the victim\u2019s underwear, saliva, and hair specimens and took vaginal and rectal swabs. The victim receiyed stitches for the cuts to her fingers and hands. She subsequently underwent three months of therapy for her emotional injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">{\u00b64} The victim could not identify the intruder except for his race and height. The coroner\u2019s laboratory analyzed the evidence gathered at the hospital and froze the specimens taken from the victim, labeling them \u201cunidentified suspect.\u201d No arrests were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">{\u00b6 5} However, in 1997, by means of access to the FBI\u2019s computer-based DNA index system and a new method of DNA testing known as Short Tandem Repeat, the coroner\u2019s laboratory conducted new tests of unsolved case samples and searched DNA profiles. A semen sample taken from the victim matched Crooks\u2019s DNA profile, which had been collected in connection with another offense and placed in the statewide database of known offenders. For confirmation, the coroner\u2019s laboratory requested a second sample from Crooks, who was, at the time, incarcerated in the penitentiary for a burglary conviction. The second sample also matched his DNA profile. By a search warrant, police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>obtained a saliva sample from Crooks that matched the specimens taken from the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">{\u00b6 6} At trial, the state\u2019s witness, a criminalist with the coroner\u2019s office, testified that the gene profile occurs at approximately \u201cone and 25 quintillion, 330 quadrillion calculation or one in 54 quadrillion, 640 trillion African American individuals.\u201d The criminalist offered his opinion, based upon his calculations and the fact that \u201c[t]here are approximately six billion people in the world, [that] unless Rodney Crooks has an identical twin, * * * the semen from this case came from him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">{\u00b6 7} Crooks\u2019s defense, outlined in his counsel\u2019s opening statement, was that the victim had consented to have sex with him. Crooks testifi\u00e9d that the victim had invited him to her apartment and that \u201cone thing [had] led to another.\u201d He said, \u201cI attempted, you know, to seduce her and she willingly, she willingly accepted it.\u201d The victim testified that she did not know and had never met Crooks.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">{\u00b6 8} The jury found Crooks guilty of count one, charging aggravated robbery, count four, charging aggravated burglary and accompanied by a physical-harm specification, and count seven, charging rape. The trial court dismissed counts five and six, pursuant to Crooks\u2019s pretrial motion, and the state dismissed by nolle prosequi counts two and three and the accompanying specifications. The trial court deferred sentencing for two weeks and ordered a presentence investigation report and a victim-impact statement. The trial court adjudicated Crooks a sexual predator following a sexual-offender-classification hearing. The court then sentenced Crooks to three indefinite ten-to-twenty-five-year terms of actual confinement, to run consecutively with an aggregate minimum sentence of fifteen years for the criminal convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">{\u00b6 9} In his first and second assignments of error, Crooks argues that because the statute of limitations for felonies was six years at the time of commission of the offenses for which he was indicted, retroactive application of the amended version of R.C. 2901.13(A)(3), effective March 9, 1999, which enlarged the statute of limitations to twenty-two years for these offenses, violated Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">{\u00b6 10} A statute violates Section 28, Article II of the state Constitution, prohibiting the enactment of retroactive laws, if it \u201ctakes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability, in respect to transactions or considerations already past.\u201d <em>Van Fossen v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co. </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 100, 106, 522 N.E.2d 489; see <em>State v. Cook </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 404, 409, 700 N.E.2d 570. To determine whether criminal conduct occurring prior to the effective date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>of a statute or amendment is subject to retroactive application, the Ohio Supreme Court has promulgated a two-part test: (1) is there a \u201c \u2018clearly expressed legislative intent\u2019 that a statute apply retroactively\u201d and, if so, (2) is the statute substantive or remedial? <em>State v. Walls, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 437, 2002-Ohio-5059, 775 N.E.2d 829, \u00b6 10, citing <em>State v. Cook, </em>83 Ohio St.3d at 410, 700 N.E.2d 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">{\u00b6 11} Without a \u201cclear indication\u201d of a legislative intent that a statute be applied retroactively, it may be applied only prospectively. See id. at 440, 775 N.E.2d 829; see, also, R.C. 1.48. Section 3 of H.B. 49, effective March 9, 1999, which amended R.C. 2901.13, states that the amendment \u201capplies to an offense committed prior to the effective date of this act if prosecution for that offense was not barred under section 2901.13 of the Revised Code as it existed on the day prior to the effective date of this act.\u201d Because the prior six-year statute of limitations did not bar the prosecution of Crooks for his November 19, 1993 offenses before November 19, 1999, the clearly expressed legislative intent is that amended R.C. 2901.13(A)(3) be applied retroactively to the offenses in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">{\u00b6 12} Remedial laws are \u201cthose laws affecting merely \u2018the methods and procedure[s] by which rights are recognized, protected and enforced, not * * * the rights themselves.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State v. Walls, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 437, 2002-Ohio-5059, 775 N.E.2d 829, \u00b6 15. Crooks attempts to distinguish <em>Walls, </em>contending that a statute of limitations is a substantive right, unlike the juvenile bindover statute, which is strictly procedural. There is clear authority, however, that \u201c[sjtatutes of limitations are remedial in nature and may be generally classified as procedural legislation.\u201d <em>Gregory v. Flowers </em>(1972), 32 Ohio St.2d 48, 61 O.O.2d 295, 290 N.E.2d 181, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">{\u00b6 13} Amended R.C. 2901.13(A)(3) does not redefine the offenses for which Crooks was indicted or increase the penalties. It only enlarges the time for prosecution to accommodate new technology that has been recognized by the General Assembly as scientifically reliable and relevant. See R.C. 2901.07 (requiring DNA collection from offenders sentenced to incarceration). The purpose of the statute of limitations is to prevent stale claims and to preserve evidence that is pertinent to the issues. See <em>Wargetz v. Villa Sancta Anna Home for the Aged </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 15, 16-17, 11 OBR 49, 462 N.E.2d 1215. Where the evidence is preserved and remains fresh by a freezing process until it can be submitted for DNA analysis, the amendment of the statute of limitations to increase the period for prosecuting felonies was remedial, because the purpose of the statute of limitations was not affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">{\u00b6 14} Accordingly, the General Assembly\u2019s retroactive application of R.C. 2901.13(A)(3), extending the statute of limitations from six to twenty-two years for the offenses at issue, was remedial and did not infringe on Crooks\u2019s substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>tive rights in violation of Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. The first and second assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">{\u00b6 15} In his third assignment of error, Crooks argues that his counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge the chain of custody of the semen sample collected from the victim at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">{\u00b6 16} A reviewing court may not reverse a conviction for ineffective assistance of counsel unless the defendant shows first that counsel\u2019s performance prejudiced the defense so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. See <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), <em>466 </em>U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. When a convicted defendant complains of ineffectiveness of counsel\u2019s assistance, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d Id. at 687-688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. There is a strong presumption that an attorney\u2019s representation fell within the \u201cwide range of reasonable professional assistance,\u201d because there are many ways to provide effective counsel. Id. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; see <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 142, 538 N.E.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">{\u00b6 17} The burden was on the state to prove to a reasonable certainty that substitutions, alterations, or tampering with the semen and saliva samples did not occur before they were tested. See <em>State v. Moore </em>(1973), 47 Ohio App.2d 181, 183, 1 O.O.3d 267, 353 N.E.2d 866. But a challenge by the defense to the DNA test results would have been a specious strategy in light of Crooks\u2019s admission that he had had sex with, and thus, we may presume, had transferred his semen to, the victim. The third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">{\u00b6 18} The fourth and fifth assignments of error, in which Crooks challenges the weight and sufficiency of the evidence, are equally untenable. Our review of the record fails to persuade us that the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that Crooks\u2019s convictions for aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary, and rape must be reversed and a new trial ordered. See <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541. The state made a persuasive case that the sexual activity was not consensual, as Crooks claimed, based upon the victim\u2019s testimony and the physical evidence, including the knife cuts to the victim\u2019s hands and fingers. The weight to be given this evidence and the credibility of the witnesses were primarily for the trier of fact to determine. See <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">{\u00b6 19} The record also contains substantial, credible evidence from which to conclude that the state proved all elements of the charged crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State v. Herring </em>(2000), 94 Ohio St.3d 246, 252, 762 N.E.2d 940. Accordingly, we overrule the fourth and fifth assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>{\u00b6 20} Finally, Crooks contends in his sixth and seventh assignments of error that the trial court\u2019s finding that he was a sexual predator was against the weight and sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">{\u00b6 21} A sexual predator is defined as \u201ca person who has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to committing a sexually oriented offense and is likely to engage in the future in one or more sexually oriented offenses.\u201d R.C. 2950.01(E). The state must prove by clear and convincing evidence that an offender is a sexual predator. See R.C. 2950.01(E) and 2950.09(B)(3); see, also, <em>State v. Eppinger </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 158, 165, 743 N.E.2d 881. \u201cClear and convincing evidence\u201d is defined as \u201cthat measure or degree of proof which will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to the allegations sought to be established. [The degree of proof] is intermediate, being more than a mere preponderance, but not to the extent of such certainty as is required beyond a reasonable doubt as in criminal cases. It does not mean clear and unequivocal.\u201d Id. at 164, 743 N.E.2d 881, quoting <em>Cross v. Ledford </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 469, 477, 53 O.O. 361, 120 N.E.2d 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">{\u00b622} In determining whether an offender, convicted of a sexually oriented offense, is a sexual predator, the trial court must consider the legislative guidelines in R.C. 2950.09(B)(2). But the weight, if any, assigned to each factor is within the trial court\u2019s discretion. See <em>State v. Thompson, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 587, 752 N.E.2d 276. In <em>Eppinger, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court established a model sexual-offender classification hearing, intended to ensure a fair hearing and to assist appellate review. This model requires the trial court to (1) create a clear, accurate, and comprehensive record for review, (2) appoint an expert, if necessary, to assist in the determination concerning the offender\u2019s likelihood of recidivism, and (3) discuss on the record the particular evidence and factors of R.C. 2959.09(B) upon which it has relied in determining the offender\u2019s likelihood of recidivism. See <em>State v. Eppinger, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 166, 743 N.E.2d 881; see, also, <em>State v. Lewis, </em>1st Dist. No. C-010274, 2001-Ohio-3915, 2001 WL 1635763.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">{\u00b6 23} At his sexual-offender classification hearing, Crooks was present with his counsel. The state offered into evidence the presentence investigation, the victim-impact statement, and Crooks\u2019s previous criminal record, which included felony convictions for aggravated burglary, a 1993 conviction for burglary and the subsequent revocation of probation for that offense, possession of criminal tools, theft, and convictions for various misdemeanors. Other than his own statement to the trial court, Crooks produced no evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">{\u00b6 24} The trial court accompanied its finding that Crooks was a sexual predator with the following tongue lashing: \u201cYou are a little creep who is a sexual predator. You\u2019re a rapist and a creep and deserve to be locked up forever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>because <em>you\u2019re </em>rotten. You concocted this most ridiculous testimony. * * * I\u2019ve considered under 2950.09(B)(3), all those factors. Of course, I think probably the nature of this charge and the breaking and entering \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s a classic kind of, you know, kind of like a Hollywood rape, the classic thing that all women are afraid of. * * * If that isn\u2019t a sexual predator, I don\u2019t know what it is. The Supreme Court, Court of Appeals would be idiots not to find him a sexual predator. They would be fools. * * * His criminal record is important too under B. And, again he\u2019s a burglar. He\u2019s done it before. It\u2019s shown that burglars are people that often commit rapes, just the whole nature of the offense. Based on that, I\u2019m finding that he\u2019s a sexual predator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">{\u00b6 25} The trial court also wrote in its judgment entry adjudicating Crooks a sexual predator, under the section for findings, \u201cclassic rape, where the defendant broke into the apartment of a stranger &amp; brutally raped and cut her. He had a prior conviction for aggravated burglary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">{\u00b6 26} The trial court\u2019s scolding of Crooks and the statements in the judgment entry do not rise to the level of the considered analysis contemplated in <em>Eppinger. </em>Although the trial court\u2019s feelings of outrage are justified, its rhetorical hyperbole tends to undercut the purpose of R.C. Chapter 2950, which, it should be remembered, is remedial, and not punitive, legislation. See <em>State v. Eppinger, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 165, 743 N.E.2d 881. To be sure, the nature of the offenses and Crooks\u2019s behavior were reprehensible, but the issue for the trial court was not whether Crooks was deserving of punishment, but whether the evidence clearly and convincingly demonstrated that, as an offender convicted of committing a sexually oriented offense in 1993, he was currently likely to reoffend. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">{\u00b627} Although the trial court departed from the <em>Eppinger </em>model, some of its stated reasons were consistent with the guidelines of R.C. 2950.09(B)(2). To determine whether the trial court\u2019s finding of the offender\u2019s likelihood of reoffending is supported by clear and convincing evidence, an appellate court must conduct its own review of \u201cthe evidence in the transcripts, victim impact statements, presentence investigation reports, prior history of arrests and convictions, age, etc., presented at the sexual offender classification hearing with respect to R.C. 2950.09(B)(2) factors.\u201d Id. at 162, 743 N.E.2d 881.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">{\u00b6 28} Accordingly, we are able to distill from the record ample evidentiary material to justify the trial court\u2019s belief that Crooks was likely to engage in one or more sexually oriented offenses in the future. See R.C. 2950.09(E). The trial court correctly considered Crooks\u2019s prior criminal record, which included his probation violation. Crooks was also currently serving a prison term in the penitentiary. See R.C. 2950.09(B)(2)(b). The victim\u2019s testimony demonstrated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>his cruelty against her, as Crooks broke into the privacy of her bedroom, forced himself upon her at knifepoint, and cut her in the course of the struggle. See R.C. 2950.09(B)(2)(i). Then after he had raped her, he stole her property before leaving her apartment. At the sexual-offender classification hearing Crooks, who had been twenty-six years old when he committed these offenses, maintained his innocence. He presented no testimony by a psychiatric or psychological expert and no evidence that he had attended sex-offender, behavior-modification, or rehabilitation programs of any kind while imprisoned. His trial testimony and his comments to the trial court at the sexual-offender-classification hearing were indicative of a person who functioned in a state of denial, with a total lack of remorse despite the physical and emotional injuries his offenses caused the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">{\u00b6 29} We find that there was clear and convincing evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that Crooks was a sexual predator. The sixth and seventh assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">{\u00b6 30} Therefore, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b334-8\">Doan, P.J., and Hildebrandt, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
