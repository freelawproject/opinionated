No. 45770) and taxpayers\u2019 (2d Civ. No. 46036) actions consolidated herein. At issue is the meaning of \u201cconvicted\u201d or \u201cconviction\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> under California law for purposes of exclusion from public office.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">On July 27, 1974, the Lieutenant Governor of California, Ed Reinecke, was found guilty of perjury (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621) by a jury in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">On July 29, appellants filed a taxpayers\u2019 action (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 526a) against respondents Reinecke, Controller Houston Flournoy and the State of California to enjoin the payment of Reinecke\u2019s salary and to require him to return to the state any compensation received after July 27. Appellants also requested respondent Attorney General Younger to initiate quo warranto proceedings (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 803) to remove Reinecke from office. Appellants claimed that rendition of the jury verdict disqualified Reinecke from holding office and receiving a salary because the jury verdict constituted a \u201cconviction\u201d under the provision of the California Constitution and implementing legislation providing for exclusion from office of persons \u201cconvicted\u201d of perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">On that same day, Governor Ronald Reagan requested respondent Attorney General to render \u201can official written opinion\u201d on the meaning of \u201cconviction\u201d and its effect on Reinecke\u2019s status. On August 1, the Attorney General issued his opinion. The opinion basically concluded that a guilty verdict was not a \u201cconviction\u201d for the purpose of exclusion from public office and that until a judgment was rendered, Reinecke would not be convicted and would be entitled to remain in office and receive his salary. (See 57 Ops. Cal.Atty. Gen. 374 (1974).)</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">On August 2, the Attorney General informed appellants he would not institute quo warranto proceedings as requested. On August 5, appellants then applied to the Attorney General for leave to sue Reinecke in quo warranto (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 803; tit. 11, Cal. Admin. Code). Their request was denied on August 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>The following day, appellants filed with the Supreme Court an original petition for writ of mandate to compel the Attorney General to grant appellants leave to sue Reinecke in quo warranto. In their papers filed with the court, both parties stressed that the issue was one of law. On August 28, the Supreme Court refused to hear the case. It issued an \u201cOrder Denying Alternative Writ.\u201d The order stated in full: \u201cPetition for writ of mandate denied. This order is final forthwith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">On September 5, appellants filed in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County a petition for writ of mandate involving the identical parties and seeking the same relief as was sought in the Supreme Court. Respondents Reinecke and Attorney General Younger filed answers. The Attorney General also filed a demurrer. On September 16, Judge Lucas sustained the demurrer without leave to amend on the ground that the Supreme Court\u2019s denial of the alternative writ of mandate was \u201ca decision on the merits and the matter in this court [was] res judicata.\u201d On September 17, appellants filed their appeal (2d Civ. No. 45770) from the ensuing order of dismissal in the mandate proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">On September 27, Reinecke\u2019s motions for a judgment of acquittal, a new trial and arrest of judgment were denied by the federal district court. On October 2, Reinecke was sentenced<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (placed on probation). Upon sentencing, he resigned from all public offices.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">On October 21, respondents Reinecke, Flournoy and the State of California demurred and moved to strike portions of appellants\u2019 taxpayers\u2019 suit. On November 1, Judge Goebel sustained the demurrer without leave to amend<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on the ground that \u201c[f]or purposes of Article XX, Section 11 of California Constitution and Government Code Sections 1021 and 3000, \u2018conviction\u2019 is as defined in Government Code Section 1770(h), to wit, \u2018when trial court judgment is entered.\u2019 \u201d On November 13, 1974, appellants filed their appeal (2d Civ. No. 46036) from the ensuing order of dismissal of the taxpayers\u2019 proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>The sole substantive issue presented here is whether Reinecke was \u201cconvicted\u201d within the meaning of the applicable California constitutional provision (former art. XX, \u00a7 11) and relevant implementing statutes for the purpose of exclusion from holding public office upon the rendition of the jury verdict, as appellants contend, or the judgment, as respondents contend.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">We conclude, for the reasons that follow, that \u201cconviction\u201d so as to exclude from public office does not occur until rendition of judgment following the verdict. We, therefore, affirm the judgments (orders of dismissal) of the trial courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Prior to discussing the main issue, we must dispose of two preliminary procedural issues. Respondents contend that the proceedings (1) are moot, and (2) are barred by the doctrine of res judicata.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">\n<em>The Proceedings Are Not Moot</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">The issue of when a person is \u201cconvicted\u201d of a crime for the purpose of exclusion from public office is of general public interest and is likely to recur. Accordingly, these proceedings are not rendered moot by the fact that Reinecke no longer holds the office of Lieutenant Governor. <em>(Fields </em>v. <em>Eu, </em>18 Cal.3d 322, 325 [134 Cal.Rptr. 367, 556 P.2d 729].)</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">\n<em>The Denial of the Writ by the Supreme Court Is Not Res Judicata</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">Respondents\u2019 contention that the Supreme Court\u2019s denial of the writ is res judicata is untenable. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Medina, </em>6 Cal.3d 484, 491, footnote 6 [99 Cal.Rptr. 630, 492 P.2d 686], our Supreme Court noted that \u201c[t]he denial without opinion of a petition for writ of mandate ... is not res judicata except when the sole possible ground of denial was on the merits or it affirmatively appears that the denial was intended to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>on the merits.\u201d Here, the Supreme Court summarily denied the petition; it did not issue an alternative writ or order to show cause and did not hear the matter and render a written opinion on the merits. There were other possible reasons for the denial. As a matter of judicial policy, the Supreme Court usually refuses to exercise its original jurisdiction where, as here, the proceeding can be brought in the first instance in a lower court in order \u201cto encourage the filing of petitions for extraordinary writs in the superior court.\u201d <em>(Friends of Mammoth </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>8 Cal.3d 247, 269 [104 Cal.Rptr. 761, 502 P.2d 1049].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The order denying the alternative writ merely stated: \u201cPetition for writ of mandate denied. This order is final forthwith.\u201d We do not consider this statement \u201caffirmative proof\u2019 that the Supreme Court \u201cintended\u201d this denial to be res judicata of the merits of the issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">\n<em>Reinecke Was Not \u201cConvicted\u201d Until the Judgment Was Entered</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">At all times relevant to this proceeding, article XX, section 11 of the California Constitution provided in pertinent part:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cLaws shall be made to exclude from office, serving on juries, and from the right of suffrage, persons convicted of bribery, perjury, forgery, malfeasance in office, or other high crimes....\u201d This provision of the 1879 Constitution was originally enacted in the 1849 Constitution as article XI, section 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The Legislature has enacted various statutes to implement the exclusion from public office. Government Code section 1021 provides: \u201cA person is disqualified from holding any office upon conviction of designated crimes as specified in the Constitution and laws of the State.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Section 3000 of the Government Code states: \u201cAn officer forfeits his office upon conviction of designated crimes as specified in the Constitution and laws of the State.\u201d Section 1770, as amended in 1971, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-4\">\u201cAn office becomes vacant on the happening of any of the following events before the expiration of the term:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\">\u201c(h) His conviction of a felony or of any offense involving a violation of his official duties. An officer shall be deemed to have been convicted under this subdivision when trial court judgment is entered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Section 1770, subdivision (h) is the only section which purports to define at which point a \u201cconviction\u201d occurs. By its passage, the Legislature has determined that, for the purpose of exclusion, a public officer is \u201cconvicted\u201d when a judgment is entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Appellants, however, contend that a person stands \u201cconvicted\u201d for purposes of exclusion from office as soon as the jury returns a verdict. They assert that the legal meaning of \u201cconviction\u201d was well settled before the adoption of the Constitution in 1879 and, therefore, the language in the constitutional provision must be construed accordingly. Appellants apparently do not directly attack the constitutionality of section 1770, subdivision (h), as amended. Rather, they claim that in order to interpret that section constitutionally, the occurrence of a vacancy for purposes of replacement must be distinguished from the disqualification from office which occurs immediately upon the verdict. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Contrary to appellants\u2019 contention, the term \u201cconviction\u201d has historically had, and continues to have, at least two accepted meanings: (1) the jury verdict, and (2) the judgment following the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">Appellants cite Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries on the Common Law and Mr. Justice Story in support of their claim to one well-settled meaning for the term \u201cconviction.\u201d Blackstone said: \u201c \u2018If the jury find him [the prisoner] guilty, he is then said to be <em>convicted </em>of the crime whereof he stands indicted; which conviction may occur two ways: either by his confessing the offense and pleading guilty, or by his being found so by the verdict of his country.\u2019 (4 Black. Com. 262.)\u201d <em>(Ex Parte Brown, </em>68 Cal. 176, 178 [8 P. 829].)</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>2 Sumn. 19, 40, Mr. Justice Story said: \u201c \u2018And here, in order to avoid ambiguity, it may be proper to state that conviction does not mean the judgment passed upon the verdict; but if the jury find him (the party) guilty, he is then said to be convicted of the crime whereof he stands indicted.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>134 Cal. 301, 308 [66 P. 372].)</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">That definition, however, was not the only meaning, or even the accepted meaning for all purposes. There was no one uniform common law (or case law) definition of when \u201cconviction\u201d occurred. Thus, as the West Virginia Supreme Court pointed out in discussing the meaning of \u201cconviction\u201d in an 1872 constitutional provision vacating county office \u201cupon conviction\u201d of the officer: \u201cThe word \u2018conviction\u2019 in its primary sense refers to a verdict of guilty by a jury. But whenever <em>a conviction </em>is declared to work some disability, the word is generally given a broader significance. The common law in this respect, as voiced by Lord Hale, follows: \u2018By <em>conviction </em>I conceive is intended not barely a conviction by verdict where no judgment is given, but it must be a conviction by judgment.\u2019 1 Hale P. C. 686. . . .\u201d <em>(State </em>v. <em>Levi </em>(1930) 109 W.Va. 277 [153 S.E. 587, 588].) The West Virginia court, relying upon the common law and the 1851 Virginia Constitution, then held that the word \u201cconviction\u201d as used in its Constitution as a ground for removal from public office implied \u201cboth a verdict of guilty and the sentence of the court thereon.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The 1872 case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lockwood, </em>109 Mass. 323, illustrates the fact that \u201cconviction\u201d even had different meanings in different provisions within the same constitution. Thus, the Massachusetts Supreme Court held that \u201cconviction\u201d meant the verdict in a constitutional provision authorizing pardons after conviction but indicated that in the provision calling for disqualification from public office, it meant the judgment. The court explained <em>(id., </em>at p. 329): \u201cWhen indeed the word \u2018conviction\u2019 is used to describe the effect of the guilt of the accused as judicially proved in one case, when pleaded or given in evidence in another, it is sometimes used in a more comprehensive sense, including the judgment of the court upon the verdict or confession of guilt; as, for instance, in speaking ... of the effect of guilt, judicially ascertained, as a disqualification of the convict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth </em>(1922) 134 Va. 589 [113 S.E. 707, 24 A.L.R. 1286], the Virginia Supreme Court held that a judgment of conviction was required under a statute providing for removal of officers \u201cconvicted\u201d of an offense involving moral turpitude. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number><em>Reading </em>(1939) 336 Pa. 165 [6 A.2d 776], the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held, inter alia, that a final judgment or sentence was necessary to remove an officer pursuant to a constitutional provision forbidding a person convicted of an infamous crime from holding office.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">We do not mean to imply that there are no decisions in other jurisdictions equating a \u201cconviction\u201d for purposes of exclusion from public office with the determination of guilt by a verdict or plea of guilty. The cases on the meaning of \u201cconviction\u201d as a ground for the disqualification for, removal from, or vacancy in public office are not in agreement over the necessity of a judgment. (See Annot. (1960) 71 A.L.R.2d 593.) The existence of this split of authority, however, indicates that there was no universally accepted rule equating \u201cconviction\u201d and the verdict at the time the California constitutional provision was adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">In California, as in other jurisdictions, \u201cthe word \u2018conviction\u2019 has been used with varying meanings.\u201d <em>(Truchon </em>v. <em>Toomey, </em>116 Cal.App.2d 736, 740 [254 P.2d 638, 36 A.L.R.2d 1230].) Appellants cite the 1867 decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Goldstein, 32 </em>Cal. 432, and the 1885 decision in <em>Ex Parte Brown, </em>68 Cal. 176 [8 P. 829], as proof that \u201cconviction\u201d at the time of the adoption of the 1879 constitutional provision had one settled meaning, to wit, the verdict. In <em>Goldstein, </em>the court held that the defendant\u2019s plea of former \u201cconviction\u201d was a good defense although no judgment had, as yet, been pronounced. In <em>Brown, </em>the court construed the word \u201cconviction\u201d in the statute concerning admission to bail pending appeal (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1272) .as signifying a finding of guilt. The <em>Brown </em>court pointed out that \u201c[t]he ordinary meaning of this word is the finding by a jury of a verdict that the accused is guilty. ...\u201d (68 Cal. at p. 178.) The court, however, also noted that \u201c[i]n legal parlance, it often signifies the final judgment of the court. ...\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>After reviewing the authorities, the court further stated <em>(id., </em>at p. 180): \u201cNow, while the word may be used as signifying the sentence pronounced on the verdict, or the record of conviction, including <em>inter alia </em>the verdict and sentence, still such meaning ought not to be attributed to it, unless there is something in the context to indicate that it was used in such sense, ...\u201d The court concluded that in the Penal Code provision at issue \u201cconviction\u201d was used in its \u201cordinary\u201d sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The following year, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodrigo, </em>69 Cal. 601 [11 P. 481], the court again recognized that there was more than one meaning for the term. The <em>Rodrigo </em>court explained <em>(id., </em>at pp. 605-606): \u201c \u2018Conviction\u2019 is usually defined the legal proceeding of record which ascertains the guilt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>of the party and upon which the sentence or judgment is founded. (Bouvier\u2019s Law Dict.) The term is sometimes applied to the finding of a person guilty by verdict of a jury. (1 Bishop\u2019s Crim. L. 223.) But it is sometimes used to denote final judgment. (Bouvier; Dwarris\u2019s Stat., 2d ed., 683.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>134 Cal. 301 [66 P. 372], cited by appellants, the court held that for purposes of impeachment of the credibility of a witness (former Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2051), \u201cthe verdict of guilty constituted a \u2018conviction\u2019 \u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 307). The <em>Ward </em>court stated: \u201cThat such verdict does constitute a conviction, within the ordinary as well as the technical meaning of the word, seems to be well settled.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court, however, specifically distinguished the meaning of \u201cconviction\u201d for purposes of impeachment of the credibility of a witness from \u201cconviction\u201d for purposes of incompetency of a witness which required, at common law, a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Clapp, 67 </em>Cal.App.2d 197, 200 [153 P.2d 758], citing <em>Ward, </em>stated: \u201cConviction does not mean the judgment based upon the verdict, but it is the verdict itself. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ward) </em>[134 Cal. at p. 308].\u201d The actual holding of <em>Clapp, </em>however, did not involve the question of whether conviction meant the verdict or the judgment. In <em>Clapp, </em>the court upheld the sufficiency of a charge of prior conviction to enhance punishment (see Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 969, 969a) against defendant\u2019s claim that \u201che had not been convicted because his <em>judgment </em>of conviction in the former case was on appeal.\u201d (67 Cal.App.2d at p. 200.) (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">For purposes of disbarment, however, our Supreme Court has consistently construed \u201cconviction\u201d as requiring a \u201cfinal judgment,\u201d not a verdict. In 1885, the court, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Treadwell, </em>66 Cal. 400, 401 [5 P. 686], held that during the pendency of an appeal, \u201cthere is not such a final conviction against the defendant as the law contemplates to justify his removal, .. .\u201d and, therefore, disbarment proceedings could not be commenced. This meaning was reaffirmed in 1920 by the court in <em>In re Riccardi, </em>182 Cal. 675 [189 P. 694], construing the same statutes <em>(former </em>Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 287-289) providing for disbarment upon \u201cconviction\u201d of a felony involving moral turpitude. In support of its interpretation that a verdict was not sufficient, the court discussed, among other things, the apparent legislative intent, settled construction of the statutes, and the dire collateral consequences of an \u201cabsolute\u201d disbarment depriving an attorney of a valuable property right. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 679.)</p>\n<p id=\"b345-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>In <em>McKannay </em>v. <em>Horton, </em>151 Cal. 711 [91 P. 598], the specific question was whether after verdict and judgment, but while an appeal was pending, a person (the mayor) was convicted of a felony for purposes of automatic removal from office within the meaning of identical provisions on vacancy in the San Francisco charter and the state law (former Pol. Code, \u00a7 996). The court held he was. The case is authority for the proposition not disputed nor decided herein that \u201cconviction\u201d for purposes of declaring a vacancy occurs as soon as the judgment is entered, despite the pendency of an appeal. The majority stated that it was \u201cnot required to decide in this case that the entry of a verdict of guilty constitutes a \u2018conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 718.) However, they describe the removal from office as \u201ca consequence which flows\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 720) from the \u201cjudgment of conviction\u201d <em>(ibid.). </em>But three concurring justices categorically stated that the verdict constitutes a conviction. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 722.)</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">California constitutional provisions, other than article XX, section 11, employing the terms \u201cconvicted\u201d or \u201cconviction\u201d have been construed in California decisions. In <em>In re Anderson, </em>34 Cal.App.2d 48 [92 P.2d 1020], the appellate court construed \u201cconviction\u201d as meaning the verdict when used in the constitutional provision empowering the governor to grant pardons \u201cafter conviction.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The <em>Anderson </em>court ruled that conviction in that article should be accorded its \u201cnormal popular meaning [the verdict].\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 51.) It distinguished <em>Riccardi </em>because of the \u201cpeculiar consequences that would follow\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 54) if such interpretation were applied in the disbarment situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">In <em>Truchon </em>v. <em>Toomey, supra, </em>116 Cal.App.2d 736, the court construed a different constitutional provision (former art. II, \u00a7 1) and reached the contrary result that judgment was required. At issue was the meaning of \u201cconviction\u201d for purposes of disfranchisement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court held that judgment and sentence were necessary before a person was \u201cconvicted\u201d within the meaning of the constitutional provision declaring that no person convicted of any infamous crime shall exercise the right of an elector. <em>Truchon </em>reviewed authorities in California and elsewhere, including the leading New York case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Fabian </em>(1908) 192 N.Y. 443 [85 N.E. 672], and concluded that: (1) conviction had various meanings\u2014the ordinary meaning of verdict and the'technical meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>of judgment; and (2) \u201c \u2018[t]he general rule where conviction results in civil penalties and disabilities is that conviction takes the technical meaning of verdict plus judgment.\u2019 \u201d (116 Cal.App.2d at p. 745.) <em>Truchon </em>distinguished <em>Anderson, </em>pointing out there was no real conflict because the philosophy concerning pardons is different froni that concerning the imposition of a serious disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">From the foregoing, we conclude that the terms \u201cconvicted\u201d and \u201cconviction\u201d have not had a fixed single meaning in California law. In the context of statutes or constitutional provisions imposing civil penalties or disabilities, they have never been construed to mean the verdict of guilt. Such penalties or disabilities have not been found applicable until at least a court judgment has been entered. The California decisions are in this respect in accord with the weight of authority in other jurisdictions. As the Supreme Court of Oregon recently stated: \u201cWhere civil penalties and disabilities are involved ... a large majority of jurisdictions accept the technical meaning of \u2018conviction\u2019 and hold that conviction takes place only after a determination of guilt and a pronouncement of the judgment of the court. [Citations.]\u201d ( <em>Vasquez </em>v. <em>Courtney </em>(1975) 272 Ore. 477 [537 P.2d 536, 537].)</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">We consider disqualification from public office a significant civil disability. In California, the right to hold public office has long been recognized as a valuable right of citizenship. In 1869, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>36 Cal. 658, 662, our Supreme Court declared that \u201c[t]he elective franchise and the right to hold public offices constitute the principal political rights of citizens of the several States.\u201d In <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Com. on Qualifications etc., </em>14 Cal.2d 179, 182 [93 P.2d 140], the court pointed out: \u201c[T]he right to hold public office, either by election or appointment, is one of the valuable rights of citizenship .. . <em>The exercise of this right should not be declared prohibited or curtailed except by plain provisions of law. Ambiguities are to be resolved in favor of eligibility to office. . . </em>.\u201d (Italics added.) More recently, the high court, citing <em>Carter, </em>has termed the right to hold public office a \u201cfundamental right.\u201d <em>(Zeilenga </em>v. <em>Nelson, 4 </em>Cal.3d 716, 720 [94 Cal.Rptr. 602, 484 P.2d 578]; <em>Fort v. Civil Service Commission, </em>61 Cal.2d 331, 335 [38 Cal.Rptr. 625, 392 P.2d 385].) Thus, any ambiguity in a constitutional provision calling for forfeiture of an existing office and disqualification from holding public office should be resolved in favor of continued eligibility. When this is done, article XX, section II of our Constitution, which is ambiguous, can reasonably be construed as authorizing the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>to enact legislation providing that forfeiture and exclusion from public office shall be effective upon entiy of a judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Such being the case, cognizance must be taken of the rule stated by our Supreme Court in <em>Methodist Hosp. of Sacramento </em>v. <em>Saylor, </em>5 Cal.3d 685, 693 [97 Cal.Rptr. 1, 488 P.2d 161], where the court said (quoting <em>Pacific Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Indus. Acc. Com., </em>215 Cal. 461, 464 [11 P.2d 1, 82 A.L.R. 1170]): \u201c \u2018[W]e cannot construe a section of the Constitution as if it were a statute, and adopt our own interpretation without regard to the legislative construction. Where more than one reasonable meaning exists, it is our duty to accept that chosen by the legislature.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">In <em>San Francisco </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>183 Cal. 273 [191 P. 26], a workmen\u2019s compensation statute allowing recovery for work-connected \u201cdisease\u201d as well as trauma was attacked on the ground that the enabling constitutional provision authorized the Legislature to prescribe such benefits for \u201cinjuiy\u201d only. Our Supreme Court, after reviewing a number of decisions from other jurisdictions construing the word \u201cinjury,\u201d stated <em>(id., </em>at pp. 279-280):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">\u201cAs between these two conflicting lines of decision it is not necessary to determine where the weight of authority lies, or which cases are the better reasoned. If those which give the broader meaning to the word \u2018injury\u2019 do not lay down the better rule, they at least establish this, that it cannot be said that the broader meaning is an impossible or unreasonable one. The situation then, as it presents itself in connection with our constitutional provision, is at least that both by general usage and by the decisions of the courts the word \u2018injury\u2019 may have either of two meanings, and that either is reasonable and possible. In such a situation, <em>where a constitutional provision may well have either of two meanings, it is a fundamental rule of constitutional construction that, if the legislature has by statute adopted one, its action in this respect is well nigh, if not completely, controlling. </em>When the legislature has once construed the constitution, for the courts then to place a different construction upon it means that they must declare void the action of the legislature. It is no small matter for one branch of the government to annul the formal exercise by another and coordinate branch of power committed to the latter, and the courts should not and must not annul, as contrary to the constitution, a statute passed by the legislature, unless it can be said of the statute that it positively and certainly is opposed to the constitution. This is elementary. But plainly this cannot be said of a statute which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>merely adopts one of two reasonable and possible constructions of the constitution. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-4\">\u201c \\ . Where a statute has been adopted in carrying into effect a constitutional provision, the constitutional provision and statute must both be so construed as to permit the act to stand.. ..\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">In the case at bench, the Legislature adopted Government Code section 1770, subdivision (h) as part of its duty to carry into effect article XX, section .11. In so doing, it adopted the reasonable meaning that \u201cconvicted\u201d signifies the entry of a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The fact that the constitutional provision herein was mandatory rather than permissive as in <em>San Francisco </em>is not significant. Article XX, section 11 provided that the Legislature shall pass laws \u201cto exclude from office . .. persons convicted of . .. perjury . ...\u201d Such a provision, while mandatory, is not self-executing. It contemplates and requires legislation to give it effect. <em>(Taylor </em>v. <em>Madigan, </em>53 Cal.App.3d 943, 951 [126 Cal.Rptr. 376].) The Constitution clearly directs that the responsibility for carrying into effect this provision lies with the Legislature, and not with the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Appellants concede that Government Code section 1770, subdivision (h) appears \u201cat variance\u201d with their claim that rendition of the verdict constitutes \u201cconviction\u201d because it provides that an office becomes vacant at the time the judgment is entered. Appellants claim, however, that the Legislature lacked the power to authorize persons to continue exercising the privileges of public office after a jury verdict of guilty. They cite <em>Pacific G. &amp; E. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>180 Cal. 497, 500 [181 P. 788], for the proposition that terms in a constitution \u201cmust be construed in the light of their meaning at the time of the adoption of the [constitutional provision], and cannot be extended by legislative definition, for such extension would, in effect, be an amendment of the constitution, if accepted as authoritative.. . .\u201d Appellants\u2019 reliance on <em>Pacific G. &amp; E. Co. </em>is misplaced. In contrast to the case at bench, the meaning of the terms there involved was not ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">The Legislature has enacted three sections in the Government Code which are pertinent to the issue herein as legislation implementing article XX, section 11. All three are in title I, \u201cPublic Officers and Employees.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Section 1021 provides: \u201cA person is disqualified from holding any office upon conviction of designated crimes as specified in the Constitution and laws of the State.\u201d Section 3000 provides that \u201c[a]n officer forfeits his office\u201d under identical circumstances, to wit \u201cconviction ... as specified in the Constitution and laws of the State.\u201d In turn, section 1770 provides that \u201c[a]n office becomes vacant on the happening of any of the following events before the expiration of the term.\u201d The subdivisions then list the specified events causing such a vacancy. Until 1971, subdivision (h) simply stated that the vacancy occurs on the \u201cconviction of a felony or any offense involving a violation of his official duties.\u201d That year, the Legislature amended the provision to add the following sentence: \u201cAn officer shall be deemed to have been convicted under this subdivision when trial court judgment is entered.\u201d The legislative intent to construe \u201cconvicted\u201d for purposes of a vacancy is patent from the clear language of the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">We must read these three sections together, viewing them in context and harmonizing the whole to ascertain the legislative purpose. It then becomes evident that the Legislature must have intended that an officer would become disqualified, and thereby forfeit his office so as to create a vacancy when judgment was entered following the verdict. It is patent that if the officer is disqualified and has forfeited his office, such office must be vacant. All three events necessarily occur simultaneously.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">In summary, the meaning of \u201cconvicted\u201d is ambiguous. It has been variously construed by the courts and defined by the Legislature dependent on the context. Where, as here, a civil disability flows as a consequence of the \u201cconviction,\u201d the majority and better rule is to require the entry of judgment. In any event, the Legislature has chosen to adopt that meaning for exclusion from public office, and its interpretation is dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">We, therefore, hold, in accord with the Attorney General\u2019s opinion (57 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 374, 375 (1974)) that under California law a \u201cconviction\u201d for the purpose of exclusion from public office \u201cconsists of a jury verdict or court finding of guilt followed by a judgment upholding and implementing such verdict or finding.\u201d Thus, on October 2, 1974, and not before, Lieutenant Governor Reinecke automatically forfeited his office and his rights and powers incident thereto. That forfeiture created a vacancy. Until then, Reinecke was entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>exercise the powers and privileges of office. He was, therefore, entitled to all the compensation he received.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Accordingly, the orders of dismissal are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Allport, Acting P. J., and Cobey, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied July 19, 1977, and appellants\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied August 25, 1977. Bird, C. J., and Manuel, J., did not participate therein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-9\">Both the parties and the applicable authorities use these terms interchangeably.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b338-7\">This judgment was later reversed. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reinecke </em>(D.C.Cir. 1975) 524 F.2d 435 [173 App.D.C. 274].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b338-8\">The court assumed appellants' complaint was amended \u201cto allege, in substance, that during the period from July 27, 1974, to and including October 2, 1974, . . . Reinecke performed no significant official State acts or useful services.\u201d The court, however, held \u201csuch allegations to be conclusions and/or irrelevant and therefore subject to a motion to strike.\u201d The court also assumed the complaint was amended to allege that after Reinecke\u2019s posttrial motions were denied on September 27, \u201cReinecke was legally convicted and, therefore, should not have received his salary from September 27, 1974 through October 2, 1974.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b339-11\">Other procedural contentions do not require discussion. Since we conclude that neither of the proceedings is moot or barred by the doctrine of res judicata and affirm the judgments of the trial courts on the ground that \u201cconviction\u201d for purposes of disqualification occurs upon rendition of judgment, we need not decide whether plaintiffs had standing to sue in a taxpayers\u2019 action or whether a quo warranto proceeding was the sole remedy. Reinecke only received salary for the period up to October 2; there was, therefore, no overpayment of salary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b340-7\">As the court explained in <em>Friends of Mammoth (ibid.): </em>\u201cArticle VI, section 10, of the state Constitution gives original jurisdiction to the Supreme Court, Courts of Appeal, superior courts, and their judges in \u2018proceedings for extraordinary relief in the nature of mandamus, certiorari, and prohibition.\u2019 Rule 56(a) provides: \u2018If the petition might lawfully have been made to a lower court in the first instance, it shall set forth the circumstances which, in the opinion of the petitioner, render it proper that the writ should issue originally from the reviewing court . . . .\u2019 In his comments to the rule, Witkin states: \u2018In form this is a rule of <em>pleading: </em>in effect, however, it expresses the policy of the Supreme Court and courts of appeal to refuse to exercise their original jurisdiction in the first instance, unless the circumstances are exceptional.\u2019 (5 Witkin, Cal.
