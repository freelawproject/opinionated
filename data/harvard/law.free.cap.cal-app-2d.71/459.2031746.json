Bonelli (now deceased) and Mary P. Bonelli, his widow; (2) a $15,000 security deposit posted by the Bonellis with the Franchise Tax Board pending resolution of their tax liability for the years 1952 and 1953; and (3) the sum of $4,591 found due the Bonellis as an income tax refund upon resolution of their 1952 and 1953 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>tax liability. The state and its Controller (hereinafter controller) appeal from judgments which favor the Bonellis on all issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">In 3 Civil 14089 the appeal is from a judgment declaring that alleged bribe money received by Bonelli may not be set off against the widow\u2019s pension benefits to which Mrs. Bonelli is entitled; in 3 Civil 14378 the appeal is from a judgment on the pleadings which denied the People\u2019s request for an accounting from Bonelli of $250,000 assertedly received from liquor licensees as bribes while he was a member of the Board of Equalization and from judgment on a cross-complaint which ordered the controller to pay to the estate of William G. Bonelli (1) pension benefits due him and accrued prior to his death, (2) the $15,000 security deposit, and (3) the $4,591 state income tax refund. The judgment further provided for interest at the legal rate of 7 percent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The following relevant facts are undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">\n<em>The Pension Benefits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Bonelli was elected to the Assembly in November of 1930 and served until 1933. In 1935 he became Director of the Department of Professional and Vocational Standards and served until April of 1938. On April 3, 1938, he' was appointed to the State Board of Equalization and was elected to successive four-year terms until defeated for reelection in 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">In 1954 Bonelli was indicted by the San Diego County Grand Jury for conspiring to commit the crime of soliciting and receiving contributions, in return for favorable treatment, from applicants and persons licensed by the Board of Equalization to sell alcoholic beverages. From 1955, and until his death, Bonelli was a fugitive from justice living in Mexico. (See <em>Bonelli </em>v. <em>Flournoy </em>(1967) 250 Cal.App.2d 495, 497 [58 Cal.Rptr. 535].)</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">During the foregoing terms of office, Bonelli was a member of the Legislators\u2019 Retirement System. On December 15, 1958, having attained the age of 63 years, he filed a written application for his retirement benefits. On January 8, 1959, the Board of Administration of the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Employees\u2019 Retirement System granted Bonelli his retirement and advised him that his first warrant would be mailed to him early in February 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">On March 3, 1959, the controller made a demand upon Bonelli that he account for monies improperly received from liquor licensees and advised him that his pension payments were being intercepted and impounded by the controller in a special \u201cWilliam G. Bonelli\u201d deposit fund in the state treasury until there was a balancing of accounts, the controller taking the position that these monies were owed to the state. Bonelli disregarded the controller\u2019s demand and no pension payments were ever received by him. The impoundment continued until Bonelli\u2019s death on November 21, 1970.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">In making application for retirement, Bonelli had elected to receive his allowance under Option No. 3 of the Legislators\u2019 Retirement System, naming his wife as the beneficiary to whom the payments were to be made after his death. On Januaiy 4, 1971, she as his widow filed a claim for retirement benefits. On August 17, 1971, the administrator of the retirement system approved the claim. Beginning September I, 1971, the retirement system commenced drawing monthly warrants for payment to her and has done so on a monthly basis since that date. However, each month the warrants have been intercepted by the controller and deposited by him in the \u201cMary P. Bonelli Special Deposit Fund\u201d in the state treasury. His purpose was to offset an indebtedness in the sum of $59,300 assertedly owed to the state by Bonelli.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">\n<em>The Security Deposit and Tax Refund</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">On February 27, 1959, the Franchise Tax Board notified the Bonellis that deficiencies for 1952 and 1953 had been found upon examination of their income tax returns. The Bonellis were notified that they could \u201cstay collection and prevent the assessment from becoming final\u201d by filing a petition for reassessment accompanied by security. Pursuant to that advice, the Bonellis, on March 9, 1959, filed with the board a petition for reassessment and a cashier\u2019s check in the sum of $15,000 payable to the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>On June 8, 1966, the Bonellis were notified that their tax liability had been reconsidered and the deficiency assessment withdrawn. They immediately demanded the return of their $15,000 and the $4,591 state income tax refund due them for the years in question, together with interest on the refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">Prior to notice to the Bonellis of the results of the tax audit, the controller, on May 26, 1966, advised them that he had intercepted and impounded both the $15,000 deposit and the $4,591 tax refund and was holding said funds in trust for them pending an accounting between Bonelli and the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The controller\u2019s principal contention is that Government Code section 12419.5<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> allows him to offset from the amount intercepted and held by him a sum equal to the amount of the bribes. The contention assumes that monies received as bribes are the property of the state, and therefore are sums \u201cdue a state agency from a person . . . [which may be offset] against any amount owing such person ... by any state agency.\u201d (\u00a7 12419.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">For the purpose of this decision, we indulge the same assumption, since\u2014as to the pension benefits\u2014the offset issue will be controlled by our resolution of the conflict between sections 12419.5 and 9359.3, and\u2014as to the security deposit and tax refund\u2014the offset statute is inapplicable because those funds have always been (and the controller so concedes) the property of the Bonellis. The latter funds, held in trust for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>them by the state, simply fail to qualify under the offset provision as \u201cany amount owing... by any state agency.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">\n<em>The Pension Benefits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Section 9359.3 provides as follows: \u201cThe right of a person to any benefit or other right under this chapter and the money in the Legislators\u2019 Retirement Fund are not subject to execution, garnishment, attachment, or any other process whatsoever,\u201d and forbids insofar as here relevant, any assignment of such money.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">\u201cIt is well settled that retirement benefit rights\u2014including pensions whether for age and service, disability or death\u2014are vested [citations].\u201d <em>(Dickey </em>v. <em>Retirement Board </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 745, 748 [129 Cal.Rptr. 289, 548 P.2d 689].) The strong public policy opposing interference with such vested pension rights, even in the face of official wrongdoing, was reaffirmed by the California Supreme Court in <em>Willens </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Qualifications </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 451 [110 Cal.Rptr. 713, 516 P.2d 1]. In <em>Willens, </em>a disabled judge who was removed from office for official misconduct involving bribery and criminal conspiracy was held entitled to receive disability retirement benefits.  The court stated: \u201cSince pension rights of this nature may be considered \u2018vested\u2019 rights <em>(Pearson </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>49 Cal.2d 523, 543 [319 P.2d 624]; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>City of Long Beach, </em>45 Cal.2d 128, 131 [287 P.2d 765]; <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>City of Fresno, supra, </em>42 Cal.2d 180, 183 [265 P.2d 884]), the following rule would appear to govern: \u2018In the absence of a valid . .. provision enacted prior to eligibility for retirement which provides for forfeiture, once a person who has undertaken public employment ... becomes eligible for retirement, his right to a pension cannot be destroyed merely because he is subsequently removed from office for his own misconduct. [Citation.] It is statutory law that \u201cNo conviction of any person for a crime works any forfeiture of any property, except in cases in which a forfeiture is expressly imposed by law . . . .\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 2604.)\u2019 <em>(Pearson </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>at p. 543.)\u201d (10 Cal.3d at pp. 458-459.)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">In an opinion dealing with the Legislators\u2019 Retirement Law, the Attorney General, citing <em>Willens, </em>and after an analysis of <em>Pearson </em>and its antecedents, concluded that the perjury conviction of a former Lieuten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>ant Governor \u201cwould have no effect upon the Lieutenant Governor\u2019s retirement benefits\u201d (57 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 374, 375, 386-387), except in the event the Lieutenant Governor became a fugitive from justice (\u00a7 9355.16, discussed <em>infra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">The <em>Pearson </em>rule appears to rest on two bases. First, the requirement that liberal construction be given pension legislation to the end that the beneficent results thereof may be achieved. <em>(Gorman </em>v. <em>Cranston </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 441, 444 [50 Cal.Rptr. 533, 413 P.2d 133]; see also <em>Jorgensen </em>v. <em>Cranston </em>(1962) 211 Cal.App.2d 292, 296 [27 Cal.Rptr. 297].) Among those results are the protection of the employee and his family from economic insecurity. <em>(Willens </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Qualifications, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at p. 456.) The second basis is the statutory prohibition against forfeiture of property for conviction of crime except where forfeiture is expressly authorized by the Legislature. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 2604.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>) Pension benefits have been upheld in the face both of indictment for and conviction of crimes involving official misconduct. (See, in addition to <em>Willens </em>and <em>Pearson, supra, Skaggs </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 497 [275 P.2d 9]; cf. <em>MacIntyre </em>v. <em>Retirement Board of S. F. </em>(1941) 42 Cal.App.2d 734 [109 P.2d 962].)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Our conclusion in support of the Bonellis on the issue of pension benefits is buttressed somewhat by the enactment, in 1959, of section 9355.16.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That section reflects clearly the Legislature\u2019s intent to avoid forfeiture of accumulated contributions by providing for suspension of membership in the system during the pendency of a criminal charge, and by permitting withdrawal of those contributions during the period of suspension. (See also, \u00a7 9355.2.) Inasmuch as the facts at bench arose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>prior to the adoption of section 9355.16, its provisions are expressly inapplicable to the Bonellis.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Turning next to the conflict between sections 12419.5 and 9359.3, it is the controller\u2019s position that the pension exemption statute is designed to protect the employee from ordinary creditors and is not to be invoked in disputes between the employee and the entity paying the pension. He maintains that section 12419.5, the offset provision, which was enacted <em>after </em>section 9359.3, the exemption statute, is the controlling provision, and contends that he is not subjecting the pension funds to attachment, garnishment, or other legal process, but is properly reducing the amount owed the state by withholding payments under the offset provision. Quite apart from the fact that the retirement system, and neither the controller nor the state, is the <em>entity paying the pension, </em>the position is untenable. In our view section 12419.5 was not intended to have the broad sweep contended for by the controller.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">An opposing conclusion would tend to undermine rather than to maintain the integrity of the retirement system, despite the fact that one practical result, in the cases at bench, is that a possibly malfeasing state officer, first by his flight and apparent removal from the state of all his assets, and secondly, by his death, has effectively denied the state the means of recovering any ill-gotten gains acquired by breach of his public trust. The exemption statute (\u00a7 9359.3) which protects retirement benefits from invasion by \u201cexecution; garnishment, attachment, or any other process whatsoever\u201d must control over the more general setoff statute (\u00a7 12419.5) if effect is to be given to the rule of law that pension legislation shall be liberally construed. (See also \u00a7 21201 [Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System]; \u00a7 31452 [County Employees\u2019 Retirement Law]; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 690.18; and see, <em>Kruger </em>v. <em>Wells Fargo Bank </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 352, 370-371 [113 Cal.Rptr. 449, 521 P.2d 441, 65 A.L.R.3d 1266] [attempted setoff against state unemployment and disability insurance benefits].)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">On the sub-issue of the statute of limitations, we summarily reject the controller\u2019s contention that Mrs. Bonelli\u2019s action is barred by the three-year statute (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 338, subd. 1). Under well-settled law, her cause of action accrued no earlier than November 21, 1970, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>date of her husband\u2019s death. <em>(Driscoll </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 297, 304 [61 Cal.Rptr. 661, 431 P.2d 245]; <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Board of Pension Commrs. </em>(1941) 18 Cal.2d 427, 430 [116 P.2d 37, 136 A.L.R. 800].) Her action was filed in superior court November 12, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">\n<em>The Security Deposit and Tax Refund</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The trial court, in granting the Bonelli estate relief on its cross-complaint, did not consider the offset provision (\u00a7 12419.5) but based its decision solely on the previous determination in Mrs. Bonelli\u2019s action that the state had no right to recover any monies received by Bonelli as bribes, and therefore there would be nothing to offset.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The controller, relying solely on the dictum in <em>Bonelli </em>v. <em>Flournoy, supra, </em>250 Cal.App.2d 495 (see fn. 7, <em>ante, </em>p. 468), takes the position that both the $15,000 and the $4,591 were automatically available to the state under the offset provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">On the other hand, counsel for the estate correctly asserts that the security deposit and, upon its determination, the tax refund, are the property of the Bonellis held in trust for them by the state, and therefore fail to qualify under the offset provision as \u201cany amount owing ... by any state agency . . . .\u201d (See fn. 4, <em>ante, </em>p. 466, and accompanying text.) Further, the controller violated the state\u2019s trusteeship obligations by withholding payment of these items. Although not specifically asserted with respect to the pension benefits, it follows, of course, that to the extent of Mr. Bonelli\u2019s contributions to his retirement fund, those sums also have remained the property of the Bonellis, held in trust by the retirement system.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">\n<em>Propriety of the Remedy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Although not discussed by the parties, we address briefly the mode of relief sought by the Bonellis. In affirming the judgments granting mandate, the court does not act as a helpless, amoral puppet, insensitive to the emanations of corruption arising from William Bonelli\u2019s 1954 indictment and flight. (See fn. 1, <em>ante, </em>p. 463.) Equitable factors play an important role in determining the availability of mandamus; the writ should not issue in aid of one who does not come into court with clean hands. <em>(San Diego County Dept. of Pub. Welfare </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 1, 9 [101 Cal.Rptr. 541, 496 P.2d 453].) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>One who sets the judicial process in motion may have the doors of the court shut against him if his conduct has violated conscience or good faith. <em>(DeGarmo </em>v. <em>Goldman </em>(1942) 19 Cal.2d 755, 764-765 [123 P.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The retirement allowance over and above Mr. Bonelli\u2019s cash contributions is a form of deferred salary, payable by contract. <em>(Dickey </em>v. <em>Retirement Board, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 745, 748-749; <em>Willens </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Qualifications, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d 451, 456, fin. 6.) A pension claimant may enforce his pension rights by mandate. Here the question of clean hands comes to the fore. We have previously accepted the premise that corrupt profits in the hands of a state official are held in constructive trust for the state (see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carter </em>(1910) 217 U.S. 286, 306 [54 L.Ed. 769, 775, 30 S.Ct. 515]; <em>Jersey City </em>v. <em>Hague </em>(1955) 18 N.J. 584 [115 A.2d 8, 11-15]; <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Bender </em>(1956) 143 Cal.App.2d 198, 211 [300 P.2d 119]; Rest., Restitution, \u00a7 190).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">A vigorous pursuit by the state of its claim for bribery money and frustration, of that pursuit by Bonelli\u2019s asylum in Mexico would have supplied a strong basis for the unclean hands doctrine against Bonelli and anyone claiming under him.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The state did not vigorously pursue its claim. Not until 10 years had passed did the state attempt to serve process by publication and mail. (See <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Cranston </em>v. <em>Bonelli </em>(1971) 15 Cal.App.3d 129 [92 Cal.Rptr. 828].) The state\u2019s conduct moved the. superior court to label it \u201ca startling example of dilatoriness.\u201d Meanwhile, in 1966, Bonelli had filed a separate lawsuit attempting to vindicate his pension rights. (See <em>Bonelli </em>v. <em>Flournoy, supra, </em>250 Cal.App.2d 495.) Finally, in 1971, Mrs. Bonelli filed her own suit for the widow\u2019s pension. Had the state been ready, willing and able to prove its charge of bribery, it could have pursued its claim early in the history of this litigation. The state did not do so. Its frustration is self-imposed and not attributable to process-dodging by Bonelli. Thus the facts do not arouse the unclean hands doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\n<em>Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The final issue urged by the controller is that the trial court erred in awarding interest, as to the retirement funds, at the legal rate of 7 percent rather than at the lesser interest rate fixed by the provisions of the Legislators\u2019 Retirement Law (\u00a7\u00a7 9353.3, 9353.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>The controller relies upon <em>Jorgensen </em>v. <em>Cranston, supra, </em>211 Cal.App.2d 292, 301, where we held, inter alia, that where a special fund (there the Judges\u2019 Retirement Fund) is involved, the contractual rate of interest specified therein applies, rather than the legal rate (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3287). Like the Judges\u2019 Retirement Fund, the fund here involved is such a special fund. (\u00a7 9354.) The Bonellis correctly point out, however, that since the monthly pension benefits have been paid out of the special fund and thereafter have been intercepted and held by the controller, <em>Jorgensen </em>has no application for the reason that the actions are not against the trustee of a special fund (as defined in Jorgensen) but upon a general monetary obligation of the state. <em>(Mass </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1964) 61 Cal .2d 612, 625-626 [39 Cal.Rptr. 739, 394 P.2d 579].)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Puglia, P. J\u201e and Friedman, J\u201e concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied July 27, 1977, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.

He did bring a petition for a writ of mandate in this court to compel the controller to pay him his pension.
