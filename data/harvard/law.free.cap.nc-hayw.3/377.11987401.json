An action of debt, however, will lie upon suggestion of a devastavit, and the practice in this state has been to issue a <em>set. fa. </em>upon such suggestion. And as every defence can be made to the <em>sci. fiu </em>which could be. nude to the action, there can be no good reason for adjudging the <em>set. fa. </em>improper. If the <em>sci.fa. </em>here he considered In lieu of <em>scire fieri </em>enquiry in England, it posser-ces advantages far above the English mode; for here it is to be executed in court, and under the direction of the court; whereas the other is is the county before a jury. With respect to the demurrer to the plea of judgments and no assets ultra, that was pleaded in the original suit; hut the defendants counsel say a replication thereto, denying the judgments, is <em>nul tiel </em>record; and. the record shews that the jury said there were no such judgments : therefore the plea has not been tried, and if so, no judgment can be presumed ; for the court ought not to enter judgment when any one plea remains untried. The answer is, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>replication may be either <em>mil tiel </em>record, or assets <em>ultra, nr per </em>fraudom, or other matter o\u00ed fact; and such replications was pro-peily triable by jury: and an irregularity committed by the clerk, in entering the verdict, will not raise a presumption that the judgment was not given upon the verdict. If there was such a judgment, that estops the defendant from using any plea which he did or might have pleaded prior to that judgment. The demurrer therefore must be allowed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
