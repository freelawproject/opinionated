At the time of the accident, defendant provided workers\u2019 compensation insurance to Greenfield Construction. Plaintiffs sued defendant, arguing that their injuries were caused by defendant\u2019s failure to adequately perform the safety inspection duties at the construction site it had undertaken as Greenfield Construction\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier. The jury awarded plaintiffs $725,000 each, and defendant appealed to this Court. After various proceedings, this Court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motions to affirm on August 21, 1980. Defendant sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, in lieu of granting leave to appeal, re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>manded the case to the Court of Appeals \"for reconsideration in light of <em>Smith v Allendale Mutual Ins Co, </em>410 Mich 685; 303 NW2d 702 (1981)\u201d. 417 Mich 984 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">On remand, defendant argues that the earlier judgments must be reversed because plaintiffs failed to establish at trial that defendant was liable to them under the negligent inspection theory set forth in <em>Smith v Allendale, supra, </em>or because the jury was not properly instructed under the <em>Smith v Allendale </em>theory. In <em>Smith v Allendale, </em>the plaintiffs sought to hold the defendants (fire insurers for plaintiffs\u2019 employers) liable for injuries sustained by the plaintiffs as a result of fire hazards not detected and brought to the insureds\u2019 attention after the insurers\u2019 inspections of the insureds\u2019 premises. The plaintiffs argued that the insurers had become liable to them under the theory expressed in Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 324A, which provides that, in certain circumstances, one who undertakes to render services to another which he should recognize as necessary for the protection of a third person is subject to liability if his \"failure to exercise reasonable care to [perform]<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> his undertaking\u201d results in physical harm to the third person. The Supreme Court held that in order to establish such a threshold undertaking, the plaintiffs were required to prove that the insurers \"had agreed or intended to provide services for the benefit of [their] insured[s]\u201d. The Supreme Court further held that \"[e]vidence demonstrating merely that a benefit was conferred upon another is not sufficient to establish an undertaking which betokens duty. * * * Acordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>where a plaintiff seeks to prove an undertaking by conduct which benefits another and that conduct is consistent with a primary purpose on the part of the actor to benefit himself, the plaintiff must offer additional evidence to create a jury question whether there was an undertaking to render services and hence a duty to one who might foresee-ably be injured by the actor\u2019s failure to perform the undertaking with reasonable care.\u201d 410 Mich 717-718.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-3\">In response, plaintiffs first argue that the holding in <em>Smith v Allendale </em>is confined to situations involving fire insurance inspections.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They contend that the issue addressed in <em>Smith </em>concerned the evidentiary requirements necessary to establish that fire insurance inspections constituted \"services to another\u201d that would trigger the duty to exercise reasonable care in the services provided and that, for various policy reasons, these evidentiary requirements are not equally applicable to a negligent worker\u2019s compensation insurance inspection case.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">We do not agree that the holding of <em>Smith v Allendale </em>is applicable only to fire insurers. Although the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion repeatedly refers to fire insurers, fire inspections, and fire prevention, the holding of the case, as stated earlier, is expressed in general terms, referring to insurers and, even more generally, to \"plaintiffs\u201d and \"actors\u201d rather than to \"fire insurers\u201d. The underlying issue in the case is not what quantum of evidence is needed to establish a fire insurer\u2019s duty to the employees of its insured, but rather how to properly interpret the term \"undertaking\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>in \u00a7 324A, Restatement Torts, 2d. On this issue, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">\"Section 324A provides that an actor who <em>'undertakes, </em>gratuitously or for consideration, <em>to render services to another\u2019 </em>(emphasis supplied) may in certain circumstances be liable to foreseeable third persons for negligence. Plaintiffs maintain that by inspecting the Farm Bureau feed mill and the Great Lakes Steel plant for fire hazards, the insurers in these cases embarked upon gratuitous undertakings within the ambit of \u00a7 324A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">\"In our view, plaintiffs misconceive the sweep of the section\u2019s principles. The illustrations given in the official comments to \u00a7 324A and the cases cited by way of example in the Reporter\u2019s Notes involve either a contractual undertaking by a defendant to render particular services, an undertaking by an agent or employee to render services to his employer as part of the agency or employment, or an undertaking whose unambiguous object is to benefit another and which would not have been performed primarily for the actor\u2019s purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">\"One can agree with the general proposition that any person, including an insurer, who assumes to act must act with reasonable care without concluding that the insurers in these cases are subject to liability under the rule of \u00a7 324A. It is not enough that the insurer acted. It must have undertaken to render services to another. Its acts do not constitute such an undertaking unless it agreed or intended to benefit the insured or its employees by the inspections.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">\"The law does not impose a duty upon an insurer who inspects in the absence of conduct evidencing an agreement or intent to benefit others by the inspection; only in such a case has the insurer acknowledged the propriety of judging the competence of its inspection by a standard which measures its potential effect on others. This concept of acknowledged obligation to another is comprehended by \u00a7 324A\u2019s threshold description of '[o]ne who undertakes * * * to render services to another\u2019; the rule stated in \u00a7 324A by its terms does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>apply to an actor following a self-serving course of conduct.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) 410 Mich 715-717.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-3\">The Supreme Court also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-4\">\"For the reasons stated [elsewhere in the opinion], we conclude that the insurers in these cases are not liable to plaintiffs under the common-law rule restated in \u00a7 324A because on these records the relationships did not give rise to an undertaking creating a duty to inspect with due care. This result is consistent with the Restatement when \u00a7 324A is read in light of the cases that gave rise to it. It also reflects our judgment, guided by the legislative response to a prior case, of the wiser public policy.\u201d 410 Mich 713.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">We note that this Court, in <em>Scott v Detroit (On Rehearing), </em>113 Mich App 241; 318 NW2d 32 (1982), <em>lv den </em>417 Mich 864 (1983), and the United States District Court, in <em>Rick v RLC Corp, </em>535 F Supp 39 (ED Mich, 1981), have applied this holding in <em>Smith v Allendale </em>to nonfire insurer situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">We also reject the contention that the Supreme Court expressly differentiated between fire insurers and workers\u2019 compensation insurers for purposes of \u00a7 324A in <em>Smith v Allendale. </em>The references to earlier Court of Appeals cases involving \u00a7 324A in the workers\u2019 compensation insurance context<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> do not approve the interpretation of \u00a7 324A contained within those cases, but simply note that \u00a7 324A of the Restatement Torts, 2d, had been applied prior to <em>Smith v Allendale </em>in Michigan case law. See 410 Mich 712. Other references to the workers\u2019 compensation insurance context occur only in the discussion of the common-law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>development of the concept of insurer liability for negligent inspection. This discussion does not endorse the holdings of the earlier cases. See 410 Mich 733-734.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Plaintiffs also argue that the policy reasons listed in <em>Smith v Allendale </em>for declining to \"enlarge\u201d the tort liability of fire insurers, 410 Mich 736-738, do not apply to workers\u2019 compensation insurers and that, therefore, the holding in <em>Smith </em>should not apply. However, whether or not these policy reasons apply, we are persuaded that the Supreme Court intended them to apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">\"The common-law principles relied on by the plaintiffs do not subject an insurer to liability for negligent inspection unless it undertakes to inspect for the insured\u2019s benefit. In assessing the proper development of these principles, we find compelling that, after the Court of Appeals permitted maintenance of actions against workers\u2019 compensation insurers for employee injuries proximately resulting from negligent safety inspections, the Legislature amended the workers\u2019 compensation act to preclude third-party actions against the carrier based upon its furnishing of, or failure to furnish, safety inspections. This amendment expresses a policy judgment that the societal benefits obtained from not burdening the insurer\u2019s decision to inspect its risks with the disincentive of tort liability outweigh whatever advantage might be realized from insistence that such inspections be conducted with due care. Although this amendment was by its terms confined to workers\u2019 compensation carriers, we are guided by the policy judgment implicit in the legislative decision.\u201d 410 Mich 736-737. (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Plaintiffs next argue that the principles in <em>Smith v Allendale </em>should not be applied retroactively to this case because the Supreme Court\u2019s decision relied upon a 1972 amendment to the workers\u2019 compensation act (which was enacted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number><em>after </em>the accident in this case) and because the decision in <em>Smith </em>constitutes a \"change in the common law\u201d. We reject both contentions. <em>Smith </em>relied upon the policy judgment that was revealed by the Legislature\u2019s swift amendment of the workers\u2019 compensation act to prevent insurers from being found liable for negligent inspections; <em>Smith </em>did not rely upon the amendment itself. It is therefore irrelevant that the 1972 amendment, 1972 PA 285, has been found by this Court to apply prospectively only.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, by its own terms, the <em>Smith </em>decision does not constitute a \"change in the common law\u201d. The Supreme Court declined to \"enlarge\u201d the tort liability of fire insurers and carefully based its interpretation of \u00a7 324A on an examination of the cases from which the Restatement rule was derived. Such an historical approach cannot be considered to result in an abrupt change in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\">Having determined that the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Smith </em>is applicable to this case, we must determine whether or not the verdict against defendant must be reversed for lack of sufficient evidence demonstrating that defendant \"had agreed or intended to provide services for the benefit of\u2019 Greenfield Construction Co., and its employees. <em>Smith v Allendale, </em>410 Mich 713-715. After carefully reviewing the record, we conclude that plaintiffs did not present sufficient evidence of such an agreement or intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">Plaintiffs presented the deposition testimony of Mr. Brian P. Murphy, a former safety engineer for CNA (defendant); the in-court testimony of Mr. Robert Myles, who, at the time of trial, headed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>CNA\u2019s Loss Control division; defendant\u2019s answers to interrogatories; and the testimony of both plaintiffs. This testimony established that defendant, in its role as workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier for Greenfield Construction, conducted safety inspections of Greenfield construction sites on an approximately monthly basis. These inspections were often unescorted and involved the inspector (often Brian P. Murphy) observing work in progress. If the inspector observed work being done in an unsafe manner, he would immediately give advice to the specific employee involved, to someone else on the work site, or to management personnel. However, both Murphy and Myles testified that the inspector and insurance company were without any authority to effect the changes recommended by them. Defendant\u2019s only alternative if Greenfield declined to follow the inspector\u2019s recommendations was to \"get off the risk\u201d (cancel the policy or refuse to renew it).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The inspectors conducted the inspections for two purposes. Initial inspections were conducted for \"safety purposes\u201d and to garner background information, such as the number of workers employed by a potential insured, needed for underwriting purposes. Subsequent inspections involved only the first purpose, unless an \"additional risk\u201d was discovered. The findings of both types of inspections were compiled in reports that were sent to defendant\u2019s underwriters so that they could evaluate the value of Greenfield as an insured and the risk of keeping Greenfield as a client. Copies of the reports were also sent to Greenfield management. Robert Myles testified that the responsibility of defendant\u2019s Loss Control department was to inform the management of the safety problems and to advise them as to how to correct their safety procedures. Defendant also provided assistance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>and expertise in this area by training Greenfield personnel and joining Greenfield\u2019s safety meetings. Where an employer had an efficient safety program of its own, defendant visited the job site less frequently and extended fewer of these \"educational\u201d and \"advisory\u201d services. Defendant had offered the services of another inspector, Glenn Johnson, to Greenfield at its job sites. Both Myles and Murphy stressed that ultimately the decision to comply or not with defendant\u2019s recommendations rested solely with Greenfield\u2019s management.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\">On appeal, plaintiffs rely upon certain portions of this testimony, arguing that these portions state, when viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, that the primary purpose for the inspections (excluding an initial inspection) was to assist Greenfield. However, it is apparent from the context of these particular quotations that the witnesses were testifying about their responsibilities to their own company. Thus, part of defendant\u2019s means of controlling its losses was to recommend various safety precautions to its insureds and to then assist the insureds in implementing these precautions.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">This evidence falls short of the necessary proof of an agreement or intent to provide inspection services for Greenfield\u2019s (and its employees\u2019) benefit. The testimony establishes only that defendant inspected the job site to carry out its primary pupose of obtaining necessary information for its underwriters and to protect itself from losses once it had accepted Greenfield as a client. There is no indication in the evidence that defendant had ever promised to provide complete safety inspections to alert Greenfield to hazards on its premises or that defendant\u2019s advertising or communications with its policyholders represented that its inspection services would relieve Greenfield of the burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>monitoring its facilities. 410 Mich 718-719. Instead, the evidence establishes only the fact of inspections and subsequent loss prevention and is therefore insufficient to establish the necessary threshold of an \"undertaking to provide services to another\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Because we have reached this conclusion, we will not address defendant\u2019s second claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Under the unique procedural circumstances of this case, we partially reverse the judgments against defendant and remand to the trial court for a new trial limited solely to the issue of defendant\u2019s liability for plaintiffs\u2019 injuries under the theory that defendant had agreed or intended to provide services for the benefit of Greenfield Construction Co. and its employees. If plaintiffs are unable to prove such an undertaking, the entire judgments are reversed. However, if plaintiffs are able to prove the undertaking, the jury\u2019s prior determination of the amount of damages due to plaintiffs is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b254-6\"> The published text of \u00a7 324A uses \"protect\u201d instead of \"perform\u201d; this is apparently a typographical error. See <em>Smith v Allendale, supra, </em>410 Mich 705, fn 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b255-5\"> Plaintiffs also argue that defendant failed to preserve the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence under \u00a7 324A Restatement, Torts, 2d for appeal. We need not address this issue as the Supreme Court has ordered us to reconsider our previous decision \"in light of <em>Smith v Allendale\u201d.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b257-7\"><em> Ray v Transamerica Ins Co, </em>46 Mich App 647; 208 NW2d 610 (1973) ; <em>Watson v Employers Ins Co of Wausau, </em>50 Mich App 597; 213 NW2d 765 (1973); <em>Olkowski v Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co, </em>53 Mich App 497; 220 NW2d 97 (1974), <em>aff'd </em>393 Mich 758; 223 NW2d 296 (1974) .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b259-5\"><em> Andrews v Ins Co of North America, </em>60 Mich App 190, 196; 230 NW2d 371 (1975); <em>Ray v Transamerica Ins Co, supra; Watson </em>v <em>Employers Ins Co of Wausau, supra; Olkowski v Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
