The property is located in an area zoned as a \u201cSenior Residence/Life Care District,\u201d and it is operating as an assisted-living facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">{\u00b6 2} In tax year 2007, the county fiscal officer valued the subject property at $8,740,000, consistent with its 2004 sale price. The property\u2019s owner, appellee Health Care REIT, Inc., sought a reduction to $3,100,000, but appellee Cuyahoga County Board of Revision (\u201cBOR\u201d) retained the fiscal officer\u2019s valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">{\u00b6 3} The owner and the appellant, Berea City School District Board of Education (\u201cschool board\u201d), both appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d), where they presented competing appraisals. The owner\u2019s appraiser relied on data about apartment buildings as a starting point for valuation and opined a value of $3,100,000. By contrast, the school board\u2019s appraiser considered only data about assisted-living facilities and opined a value of $5,400,000. The BTA found the owner\u2019s appraisal more persuasive and assigned a value of $3,100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">{\u00b6 4} The school board now appeals, arguing that the BTA\u2019s decision was unlawful and unreasonable because, among other things, it relied on an appraisal that disregarded city zoning laws. For the reasons explained below, we affirm the BTA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-14\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b194-15\">\n<em>1. The subject property</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b194-16\">{\u00b6 5} The subject property, parcel No. 373-26-018, is a 6.415-acre tract of land located in the city of Middleburg Heights and in the Berea City School District. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>The property is located in an area zoned as a \u201cSenior Residence/Life Care District,\u201d which was established for the housing and living-assistance needs of persons 60 years and older. Middleburg Heights Codified Ordinances 1134.01 and 1134.02. In keeping with that restriction, the parcel was improved in 1998 with a 48,648-square-foot structure that operates as an assisted-living facility, Brookside Estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">{\u00b6 6} In October 2004, Health Care REIT, Inc., purchased the property for $8,740,000. The property was leased to and managed by Emeritus Corporation both before and after the 2004 sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\n<em>2. Board of revision proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">{\u00b6 7} In tax year 2006, the first year of Cuyahoga County\u2019s triennium, the school board filed a complaint with the BOR, seeking an increase in property value. Health Care REIT did not file a counter-complaint. The BOR increased the property\u2019s tax value to $8,740,000 for tax year 2006, consistent with the 2004 sale price.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">{\u00b6 8} The county fiscal officer assigned the same value for tax year 2007.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Health Care REIT filed a complaint requesting a reduction to $5,400,000, and it later filed an amended complaint seeking a reduction to $3,100,000. The school board filed a counter-complaint, supporting the fiscal officer\u2019s valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">{\u00b6 9} At the BOR hearing, Health Care REIT presented the testimony and report of appraiser Richard Racek Jr. Racek used the sales-comparison and income approaches to valuation, relying on data about apartment complexes as a starting point for his analysis. Ultimately, he opined a value of $3,100,000 for tax year 2007. An employee of Emeritus, Scott Marshall, also testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">{\u00b6 10} In response, the school board pointed to the BOR\u2019s decision accepting the 2004 sale price as the best evidence of the property\u2019s value for tax year 2006 and presented evidence of the 2004 sale and lease to Emeritus and the property\u2019s $50,000,000 mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">{\u00b6 11} On July 6, 2009, the BOR issued a decision retaining the fiscal officer\u2019s valuation of the property \u2014 $8,740,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">\n<em>3. BTA proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">{\u00b6 12} Both parties appealed the BOR decision to the BTA, and the cases were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">{\u00b6 13} At the BTA hearing, Health Care REIT presented a supplemented appraisal report from Racek and his testimony. Racek again used the sales-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>comparison and income approaches to valuation, but he supplemented his analysis with additional apartment comparables. He also developed a cost-approach analysis. As in his initial report, Racek opined a value of $3,100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">{\u00b6 14} The school board introduced testimony and an appraisal report from Charles M. Ritley. Ritley used all three valuation methods. Unlike Racek, however, he did not rely on any data about apartment complexes; Ritley used only assisted-living facilities as comparables. He also placed significant reliance on financial data about the subject property and data from the Marshall Swift Valuation Service for Homes for the Elderly. Ultimately, Ritley opined a value of $5,400,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">{\u00b6 15} On January 15, 2013, the BTA issued an opinion assigning a value of $3,100,000 for the January 1, 2007 tax-lien date. The BTA rejected the October 2004 sale price as the best evidence of the property\u2019s value in tax year 2007, citing the sale\u2019s remoteness and insufficient record evidence about the circumstances of the sale. The BTA then stated that it found Racek\u2019s opinion more persuasive than Ritley\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">{\u00b6 16} The school board appealed to this court. Oral argument was held before a master commissioner on December 17, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">{\u00b6 17} On appeal, the school board advances five propositions of law, each arguing that the BTA\u2019s decision was unreasonable and unlawful. At oral argument before the master commissioner, the school board clarified that it is asking this court \u201cto reverse\u201d the BTA \u201cbecause there was not sufficient evidence to warrant a reduction\u201d in value.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">{\u00b6 18} Health Care REIT defends the BTA\u2019s decision and asks this court to award attorney fees because the school board\u2019s appeal is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">\n<em>1.

And this court has explained that \u201c[t]he reasonableness of the length of time * * * encompasses all factors that would, by changing with the passage of time, affect the value of the property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>One component of recency is the period of time that has elapsed between the sale date and the tax-lien date. We have refrained from setting a limit on the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>time that can pass between the two dates before the sale no longer qualifies as recent; the length of time a sale remains \u201crecent\u201d \u201cwill vary from case to case.\u201d <em>New Winchester Gardens, Ltd. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>80 Ohio St.3d 36, 44, 684 N.E.2d 312 (1997), <em>overruled in part on other grounds, </em>Cummins.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When determining recency in a particular case, the BTA should also consider \u201cgeneral developments in the market between the date of sale and the tax-lien date.\u201d <em>Cummins </em>at \u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">{\u00b6 23} Here, the BTA\u2019s determination that the 2004 sale of the property was \u201ctoo remote from the tax lien date in this matter\u201d is reasonable because the BTA relied on affirmative evidence indicating that the sale should <em>not </em>be regarded as recent. BTA Nos. 2009-Q-1547, 2009-Q-1615, and 2009-Q-1616, 2013 WL 314191, at *2 (Jan. 15, 2013). <em>Compare Zell v. Hamilton Cty.

Indeed, we have stated that a presumption, such as that of recency, \u201c \u2018is a procedural device which is resorted to only in the absence of evidence by the party in whose favor a presumption would otherwise operate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cincinnati School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>78 Ohio St.3d 325, 328, 677 N.E.2d 1197 (1997), quoting <em>Ayers v. Woodard, </em>166 Ohio St. 138, 140 N.E.2d 401 (1957), paragraph three of the syllabus. Here, the BTA considered the recency of the sale in light of evidence offered by both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">{\u00b6 24} In this case, the sale occurred in October 2004, 26 months prior to the tax-lien date, January 1, 2007. Moreover, two competing appraisals of the property\u2019s January 1, 2007 value have been completed since the beginning of the triennium and <em>neither </em>relied on the 2004 sale price \u2014 $8,740,000\u2014as a basis for valuing the property. Racek submitted an appraisal of the property on March 23, 2009 (and a supplemented appraisal on February 17, 2012), arriving at a valuation of $3,100,000 each time. Ritley submitted an appraisal of the property on September 4, 2012, arriving at a valuation of $5,400,000. Together, the lapse of time and the appraisals support the BTA\u2019s decision to reject the sale price as the best evidence of value.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>{\u00b6 25} In addition, the BTA\u2019s finding is supported by record evidence of general market changes following the October 2004 sale. During the BTA hearing, the school board\u2019s own appraiser stated that the property \u201csuffer[ed] a slump in occupancy during the beginning of the housing crash and a little bit into it.\u201d He further noted that \u201c[i]n \u201907, we were in the significant beginnings of this great recession * * As a result, he explained, the property went \u201cthrough a tough period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">{\u00b6 26} Finally, the BTA\u2019s decision not to rely on the 2004 sale price is also supported by the testimony of the school board\u2019s appraiser and the property\u2019s manager, both of whom informed the BTA that the sale price included real property <em>and </em>business property. This makes sense, because the sale price of an assisted-living facility may \u201cinclude elements of business value that relate to the provision of ancillary services as opposed to the rental of realty.\u201d <em>LTC Properties, Inc. v. Licking Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>133 Ohio St.3d 111, 2012-Ohio-3930, 976 N.E.2d 852, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">{\u00b6 27} Under these circumstances, it can hardly be said that the record lacks support for the BTA\u2019s conclusion, much less that there is \u201ca total absence of evidence\u201d to support its findings. <em>HealthSouth Corp. v. Testa, </em>132 Ohio St.3d 55, 2012-Ohio-1871, 969 N.E.2d 232, \u00b6 14 (\u201cwe will reverse BTA findings only when there is a total absence of evidence to support a particular finding\u201d). Therefore, we defer to the BTA\u2019s finding that the 2004 sale was not recent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">\n<em>S. Relevance of zoning in real-property valuation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">{\u00b6 28} In proposition of law No. I, the school board argues that the BTA \u201cacted unreasonably when it accepted the valuation of an assisted-living facility based on comparisons to apartment buildings\u201d even though city zoning did not permit use of the property as an apartment building. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">{\u00b6 29} The subject property is located in an area zoned by the city as a \u201cSenior Residence/Life Care District.\u201d The city created this district \u201cspecifically for elderly living and care,\u201d contemplating facilities that would meet the housing and assistance needs of persons 60 years or older, \u201cwhatever level of attention they may require.\u201d Middleburg Heights Codified Ordinances 1134.01 and 1134.02. Housing in this district is limited to apartments and single-family cluster dwelling units designed specifically for the elderly, nursing-care facilities, and assisted-living facilities. <em>Id. </em>at 1134.03. Each type of housing must comply with a minimum-size-unit requirement. For example, in an assisted-living facility, every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>unit must be at least 250 square feet, and an apartment (with no bedroom) must be at least 500 square feet. <em>Id. </em>at 1134.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">{\u00b6 30} The subject property is operating as an assisted-living facility. Seventy-five of its 86 units are less than 500 square feet. Accordingly, it could not be classified as an apartment building under current zoning law. Even if the building were reconfigured to satisfy the size requirements for apartments, those units could still be rented only to persons 60 years old or older. To eliminate the age restriction would require revision of city zoning laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">{\u00b6 31} The school board argues that in light of these zoning restrictions, it was unreasonable for the BTA to rely on Racek\u2019s appraisal \u2014 which relied on comparisons to apartment buildings as a starting point for valuation. There appear to be two components to this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">{\u00b6 32} First, the school board argues that the BTA should not have relied on Racek\u2019s appraisal, because Racek mistakenly believed that the property was currently in use as an apartment building, not as an assisted-living facility. In his appraisal report, Racek did at one point refer to the property\u2019s continued use as an apartment building. However, he also clearly stated that the building was being operated as \u201can assisted living facility,\u201d and at the hearing, he explained that the property\u2019s \u201ccurrent occupant is using the property as an assisted living facility.\u201d In addition, Racek\u2019s appraisal reports indicate that \u201cimprovements on the subject property comprise a one story, assisted living facility.\u201d Thus, the BTA had a sufficient evidentiary basis for disregarding Racek\u2019s erroneous reference to the property\u2019s operation as an apartment building.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">{\u00b6 33} Second, the school board \u201csubmits that it is unreasonable for the BTA to rely on an appraisal report and testimony from an appraiser who disregards current zoning ordinances.\u201d It is true that an appraiser cannot simply ignore zoning restrictions. Indeed, standard assessment practices and this court\u2019s case law establish that the effect of zoning on a property\u2019s market price must be taken into account for valuation purposes. <em>See </em>International Association of Assessing Officers, <em>Property Assessment Valuation </em>11, 32, 54-59, 61-62 (2d Ed.1996); <em>Woda Ivy Glen Ltd. Partnership v. Fayette Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 175, 2009-Ohio-762, 902 N.E.2d 984, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">{\u00b6 34} Racek did not ignore the zoning ordinances, however. Instead, he opined, as did the school board\u2019s expert, that the highest and best use of the building was its current use \u2014 as an assisted-living facility.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Racek then stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>that the best way to calculate the property\u2019s value was by way of comparison to apartment buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">{\u00b6 35} Nevertheless, the school board claims that Racek improperly disregarded zoning laws, citing two cases to support its argument. First, the school board says <em>Porter v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>50 Ohio St.2d 307, 364 N.E.2d 261 (1977), requires record support for any anticipated zoning changes before they can be factored into an appraisal. In <em>Porter, </em>this court considered how to value real property when it is <em>not </em>zoned for its highest and best use. The property at issue was \u201czoned for less profitable uses as compared with neighboring lands zoned for more profitable uses,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 310, yet the BTA had relied on an appraisal that \u201ctreated the property in question as if it were already zoned for its highest and best use,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 312. We reversed, holding that \u201c[i]n determining the value of property for tax assessment purposes, the taxing authority may not consider an appraisal of property in which the appraiser, believing the property to be more valuable than its permitted uses under current zoning laws indicate, values the property as if it were already zoned for its most profitable use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at syllabus. This accords with the generally accepted principle that a highest and best use must be one that is legally permissible in order to qualify as the basis for assessing the property. <em>Property Assessment Valuation </em>at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">{\u00b6 36} Unlike in <em>Porter, </em>here the BTA did not rely on an appraisal that valued the property based on a different use. Racek did not state that the property would be more highly valued as an apartment building than as an assisted-living facility, and he did not disregard existing zoning restrictions to evaluate the property for a use not presently permitted by law. Indeed, Racek and Ritley <em>agreed </em>that the highest and best use of this property was its current use \u2014 as an assisted-living facility. To the extent that Racek relied on data about apartment buildings, it was <em>not </em>for the purpose of showing that this property\u2019s highest and best use would be as an apartment building. Instead, as discussed below, he relied on information about apartment buildings as a way to isolate the property\u2019s real estate value from its business value. Accordingly, the BTA\u2019s decision to credit Racek\u2019s appraisal does not implicate <em>Porter </em>problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">{\u00b6 37} The school board also quotes <em>Park Place Properties, L.L.C. v. Miami Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>2d Dist. Miami No. 2001-CA-35, 2002 WL 242707, *11 (Feb. 15, 2002), for the proposition that evidence of value for a use prohibited by ordinance may be considered only when there is evidence showing that the ordinance is likely to be changed in the near future. As in <em>Porter, </em>the appraiser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>in <em>Park Place </em>found that the highest and best use of the property was warehousing, even though the property\u2019s current zoning did not permit that use. <em>Id. </em>at *9. The trial court\u2019s determination of value reflected the possibility that the property would be used for warehousing. However, the court of appeals rejected that valuation because \u201cno evidence [had been] presented to support the reasonable probability of a zoning change in the near future.\u201d Id. at *11.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">{\u00b6 38} The facts here differ from those in <em>Porter </em>and <em>Park Place </em>because both appraisers agree that the property\u2019s highest and best use is as an assisted-living facility, a use permitted by existing zoning laws. Their dispute is about how to best calculate the property\u2019s value for that use. Accordingly, current zoning restrictions did not require the BTA to discount Racek\u2019s appraisal. We therefore reject the school board\u2019s first proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">A <em>BTA\u2019s decision to accept Racek\u2019s appraisal over Ritley\u2019s was not unreasonable or unlawful</em></p>\n<p id=\"AB\">{\u00b6 39} In proposition of law Nos. II and III, the school board argues that the BTA acted unreasonably and unlawfully by accepting a valuation for an assisted-living facility that relied on comparisons to apartment buildings (Racek\u2019s appraisal) and rejecting a valuation that compared the assisted-living facility to other assisted-living facilities (Ritley\u2019s appraisal). Throughout these arguments, the school board levies additional criticisms of Racek\u2019s appraisal and argues that Ritley\u2019s appraisal is superior.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">a.

The school board argues that under any of these three approaches, an appraiser may not rely on comparisons to apartment buildings when valuing an assisted-living facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">{\u00b6 41} We have squarely rejected the school board\u2019s argument in earlier decisions. <em>See LTC Properties, </em>133 Ohio St.3d 111, 2012-Ohio-3930, 976 N.E.2d 852, at \u00b6 21; <em>see also Dublin Senior Community Ltd.

The valuation of the realty portion of congregate-care facilities by comparison to conventional apartment buildings has been common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>practice for over 20 years. <em>See Chippewa Place Dev. Co. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>BTA No. 91-P-245, 1993 WL 384198 (Sept. 24, 1993).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As recently as 2012, we confirmed that it is appropriate for appraisers to compare assisted-living facilities to apartment buildings in order to distinguish the property\u2019s real-property value from its business-property value. <em>LTC Properties </em>at \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">{\u00b6 42} <em>LTC Properties </em>then articulated the rationale for comparing assisted-living facilities to apartment buildings. Two considerations \u201cmilitate toward using apartment buildings as a point of comparison when valuing the real property of a congregate-care facility under the sales-comparison or income-capitalization approaches.\u201d <em>Id. </em>First, \u201cthe sale price of a congregate-care facility may include elements of business value that relate to the provision of ancillary services as opposed to the rental of realty.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Dublin Senior Community </em>at 460 (\u201ca congregate care center * * * comprises a combination of real estate and business activities,\u201d such as food and housekeeping). Second, \u201cthe income of a congregate-care facility must be analyzed into its rental and service-fee components in order to determine that portion of income that relates to realty.\u201d <em>LTC Properties </em>at \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">{\u00b6 43} The same concerns do not apply in the context of the cost approach to valuation. <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 19-22. When using this approach, an appraiser may choose to rely on apartment-building cost schedules as the starting point for comparison to an assisted-living facility. However, as we have expressly recognized, an appraiser may also choose to rely on cost schedules for nursing homes, rather than apartment buildings, as the initial point of comparison. <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 20-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">{\u00b6 44} In short, an appraiser may rely on apartment comparables when valuing an assisted-living facility. We therefore reject the school board\u2019s claim that the BTA improperly relied on Racek\u2019s appraisal because \u201c[ajpartment buildings are not comparable to assisted living facilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">b. The BTA\u2019s decision in <em>Elm St. </em>is not determinative of this case</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">{\u00b6 45} The school board also argues that we must reverse the BTA\u2019s decision because it contradicts the BTA\u2019s prior holding in <em>Elm St., Inc. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>BTA No. 2008-A-1095, 2011 WL 2446195 (June 14, 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">{\u00b6 46} In <em>Elm St, </em>a property owner challenged the Cuyahoga County Board of Revision\u2019s valuation of an assisted-living facility at $3,393,500. The property owner sought a reduction to $2,150,000. In support, it presented Racek\u2019s opinion of value, which the BTA rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>{\u00b6 47} In rejecting Racek\u2019s appraisal, the BTA critiqued his use of apartment comparables to value the <em>Elm St. </em>property. The BTA initially acknowledged that in determining the real-property valuation of congregate-care facilities, it had routinely relied upon appraisal information utilizing a comparison to conventional apartment buildings since its decision in <em>Chippewa Place. Elm St. at *5. </em>However, the BTA then found that the apartment comparables selected by Racek were \u201csignificantly dissimilar to the subject [property].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing differences in the size and number of units, amenities, etc.). The BTA explained that \u201cadjustments could have been made to account for the aforementioned drastic differences\u201d but that it was unclear from the record whether Racek had made the necessary adjustments. <em>Id. </em>at *6. The BTA also questioned Racek\u2019s valuation because he had used the same rent rate to calculate the property\u2019s entire square footage, including common areas. <em>Id. </em>Ultimately, the BTA concluded that Racek\u2019s resulting valuation was unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">{\u00b6 48} The school board now contends that because the BTA rejected Racek\u2019s appraisal in <em>Elm St, </em>stare decisis required the BTA to also reject Racek\u2019s appraisal in this case. The subject properties in <em>Elm St </em>and this case are located near each other and have similar features. And Racek\u2019s appraisals of the two properties have many similarities: his sales-approach valuation in this appraisal used the same four apartment comparables from the <em>Elm St </em>appraisal (but included four additional comparables); he relied on the same expense information and comparable sales to establish a capitalization rate in both appraisals; he used the same cost method and depreciation rate in both appraisals; and he applied the same methodology for determining a depreciation rate in the cost approach for both properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">{\u00b6 49} In spite of these similarities, <em>Elm St. </em>does not mandate any particular outcome in this case. We have firmly rejected arguments that the BTA must act consistently when evaluating evidence of value, even when the evidence goes to value of the <em>same </em>property in different tax years. <em>See Olmsted Falls Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 134, 2009-Ohio-2461, 909 N.E.2d 597, \u00b6 24-25. Although \u201cconsistency in the manner of evaluating evidence is desirable,\u201d \u201cthe concern for consistency is overridden by the imperative that the BTA correctly determine value in the case before it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">{\u00b6 50} Here, nothing in the record indicates that the BTA was unreasonable in finding Racek\u2019s valuation more credible than Ritley\u2019s in <em>this case. </em>The BTA\u2019s identification of certain problems with Racek\u2019s analysis in <em>Elm St. </em>arguably does highlight flaws in Racek\u2019s present appraisal. But the BTA did not cite the same problems with Racek\u2019s adjustments in this case that it identified in <em>Elm St. </em>Accordingly, we cannot conclude that <em>Elm St. </em>required the BTA to reach a different outcome here.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>c. The BTA\u2019s decision to rely on Racek\u2019s appraisal is supported by the record</p>\n<p id=\"Aj\">{\u00b6 51} Throughout proposition of law Nos. II and III, the school board suggests a variety of other reasons why this court should conclude that Ritley\u2019s appraisal is more persuasive than Racek\u2019s. In essence, these arguments invite this court to disregard the deference we owe to the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">{\u00b6 52} We have long recognized the BTA\u2019s \u201cwide discretion to determine the weight given to evidence and the credibility of witnesses before it\u201d when making a decision about the valuation of property. <em>Meijer, Inc. v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>75 Ohio St.3d 181, 185, 661 N.E.2d 1056 (1996). The BTA \u201cis not required to adopt the appraisal methodology espoused by any expert or witness\u201d in arriving at a valuation. <em>Hotel Statler v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>79 Ohio St.3d 299, 303, 681 N.E.2d 425 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">{\u00b6 53} When we review a determination of valuation by the BTA, we do not reevaluate the evidence considered by the BTA or \u201csubstitute [our] judgment on factual issues for that of the Board of Tax Appeals.\u201d <em>Citizens Fin. Corp. v. Porterfield, </em>25 Ohio St.2d 53, 57, 266 N.E.2d 828 (1971). Instead, we must defer to the BTA\u2019s decision as long as it is lawful and supported by the record. <em>See Throckmorton v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>75 Ohio St.3d 227, 229, 661 N.E.2d 1095 (1996). Here, the school board is unable to overcome that heavy measure of deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">\n<em>i. Racek\u2019s sales-comparison approach</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ASD\">{\u00b6 54} The school board argues that the BTA erroneously credited Racek\u2019s valuation because his sales-comparison analysis relied on data from eight apartment complexes that are not comparable to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">{\u00b6 55} As explained above, it is permissible \u2014 indeed, preferable \u2014 for an appraiser to rely on apartment comparables as a starting point for valuing an assisted-living facility under the sales-comparison approach. <em>LTC Properties, </em>133 Ohio St.3d 111, 2012-Ohio-3930, 976 N.E.2d 852, at \u00b621. Here, the BTA concluded that the comparables used in Racek\u2019s appraisal supported his valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">{\u00b6 56} The school board contends otherwise, citing significant differences between Racek\u2019s comparables and the subject property, including differences in overall square footage, unit square footage, value, amenities, and age. But the BTA was aware of these differences and reasonably concluded that Racek had made adequate \u201cadjustments to each of the sale and rent comparables used to account for the differences in amenities and size of the units.\u201d 2013 WL 314191 at *4. In addition, the BTA specifically noted that Racek \u201cconsidered the \u2018relatively small size and number of residential units\u2019 within the subject property, \u2018as well as the significant amount of common areas\u2019 in estimating operating expenses.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting Racek\u2019s appraisal report.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>{\u00b6 57} The school board also claims that Racek\u2019s appraisal lacks credibility because Racek did not adjust his final valuation after adding three comparables in his supplemented report. In his initial report, presented to the BOR, Racek considered five apartment-complex comparables. After the BTA issued its decision in <em>Elm St., </em>2011 WL 2446195, Racek supplemented his report to include three additional apartment-complex comparables (and two additional rent comparables in his income-approach analysis). The new comparables had a lower value than the original comparables. But in spite of that lower value, Racek\u2019s opinion of value remained the same: $3,100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">{\u00b6 58} Racek\u2019s unchanged valuation is somewhat perplexing, but even so, the school board cannot meet the heavy burden of proving that the BTA acted unreasonably by accepting Racek\u2019s appraisal over Ritley\u2019s. The BTA explained that Racek\u2019s valuation was more persuasive than Ritley\u2019s because even though Ritley used assisted-living-facility sales comparables, he did not adequately distinguish the business components from real-property components in the sale prices. 2013 WL 314191 at *4. Indeed, the BTA quoted Ritley\u2019s own appraisal report, which states, \u201c[I]t was * * * difficult to understand what is included in the sale price relative to the large business value component of many sales\u201d when using assisted-living-facility comparables. <em>Id. </em>Ritley also acknowledged that his comparables offered different levels and types of service than the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">{\u00b6 59} Under the circumstances, the BTA reasonably concluded that \u201cRaeek\u2019s opinion of value [was] more persuasive\u201d; his appraisal did not conflate the value associated with business components with real-property value. \u2022 <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">\n<em>ii. Racek\u2019s income approach</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">{\u00b6 60} The school board also argues that the BTA erred by crediting Racek\u2019s valuation because his \u201cincome approach is not a good indicator of value.\u201d According to the school board, Racek treated the subject property as an apartment complex without making adjustments for the property\u2019s resident-age restriction or the income and expenses specific to elder-care properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">{\u00b6 61} As explained above, Racek permissibly relied on apartment-building rent comparables as a starting point for his income-approach analysis. <em>LTC Properties, </em>133 Ohio St.3d 111, 2012-Ohio-3930, 976 N.E.2d 852, at \u00b6 21. Moreover, the BTA reasonably concluded that Racek had made adjustments to account for differences in amenities and size. 2013 WL 314191 at *4. He considered the relatively small size and number of residential units in the subject property, as well as the significant amount of common areas, when estimating operating expenses. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>{\u00b6 62} The BTA found that Racek\u2019s valuation was more credible than Ritley\u2019s because, as with his sales comparables, Ritley\u2019s rent comparables reflected the income value of both real property and services. In addition, Ritley acknowledged that his comparables offered different levels and types of service. Yet even so, Ritley \u201csimply compared the subject\u2019s actual 2012 rental rates to the rents charged by the comparables.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">{\u00b6 63} Under the circumstances, it was reasonable for the BTA to assign greater weight to Racek\u2019s valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\n<em>in. Racek\u2019s cost approach</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">{\u00b6 64} Finally, the school board argues that the BTA erred by relying on Racek\u2019s valuation under the cost approach because he used Marshall Swift Valuation Service\u2019s information about apartments rather than that service\u2019s information about homes for the elderly to determine total replacement cost and depreciation for the building on the property. The school board claims that Ritley\u2019s cost valuation is more credible because he used the Marshall Swift Valuation Service for Homes for the Elderly.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">{\u00b6 65} As with its other critiques of Racek\u2019s appraisal, the school board\u2019s objections to Racek\u2019s cost analysis are rooted in his reliance on information about apartment buildings. But as explained above, <em>LTC Properties </em>permits an appraiser to rely on cost schedules for either apartment buildings or assisted-living facilities as the starting point for analysis under the cost approach. Accordingly, the BTA did not err by failing to reject Racek\u2019s appraisal for this reason. Indeed, this is a quintessential fact-finding determination, to which we must defer.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">\n<em>iv. Conclusion regarding proposition of law Nos. I and II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">{\u00b6 66} In short, the school board did not show that the BTA\u2019s acceptance of Racek\u2019s valuation was unlawful or unreasonable. Our role does not include reevaluating the evidence considered by the BTA. And because the record supports the BTA\u2019s decision, we reject the school board\u2019s second and third propositions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">\n<em>5. Clarity of the BTA decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">{\u00b6 67} In proposition of law No. V, the school board argues that the BTA\u2019s decision is unreasonable and unlawful because it does not set forth findings, state what evidence the BTA deemed relevant to determine value, or explain why the BTA rejected other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">{\u00b6 68} We have expressly held that the BTA is <em>not </em>required to set forth formal findings of fact and conclusions of law. <em>See Wolf v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>11 Ohio St.3d 205, 206, 465 N.E.2d 50 (1984). However, the BTA does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>have \u201cthe duty to state what evidence it considered relevant in reaching its determination.\u201d <em>HealthSouth Corp. v. Levin, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 282, 2009-Ohio-584, 903 N.E.2d 1179, \u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">{\u00b6 69} As a practical matter, it can be impossible for this court to perform its appellate duty if a BTA decision fails to state what evidence it considered relevant in reaching its value determinations. For example, in <em>Howard v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>37 Ohio St.3d 195, 524 N.E.2d 887 (1988), the BTA heard evidence of three possible property values. The BTA set the value at a figure that no one had advocated and offered no explanation of how it reached that figure. We were unable to review the BTA\u2019s decision to determine whether it was unlawful or unreasonable because the BTA had not explained its reasoning. Similarly, in <em>Gen. Motors Corp. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>53 Ohio St.3d 233, 559 N.E.2d 1328 (1990), we remanded to the BTA to specify reasons for its determination. We reiterated that \u201c[w]e can perform our duty to affirm reasonable, and to reverse unreasonable, determinations only when the BTA sets forth its findings and the basis therefor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">{\u00b6 70} Despite the school board\u2019s protestations, here the BTA did set forth the basis for its decision: \u201cwe find Mr. Racek\u2019s opinion of value more persuasive.\u201d 2013 WL 314191 at *4. As a result, the BTA found the value of the subject property as of January 1, 2007, to be $3,100,000. <em>Id. </em>The BTA could have explained additional aspects of its reasoning, but its failure to do so does not necessitate reversal. The record is clear as to which evidence the BTA found more persuasive, so we are able to review the BTA\u2019s decision without remanding for additional explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">{\u00b6 71} We therefore reject the school board\u2019s fifth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">\n<em>6. Attorney fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">{\u00b6 72} Finally, Health Care REIT asks this court to award attorney fees because the school board\u2019s appeal is frivolous. According to Health Care REIT, the school board\u2019s appeal \u201cis not reasonably well-grounded in fact or warranted by existing law or a good-faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.\u201d <em>See </em>S.CtPrac.R. 4.03 (setting forth when an appeal is considered frivolous).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">{\u00b6 73} This court has awarded attorney fees under the frivolous-appeal rule under limited circumstances. For example, we ordered sanctions against an appellant in a frivolous appeal when he had a history of filing similar frivolous actions. <em>State ex rel. Howard v. Doneghy, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 355, 2004-Ohio-3207, 810 N.E.2d 958, \u00b6 10-11. Sanctions are also appropriate when a party files an action for no reason other than harassment. <em>State ex rel. Grendell v. Davidson, </em>86 Ohio St.3d 629, 716 N.E.2d 704 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>{\u00b6 74} This is not the sort of action that warrants an award of attorney fees. As the school board notes, there is an appeal as of right from decisions of the BTA to this court. <em>See </em>R.C. 5717.04. In the past, we have been willing to reverse the BTA\u2019s findings upon finding that they lack evidentiary support in the record. <em>See, e.g., Cincinnati School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 63, 2010-Ohio-4907, 936 N.E.2d 489, \u00b6 24, 35. Here, the school board\u2019s objections to Racek\u2019s appraisal provided a reasonable basis for arguing that the BTA\u2019s findings lacked evidentiary support. In addition, the school board also identified a possible conflict between the BTA\u2019s decisions in this case and in <em>Elm St., </em>2011 WL 2446195. Accordingly, there was a reasonable basis for the school board to advocate reversal in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">{\u00b6 75} For these reasons, we decline to award attorney fees under S.Ct.Prac.R. 4.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">{\u00b676} For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the BTA\u2019s decision and deny Health Care REIT\u2019s request for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b209-9\">Pfeifer, O\u2019Do.nnell, and Kennedy, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b209-10\">French, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b209-11\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Lanzinger and O\u2019Neill, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b195-14\">.

The school board contends that the holding of <em>Chippewa Place, </em>permitting comparison of a congregate-care facility to traditional apartments, does not extend to assisted-living facilities, because the former allow for more independent living than the latter. This court did not distinguish between these types of facilities in <em>LTC Properties, </em>however.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b209-12\">O\u2019Neill, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A9S\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-13\">{\u00b6 77} I respectfully dissent from the decision to affirm the BTA\u2019s determination of real-property value in this case. The BTA and, now, the majority have essentially decided that the value of an assisted-living facility is better determined by comparison to apartment buildings than by comparison to other assisted-living facilities. I cannot stand behind that logic, even under a posture of deference to the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-14\">{\u00b6 78} The subject property is located in an area zoned \u201cSenior Residence/Life Care District,\u201d which is intended to meet the housing and assistance needs of persons 60 years or older. An assisted-living facility, Brookside Estates, was constructed on the parcel in 1998. The facility includes fewer than 100 units, the vast majority of which are 254-square-foot studios. The building includes four lounges, a commercial kitchen, a dining room, a craft room, a television room, and a small beauty shop. Bathrooms are handicapped accessible, hallways are wide enough to allow for the passage of wheelchairs and medical carts, and the front driveway is curved to allow easy access for emergency vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>{\u00b6 79} In short, this is an assisted-living facility; it is <em>not </em>an apartment building. Indeed, as the school board\u2019s appraiser testified before the BTA, \u201c[i]t would take a massive amount of reconfiguration\u201d to operate this property as an apartment building.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">{\u00b6 80} This basic distinction between an assisted-living facility and an apartment building compels me to conclude that the BTA acted unreasonably when it determined this property\u2019s value by reference to data about apartment buildings. As the majority explains, two appraisals were presented to the BTA. The property owner\u2019s appraiser relied exclusively on data about apartment buildings and opined a value of $3,100,000. By contrast, the school board\u2019s appraiser considered only data about assisted-living facilities and arrived at a value of $5,400,000. Both appraisals assigned a value significantly lower than the property\u2019s most recent sale price, $8,740,000. It was an assisted-living facility then, and it is an assisted-living facility now. To value it based upon a deteriorating apartment market is disingenuous. To follow the logic of the majority and the BTA, why not bring in comparables from abandoned car dealerships and factories of similar square footage? Surely that would bring the tax value even lower.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">{\u00b6 81} For reasons I find unpersuasive, the BTA decided to credit the owner\u2019s appraisal. The BTA essentially found that data about apartment buildings was better evidence of an assisted-living facility\u2019s value than data about other assisted-living facilities. In doing so, the BTA concluded that the property had lost $5,640,000 in value since its 2004 sale, just 27 months earlier. There is simply no evidence in this record to support such a conclusion. Has the population of senior citizens dropped so precipitously that the owner would sell this asset for a $5.6 million loss a little over two years after purchasing it? This result is clearly unreasonable, and thus I cannot defer.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">{\u00b6 82} I recognize that in the past, the BTA and this court have permitted comparisons to apartment buildings as a starting point for determining the value of an assisted-living facility. <em>See, e.g., LTC Properties, Inc. v. Licking Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>133 Ohio St.3d 111, 2012-Ohio-3930, 976 N.E.2d 852, \u00b6 21; <em>Dublin Senior Community Ltd. Partnership v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>80 Ohio St.3d 455, 460, 687 N.E.2d 426 (1997). Admittedly, relying on apartment comparables can facilitate the distinction between the real-property value of an assisted-living facility and its business value. <em>See Harbor Court Ltd. Partnership v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>BTA No. 92-T-1054, 1994 WL 269639, *7-8 (June 10, 1994). But that does not mean that conventional apartment complexes make the best comparable properties in all cases. <em>Id. </em>at *11.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">{\u00b6 83} Moreover, we have not previously been squarely presented with the question whether the BTA can reasonably conclude that an appraisal based on apartment comparables is the best evidence of an assisted-living facility\u2019s value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>even when it is simultaneously presented with a credible appraisal based on assisted-living-facility comparables. For the reasons explained above, I would now hold that it cannot.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ARx\">Sleggs, Danzinger &amp; Gill Co., L.P.A., and Todd W.
