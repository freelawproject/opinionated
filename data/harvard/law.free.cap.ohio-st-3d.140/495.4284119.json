Gerald McGee) and his Ohio corpora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>tion, STAND Inc. The complaint alleged that Zubaidah, who is not licensed to practice law in Ohio, provided legal advice and services to four defendants during their criminal proceedings. Zubaidah answered the complaint, admitting to a number of the facts asserted but denying the allegations of the unauthorized practice of law. A panel of the board was appointed to hear the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">{\u00b6 2} After relator moved to withdraw a joint motion to approve a consent decree because Zubaidah\u2019s signature on the proposed decree was invalid, the matter proceeded to a hearing on May 15, 2012. Upon consideration of the testimony of ten witnesses and dozens of exhibits, the panel submitted a report concluding that Zubaidah had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law in each of the four alleged counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">{\u00b6 3} The panel recommended a civil penalty of $5,000 for each count, totaling $20,000, to be imposed jointly and severally against Zubaidah and STAND. The panel also recommended enjoining Zubaidah and STAND from further engaging in the unauthorized practice of law and assessing respondents for the costs and expenses incurred by the board and bar association. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">{\u00b6 4} Zubaidah filed objections to the board\u2019s report with this court, generally asserting that the board\u2019s decision was not factually supported. For the reasons stated below, we overrule Zubaidah\u2019s objections, and we agree with the board\u2019s findings and recommendations. We accordingly enjoin Zubaidah and STAND Inc. from engaging in the unauthorized practice of law, we assess costs, and we order Zubaidah and STAND, jointly and severally, to pay a $20,000 civil penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">{\u00b6 5} In 1986, the Lorain County Court of Common Pleas convicted Zubaidah of a single count of aggravated trafficking in drugs, imposed a suspended prison sentence of one and a half years, and ordered Zubaidah to serve five years of probation. Zubaidah was the president of STAND Inc. (Striving Towards a New Day!), a corporation he formed in 2008 inspired by his own experience with the justice system and his research into judicial cases. A stated mission of STAND was \u201cto help change the unfair and partial treatment against minorities in the judicial system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">{\u00b6 6} Zubaidah had originally wanted funding for STAND to be able to subsidize legal representation for criminal defendants, but he later abandoned his plan of applying for grants or other funding for legal services. He sought to further STAND\u2019S mission by providing his personal assistance to individuals in his community facing criminal charges. Zubaidah is not admitted to the practice of law in Ohio, has not received any legal training, and does not have a college degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>{\u00b6 7} Recipients of Zubaidah\u2019s assistance become STAND \u201cmembers\u201d after signing a \u201cGeneral Letter of Introduction,\u201d which is a one-page agreement providing that \u201cSTAND Inc. will be assisting\u201d the member. No payment is required to be a STAND member. In each of the four matters giving rise to the counts against respondents, the parent of a criminal defendant or the defendant himself requested assistance from Zubaidah during the pendency of the defendant\u2019s proceedings and signed the STAND agreement. All family members who testified regarding the four matters stated that Zubaidah had never claimed to be an attorney, and they were aware that Zubaidah was not an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The Calhoun Matter</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">{\u00b6 8} In September 2008, Dennis Calhoun was arrested and charged with two counts of rape and two counts of gross sexual imposition involving a minor under the age of 13. Attorney David Nehr represented Calhoun. Calhoun\u2019s mother, Terri Blackburn, signed a STAND membership agreement with Zubaidah after she became dissatisfied with Nehr\u2019s representation. Nehr presented a plea offer to Calhoun and advised him to accept it, but after Calhoun insisted on consulting with his family and other individuals, including Zubaidah, Calhoun rebuffed the plea offer and the case proceeded to trial. After a bench trial in July 2009, Calhoun was found guilty on all four counts. He was ultimately given a prison sentence of 15 years to life and classified as a Tier III sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">{\u00b6 9} In July 2009, before Calhoun was sentenced, Zubaidah sent a letter to Nehr informing him that Calhoun was \u201cbeing assisted\u201d by STAND and attaching a copy of the STAND membership agreement signed by Blackburn. Zubaidah alleged that Nehr had been verbally abusive to Blackburn, driving her \u201cto seek other assistance for her son\u2019s freedom,\u201d and that Nehr had emotionally manipulated Calhoun\u2019s family by approaching Calhoun with a plea deal in 2009 after allegedly stating in 2008 that the prosecution did not have evidence to support a conviction. A few days later, Zubaidah sent a second letter accusing Nehr of making insulting statements to Blackburn and of failing to protect Calhoun\u2019s interests. Zubaidah provided copies of these letters to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and the judge presiding over Calhoun\u2019s proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">{\u00b6 10} Nehr testified that he believed that Zubaidah\u2019s involvement with Calhoun had a significant negative impact on the case, because Calhoun was more willing to listen to Zubaidah than to Nehr and rejected any legal advice that Nehr provided subsequent to Zubaidah\u2019s involvement. Nehr also testified that in August 2009, he witnessed Zubaidah enter a courthouse holding cell, access to which was restricted to attorneys and court personnel, and proceed to speak with two defendants. In September 2009, Nehr witnessed Zubaidah talking with another of Nehr\u2019s clients in a courtroom hallway. Nehr learned from his client that Zubaidah had approached the client to discuss current and prior criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>proceedings and that Zubaidah had advised the client of what he could do through the legal appellate process to remove prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">{\u00b6 11} Nehr conceded that he never heard Zubaidah claim to be an attorney or otherwise hold himself out as an attorney. However, Zubaidah\u2019s \u201cconstant presence at court speaking to clients and advising them contrary to their attorney\u2019s advice\u201d led Nehr to believe that Zubaidah was practicing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The White Matter</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">{\u00b6 12} In December 2008, Eric White was charged with two counts of felonious assault and accompanying firearm specifications. Judge James Miraldi presided over the case and initially appointed James Dorman to represent White. In February 2009, after Dorman withdrew from representation due to disagreements regarding legal strategy, Judge Miraldi appointed J. Anthony Rich to represent White. White\u2019s mother, Gail White, signed a STAND membership agreement with Zubaidah, with the intent that Zubaidah would attend proceedings and provide support for White at times when Gail was unable to travel from her residence in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">{\u00b6 13} In July 2009, Zubaidah accompanied Gail to a meeting with Rich, during which Gail urged the pursuit of legal strategies that Rich perceived as involving perjury and bribery. Although Zubaidah did not personally participate in that discussion, Zubaidah\u2019s repeated interventions and White\u2019s actions from that point on led Rich to believe that Zubaidah was providing legal advice to White and his family. Subsequent to Zubaidah\u2019s involvement, White began to ask legal questions and request actions that were not relevant to his defense. White no longer gave credence to Rich\u2019s advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">{\u00b6 14} Zubaidah then began to directly interject himself into White\u2019s proceedings. In September 2009, Zubaidah sent a letter to Judge Miraldi, asking the judge to lower the amount of White\u2019s bond. Zubaidah cited the case of another criminal defendant whose bond had been set at a lower amount and argued that the judge should lower White\u2019s bond to the same amount because of the circumstances of White\u2019s case. Zubaidah qualified his arguments by explaining that \u201cStand Inc. does not act as a lawyer,\u201d but he also explained that the aim of his organization was to provide case comparisons and argue against the unfair treatment of individual defendants appearing before the court. The court forwarded Zubaidah\u2019s letter to Rich and gave Rich the opportunity to present a formal request for a bond reduction, which was then denied in October 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">{\u00b6 15} In December 2009, Zubaidah sent a letter to Rich, accusing him of failing to provide ethical and competent representation to White, citing multiple criminal cases in which the defendants\u2019 bonds were set at a lower amount than White\u2019s bond, and urging Rich to seek similar treatment for White. Rich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>withdrew as counsel shortly thereafter due to Zubaidah\u2019s interference with the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">{\u00b6 16} After a third attorney was appointed to White\u2019s case, Zubaidah continued his attempts to advocate for White by sending another letter to Judge Miraldi in January 2010. In it, Zubaidah again explained that he was not an attorney and that he believed it was not the practice of law to provide case comparisons and state what he \u201cmight have done differently.\u201d The stated purpose of the letter was to express concern regarding White\u2019s case \u201con his behalf\u2019 and to advocate for a reduced bond. Zubaidah again cited the case of another criminal defendant and argued that White\u2019s bond should be lowered to a similar level. Zubaidah concluded the letter by stating that White would be appearing before the judge in February 2010 and asking Judge Miraldi to reduce White\u2019s bond at that time. In March 2010, White pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of one count of felonious assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">{\u00b6 17} Both Zubaidah and Gail White testified that Zubaidah was a friend of the family, that he was not an attorney, and that he was not practicing law. Judge Miraldi testified that although Zubaidah claimed he was not practicing law, Zubaidah\u2019s letters comparing different criminal cases and advocating for legal results on behalf of a party appeared to constitute the practice of law. Rich testified that although Zubaidah had always claimed not to be an attorney, Zubaidah\u2019s advice to White and his ex parte letter to Judge Miraldi led Rich to believe that Zubaidah was practicing law. Based on Zubaidah\u2019s citations of inapposite case law and advice regarding irrelevant legal strategies, Rich believed that Zubaidah\u2019s involvement was detrimental to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">The Harris Matter</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">{\u00b6 18} In 2008, Isaiah Harris faced a number of charges in three separate cases, all involving the same victim. In May 2008, he was charged with felonious assault and domestic violence. In September 2008, he was charged with domestic violence and violation of a protection order. And in December 2008, he was charged with domestic violence, violation of a protection order, intimidation, kidnapping, rape, and two counts of aggravated burglary. Judge Christopher Rothgery presided over the cases and appointed J. Anthony Rich to represent Harris in all three. Harris personally signed a STAND membership agreement with Zubaidah.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">{\u00b6 19} In February 2009, the court consolidated the three cases pursuant to Harris\u2019s request but over Rich\u2019s objection. By March 2009, Rich had become extremely concerned with Harris\u2019s defiance of his legal advice and certain instances of Harris\u2019s behavior that threatened to undermine his own defense. For example, Harris confessed to many of the charged crimes during recorded phone calls to the victim from jail, yet refused to enter a guilty plea to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>charges, turning down a favorable plea deal for a three-year prison term that had been offered by the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">{\u00b6 20} Harris\u2019s consolidated cases were scheduled for a bench trial in May 2009. Two weeks prior to trial, Zubaidah sent a letter to Judge Rothgery, attaching Harris\u2019s agreement to allow STAND to \u201csupport * * * his involvement with the judicial system.\u201d Zubaidah indicated that he had in-depth knowledge about the facts of Harris\u2019s case; he defended Harris\u2019s actions by explaining that they were born of \u201cintoxicated love emotions\u201d and arguing that Harris was \u201conly guilty of loving [the victim] too much.\u201d Zubaidah asserted that \u201c[r]egardless of his extreme love for [the victim] he wouldn\u2019t force her to have sex with him or be a burglar where his three children resided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">{\u00b6 21} At Harris\u2019s trial, the prosecution played the recordings of Harris explicitly confessing to many of the crimes that he was contesting he committed. Judge Rothgery called a recess and suggested that Rich and Harris regroup in order to repair what appeared to be a breakdown in communication over trial strategy. Rich negotiated with the prosecution for a plea deal for four years in prison, and the judge indicated a willingness to assent to such a deal. Harris again refused to enter a plea and insisted on continuing with the trial. Harris was ultimately convicted of rape, intimidation, three counts of domestic violence, two counts of violating a protection order, and two counts of aggravated burglary, and was sentenced to 23 years and 6 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">{\u00b6 22} Zubaidah was in attendance throughout Harris\u2019s trial, though testimony conflicted as to Zubaidah\u2019s level of participation. Zubaidah and Harris\u2019s father testified that Zubaidah did not speak at any point during the trial. Rich testified that during the recess, Zubaidah spoke to Harris in Rich\u2019s presence and explicitly advised Harris not to accept the four-year plea deal, contrary to Rich\u2019s advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">{\u00b6 23} Both Zubaidah and Harris\u2019s father testified that Zubaidah was a friend of the family, not an attorney, and was not practicing law. They maintained that Zubaidah\u2019s letter to Judge Rothgery was a typical layperson\u2019s character reference, seeking to mitigate a defendant\u2019s punishment. Judge Rothgery testified that Zubaidah\u2019s letter exceeded the boundaries of a mere character letter when it began to assert Harris\u2019s lack of guilt based on the specific facts underlying the charges. Upon considering the character letter together with Zubaidah\u2019s letter of introduction portraying himself and STAND as representatives of Harris in his legal proceedings, Judge Rothgery believed that the letter constituted legal advocacy. As in the White case, Rich testified that despite Zubaidah\u2019s claims that he is not an attorney, Zubaidah\u2019s advice to Harris and his ex parte letter to Judge Rothgery led Rich to believe that Zubaidah was practicing law. Rich believed that the much longer prison sentence Harris received after rejecting plea offers made Zubaidah\u2019s detriment to Harris\u2019s case very clear.</p>\n<p id=\"AqoF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>The Bason Matter</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">{\u00b6 24} In 2010, Corey Bason was charged with rape and gross sexual imposition of a minor under the age of 13. Bason\u2019s mother, Dalphene Bason, signed a STAND membership agreement with Zubaidah. Judge James Miraldi presided over the case. Attorney J. Anthony Rich was appointed to represent Bason but moved to withdraw from that representation before October 2010, supposedly due to complications arising from Zubaidah\u2019s interference with the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">{\u00b6 25} In November 2010, Zubaidah sent a letter to Judge Miraldi, stating that he was \u201cpetitioning the court on behalf of\u2019 Bason and asking the judge to reduce Bason\u2019s bond. Zubaidah compared Bason\u2019s case with that of another criminal defendant in which bond had been set at a lower amount and argued that the failure to lower Bason\u2019s bond constituted a violation of Bason\u2019s due-process rights. Zubaidah accused Judge Miraldi of violating the Code of Judicial Conduct and indicated that he was sending a copy of his letter to the Ohio State Bar Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">{\u00b6 26} Both Zubaidah and Bason\u2019s mother testified that Zubaidah was a friend of the family, that he was not an attorney, and that he was not practicing law. Judge Miraldi testified that Zubaidah\u2019s letter, which provided case comparisons and legal arguments on behalf of a particular defendant, appeared to constitute the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Other Developments</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">{\u00b6 27} In December 2009, the Lorain County Bar Association sent a letter to Zubaidah, informing him that multiple attorneys had reported Zubaidah\u2019s conduct. The bar association explained that advising people in pending criminal cases constitutes the unauthorized practice of law. The letter demanded that Zubaidah immediately cease and desist from such prohibited conduct or face civil penalties up to $10,000 for each offense. Zubaidah sent a response stating that he was not an attorney and did not practice law. Zubaidah stated that he would ignore the letter unless the bar association provided the names of all attorneys who had alleged misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">{\u00b6 28} In July 2010, prior to initiating a formal action against Zubaidah, the bar association offered to negotiate a resolution with Zubaidah. Although Zubaidah agreed to meet for negotiations, no agreement was reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">{\u00b6 29} While formal proceedings were pending before the board, Zubaidah and the bar association conducted a settlement conference in April 2012 in order to negotiate a consent-to-judgment decree. Zubaidah stated on the record during the settlement hearing that he accepted the terms of the decree and that he had signed it of his own free will. However, the decree itself bore the signature \u201cKing A. Zubaidah (under duress).\u201d The bar association moved to withdraw the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>joint motion, stating that it could be reasonably inferred that the decree was not executed voluntarily, and served Zubaidah with a notice of deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">{\u00b6 30} Zubaidah refused to attend his scheduled deposition, communicating through his counsel that he wanted to assert his Fifth Amendment right not to testify due to fear of criminal prosecution. Upon the board\u2019s entry allowing withdrawal of the consent decree, the matter proceeded to a hearing, which Zubaidah attended pursuant to a subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">{\u00b6 31} At the beginning of the hearing, Zubaidah accused the panel of subjecting him to double jeopardy, and he refused to testify during the bar association\u2019s case in chief, stating that he was asserting his Fifth Amendment right not to testify. However, during Zubaidah\u2019s case in chief, he elected to waive his prior invocation of the Fifth Amendment and testified before the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">The Board\u2019s Recommendation</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">{\u00b6 32} Upon consideration of the totality of the circumstances presented in the record, the board concluded by a preponderance of the evidence that Zubaidah and STAND had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law in each of the four counts alleged in the complaint. Specifically, the board concluded that respondents engaged in the unauthorized practice of law by contracting with several criminal defendants or their families to assist the defendants in the legal process, providing legal advice to those defendants, indicating special knowledge of the law and ability to develop legal positions and strategies, indicating special knowledge of the judicial system and ability to navigate the defendants through it, sending letters to judges advocating for bond reductions or other results on behalf of the defendants, and drafting letters of advocacy to judges and attorneys that included citations of comparable cases and allegations of violations of the defendants\u2019 constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">{\u00b6 33} The board emphasized that many activities similar to portions of Zubaidah\u2019s conduct do not necessarily constitute the unauthorized practice of law. For example, challenging the judicial system as a community activist, sending a true character-reference letter to a court for purposes of a bond or sentencing decision, or providing nonlegal advice as a friend or relative to a defendant are all appropriate actions that do not individually constitute the unauthorized practice of law and should not be stifled.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">{\u00b6 34} However, the board found that Zubaidah crossed a line into the unauthorized practice of law, as shown by the formal agreements signed by the STAND members that were provided to judges and legal counsel. Given the context in which Zubaidah used these agreements, the board agreed that Zubaidah was holding himself out to his \u201cclients\u201d as having expertise on legal matters and trial strategy and holding himself out to attorneys and judges as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>having a contracted right to advocate on behalf of criminal defendants. This, in addition to evidence of Zubaidah\u2019s presentation of legal arguments and advocacy to presiding judges and the giving of legal advice to defendants, supported the conclusion that respondents\u2019 participation in each of the four defendants\u2019 cases far exceeded the bounds of acceptable layperson involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">{\u00b6 35} In light of the foregoing findings, the flagrancy of Zubaidah\u2019s conduct, the significant harm to the defendants\u2019 interests, and Zubaidah\u2019s lack of cooperation throughout the bar association\u2019s involvement, the board adopted the panel\u2019s recommendation of a civil penalty. But after consideration of Zubaidah\u2019s sincere and selfless motives in mitigation of his action, the board agreed with the panel\u2019s recommendation of a civil penalty of $5,000 for each count rather than the maximum penalty of $10,000 per count.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Respondent\u2019s Position</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">{\u00b6 36} Zubaidah objects to the board\u2019s report and recommendations regarding both himself and STAND. Because STAND is a separate corporate entity and Zubaidah is not a licensed attorney, he cannot represent STAND as a pro se advocate before this court. <em>See Union Savs. Assn. v. Home Owners Aid, Inc., </em>23 Ohio St.2d 60, 64, 262 N.E.2d 558 (1970). We therefore consider Zubaidah\u2019s arguments only as they relate to him personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">{\u00b6 37} Zubaidah\u2019s objections, for the most part, present a medley of bald assertions. He appears to address both legal issues and findings of fact, which we address in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">Legal Objections</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">{\u00b6 38} Zubaidah asserts that the board\u2019s decision is biased and discriminatory and that it raises questions regarding \u201cZubaidah\u2019s First Amendment rights of the Constitution, jurisdiction under color, subject matter, creditability, prosecutorial misconduct, ineffective assistance of counsel and HARM.\u201d Zubaidah has failed to present any arguments or legal authority to support them.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-11\">{\u00b6 39} We recognize that Zubaidah has repeatedly asserted that his conduct does not constitute the unauthorized practice of law, because he has a constitutional right to petition the court. However, he does not explain how the First Amendment right to petition the court for redress of grievances might extend to providing legal assistance to another person.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-12\">{\u00b6 40} Regardless, we have previously held that placing restrictions on a person\u2019s conduct by prohibiting the unauthorized practice of law has only an incidental relationship with free speech and does not implicate that person\u2019s First Amendment rights. <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Bailey, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 223, 2006-Ohio-4360, 852 N.E.2d 1180, \u00b6 13, citing <em>Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., </em>436 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>447, 456, 98 S.Ct. 1912, 56 L.Ed.2d 444 (1978). An incidental limitation on a First Amendment right might be justified when an important government interest is involved, <em>see Bellecourt v. Cleveland, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 439, 2004-Ohio-6551, 820 N.E.2d 309, \u00b6 6, and protecting the public against incompetence in the legal process is such a government interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">{\u00b6 41} Criminal defendants have the right to appear pro se, but when they rely on someone else\u2019s expertise, we have a duty to ensure that they are properly represented. We do so by requiring that anyone providing legal assistance must formally meet stringent standards of character and competency before being permitted to practice law in Ohio. Gov.Bar R. 1(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">{\u00b6 42} Our rules governing the unauthorized practice of law directly refute Zubaidah\u2019s claims. Gov.Bar R. VII. He does not develop any argument as to why our rules should be stricken as unconstitutional, and we find no reason to strike those rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Finding of Unauthorized Practice of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">{\u00b6 43} Zubaidah primarily maintains that the facts presented at his hearing do not support the conclusion that he has practiced law. He supports this argument by citing the testimony of attorneys Rich and Nehr that Zubaidah never claimed to be an attorney as well as the STAND members\u2019 testimony that Zubaidah was not an attorney and was not practicing law. He additionally cites testimony describing isolated portions of Zubaidah\u2019s letter on behalf of Isaiah Harris as a character reference. For the reasons articulated below, we reject Zubaidah\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">{\u00b6 44} The Ohio Constitution provides this court with original jurisdiction over the practice of law, whether authorized or unauthorized. Article IV, Section 2(B)(1)(g), Ohio Constitution; <em>Geauga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Haig, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 601, 2011-Ohio-4271, 955 N.E.2d 352, \u00b6 2. A person who is not licensed to practice law in Ohio cannot \u201c[cjommit any act that is prohibited by the supreme court as being the unauthorized practice of law.\u201d R.C. 4705.07(A)(3). The unauthorized practice of law occurs when a person who is not admitted to the Ohio bar or otherwise certified to practice law by the Supreme Court provides legal services to another person in this state. Gov.Bar R. VII(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">{\u00b6 45} An unauthorized-practice-of-law allegation not supported by an admission must be supported \u201cby other evidence of the specific act or acts upon which the allegation is based.\u201d <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. CompManagement, Inc., </em>111 Ohio St.3d 444, 2006-Ohio-6108, 857 N.E.2d 95, \u00b6 26. We will defer to the panel\u2019s determination of the credibility of testimony when \u201cthe record does not weigh heavily against the findings of the panel, as adopted by the board.\u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Robinson, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 371, 2010-Ohio-3829, 933 N.E.2d 1095, \u00b6 21. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>The panel may consider and weigh circumstantial evidence in its determination. <em>Robinson </em>at \u00b6 21 (despite respondent\u2019s claim that he did not intend to conceal documents from an opposing counsel and thus that he had not acted willfully, the court could infer a willful violation based on evidence that he removed documents from his office and did not reveal that the documents were in his possession).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">{\u00b6 46} A person \u201cwho purports to negotiate legal claims on behalf of another and advises persons of their legal rights and the terms and conditions of settlement engages in the practice of law.\u201d <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Henley, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 91, 92, 766 N.E.2d 130 (2002). The fact that the work was done for free is irrelevant. <em>Geauga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Canfield, </em>92 Ohio St.3d 15, 16, 748 N.E.2d 23 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">{\u00b6 47} Disclaimers are likewise ineffective: persons who disclose their nonattorney status are not then free to practice law without authorization. <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Telford, </em>85 Ohio St.3d 111, 113, 707 N.E.2d 462 (1999); <em>Henley </em>at 91. Even good intentions do not override the prohibition against the unauthorized practice of law. <em>See Disciplinary Counsel v. Bukstein, </em>139 Ohio St.3d 230, 2014-Ohio-1884, 11 N.E.3d 237, \u00b6 6, 21 (though the respondent assisted litigants free of charge and in the spirit of civil-rights advocacy, her provision of legal advice and presentation of legal arguments on behalf of the litigants nonetheless constituted the unauthorized practice of law). <em>See also People v. Shell, </em>148 P.3d 162, 167 (Colo.2006) (distinguishing \u201cpermissible activism\u201d from the unauthorized practice of law when a nonattorney community activist prepared legal documents and gave legal advice to specific clients).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">{\u00b6 48} Generally, a person who sends a character-reference letter to a judge on behalf of another person is not engaging in the unauthorized practice of law. Character has been defined as a \u201cgeneralized description of one\u2019s disposition as it relates to a general trait such as honesty, temperance or peacefulness.\u201d <em>State v. Reed, </em>110 Ohio App.3d 749, 753, 675 N.E.2d 77 (4th Dist.1996). In the criminal context, information about the defendant\u2019s character may assume the form of admissible evidence at trial through character testimony permitted under the Rules of Evidence and also may also serve as evidence, subject to the judge\u2019s discretion, relevant to the defendant\u2019s sentencing. <em>See </em>Evid.R. 401, 404(A)(1), 405; <em>State v. Dickerson, </em>77 Ohio St. 34, 82 N.E. 969 (1907); R.C. 2929.12. Therefore, pure character letters \u2014 those without legal arguments identifying and applying law \u2014 are evidentiary by nature and do not constitute the practice of law. However, when letters by nonattorneys cross the line from endorsing a person\u2019s character to advocating specific legal positions on behalf of that person, the unauthorized practice of law occurs. <em>See Henley </em>(holding that a nonattorney practiced law by writing letters on behalf of his \u201cclients\u201d asking for the resolution and settlement of potential discrimination claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>{\u00b6 49} To the extent that a nonparty to litigation might be permitted by a trial or appellate court to present a legal argument, he is limited to furthering his own interests as a nonparty and may not raise issues beyond those already raised by the parties. <em>See </em>App.R. 17 (requiring, in addition to consent of the parties or leave of court, that amici curiae identify and advance their own interests related to a particular case); <em>Wellington v. Mahoning Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 143, 2008-Ohio-554, 882 N.E.2d 420, \u00b6 53, quoting <em>Lakewood v. State Emp. Relations Bd., </em>66 Ohio App.3d 387, 394, 584 N.E.2d 70 (8th Dist.1990) (\u201cIn general, <em>\u2018[a]mici curiae </em>are not parties to an action and may not, therefore, interject issues and claims not raised by the parties\u2019 \u201d). And despite the laudable desire to seek reform in the criminal system, such a desire cannot be realized by legally advising and advocating on behalf of a criminal defendant without violating our prohibition against the unauthorized practice of law. <em>Bukstein </em>at \u00b6 12, 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">{\u00b6 50} Here, Zubaidah\u2019s actions extended beyond the permissible conduct of endorsing a person\u2019s character, advocating a social issue generally, advancing personal interests, or providing nonlegal advice to a family member. Despite Zubaidah\u2019s good intentions and intermittent disclaimers, his conduct shows a pattern of advocating legal positions on behalf of defendants and providing legal advice to those defendants, leading to serious consequences for the STAND clients who trusted him.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">{\u00b6 51} Zubaidah held himself out as an advocate with legal expertise to community members, legal professionals, and the judiciary. Zubaidah sought out formal representation relationships with criminal defendants\u2019 families and entered into agreements that implied to the signers that he had specialized knowledge of the legal system. Zubaidah repeatedly sent letters to attorneys and to judges on behalf of criminal defendants in pending cases that indicated that STAND would be assisting the defendant and that cited case law, raised legal issues, and asked for legal results.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">{\u00b6 52} Zubaidah also provided legal advice to the criminal defendants involved, as well as to their family members. At least one attorney heard Zubaidah directly give his client legal advice, and the remainder of the defense attorneys who testified believed from their own observations that Zubaidah had given their clients legal advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">{\u00b6 53} The board found the attorneys\u2019 testimony to be credible, and we defer to this well-supported finding. The legal stances taken by defendants under Zubaidah\u2019s counsel, which often directly contradicted the attorneys\u2019 recommendations, add strong credibility to the attorneys\u2019 belief. Zubaidah\u2019s attempt to advocate on behalf of STAND before this court greatly weakens his personal assertions that he has not practiced law at any point; it is clear that he either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>does not understand or refuses to acknowledge what does and does not constitute the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">{\u00b6 54} Zubaidah\u2019s conduct strongly invokes the purpose of restricting the practice of law to licensed attorneys: \u201cto protect the public against incompetence [and] divided loyalties * * * often associated with unskilled representation.\u201d <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. CompManagement, Inc., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 168, 2004-Ohio-6506, 818 N.E.2d 1181, \u00b6 40. The competing legal advice from Zubaidah created, or at a minimum exacerbated, a divide between the defendants and their defense attorneys: the attorney witnesses testified that Zubaidah played a significant role in eroding the client-attorney relationship, in some cases causing them to withdraw as counsel. As noted by attorney Rich, Zubaidah was able to learn information from the criminal defendants that would be considered confidential in an attorney-client relationship but that Zubaidah could be compelled to disclose by subpoena, creating the potential for \u201ccatastrophic consequences\u201d in the defendants\u2019 criminal proceedings. And Zubaidah\u2019s involvement led to actual detrimental consequences for STAND members, most strikingly illustrated by Harris receiving more than 20 additional years of imprisonment by following the legal advice of Zubaidah rather than that of his own defense attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">{\u00b6 55} Given the foregoing, we accept the board\u2019s findings that Zubaidah engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">{\u00b6 56} We accept the board\u2019s recommendation that we issue an injunction prohibiting Zubaidah and STAND from further engaging in the unauthorized practice of law. After considering the factors listed in Gov.Bar R. VII(8)(B) and UPL Reg. 400(F), which include respondent\u2019s cooperation in the investigation, the number of occasions that the unauthorized practice of law occurred and the flagrancy of the violation, the harm to third parties, and other relevant factors, we accept the board\u2019s recommendation to impose civil penalties as authorized under Gov.Bar R. VII(8)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">{\u00b6 57} (1) The degree of cooperation provided by the respondent in the investigation. Zubaidah impeded the investigation several times: he rejected a cease-and-desist letter from the Lorain County Bar Association; he appeared to agree to a consent decree but then indicated that he was signing the decree \u201cunder duress\u201d after his signature; and he refused to appear at a scheduled deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">{\u00b6 58} (2) The number of occasions that the unauthorized practice of law was committed. Zubaidah committed multiple acts constituting the unauthorized practice of law in each of the four counts charged in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>{\u00b6 59} (3) The flagrancy of the violation. Zubaidah continued with the unauthorized practice of law despite admonitions from attorneys and judges, even after receiving a formal cease-and-desist letter from the bar association. He has been persistently adamant that he has not practiced law.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">{\u00b6 60} (4) Harm to third parties arising from the offense. The consequences of the well-intentioned but unauthorized practice of law are vividly demonstrated by the difference between the proposed but rejected plea agreements and the actual sentences for some of the STAND members. The attorneys working on the cases also suffered the deterioration and termination of their relationship with their clients. As aptly indicated in the board\u2019s report, Zubaidah\u2019s actions both \u201cundermine[d] public confidence in the judicial system\u201d and caused harm \u201cirreparable in nature\u201d for each criminal defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">{\u00b6 61} (5) Any other relevant factors. Two additional aggravating factors favor a more severe penalty. First, Zubaidah had previously been ordered to cease engaging in the unauthorized practice of law: he remains under a cease-and-desist order issued by this court on April 29, 2011. <em>Lorain Cty. Bar Assn. v. Zubaidah, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 1469, 2011-Ohio-2052, 946 N.E.2d 229. Second, Zubaidah had been informed that the conduct at issue might constitute an act of unauthorized practice of law. The Lorain County Bar Association demanded as early as December 31, 2009, that respondents stop engaging in the unauthorized practice of law, but Zubaidah denied the allegations made in the bar\u2019s letter, found the demand to have \u201cno merit,\u201d and continued the same conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">{\u00b6 62} One mitigating factor points to a less severe penalty. Zubaidah\u2019s conduct resulted from a motive other than dishonesty or personal benefit. Zubaidah did not gain financially from his actions and exhibited a sincere desire both to help young men in his community and correct perceived inequalities in the legal system.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">{\u00b6 63} Viewing these factors collectively, we believe that the imposition of civil penalties furthers the purposes of Gov.Bar R. VII and that the board\u2019s recommended penalty in the amount of $5,000 for each violation, for a total of $20,000, is reasonable. We adopt that recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">{\u00b6 64} We therefore impose a civil penalty of $20,000 against Zubaidah and STAND Inc. and enjoin both respondents from engaging in the unauthorized practice of law. Zubaidah and STAND Inc. are prohibited from advising any individual involved in a pending legal matter regarding the law or trial strategies, contacting judges presiding over pending legal matters and advocating on behalf of others, and engaging in any other activities that would constitute the unauthorized practice of law. Costs and expenses are taxed to respondents Zubaidah and STAND Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>D.
