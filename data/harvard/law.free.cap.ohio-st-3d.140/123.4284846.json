Judge Oldfield has served on the Akron Municipal Court since January 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-14\">{\u00b6 2} On April 26, 2013, relator, disciplinary counsel, filed a one-count complaint charging Judge Oldfield with violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct and the Rules of Professional Conduct. Judge Oldfield answered, denying that she had committed any violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-15\">{\u00b6 3} The complaint centers on Judge Oldfield\u2019s conduct from February 5 to February 17, 2012, and alleges that during that time, she violated Jud.Cond.R. 1.2 (\u201cA judge shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary, and shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety\u201d), 1.3 (\u201cA judge shall not abuse the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>prestige of judicial office to advance the personal or economic interests of the judge or others, or allow others to do so\u201d), and 2.11(A) (\u201cA judge shall disqualify himself or herself in any proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned * * * \u201d). Relator also alleges that Judge Oldfield engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">{\u00b6 4} On August 26, 2013, a panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline conducted a hearing. Based upon the testimony of Judge Oldfield and other witnesses, the parties\u2019 factual stipulations, and exhibits, the panel unanimously recommended dismissal of the Jud.Cond.R. 1.3 allegation, finding that the violation had not been proved by clear and convincing evidence. The panel found that relator had proved by clear and convincing evidence that Judge Oldfield committed the other charged violations and recommended a public reprimand. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law, including the recommended dismissal of the Jud.Cond.R. 1.3 violation, and recommended sanction. Neither party filed objections to the recommended sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">{\u00b6 5} However, relator objects to the board\u2019s recommendation to dismiss the allegation of a Jud.Cond.R. 1.3 violation. He argues that the board improperly applied a subjective test to determine that he had not proved by clear and convincing evidence that Judge Oldfield abused the prestige of her office. Relator asserts that regardless of Judge Oldfield\u2019s actual motives, a reasonable person would believe that Judge Oldfield did in fact abuse the prestige of her office to advance her own interests or the interests of another. We agree with relator that Jud.Cond.R. 1.3 imposes an objective standard, but as we will explain, we do not agree that the board applied a different standard. We therefore overrule relator\u2019s objections and adopt the board\u2019s findings of fact and misconduct and recommended sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">{\u00b6 6} The following facts are supported by the record. On Saturday, February 4, 2012, Judge Oldfield and her husband attended a social engagement that lasted into Sunday. Catherine Loya, the public defender assigned to Judge Oldfield\u2019s courtroom, also attended. Judge Oldfield\u2019s husband left around midnight, and Loya agreed, at the husband\u2019s request, to drive Judge Oldfield home later. Sometime after 1:00 a.m. on Sunday, Judge Oldfield and Loya left the party and stopped in a shopping-center parking lot, where they remained in the car, smoking and talking.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">{\u00b6 7} Fifteen to 30 minutes later, Copley police officer Tom Ballinger noticed Loya\u2019s car and investigated. He requested identification from Judge Oldfield and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Loya. They provided it, and shortly thereafter, two other police officers, including Copley Township police officer Brian W. Price, arrived in separate cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">{\u00b6 8} Smelling alcohol, Ballinger asked Loya to perform field sobriety tests. When she refused, Ballinger arrested her for having physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. During exchanges with the police at the time of the arrest, Judge Oldfield remarked that she was a judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">{\u00b6 9} Loya was placed in the cruiser to be taken to the police station. At Judge Oldfield\u2019s request, Price drove her to the station to be with Loya. During that trip, Judge Oldfield told the officer that she was not asking for special treatment because she was a judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">{\u00b6 10} Because Loya refused to perform the field sobriety tests or take a breath-alcohol test, her driving privileges were immediately suspended. After Loya was booked, a Copley police officer drove Loya and Judge Oldfield to the judge\u2019s house, where Loya spent the next three nights until her driving privileges were restored,, apparently at her arraignment. During those three days, Judge Oldfield drove Loya to and from work. Judge Oldfield did not disqualify herself from cases in which Loya represented clients in her courtroom. After obtaining the permission of the municipal prosecutor and public defender, Judge Oldfield presided over 53 such cases until February 17, when Loya\u2019s supervisor rotated Loya out of Judge Oldfield\u2019s courtroom to avoid adverse publicity. In September 2012, a jury found Loya guilty of the physical-control violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Alleged Violations</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">{\u00b6 11} Jud.Cond.R. 1.3 provides, \u201cA judge shall not abuse the prestige of judicial office to advance the personal or economic interests of the judge or others, or allow others to do so.\u201d Comment [1] to Jud.Cond.R. 1.3 explains that it is improper for a judge to use or attempt to use his or her position \u201cto gain personal advantage or deferential treatment of any kind. For example, it would be improper for a judge to allude to his or her judicial status to gain favorable treatment in encounters with traffic officials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">{\u00b6 12} We agree with the panel and board that relator did not prove a Jud.Cond.R. 1.3 violation by clear and convincing evidence. Testimony was contradictory. Ballinger testified that as Loya was being handcuffed, Judge Oldfield said, \u201cOh, don\u2019t do that. I\u2019m the one that\u2019s been drinking. Will it help if I tell you I\u2019m a judge?\u201d Judge Oldfield remembers the incident differently. According to the judge, she told the officers that she was the one who had been drinking. One of the officers then asked her why Loya would not take the field sobriety tests if she had not been drinking, and Judge Oldfield responded, \u201cWell, those tests aren\u2019t always reliable.\u201d The officer then asked, \u201cWhat are you, some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>kind of lawyer?\u201d Judge Oldfield said that she responded honestly, \u201cYeah, actually, I\u2019ve been an attorney for some time and now I\u2019m a judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">{\u00b6 13} Relator objects to the board\u2019s recommendation to dismiss the allegation of a Jud.Cond.R. 1.3 violation. According to relator, divulging her status as a judge was gratuitous, and Judge Oldfield did so to discourage Loya\u2019s arrest. He asserts that \u201c[sjimply disclosing one\u2019s status as a judge in certain situations violates the rule.\u201d Relator states that viewed objectively, Judge Oldfield\u2019s statements \u201cabuse[d] the prestige of judicial office to advance the personal * * * interests of the judge or others.\u201d Jud.Cond.R. 1.3. He argues that by relying on Officer Price\u2019s statement that he did not believe that the judge was seeking special treatment, the board improperly applied a subjective test to determine that relator had not proved by clear and convincing evidence that Judge Oldfield abused the prestige of her office. Relator asserts that regardless of Judge Oldfield\u2019s actual motives, a reasonable person would believe that Judge Oldfield did in fact abuse the prestige of her office to advance her own interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">{\u00b6 14} Our review of the record supports the findings of the panel and the board. The panel report did refer to Officer Price\u2019s remark that he never thought that she was trying to use her position to advance her interests. But the panel did not single out Price\u2019s belief as the sole basis for its conclusion that relator failed to prove a violation of the rule. The panel discussed the testimony, the stipulations, and the incident report, including claims by two other officers that the judge requested special treatment. The panel pointed out that no other witness on the scene corroborated Ballinger\u2019s statement that Judge Oldfield had ever said, \u201cWill it help if I tell you I\u2019m a judge?\u201d The panel further noted that other statements by the judge allegedly seeking to gain advantage from her position were made to an officer who did not testify, and the panel concluded that since the judge herself denied making the statements and no other witness testified to hearing them, the evidence did not establish that the statements were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">{\u00b6 15} Therefore, the panel concluded that the evidence was contradictory and that the record, taken as a whole, did not produce \u201ca firm conviction\u201d that Judge Oldfield used her judicial title to influence the officers to accord her or Loya special treatment or that her conduct gave the appearance that she was using her title for that purpose. We find that the panel reviewed the record using an objective standard to determine whether Judge Oldfield\u2019s conduct created an appearance of impropriety, i.e., whether her behavior would create, in reasonable minds, a perception that she was improperly using her position to gain favor. We therefore overrule relator\u2019s objections and adopt the recommendation of the board to dismiss Jud.Cond.R. 1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>{\u00b6 16} We also agree with the panel and board that Judge Oldfield\u2019s conduct violated Jud.Cond.R. 1.2 and 2.11 and Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(d). Because Loya was temporarily living with Judge Oldfield and because the judge was a potential witness in Loya\u2019s criminal prosecution, Judge Oldfield should have recused herself from cases in which Loya was representing clients. Under the circumstances, her \u201cimpartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d Jud.Cond.R. 2.11(A). By creating this appearance of impropriety, Judge Oldfield failed to promote public confidence in the judiciary as required by Jud.Cond.R. 1.2. This violation is of all the more concern because the association with Loya occurred in the context of Loya\u2019s arrest. \u201cThe sight or thought of a judge providing a ride home to a person who has just been detained for breaking the law surely gives the impression of bias on the judge\u2019s part when it comes time to hear that case.\u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Medley, </em>93 Ohio St.3d 474, 476-477, 756 N.E.2d 104 (2001). This impression of bias arises whether the law-breaking associate appears in the judge\u2019s courtroom as a defendant or as a lawyer. We also find that these violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct comprise a violation of Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">{\u00b6 17} In determining the appropriate sanction for judicial misconduct, we consider the ethical duties violated, the injury caused, the existence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances listed in BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B), and our precedent. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Campbell, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 150, 2010-Ohio-3265, 931 N.E.2d 558, \u00b6 53, citing <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Sargeant, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 322, 2008-Ohio-2330, 889 N.E.2d 96, \u00b6 28, and <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Evans, </em>89 Ohio St.3d 497, 501, 733 N.E.2d 609 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\n<em>1. Duties violated and injuries caused</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cIt is of utmost importance that the public have confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.\u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Allen, </em>79 Ohio St.3d 494, 495, 684 N.E.2d 31 (1997). Jud.Cond.R. 1.2 requires a judge to promote public confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary and to avoid even the appearance of impropriety. In furtherance of this requirement, Jud.Cond.R. 2.11 commands that a judge disqualify herself from a case in which she has a personal bias or prejudice \u201cconcerning a party or a party\u2019s lawyer,\u201d Jud.Cond.R. 2.11(A)(1), and also from \u201cany proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned,\u201d Jud.Cond.R. 2.11(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">{\u00b6 19} Here, the board properly found that Judge Oldfield\u2019s impartiality from February 6, 2012, to February 17, 2012, when Loya was assigned to a different courtroom, could have reasonably been questioned. The board observed that her failure to recuse herself created the appearance of impropriety because she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>argued against Loya\u2019s arrest at the scene, because she took Loya into her home for three days and transported her to and from work in her own courtroom, and because she was a potential witness in Loya\u2019s criminal case, among other reasons. These facts also support the board\u2019s conclusion that Judge Oldfield violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\n<em>2. Aggravating and mitigating factors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">{\u00b6 20} The board found one aggravating factor: that Judge Oldfield had engaged in a pattern of misconduct by failing to disqualify herself in 53 cases in which Loya represented defendants in her courtroom right after Loya\u2019s arrest. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(c). <em>Ohio State Bar Assn. v. Evans, </em>137 Ohio St.3d 441, 2013-Ohio-4992, 999 N.E.2d 674, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">{\u00b6 21} In mitigation, the board found (1) an absence of a prior disciplinary record, (2) full and free disclosure to the disciplinary board and a cooperative attitude toward the proceedings, and (3) good character and reputation. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a), (d), and (e). As to the third factor, the parties jointly submitted scores of letters from Judge Oldfield\u2019s colleagues and associates attesting to her commitment to the community, her work ethic, and her professional excellence. The board also noted that no litigants had been harmed by Judge Oldfield\u2019s misconduct and that Judge Oldfield presided over no contested cases in which Loya represented defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\n<em>3. Applicable precedent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">{\u00b6 22} We have imposed public reprimands in other cases in which a judge violated the Code of Judicial Conduct requiring a judge to promote public confidence in the judiciary and act impartially. <em>See Medley, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 477-478, 756 N.E.2d 104; <em>Ohio State Bar Assn. v. Goldie, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 201, 2005-Ohio-6186, 837 N.E.2d 782; <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Kubilus, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 29, 2003-Ohio-6610, 800 N.E.2d 1131. While we have further found that Judge Oldfield engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, we also note that as in <em>Medley, </em>the judge submitted substantial mitigating evidence. Based on Judge Oldfield\u2019s conduct, the single aggravating factor, substantial mitigation, and our precedent, we agree with the board that a public reprimand is the appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">{\u00b6 23} Therefore, we publicly reprimand Judge Joy Malek Oldfield for her violations of Jud.Cond.R. 1.2 and 2.11 and Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(d). Costs are taxed to Judge Oldfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"A1J\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Lanzinger, J., dissent in part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b293-5\">O\u2019Connor, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ac7\">dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">{\u00b6 24} I concur with the majority\u2019s decision adopting the recommendation of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline that we find a violation of Jud.Cond.R. 1.2 and 2.11 and Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I also concur that public reprimand is a sufficient sanction. I dissent, however, from the majority\u2019s decision to adopt the board\u2019s recommendation to dismiss the allegation that Judge Oldfield violated Jud.Cond.R. 1.3. Because the majority\u2019s decision is based on a skewed view of the evidence in the record, I would sustain the relator\u2019s objection to the board\u2019s recommendation and find a violation of Jud.Cond.R. 1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">{\u00b6 25} In upholding the board\u2019s conclusion to dismiss the violation of Jud. Cond.R. 1.3, the majority ignores Judge Oldfield\u2019s own testimony and places undue weight on a testifying officer\u2019s subjective belief about the judge\u2019s statements. I find no support for the majority\u2019s acceptance of the board\u2019s determination that the evidence in the record was contradictory or insufficient as a whole to sustain a violation of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">{\u00b6 26} There is no dispute, and the parties stipulated, that Judge Oldfield identified herself as a judge at least twice during the incident. First, \u201cduring discussions with police officers, respondent indicated that she was a judge.\u201d Second, \u201c[o]n route to the Copley police station, respondent communicated that she was not asking for special treatment because she was a judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">{\u00b6 27} Importantly, Judge Oldfield\u2019s first mention of her status as a judge to the officers was gratuitous and,.contrary to the majority\u2019s characterization, more than a mere \u201cremark[ ].\u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 8. During the arrest, Officer Garner asked a \u201cyes or no\u201d question \u2014 whether Judge Oldfield was a lawyer. Judge Oldfield testified that she responded, \u201cYeah, actually, I\u2019ve been an attorney for some time and now I\u2019m a judge.\u201d Judge Oldfield acknowledged that she could have responded truthfully in a number of alternative ways, including by offering simply that she was licensed to practice law. The specific mention of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>judgeship in response was not solicited or required, nor should it have been offered. Indeed, it served only one purpose: to make sure that the officer knew that she was a judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">{\u00b6 28} Judge Oldfield\u2019s gratuitous disclosure is sufficient alone in the context here to establish that a reasonable person would believe that Judge Oldfield abused the prestige of her office to advance her own and Loya\u2019s interests in violation of Jud.Cond.R. 1.3. But Judge Oldfield\u2019s references to her judgeship did not stop there, and additional facts glossed over by the majority further support the conclusion that the rule was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">{\u00b6 29} Once Judge Oldfield mentioned her judgeship, she continued to insert herself into Loya\u2019s arrest and booking. Even though the officers offered to take Judge Oldfield home after the arrest, she requested to go to the police station and wait for Loya. Both Officer Price and Judge Oldfield testified that on the way back to the station, Judge Oldfield asked what could be done to help Loya. Both Officer Price and Judge Oldfield testified that once at the station, the judge again asked whether she could do anything to help Loya, and the judge testified that she requested and received permission to make a phone call to Loya. Thus, the officers were presented with someone who repeatedly identified herself as a judge and repeatedly asked them what could be done to help the judge\u2019s friend who had been charged with a criminal violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">{\u00b6 30} The majority found persuasive the board\u2019s concern about the lack of corroboration for the officers\u2019 testimony. But it is unclear what corroboration could exist. For example, Officer Price testified about statements made by Judge Oldfield to him with no one else present. No corroborating evidence, other than from Judge Oldfield, could exist. And some of Judge Oldfield\u2019s own testimony did corroborate significant details in Officer Price\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">{\u00b6 31} Even without corroboration, credibility can be assessed by the measure of one\u2019s motivation for honesty. Here, there is no showing that the officers would be motivated to lie. If anything, it would seem that officers who serve municipalities near the court on which Judge Oldfield sits would be more likely to be particularly truthful about the events that occurred. Therefore, I find the officers\u2019 testimony regarding Judge Oldfield\u2019s repeated statements credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">{\u00b6 32} The weight of this evidence should be sufficient under an objective standard to find a violation of Jud.Cond.R. 1.3. Seemingly to the exclusion of this testimony, however, the board afforded significant weight to Officer Price\u2019s subjective belief that he never thought that Judge Oldfield was using her position to advance her interests. I find that the evidence does not support the majority\u2019s conclusion that the board reviewed the record using an objective standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">{\u00b6 33} Instead, I find that the evidence as a whole establishes that a reasonable person would believe that Judge Oldfield abused the prestige of her office to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>advance her and Loya\u2019s interests. Therefore, I would sustain relator\u2019s objection to the board\u2019s dismissal of the Jud.Cond.R. 1.3 allegation and would find that Judge Oldfield violated the rule.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A9Q\">Scott J. Drexel, Disciplinary Counsel, and Joseph M. Caligiuri, Chief Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Ab\">Montgomery, Rennie &amp; Jonson, George D. Jonson, and Lisa M. Zaring, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">{\u00b6 34} Because I do not believe that finding a violation of Jud.Cond.R. 1.3 requires a harsher sanction, I agree with the majority\u2019s decision to impose a sanction of public reprimand. But because the majority\u2019s decision to adopt the dismissal of the Jud.Cond.R. 1.3 allegation is not supported by the record, I must dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b295-6\">Lanzinger, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b293-10\">. The majority cites the troubling fact that, after the incident, Judge Oldfield continued to preside over 53 cases in which Loya represented clients in her courtroom. According to the majority, this occurred after Judge Oldfield obtained \u201cpermission of the municipal prosecutor and public defender.\u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 10. Nothing in the Code of Judicial Conduct, expressly or implicitly, permits such an approach. Although the majority upheld the imposition of a Jud.Cond.R. 2.11 violation and concluded that Judge Oldfield should have recused herself from these cases, I address this here to discourage the future use of the majority\u2019s language as tacit approval of Judge Oldfield\u2019s approach.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
