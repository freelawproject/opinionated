Mills has filed an affidavit with the clerk of this court under R.C. 2701.03 seeking to disqualify Judge James F. Stevenson from presiding over any further proceedings in case No. 13CR000339, pending for trial in the Court of Common Pleas of Shelby County. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b704-15\">{\u00b6 2} Mills claims that he will not receive a fair trial before Judge Stevenson because in 2006, the judge \u2014 while serving as the county prosecuting attorney\u2014 prosecuted Mills in a rape ease. Mills claims that the allegations against him in the underlying abduction case are \u201csomewhat similar\u201d to the allegations in the 2006 rape ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-16\">{\u00b6 3} Judge Stevenson has responded in writing to Mills\u2019s affidavit, averring that he has no bias or prejudice against Mills. Judge Stevenson acknowledges that he worked in the county prosecutor\u2019s office for 25 years, but he further states that he has no independent recollection of Mills or the facts of his 2006 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>{\u00b6 4} For the following reasons, no basis has been established to order the disqualification of Judge Stevenson.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">{\u00b6 5} The Code of Judicial Conduct requires a judge who formerly served as a government lawyer to disqualify himself or herself from any \u201cparticular matter\u201d in which he or she personally and substantially participated as a government attorney. Jud.Cond.R. 2.11(A)(7)(b). \u201cAccordingly, a judge is not automatically disqualified from a criminal case when he or she prosecuted a defendant in an earlier, <em>unrelated </em>proceeding.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>In re Disqualification of Batchelor, </em>136 Ohio St.3d 1211, 2013-Ohio-2626, 991 N.E.2d 242, \u00b6 5; <em>see also id. </em>at \u00b6 9 (\u201cAbsent some showing of prejudgment, bias, or an appearance of bias, it will not be assumed that a trial judge is unable to provide a fair trial based solely on prior prosecutorial participation in an unrelated case\u201d), and <em>In re Disqualification of Hedric, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 1227, 2009-Ohio-7208, 937 N.E.2d 1016, \u00b6 6 (\u201cBecause [the judge] was not involved as a prosecuting attorney in the underlying action, [Jud.Cond.R. 2.11(A)(7)] does not compel his disqualification\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">{\u00b6 6} Here, Mills claims only that the facts in the underlying abduction case are \u201csomewhat similar\u201d to the facts in his 2006 rape case. But in affidavit-of-disqualification proceedings, the burden falls on the affiant to submit \u201cspecific\u201d allegations of bias or prejudice. <em>See </em>R.C. 2701.03(B)(1). Accordingly, in this case, Mills had the burden to demonstrate how the underlying case was the same \u201cparticular matter\u201d as the 2006 case or to specifically explain how the two cases are related so that Judge Stevenson\u2019s disqualification is warranted. Mills\u2019s vague assertion that the two cases are \u201csomewhat similar\u201d is insufficient. <em>See, e.g., In re Disqualification of Walker, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 606, 522 N.E.2d 460 (1988) (\u201cvague, unsubstantiated allegations of the affidavit are insufficient on their face for a finding of bias or prejudice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe statutory right to seek disqualification of a judge is an extraordinary remedy. * * * A judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5. Those presumptions have not been overcome in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">{\u00b6 8} For the reasons stated above, the affidavit of disqualification is denied. The case may proceed before Judge Stevenson.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
