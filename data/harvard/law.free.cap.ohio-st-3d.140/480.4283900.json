We agree. Consequently, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals, and we issue a writ of mandamus ordering the bureau to vacate its order transferring the entire experience rating of the former owner to the new owner and to issue a new order that determines the experience rating based only on the portion of the business that was transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">{\u00b6 3} Cleveland AFL, L.L.C. (\u201cthe former owner\u201d), was an arena football team owned by Jim Ferraro that was part of the Arena Football League. In 2009, the Arena Football League suspended operations and eventually filed bankruptcy proceedings. An investor group known as Arena Football One bought the assets of the defunct league and formed a new league.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">{\u00b6 4} Jim Ferraro then formed Cleveland Professional Football, L.L.C. (\u201cthe new owner\u201d), which is affiliated with the new league. According to Ferraro, his new company is different from the old one; in particular, the new owner does not employ the Gladiators\u2019 players and coaches. The players and coaches are now employed by the new league.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">{\u00b6 5} The new owner applied for workers\u2019 compensation coverage. On May 21, 2010, the bureau notified the new owner that the bureau had determined that it was a successor employer for workers\u2019 compensation purposes and that it was responsible for the financial rights and obligations of the old owner. The bureau stated that it would base the new owner\u2019s premium rate on the experience of the former owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">{\u00b6 6} On July 12, 2010, the new owner filed a protest and requested that the bureau hold a hearing to determine whether it was a successor to the former owner for experience-rating purposes. Following a hearing on October 6, 2010, an adjudicating committee of the bureau issued an order denying the protest. The committee made the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-11\">Based on the testimony at the hearing and the materials submitted with the protest, the Adjudication Committee DENIES the employer\u2019s protest to the transfer/combination. The Committee finds that the claims against Cleveland AFL LCC were originally allowed against a [professional em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>ployer organization (\u201cPEO\u201d)] and would have remained so but for the fact that the PEO went out of business. Under Ohio Administrative Code 4123-17-15 those claims were then transferred to the PEO<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> client-employer, Cleveland AFL LCC. The new employer, Cleveland Professional Football League, also uses a PEO to cover its players for purposes of workers compensation. Thus, the business model used by the old and new companies is the same. Both companies share the same franchise name, logo, method of covering players and ownership. BWC correctly transferred and/or combined the predecessor\u2019s experience and/or rights and/or obligations to the subsequent Employer under the Code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">{\u00b6 7} The new owner appealed. On February 23, 2011, the administrator\u2019s designee issued a final order that affirmed the decision of the adjudicating committee with one correction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">Based on the testimony and other evidence presented at the hearing, the Administrator\u2019s Designee affirms the Adjudicating Committee\u2019s findings, decision, and rationale set forth in the order. However, it is noted that, contrary to what is stated in the Adjudicating Committee order, the \u201cplayers\u201d are not covered by a PEO under contract with the successor employer. It is only the front office staff that is covered by the PEO agreements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">{\u00b6 8} The new owner filed a complaint for a writ of mandamus alleging that the bureau had abused its discretion by finding that it was a successor to the former owner for workers\u2019 compensation purposes and by failing to adequately explain its decision in writing. The court referred the matter to a magistrate who determined that the evidence supported the bureau\u2019s conclusion that the new owner was a successor employer. 2012-Ohio-6020, 2012 WL 6647026, \u00b6 64. However, the magistrate decided that the bureau abused its discretion when it transferred the entire experience of the former owner. <em>Id. </em>The magistrate recommended that the court issue a writ of mandamus ordering the bureau to vacate its previous order and issue a new order that expressly sets forth what portion of the former owner\u2019s experience is being charged to the new owner and clearly explains its decision concerning the new owner\u2019s obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>{\u00b6 9} The bureau filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">{\u00b6 10} The court of appeals concluded, over the bureau\u2019s objection, that the evidence supported the magistrate\u2019s finding that the bureau had determined that the new owner was the successor to the former owner. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 4. The appellate court also agreed with the magistrate\u2019s analysis that if only a portion of the former owner\u2019s business was transferred to the new owner, then pursuant to Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-02(B)(3), the experience rating is transferred in proportion to the business that was transferred. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 6. The court granted the new owner\u2019s request for a writ and directed the bureau to issue a new order determining the experience rating based only on the portion of the former owner\u2019s business that was transferred to the new owner. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">{\u00b6 11} This matter is before the court on the bureau\u2019s appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">\n<em>Legal Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">{\u00b6 12} The issue before us is whether the evidence supports the bureau\u2019s decision to transfer the entire experience rating of the former owner or whether only a portion of it should be transferred for purposes of determining the premium rate assigned to the new owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">{\u00b6 13} The bureau uses the concept of \u201cexperience rating\u201d to determine the premium rates of an employer. <em>State ex rel. K &amp; D Group, Inc. v. Buehrer, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 257, 2013-Ohio-734, 985 N.E.2d 1270, \u00b6 9. \u201cIn experience rating, the employer\u2019s past claims history, or experience, is consulted to compute a rate that produces premiums sufficient to pay future claims.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Crosset Co., Inc. v. Conrad, </em>87 Ohio St.3d 467, 473, 721 N.E.2d 986 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">{\u00b6 14} As it was required to do under R.C. 4123.32, the bureau established rules concerning premium \u201crates to be applied where one employer takes over the occupation or industry of another * * *, and the administrator may require that if any employer transfers a business in whole or in part * * *, the successor in interest shall assume, in proportion to the extent of the transfer, * * * the employer\u2019s account.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-02(B) permits the bureau to transfer the experience rating from a predecessor employer to a successor employer when there has been a transfer of business either in whole or in part. There is no dispute that the evidence supported the finding that the new owner was a successor to the former owner. Instead, the crux of this appeal is whether the former owner transferred its business in whole or in part to the new owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">{\u00b6 15} The bureau maintains that the former owner had assigned the risk experience of its football players to a PEO, while the new owner\u2019s football players are employees of the new league; thus, neither entity had or would have any risk experience for its football players. The bureau contends that the court should defer to the bureau\u2019s expertise on the transfer of risk experience and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>because the risk of both teams was equivalent, the bureau\u2019s transfer of the entire experience rating was proper.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ac\">Kelley &amp; Ferraro, L.L.P., and Shawn M. Acton, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AiC\">Michael DeWine, Attorney General, and John Smart, Assistant Attorney General, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">{\u00b6 16} On the other hand, the new owner argues that the former owner had employed the coaches and players and had paid into the state fund for workers\u2019 compensation coverage for those employees while the new owner\u2019s coaches and players are employed by and covered by the new league.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The new owner submitted a letter to the bureau dated October 12, 2010, after the hearing before the adjudicating committee, in which it disputed the bureau\u2019s allegation that the former owner had entered into an agreement with a PEO named Pay Source. The new owner submitted invoices from Pay Source demonstrating that Pay Source had merely processed payroll for the nonplayer employees of the former owner. The new owner maintains that the bureau\u2019s orders are not supported by the facts and are devoid of any serious analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">{\u00b6 17} The appellate court correctly determined that the bureau did not appear to have considered the arguments or evidence regarding whether the football players and coaches associated with the former owner were employed by a PEO and whether the players and coaches associated with the new owner were employed by the new league. We agree that the bureau\u2019s failure to address the evidence that the former owner employed the players and the new owner did not and to adequately explain its decision to transfer the entire experience rating to the new owner was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">{\u00b6 18} Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b648-9\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b648-10\">French, J., not participating.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-8\">. A PEO is an entity that enters into an agreement with a client employer to coemploy part of the client\u2019s workforce for workers\u2019 compensation purposes. As such, the PEO must maintain workers\u2019 compensation coverage, pay all workers\u2019 compensation premiums, and manage all claims, filings, and related procedures associated with a shared employee in compliance with R.C. Chapters 4121 and 4123. R.C. 4125.01(D); Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-15(0(1) and (D)(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b648-13\">. The new owner provided evidence of a workers\u2019 compensation claim filed by a football player in 2010 in which the bureau determined that the employer was the new league, not the new owner.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
