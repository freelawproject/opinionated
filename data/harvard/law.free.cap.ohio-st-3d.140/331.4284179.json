McClelland and Magistrate Kevin C. Augustyn, from exercising jurisdiction over a lawsuit filed against a client that Wood represents. The Eighth District Court of Appeals denied the writ on the grounds that Wood lacked standing to file suit. We affirm. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">{\u00b6 2} Wood filed an original action for a writ of prohibition in the Eighth District Court of Appeals. He alleged that Judge McClelland was the assigned judge on Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas case No. CV-11-746293, a foreclosure action filed against defendant Lynda Hicks. In an attached affidavit, Wood identified himself as counsel to Hicks in the foreclosure case.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">{\u00b6 3} The petition alleged that the plaintiff in the foreclosure action did not have physical possession of the promissory note executed by Hicks. Wood concluded that \u201cCo-Relators [sic] are therefore patently and unambiguously without jurisdiction to consider the allegations of Count One of the Complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">{\u00b6 4} The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. On September 6, 2013, the court of appeals granted summary judgment in favor of Judge McClelland and Magistrate Augustyn for two reasons: because Wood lacked standing and because he could not prevail on the merits even if he did have standing. 2013-Ohio-3922, 2013 WL 5010901, \u00b6 8, 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">{\u00b6 5} Wood timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">\n<em>Legal analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b496-13\">{\u00b6 6} A party lacks standing to invoke the jurisdiction of a court unless he or she has a real interest in the subject matter of the litigation \u201c \u2018in an individual or representative capacity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fed. Home Loan Mtge. Corp. v. Schwartzwald, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 13, 2012-Ohio-5017, 979 N.E.2d 1214, \u00b6 22, quoting <em>State ex rel. Dallman v. Franklin Cty. Court of Common Pleas, </em>35 Ohio St.2d 176, 179, 298 N.E.2d 515 (1973). Wood does not allege any personal stake in the dispute between his client, Lynda Hicks, and the holder of the note. His contention is that as Hicks\u2019s attorney, he is acting in a \u201crepresentative capacity\u201d and therefore has standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-14\">{\u00b6 7} We have had little occasion to define what constitutes a \u201crepresentative capacity\u201d for standing purposes. In <em>State ex rel. Bobbin v. Bush, </em>40 Ohio St.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>236, 533 N.E.2d 301 (1988), we held that a guardian ad litem had standing in a \u201crepresentative capacity\u201d to file suit on behalf of a ward, based on R.C. 2111.14(A)(5), which expressly vests a guardian of the estate of a ward with the duty to bring suit to protect the ward\u2019s best interests. By contrast, the superintendent of a correctional facility has no authority, statutory or otherwise, to act as the legal representative for the inmates under his care and custody. <em>Dallman </em>at 179, 298 N.E.2d 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">{\u00b6 8} These holdings suggest that a representative must have a real interest in the subject matter of the litigation. <em>See, e.g., Boulger v. Evans, </em>54 Ohio St.2d 371, 375, 377 N.E.2d 753 (1978) (noting the general principle that a fiduciary cannot appeal a judgment that does not affect him in his representative capacity).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">{\u00b6 9} In his merit brief, Wood cites Civ.R. 17(A) for the proposition that a representative may, at times, be a real party in interest. To the extent that Wood is suggesting that Civ.R. 17(A) <em>creates </em>standing, we rejected this claim in <em>Schwartzwald, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 13, 2012-Ohio-5017, 979 N.E.2d 1214, \u00b6 33 (\u201cCiv.R. 17(A) does not address standing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">{\u00b6 10} In short, we agree with the numerous courts that have held that lawyers do not have standing to bring claims in their own names based on violations of their clients\u2019 rights. <em>See, e.g., State ex rel. Felson v. McHenry, </em>146 Ohio App.3d 542, 546, 767 N.E.2d 298 (1st Dist.2001); <em>State ex rel. Brady v. Russo, </em>8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 89552, 2007-Ohio-3277, 2007 WL 1848720, \u00b6 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">{\u00b6 11} Alternatively, Wood argues that the lower court violated Civ.R. 17(A) by not allowing him reasonable time in which to substitute the real party in interest as plaintiff. Here again, his argument is contrary to <em>Schwartzwald, </em>which held that if standing is lacking at the outset, the defect cannot be cured by a Civ.R. 17(A) substitution of parties. <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">{\u00b6 12} The court of appeals also denied the petition because it rejected Wood\u2019s substantive argument on the merits. Wood argued that the foreclosure action against his client was filed by a plaintiff who lacked standing and was not the real party in interest. He sought a writ of prohibition on the theory that lack of standing was a jurisdictional defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">{\u00b6 13} Because we hold that Wood lacked standing to bring this case, we conclude that it was error for the court of appeals to decide the underlying legal issue, and we decline to address the topic. <em>State v. Chappell, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 376, 2010-Ohio-5991, 939 N.E.2d 1234, \u00b6 1, fn. 1 (reaffirming our \u201cduty not to issue advisory opinions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">{\u00b6 14} Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b497-12\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AL2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>John Wood, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AyA\">Timothy McGinty, Cuyahoga County Prosecuting Attorney, and Nora E.
