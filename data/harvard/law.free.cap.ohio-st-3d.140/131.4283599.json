Osie, stabbed David Williams to death in Williams\u2019s house in Liberty Township, Butler County. Osie was tried by a three-judge panel, which found him guilty of aggravated murder with three death specifications and sentenced him to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-16\">{\u00b6 2} David Williams was a partner in a business venture called United Contractors Unlimited (\u201cUCU\u201d), which began in August 2008. Williams had provided $10,000 in seed money to get the business started and also served as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>business mentor, providing his partners with advice on running a business. The other partners performed various jobs in the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">{\u00b6 3} Williams\u2019s partners in UCU included Robin Patterson and Nicholas Wiskur. Patterson was the office manager. Gregory Osie was Patterson\u2019s boyfriend. Osie was not a partner in UCU but had been employed on one occasion to do a job for UCU. He was also hired occasionally to do \u201codds and ends type jobs\u201d for David Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">{\u00b6 4} By February 2009, according to Nicholas Wiskur, UCU had nearly reached \u201cthe point of being defunct.\u201d Wiskur testified that the partners held a financial meeting approximately every four weeks to go over profit-and-loss statements. At these meetings, the partners would \u201cgo over checks\u201d; therefore, Wiskur knew that questions had been raised about certain checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">{\u00b6 5} Wiskur decided to investigate one specific check: a check for $375, made out to and endorsed by Greg Osie, ostensibly signed by Robin Patterson, and dated December 26, 2008. This check had been cashed at a Marathon gas station. Because the account on which it was drawn had been closed, the check bounced. Based on his familiarity with Patterson\u2019s signature, Wiskur concluded that the check was \u201cobviously forged.\u201d He called the Marathon station and discussed the matter with the owner. Wiskur subsequently discussed the matter with Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">The Events of February 13-14, 2009</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">{\u00b6 6} On February 13, 2009, between approximately 8:30 and 9:00 a.m., Wiskur went to Williams\u2019s house. Williams was not home, so Wiskur phoned him, then decided to await Williams\u2019s return.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">{\u00b6 7} Before Williams arrived, Osie phoned Wiskur. Osie claimed that he didn\u2019t know anything about the forged check. Wiskur informed Osie that the owner of the gas station had \u201cunequivocally\u201d identified Osie as the person who had cashed the check and that Osie\u2019s act had been captured on videotape. Osie continued to deny that he had cashed the check. Wiskur told him: \u201cIt\u2019s all going to come out, * * * if you did it or not. I guess * * * we\u2019ll find out, and at that time, we\u2019ll do the necessary actions * *</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">{\u00b6 8} Eventually, Williams came home, and he and Wiskur discussed other matters. However, before Wiskur left, Osie phoned Williams. Wiskur was able to hear and recognize Osie\u2019s voice on the other end of the line.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">{\u00b6 9} Wiskur testified that the conversation was \u201c[ajgitated and aggressive,\u201d with \u201csome name calling on both sides\u201d and references to the theft of money and property. During this conversation, according to Wiskur, Williams said to Osie: \u201cWell, you know, I just want to make this right. Robin won\u2019t return any of my phone calls. * * * Well, I\u2019m going to go to the police. I\u2019m going to file charges. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>This needs to be taken care of.\u201d At the end of the conversation, according to Wiskur, Williams \u201cslam[med] the phone\u201d down and said, \u201cF you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">{\u00b6 10} On the night of February 13-14, Tim Purvis, an acquaintance of Osie and Robin Patterson, was performing with a band at a local bar. Around 1:00 a.m., February 14, Purvis saw Patterson at the bar. Purvis finished playing at 2:00 a.m.; half an hour later, he left with Patterson. They reached Purvis\u2019s apartment around 2:45 a.m. Patterson stayed until 9:00 a.m. She and Purvis sat and talked and had \u201ca couple of beers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">{\u00b6 11} While Patterson was at Purvis\u2019s apartment, her phone rang between 10 and 15 times, beginning sometime between 4:00 and 5:00 a.m. Around 5:00 a.m., Purvis got a phone call from Osie, who wanted to talk to Patterson. Purvis handed Patterson his phone and went to the bathroom. He was able to hear most of the conversation, however. He described it as \u201ca lot of arguing back and forth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">{\u00b6 12} Around 5:30 or 6:00 a.m., Patterson received a text message that upset' her. Purvis described her reaction: \u201cShe was very upset, pacing back and forth, crying. Just really distraught.\u201d Purvis asked why she was upset, and she said: \u201cGreg killed Dave.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">{\u00b6 13} Records of the Cincinnati Bell Telephone Company introduced at trial show that on February 14, 2009, between 3:07 a.m. and 8:45 a.m., 15 text messages were sent from phone number 513-746-1393 to phone number 513-746-8127. Cincinnati Bell records listed Osie as both subscriber and registered user for phone number 513-746-1393. Osie was also the subscriber for phone number 513-746-8127; the registered user of that phone was listed as \u201cRobin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">{\u00b6 14} At 3:07 a.m., a text from Osie\u2019s phone to Robin\u2019s stated: \u201cBaby doll your dirt is ready to be over.\u201d At 4:24 a.m., there was another text that said simply: \u201cJob finished.\u201d Other texts sent from Osie\u2019s phone to Robin\u2019s that morning included \u201cNeed help\u201d at 4:35 a.m., \u201cBaby talk 2 me\u201d at 5:09 a.m., \u201cHelp please\u201d at 5:25 a.m., \u201cI need you i am afraid\u201d at 7:30 a.m., and \u201cBaby im worried please call\u201d at 8:29 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">{\u00b6 15} Business records of PNC Bank and United Dairy Farmers (\u201cUDF\u201d) show that on February 14, 2009, at 4:28 a.m., someone used David Williams\u2019s Visa debit card to buy $27.01 worth of gasoline at the UDF in West Chester. Business records of PNC Bank and Meijer show that on February 14, 2009, at 6:24 a.m., someone tried to use the same card to make a transaction in the amount of $547.66 at the Meijer store in West Chester, but the transaction was declined for insufficient funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">{\u00b6 16} At approximately 9:00 or 9:15 a.m., February 14, Donald E. Heis Sr., a mechanic at an auto body shop in West Chester, spotted a cell phone lying in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>pieces in the driveway of the shop as he was driving out on a wrecker call. About 15 minutes later, on his way back, Heis stopped and picked up the phone. Heis reattached the loose pieces of the phone and found that it worked. By examining the phone\u2019s recent-call log, he obtained the phone number of Williams\u2019s daughter, Heather Williams, and called that number to see whether she knew who owned the phone. Heis explained where he had found the phone and how he had obtained Heather\u2019s number. Heather said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s my dad\u2019s [phone].\u201d Heis told her that she could come by the body shop and pick it up.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">{\u00b6 17} Heather then called two of her father\u2019s friends and asked them to let him know where his phone was. She sent one of them to Williams\u2019s house. There he found Williams\u2019s body. Police were summoned, and the crime scene was processed.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The Crime Scene</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">{\u00b6 18} Williams was found lying on the living-room floor, bruised and blood-soaked. The body lay near a coffee table, where police found a wallet lying open, with business cards and various papers scattered around it. On a table by a recliner was a spillproof cup containing whiskey and a drinking straw.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Williams\u2019s television was missing from the entertainment center in the living room.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">{\u00b6 19} In the kitchen, police found a set of knives in a wooden block on the counter. One knife from the set appeared to be missing, but was found in a kitchen drawer.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">{\u00b6 20} Williams\u2019s bedroom contained a safe, which sat atop a dresser. The safe was open, and papers and other items lay scattered on the floor in front of the dresser.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">The Autopsy</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">(\u00b6 21} Dr. James Swinehart, a forensic pathologist employed by Butler County, performed an autopsy on Williams\u2019s body on February 14. Dr. Swinehart noted that Williams had suffered \u201cfive distinct stab wounds clustered basically around the left nipple area.\u201d Several of these wounds had perforated Williams\u2019s left lung, collapsing it. Dr. Swinehart measured 700 cc of blood in the left chest cavity. Williams had also sustained five stab wounds to the abdomen, one of which damaged his liver and gall bladder.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">{\u00b6 22} Finally, Williams\u2019s throat had been slashed. Dr. Swinehart identified \u201ctwo large incised wounds of the anterior neck.\u201d The more serious of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>wounds was 5 and 3/4 inches long; it penetrated Williams\u2019s larynx with a \u201cthrough and through\u201d wound and exposed his windpipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">{\u00b6 23} Dr. Swinehart concluded that Williams bled to death. Based on the temperature of Williams\u2019s body at 8:00 p.m., February 14, Dr. Swinehart was able to estimate that Williams had died in the early morning of February 14, sometime between midnight and 4:00 or 5:00 a.m. Given the large amount of sudden blood loss, Dr. Swinehart opined that Williams would have died within 15 minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">{\u00b6 24} Finally, Dr. Swinehart had a comprehensive toxicology screen performed, which revealed that Williams had a postmortem blood-alcohol level of .160 percent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Osie\u2019s Arrest and Interrogation</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">{\u00b6 25} Investigators from the Butler County Sheriffs Office determined that Osie was a suspect. Four detectives went to his address in West Chester to talk to him. They knocked on the door of his apartment, but no one answered. As the detectives were leaving the apartment complex, they noticed a red truck in the parking lot with its headlights on. Osie drove a red truck. The truck \u201cpeeled out\u201d in reverse. The detectives pursued the truck in their vehicles and were able to block its departure. When the driver of the red truck identified himself as Osie, the detectives handcuffed him and drove him to the stationhouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">{\u00b6 26} At the station, the detectives placed Osie in an interview room, where they administered <em>Miranda </em>warnings and proceeded to interrogate him.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">{\u00b6 27} Osie initially told detectives that Williams had attacked him. According to Osie, Williams accused Patterson of stealing from him and said that \u201che was going to go press charges against her.\u201d Osie claimed that after he told Williams, \u201c[Y]ou got to have proof before you do something like that,\u201d Williams became angry. Osie said that he started to leave, whereupon Williams got out of his chair, picked up a knife, and came at Osie.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">{\u00b6 28} Osie claimed that he pushed Williams back into his chair, but Williams got up and attacked him again. Osie then grabbed Williams\u2019s hand, \u201ckind of turned it into him,\u201d and stabbed Williams with the knife while Williams was holding it. In Osie\u2019s account, Williams pulled the knife out of his body and attacked Osie yet again. The knife \u201cwent back in him again, the way that I had his hand.\u201d Then, Osie claimed, he panicked and went home. Osie claimed that when he left, he did not even know that Williams was dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">{\u00b6 29} The detectives asked Osie why he had sent Patterson a text to the effect that she didn\u2019t \u201chave to worry about Dave no more\u201d if he was unaware that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Williams was dead. Osie explained that this was intended \u201c[t]o let her know that I kind of beat Dave up and stabbed him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">{\u00b6 30} The detectives continued to confront Osie with inconsistencies in his story and inconsistencies between his story and the evidence. As they did so, Osie\u2019s story changed. After admitting that he \u201ckind of beat Dave up,\u201d Osie denied beating Williams, admitting only that he had \u201cpunched him one time.\u201d Osie then amended that to \u201c[o]ne or two times maybe.\u201d Then he claimed that he had not punched Williams with his fist, but had hit him with an open hand. Finally, he admitted punching Williams in the face.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">{\u00b6 31} Osie initially claimed that he stabbed Williams only twice, and he denied cutting Williams\u2019s throat. When detectives pointed out that there appeared to be four to six stab wounds, Osie said he didn\u2019t know whether anyone else was in the house when he left, implying that someone else might have inflicted the wounds after Osie left. Osie later suggested that Williams might have inflicted some of the wounds on himself. Still later, Osie admitted stabbing Williams \u201cprobably four to five times,\u201d but denied cutting his throat. Finally, however, Osie admitted that he cut Williams\u2019s throat after stabbing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">{\u00b6 32} Osie denied taking Williams\u2019s cell phone or television, and he denied taking the knife from the house, claiming that he had left it in Williams\u2019s body. He also denied removing anything from Williams\u2019s safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">{\u00b6 33} Eventually, Osie admitted that he took keys from Williams\u2019s jacket, then went into the bedroom, opened the safe, and scattered its contents. He admitted that he took the knife with him when he left. He also admitted taking Williams\u2019s cell phone, which he threw from his truck window on his way home, and Williams\u2019s TV, which he took in order to make the crime look like a robbery. He claimed that he drove home, changed clothes, then drove to Cincinnati. There he discarded the TV in a dumpster, then threw the knife into the Ohio River.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">{\u00b6 34} After this interview, Detective Melissa Gearhart learned about Williams\u2019s tremor disorder. This called into question Osie\u2019s claim that Williams had assaulted him with a knife, so Gearhart interviewed Osie again.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">{\u00b6 35} In this second interview, Osie\u2019s story was that he and Williams got into a scuffle, during which Osie punched Williams a few times. Then Osie went into the kitchen, Williams followed him, and they struggled again. During the second struggle, Osie grabbed a knife. Williams backed away from Osie into the living room. There, Osie stabbed Williams in the chest. Williams fell to the floor, and Osie stabbed him a few more times. Then, motivated by anger, he cut Williams\u2019s throat, but only once.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Osie\u2019s Statements to His Cellmate</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">{\u00b6 36} Donald D. Simpson Jr., an acquaintance of Osie\u2019s, was Osie\u2019s cellmate in the Butler County Jail from February 15, 2009, until Simpson\u2019s release in April 2009. A \u201ccouple of weeks\u201d after moving in, Osie began to discuss his case with Simpson. During that time, according to Simpson, the two talked about Osie\u2019s case \u201cpretty much every day\u201d until Simpson\u2019s release, because \u201cthat\u2019s all [Osie] pretty much had to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">{\u00b6 37} Osie told Simpson that he had been charged with the murder of David Williams, and \u201cit all stimulated [sic] over Greg\u2019s girlfriend, Robin Patterson.\u201d Simpson testified: \u201cGreg had told me that David Williams was pressing charges on Robin Patterson for stealing around $18,000.\u201d Osie told Simpson that Patterson had used payroll checks to steal the money and that she asked him to persuade Williams not to press charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">{\u00b6 38} According to Simpson, Osie also gave him an account of Williams\u2019s murder. Osie told Simpson that before he went to Williams\u2019s house, he and Patterson had spent all day getting high on cocaine. Osie told Simpson that he arrived at Williams\u2019s house around 1:30 or 2:00 a.m. Osie began by trying to talk Williams out of pressing charges. But during the conversation, Williams indicated his intention to press charges against Osie for the check cashed at the Marathon station. At that point, Osie told Simpson,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-9\">the conversation had got heated and * * * he had punched Dave, and then it just happened that, I mean before he knew it, he had got the knife and stabbed him. He had stabbed him like four or five times in the chest, and that then when he was laying there, that he freaked out, and so he had rushed down and took the knife and sliced his throat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">{\u00b6 39} Osie told Simpson that he \u201chad tried to make it look like a break-in.\u201d Osie told Simpson that he took a flat-screen television and a credit card and also removed checks from Williams\u2019s safe. Osie said that he had tried to purchase gas with the credit card. He also had gone to Meijer and tried to buy a diamond ring for Patterson, but the card was declined. Simpson testified that Osie never told him that before arriving at Williams\u2019s house, he had intended to harm Williams or steal anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">{\u00b6 40} According to Simpson, Osie had been calling and writing Patterson, but Patterson refused to take Osie\u2019s calls or answer his letters. Shortly before Simpson\u2019s scheduled release, Osie asked him what his plans were; Simpson said that he was going back to Kentucky. Osie asked him to \u201cstick around for a couple of days and do him a favor.\u201d Osie wanted Simpson to \u201cfind the murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>weapon and place it in Mrs. [Robin] Patterson\u2019s car.\u201d Osie described the weapon as a 12-inch hunting knife. He told Simpson that he had thrown it from the window of his vehicle and gave Simpson directions for finding it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Indictment, Trial, and Verdict</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">{\u00b6 41} Osie was indicted on two counts of aggravated murder: one charging that he killed Williams with prior calculation and design, R.C. 2903.01(A), and one charging that he killed Williams while committing aggravated burglary, R.C. 2903.01(B). Each aggravated-murder count carried three death specifications. Specifications 1 and 2 to each count were felony-murder specifications, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), predicated respectively on aggravated burglary and aggravated robbery. Specification 3 to each aggravated-murder count was a witness-murder specification, R.C. 2929.04(A)(8). Counts 3, 4, and 5 charged aggravated burglary, aggravated robbery, and evidence tampering, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">{\u00b6 42} Osie waived a jury and was tried by a three-judge panel. The panel found Osie guilty of Count 2 (felony-murder) and of all three death specifications attached to that count. However, the panel acquitted him on Count 1 (aggravated murder/prior calculation and design) and found him guilty of the lesser-included offense of murder. Finally, the panel found him guilty of Counts 3, 4, and 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">{\u00b6 43} After the penalty phase, the panel sentenced Osie to death on Count 2. The case is now before this court on appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">I. Pretrial Issues</p>\n<p id=\"AlV\">A. Validity of Jury Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">{\u00b6 44} In his tenth proposition of law, Osie contends that his jury waiver was not voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. He claims that the waiver colloquy was inadequate and that the trial court should have inquired into his mental health before accepting the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">{\u00b6 45} A jury waiver must be voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. <em>State v. Ruppert, </em>54 Ohio St.2d 263, 271, 375 N.E.2d 1250 (1978). Waiver may not be presumed from a silent record. <em>State v. Foust, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 137, 2004-Ohio-7006, 823 N.E.2d 836, \u00b6 52. However, if the record shows a jury waiver, the verdict will not be set aside except on a plain showing that the waiver was not freely and intelligently made. <em>Id.; Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann, </em>317 U.S. 269, 281, 63 S.Ct. 236, 87 L.Ed. 268 (1942). Moreover, a written waiver is presumptively voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. <em>Foust </em>at \u00b6 52; <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number><em>v. Sammons, </em>918 F.2d 592, 597 (6th Cir.1990). <em>See also State v. Bays, </em>87 Ohio St.3d 15, 19, 716 N.E.2d 1126 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">{\u00b6 46} At a hearing on March 31, 2010, defense counsel stated that they had met with Osie ten days before and discussed his option of going forward with a jury trial or being tried by a three-judge panel. One of Osie\u2019s attorneys met with him on March 30 and discussed the same topic with him for 15 to 20 minutes. On March 31, defense counsel filed a written jury waiver signed by Osie.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">{\u00b6 47} At the March 31 hearing, the trial court conducted a colloquy with Osie to ensure that his waiver was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. In response to the judge\u2019s questions, Osie acknowledged that he understood that a jury consisted of 12 people, that he would play an active role in picking the jurors, that the jury would weigh the evidence and decide the credibility of the witnesses, and that he could not be found guilty unless the jury unanimously agreed that the state had proven the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Osie acknowledged that he understood that the jury would also decide whether he would receive a death sentence, that this decision would be based on whether the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravation outweighed the mitigation, and that this decision must also be unanimous. Osie acknowledged understanding that by giving up a jury, he would be tried by a three-judge panel, whose verdicts would also have to be unanimous.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">{\u00b6 48} Osie affirmed that no one had threatened him, coerced him, or promised him anything in exchange for his jury waiver. He acknowledged understanding that his right to a jury trial was protected by the state and federal Constitutions and by statute. He acknowledged that he had discussed \u201call of this\u201d with his counsel, they had answered all his questions, and he had nothing more to ask them.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">{\u00b6 49} After the colloquy, Osie signed a second jury waiver in open court. Before signing, Osie acknowledged that he had had an opportunity to go over it. The written waiver contains the following acknowledgement: \u201cI fully understand that under the laws of this State, I have a Constitutional right to a trial by jury. I wish to give up my right to a trial by jury in this case.\u201d The waiver further states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-10\">I fully understand that I am not only waiving the right to have my guilt or innocence determined by a jury, but also waiving my right to have a jury decide the sentence to be imposed upon me in the event of a guilty verdict. I fully understand that in that event, upon completion of a sentencing hearing, the same three-judge panel, who determined my guilt as to the crime(s) charged and the specifieation(s) thereto, would determine the sentence to be imposed upon me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>{\u00b6 50} The trial judge found that Osie had knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived his jury-trial right.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Voluntariness</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">{\u00b6 51} Nothing in the record suggests that the jury waiver was involuntary. When the trial court accepted Osie\u2019s written waiver, Osie affirmed that his decision was voluntary and that he had discussed his decision with his counsel. The advice of counsel is a factor supporting a finding of voluntariness. <em>Bays, 87 </em>Ohio St.3d at 19, 716 N.E.2d 1126. We conclude that the record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that Osie\u2019s jury waiver was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Knowing and Intelligent Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">{\u00b6 52} Because \u201c[a] waiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right or privilege * * *, a defendant must have some knowledge of the nature of the jury trial right to make a valid waiver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19-20. However, \u201c[t]here is no requirement for a trial court to interrogate a defendant in order to determine whether he or she is fully apprised of the right to a jury trial.\u201d <em>State v. Jells, </em>53 Ohio St.3d 22, 559 N.E.2d 464 (1990), paragraph one of the syllabus. \u201cThe Criminal Rules and the Revised Code are satisfied by a written waiver, signed by the defendant, filed with the court, and made in open court, after arraignment and opportunity to consult with counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">{\u00b6 53} Osie contends that the trial court failed to inquire into his \u201cbackground, IQ, or level of education\u201d to ensure that he understood the legal proceedings. However, he cites no authority to show that such an inquiry is a prerequisite for a valid waiver. \u201c[A] defendant need not have a complete or technical understanding of the jury-trial right in order to waive it.\u201d <em>State v. Fitzpatrick, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 321, 2004-Ohio-3167, 810 N.E.2d 927, \u00b6 44, citing <em>United States v. Martin, </em>704 F.2d 267, 273 (6th Cir.1983). \u201cA defendant is sufficiently informed to make an intelligent waiver if he was aware that a jury is composed of 12 members of the community, he may participate in the selection of the jurors, the verdict of the jury must be unanimous, and * * * a judge alone will decide guilt or innocence should he waive his jury trial right.\u201d <em>Martin </em>at 273; <em>see also Fitzpatrick, id. </em>The trial court advised Osie of all these things, and Osie acknowledged that he understood them.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In our view, the record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that Osie\u2019s waiver was knowing and intelligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>{\u00b6 54} Osie contends that the trial court should have inquired into his mental health before accepting his waiver, based on the court\u2019s knowledge of certain letters that the state had seized from Osie\u2019s cell. Osie contends that these letters \u201cwould have led anyone to have concerns about Osie\u2019s mental health,\u201d because they showed that his \u201cthought process was strange and erratic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">{\u00b6 55} The letters in question are directed to Robin Patterson. In tones of suspicion and anger, they make numerous complaints about Patterson\u2019s failure to contact Osie; accusations that Patterson was a heavy drug user and sexually unfaithful; accusations that Patterson had Williams killed and had framed Osie for the murder; and threats against Patterson, both veiled and explicit. They also contain declarations of love, explicit reflections on his sexual relationship with Patterson, and Osie\u2019s apologies for having assaulted Patterson in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">{\u00b6 56} Osie\u2019s characterization of these letters as evincing mental illness is conclusory and speculative. Osie does not explain how the letters would tend to raise questions about his mental health. Moreover, as the state points out, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Osie had any mental-health issues. Defense counsel never raised Osie\u2019s competence as an issue. \u201cIf counsel had some reason to question defendant\u2019s competency, they surely would have done so.\u201d <em>State v. Thomas, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 309, 2002-Ohio-6624, 779 N.E.2d 1017, \u00b6 39 (holding that trial court did not err by failing to make sua sponte finding that defendant was incompetent to stand trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">{\u00b6 57} We overrule Osie\u2019s tenth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">B. Judge\u2019s Failure to Recuse</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">{\u00b6 58} In his 17th proposition of law, Osie contends that Judge Noah E. Powers II, who presided over the trial, should have recused himself because his pecuniary relationship with the defense mitigation specialist, who was the judge\u2019s former law partner, created an appearance of impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">{\u00b6 59} Some months before trial, the defense requested that attorney Christopher J. Pagan be appointed as the defense mitigation specialist. Judge Powers informed the parties on the record that he had an ongoing financial relationship with Pagan, because they had been law partners, and Pagan \u201cstill owes me [the judge] money.\u201d Judge Powers was initially reluctant to appoint Pagan for this reason. However, recognizing that defense counsel had valid reasons for desiring the appointment, Judge Powers recused himself from ruling on the defense motion to appoint Pagan. The matter was referred to Judge Michael J. Sage, the administrative judge of the common pleas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">{\u00b6 60} Judge Sage held a hearing on the motion to appoint Pagan. At the hearing, defense counsel explained that Judge Powers had recused himself from the motion because \u201cthere are still some cases that Mr. Pagan has in his office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>that Judge Powers was working on at the time, and he is still owed money from those cases if and when they settle or if judgment is obtained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">{\u00b6 61} The prosecution expressed concerns because, if Osie waived his right to a jury trial and if Pagan was called to testify in the penalty phase, Judge Powers might be compelled to recuse himself. Defense counsel responded that the defense did not anticipate waiving a jury and in any event did not plan to call Pagan as a witness. Judge Sage granted the motion to appoint Pagan.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">{\u00b6 62} Osie never asked that Judge Powers recuse himself, nor did he raise the issue of Judge Powers\u2019s alleged bias before the chief justice pursuant to R.C. 2701.03, which establishes procedures for filing an affidavit of disqualification against a common pleas judge. Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section 5(C) provides: \u201cThe chief justice of the supreme court or any judge of that court designated by him shall pass upon the disqualification of any judge of the courts of appeals or courts of common pleas or division thereof.\u201d This provision vests exclusive authority to pass on disqualification matters in the chief justice or her designee. <em>See Beer v. Griffith, </em>54 Ohio St.2d 440, 441-442, 377 N.E.2d 775 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">(\u00b6 63} In <em>Beer, </em>the court of appeals voided a trial court\u2019s judgment on the ground that the trial judge in that case should have recused himself. We reversed, holding: \u201cSince only the Chief Justice or his designee may hear disqualification matters, the Court of Appeals was without authority to pass upon disqualification <em>or to </em>void the judgment of the trial court upon that basis.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Id </em>at 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">{\u00b6 64} Similarly, in <em>State v. Moore, </em>93 Ohio St.3d 649, 650, 758 N.E.2d 1130 (2001), we held that an appellant who had failed to file an affidavit of disqualification could not complain on appeal that the judges on the court below were biased. <em>Moore </em>was an appeal to this court from the judgment of a court of appeals that denied an application to reopen an appeal under App.R. 26(B). The appellant argued in this court that the judges of the court of appeals should have recused themselves from ruling on his application. Citing <em>Beer </em>and Article IV, Section 5(C), we held: \u201cUnder R.C. 2501.13, when a party believes that a judge of the court of appeals is biased, the proper avenue for redress is filing an affidavit of disqualification with this court. * * * Moore did not file such an affidavit, and therefore is foreclosed from bringing such a complaint.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">{\u00b6 65} Osie should have brought his bias claim before the chief justice via affidavit for disqualification under R.C. 2701.03. Having failed to do so, he is likewise \u201cforeclosed from bringing such a complaint,\u201d <em>id, </em>on appeal of his conviction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>{\u00b6 66} In addition to being waived, Osie\u2019s claim lacks merit. The alleged conflict is based on Osie\u2019s belief that Judge Powers \u201cha[d] a pecuniary interest in not damaging his former law partner\u2019s reputation.\u201d Osie appears to be arguing that if Pagan was appointed and his performance damaged his reputation, the result might be a reduction in the income of his law firm that could endanger his ability to meet his financial obligations to Judge Powers. Because Judge Powers might suffer \u201cfinancial loss if Pagan\u2019s reputation was harmed,\u201d he was \u201cinvested in Pagan\u2019s long term success.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">{\u00b6 67} Osie\u2019s argument is speculative. Osie does not explain how Pagan\u2019s reputation stood to be harmed by participating in this case. Nor does he explain how an interest in protecting Pagan\u2019s reputation would give rise to a bias against the defense, given that Pagan was affiliated with the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">{\u00b6 68} Osie cites <em>Tumey v. Ohio, </em>273 U.S. 510, 523, 47 S.Ct. 437, 71 L.Ed. 749 (1927), but <em>Tumey </em>is in no way apposite here. <em>Tumey </em>holds that a criminal defendant is denied due process when subjected to trial before a judge with \u201ca direct, personal, substantial pecuniary interest in reaching a conclusion against him.\u201d In <em>Tumey, </em>the mayor presiding over the village mayor\u2019s court stood to receive $12 in \u201ccosts\u201d if \u2014 and only if \u2014 the defendant was convicted. But in this case, Judge Powers\u2019s relationship with Pagan gave him no \u201cdirect, personal, substantial pecuniary interest,\u201d <em>Tumey, </em>either in convicting Osie or in subjecting him to the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">{\u00b6 69} Finally, Osie argues that \u201c[ajgreeing not to call Pagan before a mitigation investigation had been undertaken violated Osie\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel.\u201d However, Osie fails to outline any reasoning by which we could reach such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">{\u00b6 70} To demonstrate ineffective assistance, Osie would have to show both that trial counsel\u2019s failure to call Pagan as a witness was deficient performance and that it prejudiced him. <em>See generally Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). He does not attempt to make either showing here. Defense counsel may have had valid strategic reasons for not wanting Judge Powers to recuse himself. Moreover, the defense could present whatever witnesses an\u2019d evidence Pagan\u2019s investigation might uncover without having to call Pagan to testify. Osie identifies nothing in the record to show why the defense needed Pagan to testify or how he might have testified. Consequently, Osie fails to demonstrate either deficient performance or prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">{\u00b6 71} Osie\u2019s 17th proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>C. Selection of Three-Judge Panel</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">{\u00b6 72} In his ninth proposition of law, Osie contends that the three-judge panel was selected by the judge presiding over the case, Judge Powers, rather than by the presiding judge of the common pleas court, Judge Sage, who should have chosen the panel under R.C. 2945.06. Accordingly, he claims, the panel lacked jurisdiction over his case, and he is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">{\u00b6 73} On April 17, 2009, Judge Powers presided over a hearing at which two other judges for a proposed three-judge panel were selected, in case the defendant elected to waive a jury. Each of the other six judges of the Butler County Common Pleas Court was assigned a number based on seniority. Six balls, numbered 1 through 6, were placed in a bottle. A member of the court\u2019s staff pulled the balls randomly from the bottle.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">{\u00b6 74} Before this was done, Judge Powers stated: \u201c[A]s each number is drawn sequentially, those will be the judges that are assigned to the case should the defense decide to waive a jury in this matter and proceed to a three-judge panel. Does anybody have an objection to that procedure?\u201d Defense counsel said: \u201cNo, Your Honor.\u201d Judges Patricia Oney and Charles Pater were the first two judges whose numbers were pulled from the bottle.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">{\u00b6 75} Nearly a year later, Osie decided to waive his right to a jury trial. He submitted a written, signed jury waiver on March 31, 2010. The trial court held a hearing that day, during which Judge Powers conducted a jury-waiver colloquy with Osie, and Osie signed another written waiver, this time in open court. Both jury waivers were filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">{\u00b6 76} Also on March 31, the trial court filed the following judgment entry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-10\">The Court, having accepted the Defendant\u2019s <em>Waiver of a Trial by Jury </em>* * * and * * * having previously determined, by random draw, that JUDGE PATRICIA S. ONEY and JUDGE CHARLES PATER shall be assigned to sit as part of a three-judge [panel] * * * in the event that Defendant entered an appropriate waiver of trial by jury, it is ORDERED that a three-judge panel shall be empanelled, * * * to consist of JUDGE NOAH E. POWERS II, presiding, with JUDGES PATRICIA S. ONEY and CHARLES PATER acting as the balance of the three-judge panel * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">(Italics and capitalization sic.) This entry was signed by both Judge Powers, in his capacity as \u201cAssigned Trial Judge,\u201d and Judge Sage, in his capacity as \u201cCurrent Presiding and Administrative Judge\u201d of the Butler County Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>{\u00b6 77} Osie contends that this selection procedure violated R.C. 2945.06, which governs the selection of three-judge panels in bench-tried capital cases, because Judge Powers was not the presiding judge of the common pleas court and was therefore not authorized by R.C. 2945\u00cd06 to choose the other members of the three-judge panel. Osie further contends that because Judge Powers lacked authority to choose the panel, the panel lacked jurisdiction to try this capital case.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">{\u00b6 78} R.C. 2945.06 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">If the accused is charged with an offense punishable with death, he shall be tried by a court to be composed of three judges, consisting of the judge presiding at the time in the trial of criminal cases and two other judges to be designated by the presiding judge or chief justice of that court * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">{\u00b6 79} We have recently had occasion to construe R.C. 2945.06. <em>See State v. Wesson, </em>137 Ohio St.3d 309, 2013-Ohio-4575, 999 N.E.2d 557. In <em>Wesson, </em>we held: \u201cThe term \u2018presiding judge,\u2019 as used in R.C. 2945.06, does not refer to the judge to whom a capital case has been assigned, but rather refers to the presiding judge of the common pleas court.\u201d <em>Wesson </em>at \u00b6 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">{\u00b6 80} We begin by observing that at trial, Osie never objected to either the panel members or to the procedures used in selecting the panel. Furthermore, in <em>Wesson </em>we expressly declined to hold that \u201cerror in the selection of the three-judge panel is per se reversible error [or] that such an error could not be waived.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 50. In <em>Wesson, </em>the defense \u201cnever objected to the procedure followed by [the judge] to select the panel member nor objected to the panel members\u201d and thereby \u201cforfeited all but plain error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 51. Like Wesson, Osie failed to object at trial and therefore has forfeited all but plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">{\u00b6 81} There are three prerequisites to a finding of plain error: \u201cFirst, there must be an error, <em>i.e., </em>a deviation from a legal rule. * * * Second, the error must be plain. * * * Third, the error must have affected \u2018substantial rights.\u2019 We have interpreted this aspect of the rule to mean that the trial court\u2019s error must have affected the outcome of the trial.\u201d <em>State v. Barnes, </em>94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">{\u00b6 82} In this case, Osie fails to demonstrate the first, and most fundamental, of these prerequisites: the existence of an error. No error inhered in the selection of the panel. The legal rule established by R.C. 2945.06 is that the presiding judge of the common pleas court has the power to appoint the panel members. <em>Wesson, </em>137 Ohio St.3d 309, 2013-Ohio-4575, 999 N.E.2d 557, syllabus. And there was no deviation from that rule in this case, because Judge Powers did not appoint the panel. Judge Sage did, by signing the March 31 entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>{\u00b6 83} \u201cA court of record speaks only though its journal and not by oral pronouncement or mere written minute or memorandum.\u201d <em>Schenley v. Kauth, </em>160 Ohio St. 109, 113 N.E.2d 625 (1953), paragraph one of the syllabus. Therefore, the March 31, 2010 journal entry \u2014 not the session of the trial court at which the names of the panel members were drawn \u2014 constituted the actual appointment of the panel. Because Judge Sage signed that entry, it was Judge Sage who appointed the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">{\u00b6 84} Therefore, we reject Osie\u2019s argument that although Judge Sage signed the March 31 entry appointing the panel, \u201che took no part in the actual designation of the other two judges.\u201d The March 31 entry <em>was </em>the \u201cactual designation of the other two judges.\u201d The fact that Judge Powers presided over the hearing at which the panel members were drawn does not matter, just as it does not matter that a court employee actually drew the names from the bottle.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">,{\u00b6 85} Additionally, \u201c[rjeversal for plain error \u2018is warranted only if the outcome of the trial clearly would have been different absent the error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wesson </em>at \u00b6 52, quoting <em>State v. Hill, </em>92 Ohio St.3d 191, 203, 749 N.E.2d 274 (2001). As <em>Wesson </em>demonstrates, the claimed error was not outcome-determinative in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">{\u00b6 86} In <em>Wesson, </em>even though the wrong judge (the judge presiding over the <em>trial, </em>rather than the presiding judge of the court) appointed the panel members, we declined to find plain error because the defendant did not contend that \u201cthe appointment of different members to the three-judge panel would have changed the outcome of the proceeding. Further, both of the panelists served as members of the Summit County Court of Common Pleas. Nothing suggests that either was ineligible or unqualified to hear the case.\u201d <em>Wesson, </em>137 Ohio St.3d 309, 2013-Ohio-4575, 999 N.E.2d 557, at \u00b6 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">{\u00b6 87} Here, as in <em>Wesson, </em>Osie does not contend that the appointment of different members to the panel would have changed the outcome in his case. Moreover, as in <em>Wesson, </em>both panelists were judges of the appropriate common pleas court, and nothing in the record suggests that either judge was ineligible or unqualified to hear the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">{\u00b6 88} For the foregoing reasons, the procedure whereby Judges Oney and Pater were appointed to the panel was not plain error. Osie\u2019s failure to make a contemporaneous objection to that procedure forfeits his claim. Hence, we overrule Osie\u2019s ninth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">II. Confession Issues</p>\n<p id=\"AlY\">A. Voluntariness of Confession</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">{\u00b6 89} Osie\u2019s 15th and 16th propositions of law challenge the voluntariness of his confession and will be considered together.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Osie\u2019s Confession</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">{\u00b6 90} When Osie arrived at the sheriffs office on the night of his arrest, he was given a soft drink and taken to the interview room, where his handcuffs were removed. Detective Rob Whitlock read him his <em>Miranda </em>rights from a card. Whitlock testified at the suppression hearing that he told Osie to sign the card \u201cif he understood his rights and he wanted to go ahead and talk to us.\u201d Osie signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">{\u00b6 91} The detectives then talked to Osie for about 15 minutes, without recording the conversation. During this part of the interrogation, Osie claimed that Williams had \u201ccome at him\u201d with a knife and that Osie \u201chad taken the knife and turned it on Mr. Williams * * * to stab him twice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">{\u00b6 92} Then they turned on the tape recorder, and Detectives Whitlock and Melissa Gearhart interviewed Osie from 7:58 p.m. to 8:43 p.m. Osie changed his story several times during this interview, but ultimately confessed to cutting Williams\u2019s throat, stabbing him, and stealing from him. After the first taped interview concluded, Osie was given a fast-food meal. At 9:07 p.m., Detective Gearhart turned on the tape recorder and began a second interview with Osie, during which she asked him about the whereabouts of the knife and about the goods stolen from the house. This interview lasted ten minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Alleged Coercion</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">{\u00b6 93} \u201cIn deciding whether a defendant\u2019s confession is involuntarily induced, the court should consider the totality of the circumstances * * *.\u201d <em>State v. Edwards, </em>49 Ohio St.2d 31, 358 N.E.2d 1051 (1976), paragraph two of the syllabus, <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>438 U.S. 911, 98 S.Ct. 3147, 57 L.Ed.2d 1155 (1978). Nevertheless, \u201cthe use of an inherently coercive tactic by police is a prerequisite to a finding of involuntariness.\u201d <em>State v. Perez, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 122, 2009-Ohio-6179, 920 N.E.2d 104, \u00b6 71, citing <em>Colorado v. Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 167, 107 S.Ct. 515, 93 L.Ed.2d 473 (1986). Consequently, unless the detectives used a coercive tactic, we need not assess the totality of the circumstances. <em>State v. Treesh, </em>90 Ohio St.3d 460, 472, 739 N.E.2d 749 (2001); <em>Perez </em>at \u00b671. \u201cEvidence of use by the interrogators of an inherently coercive tactic <em>(e.g., </em>physical abuse, threats, deprivation of food, medical treatment, or sleep) will trigger the totality of the circumstances analysis.\u201d <em>State v. Clark, </em>38 Ohio St.3d 252, 261, 527 N.E.2d 844 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">{\u00b6 94} In his 16th proposition of law, Osie claims that the detectives used a coercive tactic when they urged Osie to tell the truth so as to keep Patterson clear of the investigation. Osie contends that this alone rendered his confession involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>{\u00b6 95} During the first taped interview, Detective Gearhart asked Osie: \u201cAnd who is the one person that you sent the text to, after everything was done?\u201d Osie replied, \u201cRobin.\u201d Gearhart and Osie then had this exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-5\">Q Okay. So * * * here is what you don\u2019t realize that you\u2019re not doing right now by not giving us the big picture, do you love Robin?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">A Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">Q Love her a lot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-8\">A Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-9\">Q Okay. The one person that you\u2019ve sent a text to, after this has happened, which is last night, is Robin, she is the only other person besides you that knows that something has happened to David. Where is that going to take us? * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-10\">A To me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-11\">Q Where is that going to take us? No, think about it. * * * You\u2019ve sent your girlfriend who you love to death a text.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-12\">* * * You\u2019re not going to have to worry about David anymore, but you\u2019re going to sit here * * * and tell us I did all of this stuff, I\u2019ve punched him, I\u2019ve stabbed him, I\u2019ve slit his throat, * * * one other person knows that something\u2019s happened to David, maybe not what, I don\u2019t know what your words were earlier, but misconstrued or whatever, you sent her a text that said, you don\u2019t have to worry about David anymore?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-13\">A Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-14\">Q Who does that take us to, because you don\u2019t want to fill in the blanks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-15\">A. Her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-16\">Q. Bingo. Is that what you want to leave us with, you love her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-17\">A Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-18\">Q You need to think about that. Because I guarantee her fingerprints are in the house, she had been there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-19\">A Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-20\">Q They had a business together.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-21\">A Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-22\">Q What is that going to do for her, what are you doing for her right now by not completing your story, this is your story * * * but that\u2019s what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>you\u2019re doing to her, * * * you need to think about that.

And I don\u2019t think you want to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">But getting the stuff back is going to help you * * *. It\u2019s a big deal for you, and it\u2019s not a big deal for Robin. Where is the TV?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">{\u00b6 96} Threats against a suspect\u2019s family can be coercive. <em>See generally Lynumn v. Illinois, </em>372 U.S. 528, 534, 83 S.Ct. 917, 9 L.Ed.2d 922 (1963) (police threatened that suspect\u2019s children would be taken from her if she refused to cooperate); <em>Rogers v. Richmond, </em>365 U.S. 534, 81 S.Ct. 735, 5 L.Ed.2d 760 (1961) (confession followed police chiefs pretense of placing a call ordering suspect\u2019s wife brought in for questioning).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">{\u00b6 97} In particular, \u201cthreats to arrest members of a suspect\u2019s family may cause a confession to be involuntary.\u201d <em>United States v. Finch, </em>998 F.2d 349, 356 (6th Cir.1993). The issue \u201cturns on * * * whether the threat could have been lawfully executed,\u201d i.e., whether the police had probable cause to arrest the person in question. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>351 F.3d 254, 263 (6th Cir.2003). When there is no probable cause for the threatened arrest and therefore no legal basis for carrying out the threat, a confession caused by the threat is involuntary. <em>Id. </em>at 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">{\u00b6 98} In <em>Perez, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 122, 2009-Ohio-6179, 920 N.E.2d 104, we held that police had not coerced the defendant when they indicated to him that his wife could be subject to arrest, because the police indeed had probable cause to arrest the defendant\u2019s wife. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 72-76. \u201cIndeed, it may more generally be said that a mere threat to take action which would be lawful and necessary absent cooperation is not objectionable.\u201d 2 LaFave, Israel, King &amp; Kerr, <em>Criminal Procedure, </em>Section 6.2(c), at 623 (3d Ed.2013), fn. 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">{\u00b6 99} The alleged threats to involve Patterson in the investigation are, if anything, less coercive than the circumstances in <em>Perez: </em>Patterson was not Osie\u2019s wife, and \u201c[a] relationship other than a spousal relationship is not as susceptible to coercion by threat or promise.\u201d <em>Johnson v. State, </em>513 N.E.2d 650, 652 (Ind.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">{\u00b6 100} Moreover, the detectives never threatened to arrest Patterson. Detective Gearhart did suggest that Osie\u2019s failure to come clean might implicate Patterson as a suspect (\u201cWho does that take us to, because you don\u2019t want to fill in the blanks?\u201d). But \u201cvague and indefinite\u201d statements do not render a confession involuntary. <em>Id. </em>at 653. Moreover, \u201cthe police may bring to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>defendant\u2019s attention the probability that his relative may be culpable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Raymond, </em>424 Mass. 382, 396, 676 N.E.2d 824 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">{\u00b6 101} In <em>United States v. Jones, </em>32 F.3d 1512 (11th Cir.1994), an officer told the defendant that his girlfriend would continue to be a suspect unless he explained her participation and that if his girlfriend was part of the robbery, she was subject to prosecution. No promise was made that his girlfriend would not be prosecuted if he cooperated. The court concluded: \u201cNot only was this information true, but also such comments or information would not render Jones\u2019s subsequent statements involuntary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1517. <em>See also United States v. Haynes, </em>301 F.3d 669, 684 (6th Cir.2002) (alleged threats to take legal action against defendant\u2019s girlfriend and daughter \u201cwere not of such a gravity that an ordinary person * * * would have lost the will to resist\u201d); <em>State v. Edwards, </em>116 S.W.3d 511, 530-531 (Mo.2003) (police had interviewed defendant\u2019s wife and children and told him that they would do so again if he did not tell the truth; held, not coercive).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">{\u00b6 102} We conclude that Detective Gearhart\u2019s discussion during the interrogation of Patterson\u2019s potential involvement was not coercive.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Intoxication</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">{\u00b6 103} In his 15th proposition of law, Osie contends that intoxication and cocaine use rendered him incapable of voluntarily waiving his right to remain silent. Sometime after Detective Whitlock Mirandized Osie, Osie told him that he had \u201csome beers\u201d that day, and on the previous night (February 13), he and Robin Patterson had been \u201cdoing lines of cocaine.\u201d However, Whitlock testified that Osie did not smell of alcohol and did not appear to be intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">{\u00b6 104} There was no evidence at the suppression hearing indicating that Osie had used cocaine more recently than the night before the interrogation. Moreover, the defense submitted no evidence to show how long the effects of cocaine might be expected to continue. Therefore, there was nothing to refute Whitlock\u2019s testimony that Osie did not appear intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">{\u00b6 105} Moreover, the record shows that the confession was voluntary under the totality of the circumstances. The totality of the circumstances includes \u201cthe age, mentality, and prior criminal experience of the accused; the length, intensity, and frequency of interrogation; the existence of physical deprivation or mistreatment; and the existence of threat or inducement.\u201d <em>Edwards, </em>49 Ohio St.2d 31, 358 N.E.2d 1051, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">{\u00b6 106} There is no evidence that Osie was mistreated in any way. He was given food and drink and during both interviews was permitted to smoke \u201cas he wished.\u201d There is no evidence that he was threatened or promised anything. Osie was interrogated for approximately an hour; then he had a 24-minute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>break, followed by ten more minutes of interrogation. The record shows that Osie was around 47 years old at the time of the interrogation. Osie never complained of being tired or sleepy, having a cloudy or distorted memory, or being under the influence of any mind-altering substance. Detective Whitlock testified that he appeared to be nervous, but not confused.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">{\u00b6 107} Under the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that Osie voluntarily waived his rights and that his confession was voluntary. Accordingly, Osie\u2019s 15th and 16th propositions of law are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">B. Partial Recording of Interrogation</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">{\u00b6 108} In his 18th proposition of law, Osie contends that the trial court should have suppressed his confession because the detectives who obtained it recorded only part of the interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">{\u00b6 109} Nothing in the federal or Ohio Constitution requires that confessions or police interviews be recorded. <em>State v. Smith, </em>80 Ohio St.3d 89, 106, 684 N.E.2d 668 (1997). But Osie contends that if police do record an interview with a suspect, due process and fundamental fairness require them to record the whole interview, not just a portion of it. He contends that if police fail to record the whole interview, the trial court must exclude the recorded portion from evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">{\u00b6 110} Osie did not, at trial, raise the partial recording of the interview as a ground for excluding the recorded portions. Therefore, he has waived this issue unless he can demonstrate plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">{\u00b6 111} Osie\u2019s claim is a novel one at best. He cites no cases holding that partial recording of a custodial interview is grounds for excluding the recorded portion. The cases he does cite do not stand for any such proposition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Shaver, </em>89 Fed.Appx. 529, 532-533 (6th Cir.2004) (neither Fed.R.Evid. 106 nor common-law \u201cdoctrine of completeness\u201d entitled defendant to introduce his own self-serving hearsay statements at trial); <em>United States v. Spearman, </em>186 F.3d 743, 756 (6th Cir.1999) (trial court did not err in allowing the government to play only portions of an incriminating videotape; defense had been given the opportunity to play the entire videotape); <em>State v. Davis, </em>4 Ohio App.3d 199, 447 N.E.2d 139 (1982) (under Evid.R. 106, a party may be compelled to choose between admitting an entire tape-recorded statement and forgoing use of the statement altogether).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>{\u00b6 112} None of these cases holds, implies, or even suggests that where a conversation was partly recorded and partly unrecorded, the trial court must exclude the recorded portion. Nor are these cases based on constitutional principles. (Although <em>Davis </em>does speak of \u201cthe fundamental fairness of presenting statements in context,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 201, its holding is ultimately based on Evid.R. 106.) An error is plain error only if the error is obvious. <em>E.g., State v. Hancock, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 57, 2006-Ohio-160, 840 N.E.2d 1032, \u00b6 60. Moreover, plain error must be plain \u201cat the time that the trial court committed it.\u201d <em>State v. Barnes, </em>94 Ohio St.3d at 28, 759 N.E.2d 1240. In view of the lack of authority to support Osie\u2019s argument, we cannot find that the trial court committed plain error by not suppressing his confession sua sponte on the ground that only part of the interrogation was recorded. Hence, we overrule his 18th proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">III. Hearsay/Confrontation Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">{\u00b6 113} In his second proposition of law, Osie contends that hearsay statements by the victim, David Williams, were introduced at trial and used as substantive evidence of Osie\u2019s guilt, in violation of Osie\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">{\u00b6 114} Osie does not specifically identify the particular statements alleged to have been improperly admitted. However, according to his brief, the statements at issue were \u201cadmitted * * * through the testimony of Nick Wiskur.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">{\u00b6 115} Wiskur\u2019s testimony described statements he overheard Williams make during Williams\u2019s February 13, 2009 phone conversation with Osie. Wiskur testified that Williams said: \u201cI just want to make this right. Robin won\u2019t return any of my phone calls. I don\u2019t really have an issue with it.\u201d Wiskur further testified that Williams said: \u201cI\u2019m going to go to the police. I\u2019m going to file charges. This needs to be taken care of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">{\u00b6 116} These statements were admitted over defense objection. The state did not contest the defense claim that the statements were hearsay, but argued that they were admissible under two hearsay exceptions: excited utterance and forfeiture by wrongdoing, Evid.R. 804(B)(6). The trial court overruled the defense objection and admitted Wiskur\u2019s testimony about Williams\u2019s statements under the forfeiture-by-wrongdoing exception of Evid.R. 804(B)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">{\u00b6 117} In their briefs, both parties extensively analyze the admissibility of Williams\u2019s statements under Evid.R. 804(B)(6) and under the forfeiture-by-wrongdoing exception to the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. <em>See generally Giles v. California, </em>554 U.S. 353, 128 S.Ct. 2678, 171 L.Ed.2d 488 (2008) (discussing common-law doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing). However, we conclude that Williams\u2019s statements were admissible for a more fundamental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>reason: they were not <em>hearsay, </em>as Evid.R. 801(C) defines that term, because they were not introduced for the purpose of proving the truth of the matters asserted therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">{\u00b6 118} \u201c \u2018Hearsay\u2019 is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Evid.R. 801(C). A statement is not hearsay when offered for a purpose other than to prove the truth of the matter asserted. <em>State v. Davis, </em>62 Ohio St.3d 326, 343, 581 N.E.2d 1362 (1991). In this case, the state did not use Williams\u2019s statement to establish the truth of the matter asserted, but for the nonhearsay purpose of establishing Osie\u2019s motive in killing Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">{\u00b6 119} In his conversation with Osie, Williams said: \u201cI\u2019m going to go to the police. I\u2019m going to file charges.\u201d The \u201cmatter asserted\u201d in Williams\u2019s out-of-court statement was that he intended to report something (the thefts from UCU) to the authorities and to file charges concerning the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">{\u00b6 120} The state did not introduce Williams\u2019s statement for the purpose of showing that Williams <em>actually intended </em>to file charges. In fact, whether Williams so intended does not affect Osie\u2019s guilt or innocence of aggravated murder. Therefore, the relevance of Williams\u2019s statement to Osie did not hinge upon whether it was true.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">{\u00b6 121} Instead, the statement was relevant because Williams made it <em>to Osie. </em>Specification 3 to the aggravated-murder counts charged Osie with murdering \u201ca witness to an offense who was purposely killed to prevent the victim\u2019s testimony in any criminal proceeding.\u201d R.C. 2929.04(A)(8). To prove this specification, the state had to prove that Osie killed Williams for the purpose of preventing him from filing a criminal charge. The fact that Williams told Osie that he intended to go to the police to file charges was relevant to prove Osie\u2019s purpose in killing Williams, and consequently, to prove the (A)(8) specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">{\u00b6 122} \u201cIt is well established that extrajudicial statements made by an out-of-court declarant are properly admissible to explain the actions of a witness to whom the statement was directed.\u201d <em>State v. Thomas, </em>61 Ohio St.2d 223, 232, 400 N.E.2d 401 (1980). A statement is not hearsay when introduced to show its effect on the listener. \u201cA statement that D made a statement to X is not subject to attack as hearsay when its purpose is to establish the state of mind thereby induced in X, such as * * * having knowledge or motive * * *.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) 2 <em>McCormick on Evidence, </em>Section 249, at 191 (7th Ed.Broun Ed.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">{\u00b6 123} That is precisely how the state used Williams\u2019s statement to Osie: to show that Osie believed that Williams intended to file charges. In closing argument, the prosecutor said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>And so what happens later is a phone call to Dave [Williams], and so <em>we knew that Osie knows </em>that the information was turned over to Dave, because then the conversation between Dave and Greg Osie on the phone where Dave specifically told him, \u201cI am going to the police. I am going to file charges. I am going to the police.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">That was the last conversation that we know they had for a fact when the phone hung up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">{\u00b6 124} The state reiterated this point in its rebuttal argument. The prosecutor argued that Osie\u2019s purpose in killing Williams \u201cwas to keep him from presenting that criminal testimony.\u201d In support of this assertion, the prosecutor again cited Wiskur\u2019s testimony about the Williams-Osie conversation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">What does Osie do then [after talking to Wiskur]? He calls Dave that same day, and they had that very heated argument that Nick Wiskur overhears.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-9\">And in that argument, Dave tells Osie, \u201cI\u2019m going to the police.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">{\u00b6 125} The state used Williams\u2019s statement to Osie, as testified to by Wiskur, solely for the nonhearsay purpose of showing its effect on Osie \u2014 i.e., showing that Osie killed Williams because he believed that Williams intended to file charges with regard to the thefts. Because the statement was not introduced to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein, it was not \u201chearsay\u201d as the Rules of Evidence define that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">{\u00b6 126} For the same reason, the statement\u2019s admission did not violate the Confrontation Clause. \u201cThe Clause * * * does not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 59, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), fn. 9, citing <em>Tennessee v. Street, </em>471 U.S. 409, 414, 105 S.Ct. 2078, 85 L.Ed.2d 425 (1985). Accordingly, we overrule Osie\u2019s second proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">IV. Seizure of \u201cAttorney Work Product\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-13\">{\u00b6 127} In his seventh proposition of law, Osie claims that the state violated his Sixth Amendment rights by seizing confidential materials, which he describes as \u201cattorney work product,\u201d during a search of his jail cell and that the trial court erred by admitting these materials into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>{\u00b6 128} At a motion hearing before trial, defense counsel complained that Osie\u2019s cell in the Butler County jail had been searched and that certain documents had been seized. Defense counsel explained that they had asked Osie to write down information that might assist them in preparing his defense, such as \u201cmitigation witnesses, fact witnesses, names, address[es], phone numbers, whatever.\u201d Counsel stated that they had received a phone call from Osie \u201csaying they came in and searched his cell and took all of the items that he had been preparing for us.\u201d After the seizure, the state provided copies of the seized items to the defense in discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">{\u00b6 129} The trial court said: \u201cIf * * * you [defense counsel] want to bring it before the Court and have an evidentiary hearing, I\u2019ll be more than willing to entertain that if that\u2019s necessary.\u201d The court admonished the prosecution: \u201c[T]hey\u2019ve got a right to have their work product protected, and I\u2019m not saying that what you did wasn\u2019t appropriate. I don\u2019t have the evidence in front of me to say whether it was or it wasn\u2019t. But I am saying that if it\u2019s brought before me, I\u2019m going to scrutinize it.\u201d The court then ordered the prosecution to examine its file and make sure that everything removed from Osie\u2019s cell had been turned over to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">{\u00b6 130} When the defense raised the issue of seized work product at a later hearing, the trial court told counsel, \u201c[I]f you think the prosecution did something wrong, * * * something that\u2019s suppressible, unconstitutional, whatever, file a motion and bring it to my attention, and I\u2019ll conduct an evidentiary hearing on it, and we can put witnesses on the stand and deal with it in that manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">{\u00b6 131} \u201cImplicit within the meaning of [the constitutional right to counsel] is the right of a criminal defendant to consult privately with his attorney.\u201d <em>State v. Milligan, </em>40 Ohio St.3d 341, 342, 533 N.E.2d 724 (1988). The leading case concerning the Sixth Amendment consequences of government intrusions into attorney-client communications is <em>Weatherford v. Bursey, </em>429 U.S. 545, 97 S.Ct. 837, 51 L.Ed.2d 30 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">{\u00b6 132} In <em>Weatherford, </em>several persons were arrested for vandalizing a government building. One of them was an undercover law-enforcement agent. One of his fellow arrestees retained a lawyer and, still unaware of the agent\u2019s true function, invited the agent to join them in confidential conversations on two occasions before trial. The <em>Weatherford </em>court rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that the agent\u2019s presence during attorney-client conversations violated the Sixth Amendment under the circumstances of that case. However, the court noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-10\">Had Weatherford [the agent] testified at Bursey\u2019s [the offender\u2019s] trial as to the conversation between Bursey and [his attorney]; had any of the State\u2019s evidence originated in these conversations; had these overheard conversations been used in any other way to the substantial detriment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Bursey; or even had the prosecution learned from Weatherford * * * the details of the [attorney-client] conversations about trial preparations, Bursey would have a much stronger case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 554. However, there was \u201cno tainted evidence * * *, no communication of defense strategy to the prosecution, and no purposeful intrusion\u201d into the attorney-client relationship. <em>Id. </em>at 558. Accordingly, \u201cthere was no violation of the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">{\u00b6 133} Although <em>Weatherford </em>involved the actual presence of a government informant during consultations between the defendant and his counsel, the same principles have been applied to a case in which a defendant\u2019s written communication to his counsel was seized from his jail cell and used to impeach his testimony at trial. <em>See Bishop v. Rose, </em>701 F.2d 1150 (6th Cir.1983). In <em>Bishop, </em>however, the result was different. The court found that the defendant\u2019s right to counsel had been violated because the confidential document was, in that case, used at trial to the substantial detriment of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">{\u00b6 134} Osie argues that even though the defense never filed a motion to suppress the alleged work product, the trial court \u201cshould have rejected the admission of the material as the gatekeeper of the evidence.\u201d But Osie cites no relevant authority to support this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">{\u00b6 135} In this case, the trial court correctly noted that it had no evidence before it. The trial court recognized that the defense had \u201ca right to have their work product protected\u201d and made clear that if the defense filed a motion to suppress, the court would hold an evidentiary hearing. Osie\u2019s counsel had ample opportunity to request an evidentiary hearing into the defense claim that work product had been seized. Counsel declined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">{\u00b6 136} Moreover, the defense never objected at trial to the admission of State\u2019s Exhibit 64. Nor did the defense object to any other item of evidence on the ground that its seizure by the state violated the Sixth Amendment or on any related ground. \u201cBy failing to file a motion to suppress illegally obtained evidence, a defendant waives any objection to its admission.\u201d <em>State v. Campbell, </em>69 Ohio St.3d 38, 44, 630 N.E.2d 339 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">{\u00b6 137} The record provides no basis for a finding of plain error. Osie contends that two items of confidential work product were seized and used against him at trial, State\u2019s Exhibit 64 and a list of names, places, and phone numbers. But, as seen from the discussion below, the purported list is not in the record and was never introduced at trial. Osie does not show how the list was \u201cused\u201d against him or that such a list even existed. And as will also be seen in our discussion below, State\u2019s Exhibit 64, the 48-page letter, cannot credibly be claimed to be attorney work product or a confidential attorney-client communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>{\u00b6 138} In discussing his seventh proposition of law, Osie never identifies what, specifically, the trial court should have suppressed. However, in his 14th proposition of law (in which he asserts prosecutorial misconduct), he does specifically identify State\u2019s Exhibit 64 as \u201cattorney work product\u201d that the state should not have introduced against him. The state claims that Exhibit 64 was not work product and that it was probative of Osie\u2019s intent to kill Williams to protect Patterson from criminal charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">{\u00b6 139} State\u2019s Exhibit 64 was a 48-page letter, or series of letters, handwritten by Osie and apparently directed to Robin Patterson, but never mailed. In his reply brief, Osie contends that despite appearances, Exhibit 64 \u201cwas not a letter\u201d because he never intended to mail it. Osie describes Exhibit 64 as \u201ca journal that Osie was writing at the direction of his attorneys * * * with daily journal entries that he imagined himself writing to Robin Patterson about the night that David Williams was killed.\u201d Osie\u2019s brief explains that \u201c[h]is attorneys encouraged him to write down his thoughts in journal form in lieu of writing [Patterson] letters, due to the possibility of her being called as a witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">{\u00b6 140} Osie\u2019s description of Exhibit 64 is unsupported by anything in the record. The only portion of the record Osie cites to support his assertions is the first page of Exhibit 64. On that page, Osie wrote: \u201cMy lawyers told me I\u2019m not to write to you. They think you are a witness * * *.\u201d But nothing in Exhibit 64, or anywhere else in the record, indicates that this document is the result of \u201c[h]is attorneys encouraging] him to write down his thoughts in journal form.\u201d Nor does anything in the record substantiate Osie\u2019s claim that he never intended to mail the letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">{\u00b6 141} Nor does Exhibit 64 fit the description that defense counsel gave the trial court: \u201cWhen we met with him initially, we said write down things for us you may think assists in our defense; mitigation witnesses, fact witnesses, names, address[es], phone numbers, whatever * * There is nothing in Exhibit 64 to suggest that it was written at the direction of Osie\u2019s attorneys or intended for them.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Instead, it is a rambling series of declarations, including expressions of love, accusations, pleas, threats, memories, and promises, all directed to Osie\u2019s girlfriend. In sum, Osie fails to show that State\u2019s Exhibit 64 was a confidential attorney-client communication or attorney work product.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">{\u00b6 142} Osie also contends that the state seized \u201ca list of names, places, and phone numbers\u201d created by Osie at the direction of his counsel and \u201cdesigned to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>aid in the investigation and preparation of Osie\u2019s defense and mitigation presentation.\u201d Osie accuses the state not only of confiscating this list but of using it against him at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">{\u00b6 143} Osie does not, however, explain how the state used the list. Initially, we note that no such list was introduced into evidence at trial; consequently, Osie\u2019s claim that the trial court erred by admitting confidential attorney work product into evidence could not apply to the list.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">{\u00b6 144} \u201cEven where there is an intentional intrusion by the government into the attorney-client relationship, prejudice to the defendant must be shown before any remedy is granted.\u201d <em>United States v. Steele, </em>727 F.2d 580, 586 (6th Cir.1984), citing <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>449 U.S. 361, 365-366, 101 S.Ct. 665, 66 L.Ed.2d 564 (1981). To determine prejudice, a court must look to the factors identified in <em>Weatherford: </em>\u201c(1) whether the government deliberately intruded in order to obtain confidential and privileged information, (2) whether the government obtained directly or indirectly any evidence which was or could be used at trial as a result of the intrusion, (3) whether any information obtained was or could be used in any manner detrimental to the defendant, and (4) whether details about trial preparation were learned by the government.\u201d <em>Milligan, </em>40 Ohio St.3d at 344, 533 N.E.2d 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">{\u00b6 145} In this case, there was no showing of any of the above four factors. The record contains no evidence that the search of Osie\u2019s cell was a \u201cdeliberate intrusion] in order to obtain confidential and privileged information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As already noted, Osie\u2019s list of names, places, and phone numbers was not introduced at trial. Nor did the state use it to impeach any witness. <em>Compare Bishop v. Rose, </em>701 F.2d at 1156-1157 (prosecution used defendant\u2019s 14-page handwritten document, intended for his attorneys, on cross-examination of defendant). There was no showing that possession of the list enabled the state to obtain any evidence that \u201cwas or could be used at trial.\u201d <em>Milligan </em>at 344. Nor was there any showing that the information obtained could be used to Osie\u2019s detriment in any way or that the prosecution learned any details about trial preparation from the list. Accordingly, the defense did not demonstrate that they were entitled to any remedy with regard to Osie\u2019s list of names, places, and phone numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">{\u00b6 146} Osie\u2019s seventh proposition of law was waived at trial, and Osie fails to show plain error. Accordingly, this proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">V. Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"A6O\">A. <em>Brady </em>Claim \u2014 Delayed Disclosure of Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">{\u00b6 147} In his eighth proposition of law, Osie contends that the state\u2019s delayed disclosure of evidence favorable to him violated his right to a fair trial. <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>{\u00b6 148} Osie contends that two items were subjected to delayed disclosure. First, there was a laboratory report by a fingerprint analyst for the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation and Identification (\u201cBCI\u201d). The report involved a box that contained a knife that, according to the prosecutor, may or may not have been the murder weapon. The report was dated April 13, 2009, nearly a year before the prosecution learned of its existence and disclosed it to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">{\u00b6 149} The report stated that on February 27, 2009 (13 days after the murder), Detective Monroe submitted a \u201c[w]hite box containing [a] knife.\u201d The BCI analyst examined the box for fingerprints and found no latent prints with sufficient ridge detail for comparison.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">{\u00b6 150} This report was disclosed to the defense on April 8, 2010. According to the prosecutor, this was the same day the prosecution itself learned of the report\u2019s existence. The prosecutor\u2019s letter of April 8, 2010, to lead defense counsel stated: \u201c[W]e do not intend to use this report because nothing was revealed <em>and </em>the Defendant admitted that he took the murder weapon and threw it in the river. However, if you wish to admit the report, we will not object and stipulate to its admission.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Neither the box nor the lab report was introduced into evidence by either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">{\u00b6 151} Second, the felony record of state\u2019s witness Donald Simpson, Osie\u2019s cellmate to whom he had made damaging admissions, was not disclosed to the defense until the same morning that Simpson testified.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Simpson had three felony convictions: vehicular assault, attempted sexual battery, and sexual battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">{\u00b6 152} Before cross-examining Simpson, defense counsel complained about the late disclosure, stating that had Simpson\u2019s record been disclosed earlier, they \u201ccertainly would have given the name or * * * information to the private investigator to investigate any further, but at this point, I mean he\u2019s here, he\u2019s testified. * * * [W]e believe the information they\u2019ve given us up to now, so we\u2019ll use that and move forward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">{\u00b6 153} <em>Brady </em>holds that \u201cthe suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d 373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215. Evidence is material if there is a \u201c \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 \u201d that the result of the trial would have been different had the evidence been disclosed to the defense. <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 433, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995), quoting <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). \u201cA \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 is a probability sufficient to undermine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>State v. Johnston, </em>39 Ohio St.3d 48, 529 N.E.2d 898 (1988), paragraph five of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">{\u00b6 154} <em>Brady </em>imposes on the government an obligation to turn over evidence that is both favorable to the defendant and material to guilt or punishment. \u201cMateriality pertains to the issue of guilt or innocence, and not to the defendant\u2019s ability to prepare for trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Bencs, </em>28 F.3d 555, 560 (6th Cir.1994), citing <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 112, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976), fn. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">{\u00b6 155} \u201cThus, <em>Brady </em>generally does not apply to delayed disclosure of exculpatory information, but only to a complete failure to disclose.\u201d <em>Bencs </em>at 560. \u201cDelay only violates <em>Brady </em>when the delay itself causes prejudice.\u201d <em>United States v. Patrick, </em>965 F.2d 1390, 1400 (6th Cir.1992), <em>vacated and remanded on other grounds sub nom. Mohwish v. United States, </em>507 U.S. 956, 113 S.Ct. 1378, 122 L.Ed.2d 754 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">{\u00b6 156} Osie does not explain how he was prejudiced by the delayed disclosure. He argues that had his counsel \u201chad earlier knowledge of this information [i.e., both the lab report and Simpson\u2019s record], they would have been available to develop a more thorough challenge of Simpson\u2019s allegations that he was collecting a knife that Osie had discarded.\u201d This claim is vague and speculative, however, and thus fails to reach the level of a reasonable probability, one that is \u201csufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Johnston, </em>39 Ohio St.3d 48, 529 N.E.2d 898, paragraph five of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">{\u00b6 157} With regard to the BCI report on the box, Osie argues that even a \u201cneutral\u201d finding of no usable prints could be favorable to him. <em>See Patler v. Slayton, </em>503 F.2d 472, 479 (4th Cir.1974). But the significance, if any, of the lack of prints on the box is unclear. The record does not disclose where the box was found or anything else about it that might tie it to the murder or explain why the lack of prints on it was exculpatory. Neither the box, the knife, nor the lab report was introduced in evidence by either side. Moreover, the killer\u2019s identity was not contested. Osie had long since confessed that he stabbed Williams. On these facts, Osie cannot show a reasonable probability that earlier disclosure of the lab report would have made a difference in the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">{\u00b6 158} Simpson\u2019s felony record was clearly <em>Brady </em>material. However, the prosecutor did disclose it before Simpson testified, and he also elicited Simpson\u2019s felony convictions on direct examination. Again, Osie does not explain how earlier disclosure of Simpson\u2019s record would have enhanced the ability of the defense to impeach Simpson.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">{\u00b6 159} Osie\u2019s eighth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>B. Other Misconduct Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">{\u00b6 160} In his 14th proposition of law, Osie contends that prosecutorial misconduct denied him a fair trial. He divides his allegations into two categories: trial misconduct and penalty-phase misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Trial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">{\u00b6 161} Osie\u2019s claims of trial misconduct duplicate other propositions of law in his brief. First, he claims that the prosecutors improperly withheld exculpatory evidence. Osie\u2019s eighth proposition raises the same issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">{\u00b6 162} Second, Osie contends that the state relied on evidence obtained during an \u201cimproper search\u201d of his cell. Although this sounds like a Fourth Amendment claim, his arguments actually duplicate his seventh proposition of law, in which he claims that the state violated his Sixth Amendment rights by obtaining and using \u201cattorney work product.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">{\u00b6 163} Because the claims raised in Osie\u2019s seventh and eighth propositions of law lack merit, we reject the claims raised in Part A of Osie\u2019s 14th proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">Penalty-Phase Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">{\u00b6 164} Osie\u2019s penalty-phase-misconduct claims focus on the prosecutor\u2019s arguments, but Osie did not object to any of the three statements that he now claims were improper. No plain error occurred here, because none of the prosecutor\u2019s statements were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">{\u00b6 165} First, Osie complains that the state made the following argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-12\">[TJhere are aggravating circumstances that were proved, and now let\u2019s weigh that and think, an aggravated circumstance is something that goes beyond what we expect to see. It\u2019s beyond the norm. But what did we hear yesterday [during Osie\u2019s presentation of mitigating evidence] from questions, from answers about the defendant? We heard his childhood, normal. It\u2019s great, normal. He was at one point married, normal. Two kids, normal. It\u2019s the human existence. We heard what\u2019s normal. That mitigation was in a word normal. It\u2019s the typical human experience is what we heard, but aggravated circumstances are anything but normal. Those are abnormal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">{\u00b6 166} The prosecutor also described Osie\u2019s mitigating evidence as \u201cthese feathers, these normal parts of human existence, * * * the normalcy of feathers,\u201d i.e., insubstantial when weighed against the grave aggravating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>{\u00b6 167} Osie contends that, by characterizing his mitigation as \u201cnormal,\u201d and, as such, deserving of little weight (\u201cfeathers\u201d), the state\u2019s argument denied him the individualized consideration to which the Eighth Amendment entitles a capital defendant at sentencing. <em>See generally Woodson v. North Carolina, </em>428 U.S. 280, 304, 96 S.Ct. 2978, 49 L.Ed.2d 944 (1976) (individualized consideration is \u201ca constitutionally indispensable part of inflicting the penalty of death\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">{\u00b6 168} However, the state was entitled to argue that Osie\u2019s childhood had little weight in mitigation. \u201cProsecutors can urge the merits of their cause and legitimately argue that defense mitigation evidence is worthy of little or no weight.\u201d <em>State v. Wilson, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 381, 399, 659 N.E.2d 292 (1996). Individualized consideration \u201cmeans that we must focus on \u2018relevant facets of the character and record of the individual offender.\u2019 \u201d <em>Enmund v. Florida, </em>458 U.S. 782, 798, 102 S.Ct. 3368, 73 L.Ed.2d 1140 (1982), quoting <em>Woodson </em>at 304. Arguing about the merits of the specific evidence offered in mitigation by the defense does not deny individualized consideration of that evidence \u2014 quite the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">{\u00b6 169} Osie further contends: \u201c[T]he prosecutor argued that mitigation evidence regarding Osie before the time of the crime was not relevant to the sentencing determination.\u201d Osie is referring to the following passage from the prosecutor\u2019s argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">The final thing I think that we heard was that before 2006, Mr. Osie may have been a bit different, but we\u2019re here in 2010 evaluating whether those aggravated circumstances he committed in 2009 outweigh what\u2019s able to be put forward to you again here in 2010.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Osie contends that by making this argument, the prosecutor was \u201curging the court to ignore mitigation\u201d and \u201ccircumvent[ing]\u201d R.C. 2929.04(B), which requires the sentencer to consider the mitigating factors raised by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">{\u00b6 170} However, immediately after the statement at issue here, the prosecutor said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-10\">And I think that the way to look at this and a way to <em>put them on the scales </em>is they are like these feathers. Friends and family saying they love you, that I haven\u2019t really done too much before this, those are feathers. <em>They\u2019re not entitled to much weight.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">(Emphasis added.) The prosecutor was not urging the court to ignore the defense mitigation or arguing that it was irrelevant. Indeed, he acknowledged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>that it had its place \u201con the scales.\u201d He simply argued that it was \u201cnot entitled to much weight.\u201d Isolated comments by a prosecutor are not to be taken out of context and given their most damaging meaning. <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, </em>416 U.S. 637, 647, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974); <em>State v. Hill, </em>75 Ohio St.3d 195, 204, 661 N.E.2d 1068 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">{\u00b6 171} Finally, the prosecutor argued that the witness-murder specification, R.C. 2929.04(A)(8), was entitled to great weight, because \u201cwhat that factor is saying is that a witness was silenced to subvert justice.\u201d The prosecutor then made the following statement, which Osie claims was improper: \u201cThis weight cannot be counterbalanced. There was nothing that was presented as evidence going to any mitigating factor that can counterbalance that, that silencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">{\u00b6 172} This statement did not urge the court to \u201cignore mitigating factors,\u201d as Osie claims. Rather, it simply claimed that the (A)(8) factor had such weight that Osie\u2019s mitigation could not \u201ccounterbalance\u201d it.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">{\u00b6 173} Osie fails to demonstrate plain error with respect to the prosecutor\u2019s arguments. Accordingly, Part B of his 14th proposition is waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">VI. Sentencing Issues</p>\n<p id=\"Aoc\">A. Allocution</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">{\u00b6 174} In his first proposition of law, Osie contends that the trial court violated Crim.R. 32(A)(1) by failing to ask him if he had anything to say before sentence was pronounced.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">{\u00b6 175} To provide the necessary context for analysis of this claim, we begin with the penalty phase of Osie\u2019s trial. On April 29, 2010, after the parties had rested but before closing arguments commenced, the trial court had the following exchange with Osie and his counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-11\">JUDGE POWERS: * * * All right, Mr. Howard [defense counsel], does Mr. Osie have anything he\u2019d like to say by way of allocution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-12\">MR. HOWARD: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-13\">JUDGE POWERS: Does he understand that he can make an unsworn statement here today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-14\">MR. HOWARD: He does, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-15\">JUDGE POWERS: And he understands that if he made such an unsworn statement, unless \u2014 it not being a sworn statement, he would not be cross-examined in this matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-16\">MR. HOWARD: He does, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-17\">JUDGE POWERS: All right. And you\u2019ve explained all of that to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>MR. HOWARD: We have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">JUDGE POWERS: Do you understand that, Mr. Osie?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">{\u00b6 176} On May 3, 2010, the panel held a sentencing hearing, at which it sentenced Osie to death on Count 2 and also imposed sentences for the noncapital offenses. At this hearing, the panel did not ask Osie whether he wished to make a statement in his or her own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">{\u00b6 177} A week later, on May 10, the panel held a second sentencing hearing. The judge presiding over the case explained that at the original sentencing on May 3, the trial court had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-9\">failed to advise the defendant regarding the application of post-release control to the sentence imposed by the Court in this matter. As a result thereof, the Court believes that that sentence or a portion thereof was void, and that the defendant must be resentenced to correct that error, the same to include an advice on the application of post-release control to this matter. Accordingly, the Court has brought Mr. Osie forward here today to perform that duty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">{\u00b6 178} The court then addressed Osie\u2019s counsel, asking whether they desired to put anything on the record; they declined. Immediately thereafter, the court addressed Osie personally: \u201cDoes Mr. Osie wish to say anything?\u201d Osie replied: \u201cNo, Your Honor.\u201d The court then proceeded to read the sentencing opinion into the record and reimposed sentence on Osie for each of the offenses (both capital and noncapital) of which he had been convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">{\u00b6 179} Crim.R. 32(A)(1) provides: \u201cAt the time of imposing sentence, the court shall * * * [a]fford counsel an opportunity to speak on behalf of the defendant and address the defendant personally and ask if he or she wishes to make a statement in his or her own behalf or present any information in mitigation of punishment.\u201d The rule applies to capital eases. <em>State v. Campbell, </em>90 Ohio St.3d 320, 738 N.E.2d 1178 (2000), paragraph two of the syllabus. Moreover, \u201c[i]n a case in which the trial court has imposed sentence without first asking the defendant whether he or she wishes to exercise the right of allocution created by Crim.R. 32(A), resentencing is required unless the error is invited error or harmless error.\u201d <em>Id., </em>paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">{\u00b6 180} The state argues that the trial court complied with Crim.R. 32(A)(1) at the May 10 resentencing hearing when it asked Osie whether he \u201cwish[ed] to say anything\u201d and Osie declined. We agree. The trial court clearly regarded the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>sentence imposed at the May 3 hearing as void. Therefore, the May 10 hearing was \u201cthe time of imposing sentence\u201d for purposes of Crim.R. 32(A)(1). At that hearing, the trial court asked Osie whether he wished to say anything, and Osie said that he did not. The court gave Osie everything he was entitled to under Crim.R. 32(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">{\u00b6 181} Osie contends, however, that the opportunity he was offered to speak at the May 10 resentencing hearing appeared to have been \u201cdirected only towards the non-capital counts.\u201d Citing our decision in <em>State v. Green, </em>90 Ohio St.3d 352, 738 N.E.2d 1208 (2000), Osie contends that at the May 10 hearing, the trial court should have \u201cunambiguously\u201d asked him if he had anything to say before he was sentenced on his capital counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">{\u00b6 182} In <em>Green, </em>we determined that a trial court had failed to comply with Crim.R. 32(A)(1), even though the court had asked the defendant whether he had anything to say before he was sentenced. Our holding in <em>Green </em>was based, in part, on the failure of the trial court in that case to make clear whether the court was inviting the defendant to make a statement about the capital counts as well as the noncapital counts: \u201cThe context suggests that the court may have solicited comment only on the noncapital offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">{\u00b6 183} Osie argues that this case resembles <em>Green, </em>in that \u201cthe context of the trial court\u2019s request here suggested that the court was only soliciting comment on the post-release control issue.\u201d We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">{\u00b6 184} Before asking Osie on May 10 if he wished to say anything, the trial court had explained in open court that in its opinion, the sentence imposed on May 3, or a portion thereof, was void. It was evident from the trial court\u2019s remarks that it regarded the <em>entire </em>sentence imposed on May 3 as being rendered void (at least potentially) by the postrelease-control error. The stated purpose of the resentencing was \u201cto correct that error,\u201d which threatened to render the sentence void; from the trial court\u2019s perspective, anything less than a complete resentencing would risk failing to completely correct the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">{\u00b6 185} Therefore, it should have been \u2014 and almost certainly was \u2014 obvious to Osie that the trial court intended to resentence him on <em>all </em>counts, including the capital counts. That being the case, it was equally clear that the trial court\u2019s direct invitation to Osie to \u201csay anything\u201d <em>also </em>covered all counts, including the capital counts. We find no ambiguity in that invitation and therefore reject Osie\u2019s proposed analogy to <em>Green. </em>Accordingly, Osie\u2019s first proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">B. Failure to Merge Death Specifications</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">{\u00b6 186} In the penalty phase of a capital case, \u201cwhere two or more aggravating circumstances arise from the same act or indivisible course of conduct and are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>thus duplicative,\u201d they will be merged for sentencing purposes. <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 164, 473 N.E.2d 264 (1984), paragraph five of the syllabus. In his fourth proposition of law, Osie contends that the trial court erred by failing to merge the felony-murder/burglary specification, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), and the witness-murder specification, R.C. 2929.04(A)(8). Osie argues that the specifications should have merged on authority of <em>State v. Fry, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 163, 2010-Ohio-1017, 926 N.E.2d 1239. For the reasons that follow, we agree; however, the error can be corrected by our independent review, and so there is no need to remand this case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">{\u00b6 187} In <em>Fry, </em>the defendant was convicted of aggravated murder with specifications for aggravated burglary and witness-murder. The trial court merged the two specifications, but failed to so instruct the jury. On appeal, the state argued that the trial court\u2019s error was harmless because those two specifications should not have merged in the first place. We rejected that argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">The state argues that the two specifications did not merge because the evidence proving these offenses was separate and distinct. However, * * * Fry unlawfully entered Knox\u2019s residence on July 31 to kill [the victim] either in retaliation for filing a criminal complaint against him or to prevent her from testifying against him in future criminal proceedings. He murdered her shortly after entering the residence. Thus, Fry\u2019s actions in killing [the victim] during an aggravated burglary and killing her because she was a witness were \u201cinextricably intertwined, and thereby constituted one indivisible course of conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-6\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 181, quoting <em>State v. Garner, 74 </em>Ohio St.3d 49, 54, 656 N.E.2d 623 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">{\u00b6 188} In this case, as in <em>Fry, </em>Osie\u2019s object in trespassing in Williams\u2019s home, and also his reason for killing Williams, was to prevent him from filing a criminal complaint against him or Patterson. Moreover, the trespass, and therefore the aggravated burglary, did not begin until Osie began to assault Williams. Consequently, Osie\u2019s actions in killing Williams during an aggravated burglary and killing him because he was a witness appear to be \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d and hence \u201cconstituted one indivisible course of conduct.\u201d <em>Gamer </em>at 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">{\u00b6 189} We can cure any error related to the duplicative specifications by merging the two specifications as part of our independent sentence review. <em>Fry, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 163, 2010-Ohio-1017, 926 N.E.2d 1239, at \u00b6 183, citing <em>State v. Mitts, </em>81 Ohio St.3d 223, 232, 690 N.E.2d 522 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>C. Sufficiency of Evidence of Death Specifications:</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Witness-Murder Specification</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">{\u00b6 190} In his third proposition of law, Osie contends that the state failed to present evidence sufficient to convict him on the R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) witness-murder specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">{\u00b6 191} Under R.C. 2929.04(A)(8), a person who commits aggravated murder is guilty of a capital specification if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-9\">[t]he victim of the aggravated murder was a <em>ivitness to an offense </em>who was purposely killed <em>to prevent the victim\u2019s testimony in any criminal proceeding </em>and the aggravated murder was not committed during the commission, attempted commission, or flight immediately after the commission or attempted commission of the offense to which the victim was a witness</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">(Emphasis added.) Osie\u2019s principal argument here is that unless a formal criminal proceeding has actually commenced, a victim cannot have been killed to prevent his or her testimony \u201cin any criminal proceeding\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2929.04(A)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">{\u00b6 192} Osie argues that since no formal criminal charges had been filed against anyone with regard to the alleged thefts from UCU, there was no \u201ccriminal proceeding.\u201d And because there was no criminal proceeding, Osie contends, R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) could not apply to the murder of Williams, even though that murder was committed for the purpose of preventing Williams from complaining to law-enforcement authorities about the alleged thefts.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">{\u00b6 193} As Osie recognizes, we have squarely held just the opposite. In <em>State v. </em>Conway, 109 Ohio St.3d 412, 2006-Ohio-2815, 848 N.E.2d 810, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-13\">R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) does not require that a criminal action be pending when the defendant kills the victim-witness. Indeed, we have previously upheld application of the witness-murder specification in situations where no criminal proceeding had been initiated at the time the victim was murdered. * * * The plain language of the statute requires only (1) that the victim was a witness to an offense and (2) that the purpose of killing the victim was to prevent the victim from testifying in a criminal proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number><em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 55. However, Osie urges us to reexamine <em>Conway </em>in light of our later decision in <em>State v. Malone, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 244, 2009-Ohio-310, 903 N.E.2d 614, in which we construed a different statute that defines a different offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">{\u00b6 194} <em>Malone </em>holds that \u201ca conviction for intimidation of a witness under R.C. 2921.04(B) is not sustainable when the intimidation occurred after the criminal act but prior to any proceedings flowing from the criminal act in a court of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">{\u00b6 195} We cannot agree with Osie that <em>Malone </em>has any application to this case. Former R.C. 2921.04(B), the witness-intimidation statute construed in <em>Malone, </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">No person, knowingly and by force or unlawful threat of harm to any person or property, shall attempt to influence, intimidate, or hinder the victim of a crime in the filing or prosecution of criminal charges or an attorney or <em>mtness involved in a criminal action or proceeding </em>in the discharge of the duties of the attorney or witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">(Emphasis added.) 146 Ohio Laws, Part I, 528. The defendant in <em>Malone </em>was prosecuted under the provision covering threats to a \u201cwitness involved in a criminal action or proceeding.\u201d Therefore, \u201c[t]he question [was] whether [the witness] was \u2018involved in a criminal action or proceeding\u2019 at the time the threat was made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">{\u00b6 196} We relied on the specific language of R.C. 2921.04(B) to support our holding in <em>Malone. </em>Crucial to our construction of \u201ccriminal action or proceeding\u201d in that case was the statute\u2019s requirement that the witness be \u201cinvolved in\u201d such an action or proceeding. R.C. 2921.04(B) \u201crequires a witness\u2019s <em>involvement </em>in a criminal action or proceeding, not his or her potential involvement.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id., </em>121 Ohio St.3d 244, 2009-Ohio-310, 903 N.E.2d 614, at \u00b6 21. \u201cThe statute simply does not apply to witnesses or attorneys who <em>might </em>become involved in a criminal action or proceeding. It applies only to witnesses and attorneys who <em>are involved </em>in a criminal action or proceeding.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">{\u00b6 197} <em>Malone\u2019s </em>construction of R.C. 2921.04(B) provides no basis for overruling <em>Conway\u2019s </em>construction of R.C. 2929.04(A)(8). Unlike R.C. 2921.04(B), R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) is not limited to a witness who is \u201cinvolved in\u201d a criminal proceeding. Rather, R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) speaks of \u201ca witness to an offense who was purposely killed to <em>prevent </em>the victim\u2019s testimony in <em>any </em>criminal proceeding.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The language \u201cto prevent\u201d indicates that the defendant\u2019s motive is to affect a future proceeding. Moreover, R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) uses the broad, inclusive term \u201cany\u201d criminal proceeding. Consequently, a murder com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>mitted for the purpose of preventing the victim\u2019s testimony in a future or potential criminal proceeding is well within the statute\u2019s reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">{\u00b6 198} Osie further contends that even if we reject his proposed reinterpretation of the R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) witness-murder specification, the evidence supporting that specification was still insufficient to convict him of it. He claims: \u201cThere is simply no evidence that Osie intended to kill Williams to prevent his testimony at a later trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">{\u00b6 199} But the term \u201ctestimony in any criminal proceeding\u201d is not limited to <em>trial </em>testimony. In <em>State v. Filiaggi, </em>86 Ohio St.3d 230, 248, 714 N.E.2d 867 (1999), we interpreted the term \u201ctestimony in any criminal proceeding\u201d to include the filing of a complaint accusing another of a criminal offense. <em>See also State v. Turner, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 331, 2005-Ohio-1938, 826 N.E.2d 266, \u00b6 53-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">{\u00b6 200} Nicholas Wiskur testified that in a phone conversation on February 13, Williams told Osie that he intended to file charges with respect to the missing money. Wiskur further testified that the conversation became heated on both sides, indicating that Osie was angry with Williams. Osie admitted in his confession that he went to Williams\u2019s house to discuss the matter with him. Osie told the Butler County detectives that Williams had said that he was going to press charges against Patterson for stealing from him. Additionally, he told his cellmate that Williams had expressed his intention to press charges against Osie himself. These statements by Williams precipitated the quarrel that ended with Osie stabbing Williams to death. From this evidence, the trier of fact could reasonably infer that when Osie stabbed Williams, he did so with the purpose of preventing Williams from filing charges against Osie and/or Patterson.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">{\u00b6 201} Osie contends that Williams\u2019s murder stemmed from \u201can argument between the two men that got out of hand.\u201d But the very subject of that argument was Williams\u2019s intention to file charges. That hardly precludes the inference that Osie\u2019s purpose in stabbing Williams was to keep him from filing charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">{\u00b6 202} Osie\u2019s texts to Patterson corroborate his purpose of preventing Williams from filing charges against Patterson. At 3:07 a.m., Osie texted Patterson: \u201cBaby doll your dirt is ready to be over.\u201d At 4:24 a.m., he texted her: \u201cJob finished.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">{\u00b6 203} The state\u2019s evidence was legally sufficient to prove Osie\u2019s guilt of the R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) specification. We overrule Osie\u2019s third proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>Robbery-Murder Specification</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">{\u00b6 204} In his 11th proposition of law, Osie argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove the R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) felony-murder specification predicated on aggravated robbery. According to Osie, the state failed to prove that an aggravated robbery took place, because the trial court found in its sentencing opinion that the theft of Williams\u2019s property was an afterthought.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">{\u00b6 205} Because aggravated robbery requires that the defendant inflict serious physical harm \u201cin * * * committing a theft offense,\u201d R.C. 2911.01(A)(3), Osie contends that the intent to steal must coincide with the infliction of physical harm on the victim. According to Osie, physical harm inflicted before the formation of an intent to commit theft does not elevate a subsequent theft into an aggravated robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">{\u00b6 206} However, in <em>State v. Smith, </em>61 Ohio St.3d 284, 574 N.E.2d 510 (1991), we rejected a similar argument under an earlier version of R.C. 2911.01. In <em>Smith, </em>the defendant argued that \u201cthe evidence fails to establish that his intent to take [the victim\u2019s] property or the actual taking of the property coincided with his threat or use of force and hence he is not guilty of aggravated robbery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 290. We rejected this argument and held that \u201cthe victim of a robbery, killed just prior to the robber\u2019s carrying off her property, is nonetheless the victim of an aggravated robbery.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">{\u00b6 207} Osie also argues that he is not guilty of the aggravated-robbery death specification under R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), because the murder was not committed \u201cwhile\u201d committing a robbery or fleeing afterward. But it is well settled that the R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) specification does not require that the killing occur at the same instant as the underlying felony, that the killing be caused by the underlying felony, <em>State v. Cooey, </em>46 Ohio St.3d 20, 23, 544 N.E.2d 895 (1989), or that the intent to commit the underlying felony precede the murder, <em>State v. Williams, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 569, 660 N.E.2d 724 (1996), paragraph one of the syllabus. All that is required is that the killing must be directly associated with the underlying felony as part of one continuous occurrence. <em>State v. Cooper, 52 </em>Ohio St.2d 163, 179-180, 370 N.E.2d 725 (1977). Accordingly, we overrule Osie\u2019s 11th proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">D. Trial Panel\u2019s Sentencing Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">{\u00b6 208} In his fifth proposition of law, Osie contends that the three-judge panel\u2019s sentencing opinion is flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>{\u00b6 209} First, he reiterates his claim that the panel should have merged the burglary-murder and witness-murder specifications. As discussed above in relation to Osie\u2019s fourth proposition, this claim has merit. However, it can be corrected by this court\u2019s independent sentence review.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">{\u00b6 210} Second, he claims that the trial court failed to explain why the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors. \u201cThis claim lacks merit because the opinion contains extensive discussion of the aggravating circumstances and the mitigating factors.\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 404, 2008-Ohio-2, 880 N.E.2d 31, \u00b6 360. The opinion thoroughly discusses each aggravating circumstance and mitigating factor and explains why the court assigned each one the weight it did. Therefore, \u201cthe opinion as a whole adequately explains\u201d why the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors. <em>State v. Hale, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 118, 2008-Ohio-3426, 892 N.E.2d 864, \u00b6 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">{\u00b6 211} Third, Osie argues that the trial court \u201cimproperly diminished\u201d his mitigating evidence \u2014 specifically, his drug use on the day before the killing \u2014 by dismissing it as voluntary. But we have repeatedly stated that \u201c[vjoluntary intoxication generally deserves little weight as a mitigating factor.\u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 210, 2006-Ohio-6404, 858 N.E.2d 1144, \u00b6 305. In any event, the \u201cassessment and weight to be given mitigating evidence are matters for the trial court\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>State v. Lott, </em>51 Ohio St.3d 160, 171, 555 N.E.2d 293 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">{\u00b6 212} Finally, Osie argues that the trial court gave excessive weight to the witness-murder specification, turning it into a \u201c \u2018super\u2019 aggravating circumstance\u201d that carries what amounts to an automatic death sentence. The panel wrote that the witness-murder specification was the \u201cmost compelling\u201d because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">[i]t represents a threat, an attack, not only upon the victim, but upon the criminal justice system itself. Defendant silenced Mr. Williams to subvert justice, to prevent Mr. Williams from lawfully seeking justice and redress in the Courts of this State. This specification the panel gives its most weight, great weight.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">We have similarly observed: \u201cMurdering a witness to prevent his or her testimony strikes at the heart of the criminal justice system.\u201d <em>State v. Keene, </em>81 Ohio St.3d 646, 671, 693 N.E.2d 246 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">{\u00b6 213} In <em>State v. Jones, </em>91 Ohio St.3d 335, 744 N.E.2d 1163 (2001), we rejected a similar argument: that a trial court had elevated the R.C. 2929.04(A)(6) specification for murder of a law-enforcement officer into a super-aggravating circumstance that no mitigation could equal or outweigh. In <em>Jones, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>the trial court stated that killing a police officer who was trying to apprehend a felon \u201cstrikes at the very heart of the justice system.\u201d We observed: \u201cThe trial court\u2019s statement regarding the severity of killing a police officer was not improper. Courts are certainly entitled to consider the gravity of the aggravating circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">{\u00b6 214} No legal errors appear in the sentencing opinion. \u201cMoreover, our independent review of the sentence will cure any flaws in the trial court\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>State v. Lang, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 512, 2011-Ohio-4215, 954 N.E.2d 596, \u00b6 298. Osie\u2019s fifth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">VII. Ineffective Assistance</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">{\u00b6 215} In his 12th proposition of law, Osie claims that he received ineffective assistance from his trial counsel. To establish ineffective assistance, Osie must show (1) deficient performance by counsel, i.e., performance that fell below an objective standard of reasonable representation, and (2) prejudice, i.e., a reasonable probability that but for counsel\u2019s errors, the proceeding\u2019s result would have been different. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. at 687-688 and 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>State v. Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989), paragraphs two and three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">{\u00b6 216} Osie divides his ineffective-assistance claims into three categories: those involving the pretrial stage of proceedings, those involving the trial itself, and those involving the penalty phase. We note that Osie presents these claims in almost completely conclusory terms, with little or no specific explanation of why trial counsel\u2019s acts and omissions fall below an objective standard of reasonable representation and how they were prejudicial. With that preliminary observation, we turn to Osie\u2019s individual claims of ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Pretrial</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">{\u00b6 217} The defense filed a motion to appropriate funds for an investigator, which the trial court granted. Osie asserts that defense counsel nonetheless failed to hire an investigator. However, Osie does not explain what factual basis, if any, he has for this assertion. He points to nothing in the record to demonstrate that defense counsel failed to hire an investigator. In fact, defense counsel referred during trial to an investigator, in such a way as to imply that they had hired one. When the defense complained to the trial court about receiving late disclosure of Donald Simpson\u2019s felony record, defense co-counsel said that had counsel known about Simpson\u2019s record sooner, \u201cwe certainly would have given the name or * * * information to the private investigator to investigate any further * * Osie\u2019s claim lacks support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">{\u00b6 218} Osie contends that the defense should have filed a motion to suppress the \u201cattorney work product\u201d seized from Osie\u2019s cell. As discussed in reference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Osie\u2019s seventh proposition of law, the only alleged work product admitted into evidence at trial was State\u2019s Exhibit 64, Osie\u2019s letters to Patterson, which were neither confidential nor \u201cattorney work product.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">{\u00b6 219} Osie contends that the defense should have objected to the admission of Osie\u2019s confession on the grounds that the police did not record the entire interview. This claim fails because, as discussed in relation to Osie\u2019s 18th proposition of law, it rests on a novel theory unsupported by existing Ohio law. \u201cIt is not ineffective assistance for a trial lawyer to maneuver within the existing law, declining to present untested * * * legal theories.\u201d <em>State v. McNeill, </em>83 Ohio St.3d 438, 449, 700 N.E.2d 596 (1998). <em>See also Ledbetter v. Commr. of Corr., </em>275 Conn. 451, 461-462, 880 A.2d 160 (2005) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">{\u00b6 220} Osie contends that the defense should have requested a competency evaluation. The test for competence to stand trial is whether \u201cthe defendant is incapable of understanding the nature and objective of the proceedings against the defendant or of assisting in the defendant\u2019s defense.\u201d R.C. 2945.37(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">{\u00b6 221} Osie contends that an evaluation was called for because he \u201cdemonstrated a disjointed understanding of the proceedings and discovery revealed unhealthy personal relationships.\u201d But Osie supports his claim of \u201cdisjointed understanding\u201d only by unexplained citations to the transcript. Osie does not explain how these citations demonstrate that he was unable to understand the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">{\u00b6 222} Osie supports his claim of \u201cunhealthy personal relationships\u201d by referring to State\u2019s Exhibit 64, his letters to Patterson. The letters arguably do exhibit unhealthy relationships, but nothing in them suggests that Osie lacked the ability to understand the proceedings or assist in his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">{\u00b6 223} Osie complains that defense counsel \u201c[flailed to retain a proper mitigation specialist.\u201d But hiring a mitigation specialist is not a requirement of effective assistance. <em>State v. McGuire, </em>80 Ohio St.3d 390, 399, 686 N.E.2d 1112 (1997). Nor does Osie explain why Pagan, whose services Osie\u2019s defense counsel had used before, was not a \u201cproper mitigation specialist.\u201d Therefore, he fails to demonstrate either deficient performance or prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">{\u00b6 224} Osie contends that defense counsel \u201c[flailed to ensure that the three-judge panel was created in accordance with R.C. \u00a7 2945.06.\u201d This claim fails because, as discussed with regard to Osie\u2019s ninth proposition of law, the panel was created in accordance with R.C. 2945.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">{\u00b6 225} Osie contends that defense counsel \u201c[flailed to ensure that Osie had a proper understanding of the jury waiver and its subsequent consequences.\u201d To the contrary, as discussed in connection with Osie\u2019s tenth proposition, the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>demonstrates that Osie did have a sufficient understanding of his right to a jury-trial to waive it.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">{\u00b6 226} Osie contends that defense counsel should have asked the trial court to seal witness statements for appellate review. He cites no authority for the proposition that such an omission constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, he offers no analysis to explain why the statements should have been sealed or how the claimed omission meets the <em>Strickland </em>criteria of deficient performance and prejudice. Hence, he fails to carry his burden of showing ineffective assistance with respect to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">{\u00b6 227} Osie contends that his counsel failed to object to numerous instances of prosecutorial misconduct. Osie cross-references his 14th proposition of law, which challenges two instances of alleged misconduct in the guilt phase: delayed disclosure of alleged <em>Brady </em>material and the seizure and admission of attorney work product. But, as discussed earlier in connection with Osie\u2019s seventh proposition, Osie\u2019s letters to Patterson were not shown to be attorney work product. And, as discussed earlier in connection with Osie\u2019s eighth proposition, he has made no showing that the delayed disclosure of the alleged <em>Brady </em>material was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Mitigation</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">{\u00b6 228} Defense counsel\u2019s mitigation evidence consisted of testimony by Osie\u2019s family (his mother, brother, and son) and two longtime friends, who testified about his childhood, his reaction to his father\u2019s death, and his drug habit. Osie contends that counsel should have conducted a more thorough investigation and presented more evidence about Osie\u2019s \u201cbackground, education, mental and emotional stability [and] family relations,\u201d as well as expert testimony to explain the effects of cocaine on Osie\u2019s behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">{\u00b6 229} However, the record before us does not show what investigations Osie\u2019s counsel did or did not conduct. Nor does it show what further information counsel could have introduced about Osie\u2019s background, education, stability, or family relations. Osie cannot show either deficient performance or prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">{\u00b6 230} Osie further contends that his counsel failed to ensure that Osie was afforded his right to allocution. However, as we explain in discussing Osie\u2019s first proposition of law, Osie was in fact permitted to make a statement to the trial court before finally being sentenced. He therefore received all that Crim.R. 32(A)(1) entitled him to. Moreover, Osie makes no attempt to show that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the sentencing would have been otherwise \u2014 i.e., that he would have avoided a death sentence \u2014 had counsel taken action to secure Osie\u2019s right to allocution.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>{\u00b6 231} Finally, Osie claims that his counsel failed to object to \u201cnumerous instances\u201d of penalty-phase prosecutorial misconduct. Again, Osie cross-references his 14th proposition of law, which identifies three instances of claimed misconduct in the penalty-phase closing argument. As discussed in the section dealing with that proposition, none of these claims have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">{\u00b6 232} Osie fails to show how any of his ineffective-assistance claims fulfill the <em>Strickland </em>criteria of deficient performance and prejudice. Accordingly, his 12th proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">VIII. Settled Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">A. Constitutionality of Felony-Murder Specification</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">{\u00b6 233} In his 13th proposition of law, Osie claims that the felony-murder specification defined in R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) unconstitutionally fails to narrow the class of offenders sentenced to death, because it duplicates the elements of felony-murder, R.C. 2929.03(B). We have repeatedly rejected such claims. <em>See, e.g., State v. Fry, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 163, 2010-Ohio-1017, 926 N.E.2d 1239, \u00b6 185; <em>State v. Henderson, </em>39 Ohio St.3d 24, 28-29, 528 N.E.2d 1237 (1988). <em>See also Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 392, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000), fn. 16, citing <em>Lowenfield v. Phelps, </em>484 U.S. 231, 108 S.Ct. 546, 98 L.Ed.2d 568 (1988). Osie\u2019s 13th proposition is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">B. Constitutionality of Death Penalty</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">{\u00b6 234} In his 19th proposition of law, Osie claims that the death penalty and Ohio\u2019s statutory provisions for its administration are unconstitutional and violate international law. We have repeatedly rejected each of Osie\u2019s claims, and we overrule them summarily today. <em>See generally State v. Spisak, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 80, 82, 521 N.E.2d 800 (1988) (summarily overruling propositions of law raising long-settled legal arguments); <em>State v. Poindexter, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 1, 520 N.E.2d 568, (1988), syllabus (approving summary disposition of settled issues in capital cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">{\u00b6235} Osie contends that Ohio\u2019s death-penalty scheme is arbitrary and administered in a racially discriminatory manner. We have rejected both arguments. <em>See Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 168-169, 473 N.E.2d 264; <em>State v. Mink, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 350, 2004-Ohio-1580, 805 N.E.2d 1064, \u00b6 103 (Ohio\u2019s statutory scheme is not racially discriminatory), citing <em>State v. Steffen, </em>31 Ohio St.3d 111, 124-125, 509 N.E.2d 383 (1987); <em>State v. Zuern, </em>32 Ohio St.3d 56, 64-66, 512 N.E.2d 585 (1987) (same); <em>State v. Short, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 360, 2011-Ohio-3641, 952 N.E.2d 1121, \u00b6 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">{\u00b6 236} Osie contends that Ohio\u2019s death-penalty procedures are unreliable. This claim has been rejected. <em>See Jenkins </em>at 172-173; <em>State v. Stumpf, </em>32 Ohio St.3d 95, 104, 512 N.E.2d 598 (1987). He further argues that Ohio\u2019s statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>unconstitutionally fail to provide individualized sentencing because they require proof of aggravating circumstances in the guilt phase. This claim, too, has been rejected. <em>See Henderson, </em>39 Ohio St.3d at 28-29, 528 N.E.2d 1237; <em>Jenkins </em>at 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">{\u00b6 237} Osie argues that Ohio\u2019s death-penalty scheme impermissibly burdens a capital defendant\u2019s right to a jury trial. This claim lacks merit. <em>See State v. Buell, </em>22 Ohio St.3d 124, 138, 489 N.E.2d 795 (1986), citing <em>State v. Nabozny, </em>54 Ohio St.2d 195, 375 N.E.2d 784 (1978), paragraph one of the syllabus, <em>overruled on other grounds, </em>439 U.S. 811, 99 S.Ct. 70, 58 L.Ed.2d 103 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">{\u00b6238} Osie argues that R.C. 2929.03(D)(1) is unconstitutional because it provides that if the defendant requests a presentence investigation or a court-ordered mental evaluation, the reports generated thereby must be provided to the jury or the panel. We have rejected this argument. <em>See State v. Esparza, </em>39 Ohio St.3d 8, 10, 529 N.E.2d 192 (1988); <em>Buell </em>at 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">{\u00b6 239} Osie again argues that R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) is unconstitutional because it repeats the definition of felony-murder set forth in R.C. 2903.01(B). This claim mirrors Osie\u2019s 13th proposition of law, which we have already rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">{\u00b6 240} Osie argues that R.C. 2929.03(D)(1) and 2929.04 are unconstitutionally vague because they give the sentencer unfettered discretion to weigh the nature and circumstances of the offense as an aggravating circumstance. Osie\u2019s claim is incorrect. <em>See State v. McNeill, </em>83 Ohio St.3d at 453, 700 N.E.2d 596, citing <em>Tuilaepa v. California, </em>512 U.S. 967, 973-980, 114 S.Ct. 2630, 129 L.Ed.2d 750 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">{\u00b6 241} Osie argues that Ohio\u2019s death-penalty scheme provides constitutionally inadequate appellate review of the proportionality and appropriateness of the death sentence. We reject this claim. <em>See Steffen, </em>31 Ohio St.3d 111, 509 N.E.2d 383, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State v. LaMar, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">{\u00b6 242} Osie contends that the death penalty violates various aspects of international law. He contends that Ohio imposes the death penalty in a racially discriminatory manner and thereby violates the Convention on Racial Discrimination. We rejected that claim in <em>Short, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 360, 2011-Ohio-3641, 952 N.E.2d 1121, \u00b6 137. Osie\u2019s other international-law claims were also rejected in <em>Short. Id. </em>at \u00b6 138 (rejecting claims under International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, United Nations Convention against Torture, and customary international law).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">{\u00b6 243} Osie\u2019s 19th proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>IX. Independent Sentence Review</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">{\u00b6244} Under R.C. 2929.05(A), this court must independently review Osie\u2019s death sentence. We may affirm a death sentence \u201conly if * * * persuaded from the record that the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing outweigh the mitigating factors present in the case and that the sentence of death is the appropriate sentence in the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We must also determine whether the evidence supports the panel\u2019s finding of aggravating circumstances and whether the death sentence is proportionate to those imposed in similar cases. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">{\u00b6 245} In his sixth proposition of law, Osie contends that on independent review, we should find that the aggravating circumstances do not outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Aggravating Circumstances</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">{\u00b6 246} Osie was convicted of three aggravating circumstances: witness-murder, R.C. 2929.04(A)(8), felony-murder predicated on aggravated burglary, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), and felony-murder predicated on aggravated robbery, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). As discussed in connection with Osie\u2019s fourth proposition of law, the aggravated-burglary specification and the witness-murder specification merge, leaving only two specifications. We find that the evidence supports Osie\u2019s convictions of the aggravated-robbery and witness-murder specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Mitigating Factors: History, Character, and Background</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">{\u00b6 247} Osie was 48 years old in 2010, when the trial took place. He grew up in a two-parent family with four siblings in the Camp Washington neighborhood of Cincinnati. Camp Washington was a former industrial area. According to some of Osie\u2019s mitigation witnesses, it had become a \u201ctough\u201d or \u201cvery bad\u201d neighborhood by the 1960s, when Osie was growing up there.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Many of its children lacked two parents, failed to finish school, or got into trouble with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">{\u00b6 248} Despite the surroundings, it appears that Osie had a good upbringing. His younger brother Kenneth testified that \u201c[t]here was a lot of trouble\u201d in the neighborhood when they were growing up there, but \u201cwe [the Osie children] stayed away from that,\u201d thanks to having two strict and caring parents who instilled good values in their children. Family friend Paul Rudemiller also testified that Osie had stayed out of trouble as a youth; unlike many other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>children in the neighborhood, Osie \u201cled a life that kept him away from the court system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">{\u00b6 249} Jim Egbert had been the pastor of a church in Camp Washington for 28 years. His was a \u201cmission church\u201d engaged in \u201ccommunity ministry\u201d and \u201coutreach.\u201d He testified that the entire Osie family had volunteered in the church\u2019s community programs, even though they did not belong to Egbert\u2019s church. Osie had been a \u201cwilling participant,\u201d although Egbert was unable to recall any specific activities that Osie had participated in.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">{\u00b6 250} Osie played softball, baseball, basketball, and football and participated in the Cub Scouts. He organized and raised money for an adult softball team and volunteered for a summertime neighborhood-cleanup program. After graduating from high school, he took a job in a meatpacking plant, married, and had two children. He and his wife were separated for several years, but reunited when Osie\u2019s son Brian was in the eighth grade.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">{\u00b6 251} Paul Rudemiller was the longtime president and executive director of the Camp Washington Community Board, Inc., a nonprofit tax-exempt corporation established for community organizing and neighborhood improvement. He was a friend of Osie\u2019s mother, who was \u201csecretary and/or treasurer\u201d of the Camp Washington Community Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">{\u00b6 252} Rudemiller described Osie as \u201ca decent kid\u201d who graduated from high school, went to church, got a job, and got married. He believed that Osie \u201chas many good parts\u201d based on \u201cthe good things he has done in the 50 years [Rudemiller has] known him.\u201d Ten to 15 years earlier, when Osie separated from his wife, the community board had rented an apartment to him. \u201c[H]e was a good tenant and probably one of the cleanest tenants we had,\u201d Rudemiller testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">{\u00b6 253} Rudemiller knew that Osie drank and testified that Osie had had \u201cone or two offenses involving excessive drinking,\u201d but he had never known Osie to have a drug problem. Rudemiller had last seen Osie at the funeral of Osie\u2019s father, which took place in 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">{\u00b6 254} Osie\u2019s 22-year-old son, Brian, was a college student. He testified that Osie had been an attentive parent. During Osie\u2019s first separation from his wife, Osie saw Brian every other weekend. When Brian was in the eighth grade, Osie and his wife reunited. In high school, Brian played baseball, and Osie attended his games regularly and coached him in a summer league.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">{\u00b6 255} In 2006, Osie finally broke up with his wife, and Brian testified that Osie\u2019s behavior changed markedly after that. Osie began staying out all night, using drugs, and stealing from his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>{\u00b6 256} Osie\u2019s mother, Patricia, testified that Osie was a very well-behaved child, raised to be a \u201cgood, decent\u201d person. As an adult, Osie used to visit his mother once a week. However, around 2007,,Patricia began to notice changes in Osie. He lost his job around this time. He visited less often; when he did visit, he wanted to borrow money, something he had not done when employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">{\u00b6 257} Sometime in 2008 or 2009, Osie called his mother to ask for money to make a payment on his truck. Osie, his mother, and someone she identified only as \u201cthe lady from the truck company\u201d were on a three-way conference call, during which Osie\u2019s mother revealed her checking-account number. After this happened, Patricia found that someone was withdrawing money from her account without her knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">{\u00b6 258} Nevertheless, Patricia testified, she still loved her son, and it was important to her to maintain contact with him. She testified that she visited Osie every two weeks at the jail and intended to visit him in prison if he received a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Sentence Evaluation</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">{\u00b6 259} Based upon the foregoing evidence, and upon the record of the guilt phase, Osie argues that the following mitigating factors exist:</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">{\u00b6 260} 1. Over most of his lifetime, he had been a productive member of society and an asset to his family and community. The evidence supports the existence of this factor. Osie was gainfully employed from his high school graduation until he lost his job in 2007. Along with his family, he took part to some degree in efforts to improve the Camp Washington neighborhood. His son Brian testified that he was a loving and involved father. These matters are all entitled to some weight in mitigation. <em>See State v. Drummond, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.2d 1038, \u00b6 263 (testimony that defendant was a loving, supportive father entitled to weight); <em>State v. Fox, </em>69 Ohio St.3d 183, 194, 631 N.E.2d 124 (1994) (steady employment since high school and favorable community reputation entitled to weight).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">{\u00b6 261} 2. He \u201csuffered a number of setbacks,\u201d particularly his father\u2019s death and his divorce, that caused his behavior to change. This is entitled to some weight as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">{\u00b6 262} 3. He retains the love and support of his family. This is also entitled to some weight. <em>See, e.g., State v. Jones, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 10, 2012-Ohio-5677, 984 N.E.2d 948, \u00b6 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">{\u00b6 263} 4. He had a drug habit, and alcohol and cocaine played a role in the murder. But \u201c[voluntary intoxication is at most a weak mitigating factor, entitled to little weight.\u201d <em>Fitzpatrick, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 321, 2004-Ohio-3167, 810 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>N.E.2d 927, \u00b6 111 (citing cases); <em>see also Turner, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 331, 2005-Ohio-1938, 826 N.E.2d 266, \u00b6 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">{\u00b6 264} 5. He lacks a significant history of criminal convictions and delinquency adjudications. <em>See </em>R.C. 2929.04(B)(5). However, the defense has the burden of establishing the existence of mitigating factors, including the (B)(5) factor, and Osie did not place his criminal record, or lack thereof, in evidence. <em>See Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 171, 473 N.E.2d 264. The only evidence on that subject came from Paul Rudemiller, who testified that Osie \u201chad one or two offenses involving excessive drinking.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">{\u00b6 265} 6. He confessed and cooperated with the police after his arrest. \u201cA defendant\u2019s confession and cooperation with law enforcement are mitigating factors.\u201d <em>State v. Bethel, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 416, 2006-Ohio-4853, 854 N.E.2d 150, \u00b6 191. But the mitigating value of this factor is reduced by the fact that Osie repeatedly lied to the detectives questioning him. <em>See State v. Perez, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 122, 2009-Ohio-6179, 920 N.E.2d 104, \u00b6 247 (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">{\u00b6 266} 7. His infatuation with Patterson and his \u201cmisplaced\u201d desire to protect her played a significant role in the murder.

The forged check was made out to him, and he cashed it. Moreover, according to the account of the murder Osie gave to his cellmate Simpson, the encounter between Osie and his victim \u201cgot heated\u201d only when Williams threatened to file charges against Osie. It was at that point that Osie assaulted Williams. We find this factor entitled to little weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">{\u00b6 268} 8. The murder \u201cwas the result of an argument that got out of control.\u201d According to Osie\u2019s confession and his statement to Simpson, he attacked Williams after they began to quarrel. However, Osie\u2019s repeated efforts to falsely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>shift blame to Williams throughout his confession cast doubt upon this claim, and we afford it little weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">{\u00b6 269} Our independent review of the record discloses no further mitigating factors, either in the nature and circumstances of the offense or in the history, character, and background of the offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">{\u00b6 270} Having independently weighed the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors, we find that the two aggravating circumstances of robbery-murder and witness-murder outweigh the mitigating factors present in this case beyond a reasonable doubt. \u201cIn particular, the R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) witness-murder specification is entitled to great weight, for it \u2018strikes at the heart of the criminal justice system.\u2019 \u201d <em>Turner, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 331, 2005-Ohio-1938, 826 N.E.2d 266, \u00b6 100, quoting <em>State v.

Simmons, </em>543 U.S. 551, 568-569, 125 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005). Ohio\u2019s statute reflects this principle by allowing a death sentence only if the state proves beyond a reasonable doubt all elements of a specification charging an aggravating circumstance. R.C. 2929.04(A) sets forth ten categories of aggravating circumstances that, if proven beyond a reasonable doubt, make an offender eligible for the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">{\u00b6 275} One of the categories is R.C. 2929.04(A)(8), defining the witness-murder specification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">The victim of the aggravated murder was a witness to an offense who was purposely killed <em>to prevent the victim\u2019s testimony in any criminal proceeding </em>and the aggravated murder was not committed during the commission, attempted commission, or flight immediately after the commission or attempted commission of the offense to which the victim was a witness, or the victim of the aggravated murder was a witness to an offense and was purposely killed in retaliation for the victim\u2019s testimony in any criminal proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">{\u00b6 276} I cannot find that this specification was proven beyond a reasonable doubt in the case before us. The cases that the majority cites to uphold Osie\u2019s R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) conviction were cases decided before <em>State v. Malone, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 244, 2009-Ohio-310, 903 N.E.2d 614. In <em>Malone, </em>we interpreted the meaning of the statutory phrase \u201ca criminal action or proceeding\u201d as that term was used in a former version of the witness-intimidation statute, R.C. 2901.04(B). 146 Ohio Laws, Part I, 528. Although the witness-murder specification is in a different statute, the same analysis should be used here to understand the meaning of the words \u201ccriminal proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\"><em>The Analysis in </em>State v. Malone</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">{\u00b6 277} Malone was charged with a violation of former R.C. 2921.04(B) as a result of making threats to a woman who had witnessed his rape of another woman. <em>Malone </em>did not turn on whether the victim intended to file a complaint and was prevented from filing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">{\u00b6 278} Former R.C. 2921.04(B) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-11\">No person, knowingly and by force or by unlawful threat of harm to any person or property, shall attempt to influence, intimidate, or hinder the victim of a crime in the filing or prosecution of criminal charges or an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>attorney or <em>witness involved in a criminal action or proceeding </em>in the discharge of the duties of the attorney or witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">{\u00b6 279} We recognized a conflict on the following certified question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">Is a conviction for intimidation of a witness under R.C. 2921.04(B), which requires the witness to be involved in a criminal action or proceeding, sustainable where the intimidation occurred after the criminal act but prior to any police investigation of the criminal act, and thus, also prior to any proceedings flowing from the criminal act in a court of justice?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-7\"><em>State v. Malone, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 1472, 2008-Ohio-153, 879 N.E.2d 781. We held that such a conviction was not sustainable. 121 Ohio St.3d 244, 2009-Ohio-310, 903 N.E.2d 614, at \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">{\u00b6 280} We began our analysis in <em>Malone </em>by citing the rule of lenity. R.C. 2901.04(A) states that \u201csections of the Revised Code defining offenses or penalties shall be strictly construed against the state, and liberally construed in favor of the accused.\u201d Because the term \u201ccriminal action or proceeding\u201d was undefined in the statute, we interpreted the term to mean \u201ca formal process involving a court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 18. We defined the term \u201cproceeding\u201d as \u201c \u2018the \u201c[rjegular and orderly progress in form of law, including all possible steps in an action from its commencement to the execution of judgment.\u201d <em>[Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1204 (6th Ed.Rev.1990)].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 16, quoting <em>State ex rel. Steckman v. Jackson, </em>70 Ohio St.3d 420, 432, 639 N.E.2d 83 (1994). We concluded that because Malone made his threat before a criminal complaint had been made, a liberal construction in his favor meant that the statute could not apply. The <em>Malone </em>holding was reaffirmed in <em>State v. Davis, </em>132 Ohio St.3d 25, 2012-Ohio-1654, 968 N.E.2d 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">{\u00b6 281} We recently said in <em>State v. Maxwell, </em>139 Ohio St.3d 12, 2014-Ohio-1019, 9 N.E.3d 930, \u00b6 162:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-10\">R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) does not require that a criminal action be pending when the defendant kills the witness. Indeed, a defendant can be charged with the witness-murder specification in situations in which no criminal proceeding has been initiated at the time the victim was murdered. <em>State v. Conway, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 412, 2006-Ohio-2815, 848 N.E.2d 810, \u00b6 55. The statute requires only (1) that the victim was a witness to an offense and (2) that the purpose of killing the witness was to prevent the victim from testifying in a criminal proceeding. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number><em>Maxwell, </em>however, turned on the fact that the witness had given grand-jury testimony and was killed in retaliation. We did not analyze the import of the words \u201ccriminal proceeding\u201d in light of our discussions in <em>Malone </em>and <em>Davis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">{\u00b6 282} In this case, there was no evidence that Osie murdered Williams in retaliation for testimony Williams had already given, and thus, the question is whether Williams was a \u201cwitness to an offense who was purposely killed to prevent the victim\u2019s testimony in any criminal proceeding.\u201d The evidence showed beyond a reasonable doubt that Williams intended to press charges against both Osie and Patterson and that he was killed to prevent his filing a complaint with the police. Indeed, the majority opinion focuses on this point alone, stating that \u201c[t]o prove this specification, the state had to prove that Osie killed Williams for the purpose of preventing him from filing a criminal charge.\u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 121. That, however, is not what the statute says.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">{\u00b6 283} R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) does not mention that an offender must purposely kill to prevent either the filing of a complaint or the initiation of criminal charges, which the evidence shows was the motivation for Osie\u2019s actions. Instead, the specification applies when the offender prevents the witness from <em>testifying </em>in criminal proceedings. The General Assembly could have chosen to create a specification that included language similar to the witness-intimidation statute, which brings within its scope \u201chindering]\u201d the victim of a crime or delinquent act \u201cin the filing or prosecution of criminal charges.\u201d R.C. 2921.04(B)(1).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">{\u00b6 284} Osie was convicted of the R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) specification because he attempted to prevent Williams from going to the police to file a complaint. This is not proof of the specification within its stated terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">{\u00b6 285} I concur in the judgment insofar as it affirms Gregory Osie\u2019s convictions on Count One, murder, and Count Two, felony-murder, as well as on the aggravating circumstances of felony-murder in the commission of aggravated robbery and aggravated burglary under R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) for the latter offense. But I would vacate the conviction of the aggravating circumstance under R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) for that offense and remand this case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">French, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b348-6\">. It is noteworthy that after <em>Malone </em>was decided, the General Assembly enacted 2011 Sub.H.B. No. 20, effective June 4, 2012, that clarified the scope of the intimidation statute by amending subsection (B) and adding subsection (E):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">(B) No person, knowingly and by force or by unlawful threat of harm to any person or property or by unlawful threat to commit any offense or calumny against any person, shall attempt to influence, intimidate, or hinder any of the following persons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">(1) The victim of a crime or delinquent act in the filing or prosecution of criminal charges or a delinquent child action or proceeding;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">(2) A witness to a criminal or delinquent act by reason of the person being a witness to that act;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-10\">(3) An attorney by reason of the attorney\u2019s involvement in any criminal or delinquent child action or proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-12\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-13\">(E) As used in this section, \u201cwitness\u201d means any person who has or claims to have knowledge concerning a fact or facts concerning a criminal or delinquent act, <em>whether or not criminal or delinquent child charges are actually filed.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-14\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b349-7\">O\u2019Neill, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AW5\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">{\u00b6 286} In <em>State v. Kirkland, </em>140 Ohio St.3d 73, 2014-Ohio-1966, 15 N.E.3d 818, this court affirmed a death sentence despite its acknowledgment that the defendant\u2019s penalty-phase hearing was unfair, based on its independent review of the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 98 and \u00b6 141-168. I dissented, pointing out that the court\u2019s analysis and decision were in violation of <em>Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 609, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002). <em>See Kirkland </em>at \u00b6 201-204 (O\u2019Neill, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">{\u00b6 287} The court repeats that error today, holding that while the trial court in this case failed to merge \u201cduplicative [death] specifications,\u201d majority opinion at \u00b6 189, this court\u2019s independent sentence review can \u201ccure\u201d any error as part of our \u201cindependent sentence review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>I rejected this analysis in <em>Kirkland </em>and I reject it again. It is illogical and unsupported by the law. I do not believe that Osie\u2019s choice to have his case heard by a three-judge panel resolves the issue. If there is inarguable and prejudicial error in the imposition of a death sentence, it should be elementary that a new sentencing is required. We do not engage in post hoc justification of the result when reviewing prison sentences. <em>See State v. Whitfield, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 319, 2010-Ohio-2, 922 N.E.2d 182, paragraph two of the syllabus (\u201cUpon finding reversible error in the imposition of multiple punishments for allied offenses, a court of appeals <em>must reverse the judgment of conviction and remand for a new sentencing hearing </em>* * * \u201d [emphasis added]). This is a death sentence, and \u201cgood enough\u201d is unacceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">{\u00b6 288} At the bottom line, a sentence of death should never have been imposed in this case. While acknowledging Osie\u2019s contention that Williams\u2019s murder stemmed from an argument between the two men that got out of hand, the majority suggests that because the \u201csubject of that argument was Williams\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>intention to file charges,\u201d it was proper to adopt \u201cthe inference that Osie\u2019s purpose in stabbing Williams was to keep him from filing charges.\u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 201. It is true that the factfinder may rely upon an inference to conclude that sufficient evidence of an offense has been presented. <em>See State v. Jordan, </em>89 Ohio St.3d 488, 733 N.E.2d 601 (2000). But it is another thing altogether to conclude that the very same \u201cinference\u201d is also sufficient to justify the imposition of a death sentence. The majority makes a quantum leap in reaching its conclusion that the inference outweighs all of the mitigating evidence presented by the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. This record simply does not provide any support for that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">{\u00b6 289} The defendant\u2019s girlfriend was suspected of stealing approximately $18,000 from her employer, David Williams. She was the office manager at a struggling company and was thought to be using phony payroll checks to steal money. One of the checks for $375 was made out to the defendant, and he cashed it at a gas station in front of a video camera. The undisputed facts are that on the night of the murder, the defendant went to Williams\u2019s house to attempt to persuade him not to report the thefts to the police. The state\u2019s own jailhouse informant testified that the defendant had told him that prior to going to Williams\u2019s house, he got high on cocaine and that defendant only went to Williams\u2019s house to \u201ctalk [Williams] out of pressing charges.\u201d The conversation became heated, and Williams indicated that the police would investigate the $375 check. When questioned by the police, the defendant lied multiple times but ultimately confessed to killing Williams. According to the informant, Donald Simpson Jr.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">I guess it had turned into Greg trying to talk him out of pressing charges, and I \u2014 he had said the conversation had come up that he was going to press charges on Greg himself, because one of the checks had been wrote and cashed at a Marathon gas station there on Cincinnati-Dayton and Tylersville. It had been wrote to Greg himself, and I guess at that point, he said that the conversation had got heated and that he had punched Dave, and then it just happened that, I mean before he knew it, he had got the knife and stabbed him. He had stabbed him like four or five times in the chest, and that then when he was laying there, that he freaked out, and so he rushed down and took the knife and sliced his throat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">{\u00b6 290} The defendant clearly deserves severe punishment \u2014 he admits he killed another. But the question before the three-judge panel was whether the motive behind the murder was to silence his girlfriend\u2019s employer, who was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>threatening to go to the police over her embezzlement of company funds. There were only two witnesses to the fight that turned fatal: the decedent and the defendant. And before the state of Ohio, in the name of its citizens, can take another life, it must demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the motive to silence this witness was the driving force behind the fatal act. Other than the death; there is no direct evidence and precious little circumstantial evidence of that intent. Accordingly, I would hold as a matter of law that the state has failed in that endeavor. A reasonable interpretation of what happened here is that an ugly confrontation turned into a physical altercation that ended up with one person dying and another fleeing, and any basis for rejecting that interpretation can only be inferred from the killing itself. As a result, the same inference that provides the legal basis for convicting the defendant of aggravated murder also provides the basis for the specification making the defendant eligible for death. That is a legally insufficient process in a capital-murder case.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">{\u00b6 291} The undisputed evidence is that the defendant initially went to Williams\u2019s house to talk to him, not to kill him. To arrive at the majority\u2019s tortured conclusion, the specific purpose to kill a witness to prevent him from testifying about a crime that has not yet even been reported to the police must be inferred from circumstances surrounding the killing. Have we really arrived at the point where we are willing to execute someone based upon an inference? And are we now ready to simply ignore the perfectly reasonable contrary view of the offense that the killing simply stemmed from an argument where the defendant, high on cocaine, lost control of himself?</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">{\u00b6 292} And ultimately, even if the answer to those questions is \u201cyes,\u201d simple justice demands that a speculative finding of inferred specific purpose cannot, standing alone, outweigh the mitigation evidence presented by the defendant. The evidence is undisputed that the defendant was a good, productive, and law-abiding member of society for many years. He consistently worked, volunteered for the benefit of the community, and raised two adult sons. In his lifetime he has only one prior conviction, for OVI. His four siblings, his sons, and his mother all love him and want him to be part of their lives even if he\u2019s in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">{\u00b6 293} The roots of this crime stem from the virtually simultaneous collapse of the defendant\u2019s marriage and the death of his father. These two events sent the defendant into a downward spiral that led to abuse of alcohol and cocaine, embezzlement from his mother, and finally the horrible murder of which he stands convicted. The defendant made good decisions for 45 years, bad decisions for three years, and awful decisions for one night.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">{\u00b6 294} Given the undisputed evidence, our independent sentence review cannot support the conclusion that death, rather than life in prison with or without a chance of parole, is the appropriate sentence in this case. This is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>case of two men in a very contentious situation that got out of hand and that left one of them dead. In weighing mitigation versus aggravation, I am persuaded by the first 45 years of the defendant\u2019s life, during which he kept a job, raised a family, and put two kids through college. The defendant is not someone who kills his mother-in-law and slashes his two children\u2019s throats. <em>See State v. Mammone, </em>139 Ohio St.3d 467, 2014-Ohio-1942, 13 N.E.3d 1051. The defendant is not someone who rapes two teenagers and then sets their bodies on fire. <em>See State v. Kirkland, </em>140 Ohio St.3d 73, 2014-Ohio-1966, 15 N.E.3d 818. No, the defendant is a man who went down the wrong path, with a tragic ending for Mr. Williams and his survivors. Society gets no benefit from executing this defendant, and his crimes are not the type of offenses that can even arguably justify the imposition of the punishment of death. I accordingly dissent.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ano\">Michael T. Gmoser, Butler County Prosecuting Attorney, Michael A. Oster Jr., Chief, Appellate Division, and Lina N.
