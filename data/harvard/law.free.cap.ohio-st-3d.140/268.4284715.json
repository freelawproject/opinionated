We conclude that the employment-discrimination provisions in R.C. 4112.01(A)(2) and 4112.02(A) do not expressly impose civil liability on such employees, but instead impose vicarious liability on the political subdivision itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-15\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b432-16\">{\u00b6 2} This appeal arises from an employment-discrimination action filed by appellee, Anita Hauser, against the Dayton Police Department (\u201cDPD\u201d) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>appellant, Major E. Mitchell Davis. At all relevant times, Hauser, a female over age 40, worked as a police officer for DPD under Davis\u2019s supervision. Hauser\u2019s complaint asserted a variety of claims, including age- and sex-based discrimination in violation of R.C. Chapter 4112 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq. (\u201cTitle VII\u201d). Specifically, Hauser alleged that DPD and Davis took employment actions against her that they did not take against those who were not in her statutorily protected class by imposing certain employment conditions, withholding her wages, subjecting her to \u201cfrivolous\u201d investigations, and denying her opportunities for career advancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">{\u00b6 3} Together, DPD and Davis moved for summary judgment, arguing, inter alia, that Davis was entitled to immunity under R.C. 2744.03(A)(6). Relying on the Eighth District\u2019s decision in <em>Campolieti v. Cleveland, </em>184 Ohio App.3d 419, 2009-Ohio-5224, 921 N.E.2d 286 (8th Dist.), Davis argued that a supervisor employed by a political subdivision cannot be held individually liable in a discrimination action.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">{\u00b6 4} The trial court granted Davis and DPD\u2019s motion for summary judgment on most of Hauser\u2019s claims, but denied the motion as it related to Hauser\u2019s claim of sex discrimination under R.C. 4112.02(A) and Title VII. The trial court also denied the motion as it related to Davis\u2019s claim of immunity, reasoning that there were genuine issues of material fact regarding Davis\u2019s status as a manager or supervisor and regarding whether Davis had discriminated against Hauser based on sex. Hauser then filed a notice of voluntary dismissal pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A), and Davis appealed the trial court\u2019s decision denying him immunity pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">{\u00b6 5} In a two-to-one decision, the court of appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of summary judgment to Davis on his claim of immunity. The majority relied on R.C. 2744.03(A)(6)(c), which states that an employee of a political subdivision is not entitled to immunity if a section of the Revised Code expressly imposes civil liability, and concluded that \u201ccivil liability is expressly imposed upon managers or supervisors, such as Davis, under R.C. 4112.01(A)(2) for their individual violations of R.C. 4112.02(A).\u201d 2013-Ohio-11, 986 N.E.2d 523, \u00b6 28 (2d Dist.).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">{\u00b6 6} The court of appeals certified that its judgment is in conflict with the Eighth District\u2019s judgment in <em>Campolieti </em>184 Ohio App.3d 419, 2009-Ohio-5224, 921 N.E.2d 286, as to the following question: \u201cWhether civil liability is expressly imposed upon managers or supervisors under R.C. 4112.01(A)(2) for their individual violations of R.C. 4112.02(A) so that political subdivision employee immunity is lifted by R.C. 2744.03(A)(6)(c).\u201d We agreed that a conflict exists and also accepted jurisdiction over Davis\u2019s discretionary appeal. 135 Ohio St.3d 1431, 2013-Ohio-1857, 986 N.E.2d 1021.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">{\u00b6 7} R.C. 2744.03(A)(6) provides an employee of a political subdivision with immunity from tort liability, with three exceptions. At issue here is the exception in R.C. 2744.03(A)(6)(c), which removes immunity if \u201c[e]ivil liability is expressly imposed upon the employee by a section of the Revised Code.\u201d The question in this appeal is whether R.C. 4112.02(A) \u201cexpressly imposefs]\u201d civil liability upon an employee of a political subdivision in Davis\u2019s situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">{\u00b6 8} R.C. 4112.02(A) makes it an unlawful discriminatory practice for \u201cany employer\u201d to discriminate on a number of different grounds \u2014 as relevant to this case, sex \u2014 and a violation of that provision subjects the employer to civil liability. R.C. 4112.99. The General Assembly has defined \u201cemployer\u201d to include \u201cthe state, any political subdivision of the state, any person employing four or more persons within the state, and any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer.\u201d R.C. 4112.01(A)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">{\u00b6 9} Our analysis centers on the meaning of the last category listed in R.C. 4112.01(A)(2) \u2014 \u201cany person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer.\u201d In construing statutes, our task is not to \u201cpick out one sentence and disassociate it from the context.\u201d <em>State v. Wilson, </em>77 Ohio St.3d 334, 336, 673 N.E.2d 1347 (1997). Rather, we construe statutes \u201cas a whole,\u201d <em>State ex rel. Myers v. Spencer Twp. Rural School Dist. Bd. of Edn., </em>95 Ohio St. 367, 373, 116 N.E. 516 (1917), and based on how one would have reasonably understood the text \u201cat the time\u201d it was enacted. <em>Volz v. Volz, </em>167 Ohio St. 141, 146, 146 N.E.2d 734 (1957). Based on the statutory and historical context of the words chosen by the General Assembly, we conclude that R.C. 4112.01(A)(2) and 4112.02(A) do not expressly impose civil liability on political-subdivision employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">{\u00b6 10} The definition of \u201cemployer\u201d in R.C. 4112.01 was first enacted in 1959. Am.S.B. No. 10, 128 Ohio Laws 12. At that time, the definition, then codified as R. C. 4112.01(B), was worded slightly differently than it is today to conclude with the phrase \u201cany person acting in the interest of an employer, directly or indirectly.\u201d When the General Assembly selected that phrase, it had already acquired a particular meaning in the context of employment-practices legislation. Twelve years earlier, the United States Supreme Court construed the same definition of \u201cemployer\u201d \u2014 \u201c \u2018any person acting in the interest of an employer, directly or indirectly\u2019 \u201d \u2014 in the context of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. <em>Packard Motor Car Co. v. Natl. Labor Relations Bd., </em>330 U.S. 485, 488, 67 S. Ct. 789, 91 L.Ed. 1040 (1947), <em>superseded by statute on other grounds, </em>quoting 49 Stat. 450 (1935). The court held that the \u201cobvious[ ]\u201d purpose of this phrase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>was \u201cto render <em>employers </em>responsible in labor practices for acts of any persons performed in their interests.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 489. The court rejected an automotive company\u2019s argument that several of its plant foremen were not \u201cemployees,\u201d but qualified as \u201cemployers,\u201d under the act, stating that the purpose of the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d was to incorporate \u201cthe ancient maxim of the common law, respondeat superior, by which a principal is made liable for the tortious acts of his agent and the master for the wrongful acts of his servants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This language was necessary, according to the court, because \u201cCongress was creating a new class of wrongful acts to be known as unfair labor practices, and it could not be certain that the courts would apply the tort rule of respondeat superior to those derelictions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">{\u00b6 11} Whether we agree or disagree with the <em>Packard </em>court\u2019s construction, we cannot ignore Packard\u2019s historical relevance when examining the General Assembly\u2019s use 12 years later of the same language \u2014 \u201cany person acting in the interest of an employer\u201d \u2014 in what continues to be the essence of current R.C. 4112.01(A)(2). Giving this phrase the meaning it had \u201cat the time\u201d of its enactment, <em>Volz </em>at 146, we read it to mean what the United States Supreme Court said it meant: an employer faces \u201crespondeat superior\u201d liability \u201cfor acts of any persons performed in [the employer\u2019s] interests.\u201d <em>Packard </em>at 489. Respondeat superior speaks only to the vicarious liability of an <em>employer, </em>it does not simultaneously create an express cause of action against individual agents and servants of the employer. \u201cRespondeat superior\u201d means \u201c[l]et the <em>master </em>answer,\u201d and at the time <em>Packard </em>was decided, the phrase was defined as the doctrine holding \u201ca <em>master </em>* * * liable in certain cases for the wrongful acts of his servant, and a <em>principal </em>for those of his agent.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1546 (3d Ed.1933). Just as respondeat superior refers only to the vicarious liability of an employer, so too does R.C. 4112.01(A)(2) refer to the vicarious liability of a political-subdivision employer when the question is whether that statute \u201cexpressly\u201d imposes liability on political-subdivision employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">{\u00b6 12} Even though R.C. 4112.02(A) imposes liability only upon an \u201cemployer,\u201d the General Assembly knows how to expressly impose liability on individuals, and it has done so elsewhere in R.C. 4112.02. For example, ever since it first enacted R.C. Chapter 4112 in 1959, the General Assembly has declared it unlawful for \u201cany person\u201d to \u201caid, abet, incite, compel},] or coerce the doing of * * * an unlawful discriminatory practice,\u201d or to \u201cattempt directly or indirectly to commit any act\u201d constituting \u201can unlawful discriminatory practice.\u201d Former R.C. 4112.02(H) (enacted by Am.S.B. No. 10, 128 Ohio Laws 12, 14), now codified as R.C. 4112.02(J). And in R.C. 4112.02(G), the General Assembly prohibits discrimination in a \u201cplace of public accommodation\u201d by \u201cany proprietor or any employee, keeper, or manager.\u201d Thus, an examination of R.C. 4112.02 reveals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>that when the General Assembly imposes individual liability for discriminatory practices, it does so expressly. If we were to conclude that the employer-discrimination provision in R.C. 4112.02(A) expressly imposes liability on employees, we would render the aiding-and-abetting provision in R.C. 4112.02(J) largely superfluous. That provision already holds individual employees liable for their participation in discriminatory practices. This context supports our determination that R.C. 4112.01(A)(1) and 4112.02(A) subject employers to vicarious liability and do not expressly impose liability on individual employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">{\u00b6 13} Almost every federal circuit has reached the same conclusion in the context of Title VII, which defines \u201cemployer\u201d to include certain persons<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with 15 or more employees and \u201cany agent of such a person.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 2000e(b). <em>See, e.g., Busby v. Orlando, </em>931 F.2d 764, 772 (11th Cir.1991) (holding that Title VII provides relief against the employer, \u201cnot individual employees\u201d); <em>Wathen v. Gen. Elec. Co., </em>115 F.3d 400, 406 (6th Cir.1997) (\u201cCongress did not intend individuals to face liability under the definition of \u2018employer\u2019 it selected for Title VII\u201d); <em>Fantini v. Salem State College, </em>557 F.3d 22, 30 (1st Cir.2009) (relying on decisions from ten other federal circuits to support the conclusion that \u201cthere is no individual employee liability under Title VII\u201d). Courts have construed this agency language to reveal Congress\u2019s intent to \u201cincorporate the principles of respondeat superior into Title VII rather than to expose either supervisors or co-workers to personal liability in employment discrimination cases.\u201d <em>Lenhardt v. Basic Inst. of Technology, Inc., </em>55 F.3d 377, 380 (8th Cir.1995); <em>see generally Meritor Savs. Bank, F.S.B. v. Vinson, </em>477 U.S. 57, 72, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 91 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986) (Title VII\u2019s definition of \u201cemployer\u201d incorporates agency principles and \u201cevinces an intent to place some limits on the acts of employees for which employers under Title VII are to be held responsible\u201d). These courts have also relied on the fact that Title VII\u2019s definition of \u201cemployer\u201d excludes persons with fewer than 15 employees. 42 U.S.C. 2000e(b). Because this exclusion was designed in large part to protect small businesses from \u201cthe costs associated with litigating discrimination claims,\u201d courts have found it \u201cinconceivable\u201d to suggest that \u201cCongress intended to allow civil liability to run against individual employees.\u201d <em>Miller v. Maxwell\u2019s Internatl. Inc., </em>991 F.2d 583, 587 (9th Cir.1993); <em>see also Fantini </em>at 29-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">{\u00b6 14} Federal case law interpreting Title VII has persuasive value in cases like this one, which involves comparable provisions in R.C. Chapter 4112. <em>Plumbers &amp; Steamfitters Joint Apprenticeship Commt. v. Ohio Civ. Rights Comm., </em>66 Ohio St.2d 192, 196, 421 N.E.2d 128 (1981). There is no material difference between R.C. 4112.01(A)(2)\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cperson acting * * * in the interest of an employer\u201d and Title VII\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cagent of\u2019 an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>employer. 42 U.S.C. 2000e(b). Both phrases reflect the purpose of exposing employers to vicarious liability under the doctrine of respondeat superior. And, like Title VII, R.C. 4112.01(A)(2)\u2019s definition of \u201cemployer\u201d also excludes smaller employers, i.e., those with fewer than four employees. We have stated that the purpose of this exclusion is to protect such employers \u201cfrom the burdens of R.C. Chapter 4112.\u201d <em>Collins v. Rizkana, </em>73 Ohio St.3d 65, 74, 652 N.E.2d 653 (1995). Reading the statute to simultaneously exempt a small-business owner from liability yet impose liability on any individual working for a larger company obstructs this purpose. If a statute is susceptible to different meanings, we should favor the meaning that \u201cfurthers the legislative purpose\u201d over the meaning that obstructs or hinders that purpose. <em>State ex rel. Toledo Edison Co. v. </em>Clyde, 76 Ohio St.3d 508, 513, 668 N.E.2d 498 (1996); <em>see Wathen, </em>115 F.3d at 405 (conceding that a \u201cnarrow and literal reading\u201d of 42 U.S.C. 2000e(b) implies that an employer\u2019s agent is a statutory employer for liability purposes, but rejecting that reading as producing \u201ca result clearly at odds with the express intent of Congress\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">{\u00b6 15} Reading the statute as a whole and consistently with the legislative intent behind R.C. Chapter 4112, we conclude that R.C. 4112.01(A)(2) and 4112.02(A) do not expressly impose civil liability on political-subdivision employees so as to exempt them from immunity under R.C. 2744.03(A)(6)(c), but rather subject a political-subdivision employer to vicarious liability for the discriminatory acts of its employees. We underscore, however, that our conclusion is limited to the provisions dealing with \u201cemployer\u201d discrimination, R.C. 4112.01(A)(2) and 4112.02(A). An individual political-subdivision employee still faces liability under other provisions of R.C. 4112.02 that expressly impose liability, including the aiding-and-abetting provision in R.C. 4112.02(J).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">{\u00b6 16} Hauser argues that we are bound to reach the opposite conclusion based on our decision in <em>Genaro v. Cent. Transport, Inc., </em>84 Ohio St.3d 293, 703 N.E.2d 782 (1999). In that case, we held that \u201ca supervisor/manager may be held jointly and/or severally liable with her/his employer for discriminatory conduct of the supervisor/manager in violation of R.C. Chapter 4112.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at syllabus. While it comes close, <em>Genaro </em>does not qualify as binding precedent on the immunity question in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">{\u00b6 17} The certified question in <em>Genaro </em>involved <em>private-sector </em>supervisors and managers, and it asked only whether such persons may be jointly and severally liable with an employer for conduct \u201cin violation of R.C. Chapter 4112.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 293, 300. We did not address whether the employer-discrimination provision in R.C. 4112.02(A) \u201cexpressly imposed\u201d civil liability on a political-subdivision employee for purposes of the immunity exception in R.C. 2744.03(A)(6)(c). To be sure, our reasoning in this case calls the <em>Genaro </em>majority\u2019s reasoning into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>question, particularly its basis for distinguishing the prevailing interpretation of Title VII. <em>See Genaro </em>at 299 (declaring R.C. 4112.01(A)(2)\u2019s definition of employer to be \u201cbroader\u201d than Title VII\u2019s definition). But because <em>Genaro </em>did not squarely address the immunity question at issue here, it is not binding authority, and we need not apply <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, to decide whether we should overrule it.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">{\u00b6 18} R.C. 4112.01(A)(2) and 4112.02(A) do not expressly impose civil liability on political-subdivision employees so as to trigger the immunity exception in R.C. 2744.03(A)(6)(c). Accordingly, we answer the certified question in the negative and reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b438-7\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Lanzinger, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b438-8\">O\u2019Donnell, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b438-9\">Pfeifer, Kennedy, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-11\">.

Sandusky, </em>68 Ohio St.3d 139, 144, 624 N.E.2d 704 (1994) (Pfeifer, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">{\u00b6 20} Second, I continue to believe that the <em>Galatis </em>test (established in <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256) is .a \u201chopelessly random and formulaic approach to overruling precedent.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Shelly Materials, Inc. v. Clark Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>115 Ohio St.3d 337, 2007-Ohio-5022, 875 N.E.2d 59, \u00b6 50 (Pfeifer, J., dissenting). Once again, this court shies away from addressing a precedent with which it disagrees because of the unworkability of the <em>Galatis </em>test. <em>See Groch v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>117 Ohio St.3d 192, 2008-Ohio-546, 883 N.E.2d 377, \u00b6 221 (Lanzinger, J., concurring in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-13\">{\u00b6 21} Third, the statute in question need not be very rigorously examined to realize that the lead opinion is patently wrong. R.C. 4112.01(A)(2) defines \u201cemployer\u201d broadly, to include \u201cthe state, any political subdivision of the state, * * * and any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer.\u201d It is clear that Major Davis was acting in the interest of an employer when he allegedly discriminated against Anita Hauser. According to the statutory scheme, a person acting in the interest of an employer is an \u201cemployer\u201d and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>subject to liability. The lead opinion in essence concludes that an employee of a political subdivision who discriminates illegally is not a \u201cperson acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">{\u00b6 22} I would answer the certified question in the affirmative and affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">{\u00b6 23} I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b439-6\">O\u2019Neill, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b439-7\">Kennedy, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AvI5\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">{\u00b624} Regrettably, I must dissent. The lead opinion concludes that R.C. 4112.01(A)(2) does not expressly impose civil liability for unlawful discriminatory practices on political-subdivision supervisors. I cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">{\u00b6 25} R.C. 4112.02(A) prohibits sex discrimination by an \u201cemployer.\u201d We have already held that R.C. 4112.01(A)(2) holds individual supervisors and managers accountable as employers for their own discriminatory conduct in the workplace. <em>Genaro v. Cent. Transport, Inc., </em>84 Ohio St.3d 293, 300, 703 N.E.2d 782 (1999). The only question is whether the Revised Code \u201cexpressly\u201d imposes civil liability upon appellant, Major ,E. Mitchell Davis, a political-subdivision supervisor who would ordinarily be immune from such liability through sovereign immunity. <em>See </em>R.C. 2744.03(A)(6)(c). If it does, then we must affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">{\u00b6 26} The Revised Code expressly imposes such liability. R.C. 4112.01(A)(2) states: \u201c \u2018Employer\u2019 includes the state, any political subdivision of the state, any person employing four or more persons within the state, and any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer.\u201d This provision, in conjunction with <em>Genaro, </em>expressly imposes civil liability for discriminatory acts on the state and its supervisory employees. In fact, imposing such liability is a main purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">{\u00b6 27} While I disagree with the holding in <em>Genaro, </em>it has been the law of Ohio since 1999, and my duty is to apply it. The General Assembly has amended R.C. 4112.01 five times since we issued <em>Genaro, </em>but it has never addressed this precedent through legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">{\u00b6 28} For these reasons, I dissent. I would hold that liability is expressly imposed on political-subdivision supervisors under R.C. 4112.01(A)(2) and <em>Genaro, </em>and I would answer the certified-conflict question accordingly.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Acm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Scaccia and Associates, L.L.C., and John J.
