In this appeal, we consider whether the state must prove a culpable mental state with respect to the element contained in R.C. 2911.02(A)(3), that the offender did \u201c[u]se or threaten the immediate use of force against another.\u201d We hold that it need not and that the strict-liability and read-in-recklessness rules of R.C. 2901.21(B) do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">{\u00b6 2} The Montgomery County Grand Jury indicted appellee, Kevin Tolliver, on one count of robbery under R.C. 2911.02(A)(3). The indictment alleged that Tolliver, \u201cin attempting or committing a theft offense, or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense, did recklessly use or threaten the immediate use of force against\u201d Jasmine Jordan. The indictment largely tracked the language of the robbery statute, but it added the word \u201crecklessly\u201d with respect to the force element; R.C. 2911.02(A)(3) does not specify any such mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">{\u00b6 3} At Tolliver\u2019s jury trial, evidence established that Tolliver stole merchandise from a Dollar General store and escaped by using and threatening force against a store employee who tried to stop him. The employee, Jasmine Jordan, testified that Tolliver pushed her and that she pushed back, at which point Tolliver raised his fist as if to punch her in the face. Tolliver took the stand and admitted shoplifting and raising his fist at Jordan. He also admitted that the surveillance video showed that he extended his arms into Jordan\u2019s chest, causing her to move backward, but he refused to admit that he pushed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">{\u00b6 4} The trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury mirrored the statutory definition of robbery and did not instruct the jury that the state was required to prove any mental state with respect to the force element in R.C. 2911.02(A)(3). In defining the elements of a completed or attempted \u201ctheft offense,\u201d an element of robbery set forth in R.C. 2911.02(A), the trial court instructed the jury on the elements of theft in R.C. 2913.02(A)(1), including the mental states of \u201cpurpose\u201d to deprive the owner of property or services and \u201cknowingly\u201d obtaining or exerting control over the property or services without consent. R.C. 2913.02(A). The trial court also defined an \u201cattempt\u201d as an offender \u201cknowingly\u201d engaging in conduct that, if successful, would have resulted in the completed offense. The jury found Tolliver guilty as charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">{\u00b6 5} Tolliver appealed, arguing that the trial court committed plain error by not instructing the jury that the state had to prove that he had recklessly used force while committing or attempting to commit theft. The court of appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>agreed and reversed Tolliver\u2019s conviction. 2013-Ohio-115, 986 N.E.2d 34, at \u00b6 26, 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">{\u00b6 6} We accepted jurisdiction over the state\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">{\u00b6 7} As it applies to Tolliver, R.C. 2911.02 defines robbery as follows: \u201c(A) No person, in attempting or committing a theft offense or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense, shall do any of the following: * * * (3) Use or threaten the immediate use of force against another.\u201d The issue in this appeal is whether the state must prove the culpable mental state of \u201crecklessness\u201d in proving the force element R.C. 2911.02(A)(3) requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">{\u00b6 8} We begin with the text of R.C. 2911.02, which does not explicitly or impliedly require proof of any culpable mental state for the force element in subdivision (A)(3). It does, however, require proof of culpability for other elements of the offense. Division (A) expressly predicates every robbery on the elements of a completed or attempted \u201ctheft offense,\u201d including all culpable mental states. R.C. 2911.02(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">{\u00b6 9} Tolliver\u2019s predicate theft offense, according to the jury instructions, was the theft offense defined in R.C. 2913.02(A)(1), which includes the mental states of \u201cpurpose\u201d and \u201cknowingly.\u201d To find Tolliver guilty of an \u201cattempted\u201d theft offense, the jury had to find that Tolliver \u201cknowingly\u201d engaged in conduct that, if successful, would have resulted in the completed offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">{\u00b6 10} The analysis is straightforward for statutes like R.C. 2911.02, in which the General Assembly has already said which elements of the offense require proof of culpability and which do not. \u201cFor these offenses, if the General Assembly intends for the additional elements to carry their own mens rea, it must say so.\u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 107, 2010-Ohio-6301, 942 N.E.2d 347, \u00b6 38. The state need prove culpability only for the elements for which a mental state is specified in the section defining the offense, and courts should not fill any gaps by inserting culpability requirements that the text and ordinary rules of construction cannot bear. <em>See id. </em>at \u00b6 42. It is our duty \u201cto give effect to the words used, not to delete words used or to insert words not used.\u201d <em>Columbus-Suburban Coach Lines, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>20 Ohio St.2d 125, 127, 254 N.E.2d 8 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">{\u00b6 11} The only way to read a culpable mental state where one does not exist is through R.C. 2901.21(B), which applies only to those statutes that \u201cdo[ ] not specify any degree of culpability.\u201d Today, we hold that R.C. 2901.21(B) does not apply to the statute defining robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>\n<em>Mens Rea, Legislative Silence, and R.C. 2901.21(B)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">{\u00b6 12} Before the General Assembly enacted R.C. 2901.21(B) in 1974, there was no universal rule for construing statutes that did not specify any element of mens rea. When legislatures first began codifying criminal offenses, courts (including this one) interpreted those statutes to require an element of mens rea, even though the legislature did not specify one. <em>See </em>Sayre, <em>Public Welfare Offenses, </em>33 Colum.L.Rev. 55, 62 (1933) (collecting decisions); <em>see, e.g., Birney v. State, </em>8 Ohio 230, 238 (1837) (stating, \u2018We know of no case where positive action is held criminal, unless the intention accompanies the act, either expressly or necessarily inferred from the act itself\u2019). This presumption of mens rea rested on the common-law tradition that all crime included \u201csome mental element,\u201d and courts assumed that legislative silence \u201cmerely recognized that intent was so inherent in the idea of the offense that it required no statutory affirmation.\u201d <em>Morissette v. United States, </em>342 U.S. 246, 252, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">{\u00b6 13} With the advent of statutes defining newer offenses and the strict-liability offense, however, it became less clear whether statutory silence assumed a culpable mental state or, in the case of strict liability, imposed liability \u201cwithout any kind of mental state whatsoever.\u201d 1 LaFave, <em>Substantive Criminal Law, </em>Section 5.1, at 336 (2d Ed.2003); Sayre at 62-66. The United States Supreme Court addressed this issue, stating that courts should presume that a culpable mental state should be proven unless the statute contained a \u201ccontrary direction,\u201d <em>Morissette </em>at 263, or \u201cclear expression\u201d to impose liability without fault, <em>id. </em>at 254, fn. 14. This court took the opposite approach and construed statutes as imposing strict liability unless they specified an element of intent. <em>See State v. Huffman, </em>131 Ohio St. 27, 1 N.E.2d 313 (1936), paragraph one of the syllabus (holding that \u201cif a statute defining an offense is silent on the question of intent, it is not necessary to allege and prove an intent to commit the offense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">{\u00b6 14} Against this backdrop, the General Assembly enacted R.C. 2901.21(B), which provides the following rule for determining whether statutes not specifying any culpable mental state impose strict liability or instead require some level of culpability, that is, recklessness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">(B) When the section defining an offense does not specify any degree of culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not required for a person to be guilty of the offense. When the section neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability, recklessness is sufficient culpability to commit the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>{\u00b6 15} This text identifies two conditions that must exist before a court can read recklessness into an offense. First, the \u201csection\u201d defining the offense must not specify \u201cany degree of culpability,\u201d meaning that the section does not already require proof of a culpable mental state for any element of the offense in any division or subdivision. R.C. 2901.21(B); <em>see also Johnson, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 107, 2010-Ohio-6301, 942 N.E.2d 347, at \u00b6 31 (\u201cR.C. 2901.21(B) requires us to examine the entire section defining the offense, not merely a clause or subsection\u201d); <em>State v. Maxwell, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 254, 2002-Ohio-2121, 767 N.E.2d 242, \u00b6 22 (\u201cwe need to determine whether the entire <em>section </em>includes a mental element, not just whether <em>division </em>(A)(6) includes such an element\u201d [emphasis sic]). Second, the section must not plainly indicate a purpose to impose strict liability. R.C. 2901.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">{\u00b6 16} In <em>Maxwell, </em>we phrased this standard as a two-step inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">[A] court must be able to answer in the negative the following two questions before applying the element of recklessness pursuant to R.C. 2901.21(B): (1) does the section defining an offense specify any degree of culpability, and (2) does the section plainly indicate a purpose to impose strict criminal liability?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-7\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">{\u00b6 17} In <em>Johnson, </em>we acknowledged that \u201cour use of R.C. 2901.21(B) has been imprecise\u201d in prior decisions in which we had unnecessarily applied it to statutes that already specified a culpable mental state for one or more of the elements of the offense. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 40, 42. We clarified that R.C. 2901.21(B) \u201cdoes <em>not </em>cover\u201d these cases and refused to apply it to R.C. 2923.13(A)(3), a statute prohibiting the possession of a weapon while under disability, which contains a mental state of \u201cknowingly\u201d in division (A). (Emphasis sic.) <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 31. We concluded that, because division (A) \u201calready contains the mens rea of \u2018knowingly,\u2019 R.C. 2901.21(B) does not apply,\u201d and \u201cthe state is not required to prove a culpable mental state for the element\u201d of the offense in subdivision (A)(3). <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">\n<em>R.C. 2901.21(B) Does Not Apply to R.C. 2911.02, the Statute Defining Robbery</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">{\u00b6 18} Like the statute at issue in <em>Johnson, </em>the section defining robbery already requires proof of culpability for one or more elements of the offense. R.C. 2911.02(A) predicates every robbery on the elements of a completed or an attempted \u201ctheft offense,\u201d which, for Tolliver, included the mental states of \u201cpurpose\u201d and \u201cknowingly.\u201d R.C. 2913.02(A). Because R.C. 2911.02(A) \u201calready contains [a] mens rea,\u201d by reference to the predicate theft offense, the section already specifies culpability, and we cannot apply R.C. 2901.21(B)\u2019s rules for determining whether an offense imposes strict liability or requires proof of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>recklessness. <em>See Johnson, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 107, 2010-Ohio-6301, 942 N.E.2d 347, at \u00b6 42. The section defining robbery makes clear which elements of the offense require proof of culpability, and the force element in R.C. 2911.02(A)(3) is not one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">{\u00b6 19} We reached a similar conclusion in <em>State v. Wharf, </em>86 Ohio St.3d 375, 715 N.E.2d 172 (1999), and held that the deadly-weapon element of robbery in R.C. 2911.02(A)(1) \u201cdoes not require the mens rea of recklessness\u201d or any \u201cspecific mental state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at paragraphs one and two of the syllabus. Because the \u201ctheft offense\u201d element of the robbery statute already required proof of one or more culpable mental states (for Wharf, purpose and knowledge, <em>id. </em>at 377, at fn. 1), we concluded that the state did not need to prove any culpable mental state \u201cbeyond that required for the theft offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">{\u00b6 20} Because R.C. 2901.21(B) does not apply to the section defining robbery, it is illogical to ask whether that section \u201cplainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability\u201d or instead requires proof of \u201crecklessness.\u201d By definition, the section defining robbery <em>cannot </em>plainly impose strict liability because it always includes the mens rea of the predicate theft offense. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>453 (10th Ed.2014) (defining \u201cstrict-liability crime\u201d as a crime that \u201cdoes not require a mens rea element\u201d); R.C. 2901.21(B) (stating when an offense is a strict-liability offense). Likewise, recklessness cannot be \u201csufficient culpability to commit the offense,\u201d R.C. 2901.21(B), because the robbery statute requires the state to prove more than mere recklessness by predicating the robbery on a knowing and/or purposeful theft offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">{\u00b6 21} Simply put, R.C. 2901.21(B) does not apply whenever an element of an offense is missing a mens rea. The General Assembly has the power to selectively assign culpable mental states to some elements and not others. Unlike the Model Penal Code approach, which requires culpability for \u201call material elements\u201d of an offense, <em>see </em>Model Penal Code Section 2.02(4), R.C. 2901.21(A)(2) adopts the view that a person need possess only the \u201crequisite degree of culpability for <em>each element as to which a culpable mental state is specified </em>by the section defining the offense.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In this respect, Ohio follows the view that \u201ca crime may be defined so as to require one type of fault as to one element, another type as to another element, and no fault at all as to a third element.\u201d 1 LaFave, Section 5.5, at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">{\u00b6 22} We stressed this point in <em>Johnson </em>and refused to apply R.C. 2901.21(B) on an \u201celement-by-element\u201d basis wherever culpability is missing. 128 Ohio St.3d 107, 2010-Ohio-6301, 942 N.E.2d 347, at \u00b6 33, 34, 38. There must be \u201ca complete absence of culpability in the <em>section </em>defining the offense\u201d before a court can apply R.C. 2901.21(B)\u2019s strict-liability and read-in-recklessness rules. (Emphasis sic.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number><em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 34. Here, there is not a complete absence of culpability, because R.C. 2911.02 requires every robbery to include the culpable mental states of the predicate theft offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">{\u00b6 23} R.C. 2901.21(B), the statute for determining whether an offense imposes strict liability or requires proof of recklessness, applies only if \u201cthe section defining an offense does not specify any degree of culpability.\u201d If the section already requires proof of a culpable mental state for any element of the offense in any division or subdivision, R.C. 2901.21(B) does not apply, and the state need prove culpability only as specified in the section. Because R.C. 2911.02 defines every robbery to include the culpable mental states of the predicate theft offense, R.C. 2901.21(B), which applies only when a mental state is not specified in a section defining an offense, does not apply, and the state need not prove a culpable mental state with respect to the force element in R.C. 2911.02(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">{\u00b6 24} Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b590-9\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and O\u2019Donnell and Kennedy, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"A6e\">Pfeifer, Lanzinger, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b590-10\">Lanzinger, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AC2\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">{\u00b6 25} The majority opinion holds that the mere reference to a theft offense within R.C. 2911.02(A)(3) supplies a culpable mental state to the third-degree-felony offense of robbery, so that the state need not prove that a defendant recklessly used or threatened the immediate use of force against another. For the following reasons, I respectfully dissent and would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">{\u00b6 26} The third-degree-felony offense of robbery under R.C. 2911.02(A)(3) requires the use of force or the threat of the use of force, but the statute does not explicitly require proof of any culpable mental state. The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-13\">(A) No person, in attempting or committing a theft offense or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense, shall do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-14\"><em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-15\">(3) Use or threaten the immediate use of force against another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>The definition of this offense does not specify that the offender must have acted purposely, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">{\u00b6 27} We have clarified that the General Assembly has intended that R.C. 2901.21(B) provides a default rule of recklessness when a mens rea is missing from the definition of the offense and strict liability has not been clearly indicated. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 107, 2010-Ohio-6301, 942 N.E.2d 347, \u00b6 34. But in <em>Johnson, </em>we examined the offense of having weapons when the defendant is under indictment or has been previously convicted of a felony drug offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because that offense was defined by specifying the mens rea of \u201cknowingly\u201d with respect to the possession of a weapon, we held that R.C. 2901.21(B) did not apply. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">{\u00b6 28} <em>Johnson </em>did not contemplate the incorporation by reference of elements from another statute. On its face, the third-degree-felony offense of robbery defined in R.C. 2911.02(A)(3) does not contain any mens rea. R.C. 2901.21(B) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">When the section defining an offense does not specify any degree of culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not required for a person to be guilty of the offense. When the section neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability, recklessness is sufficient culpability to commit the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">{\u00b6 29} In answering the initial question whether the \u201cthe section defining an offense\u201d specifies any culpability, the majority determines in Kevin Tolliver\u2019s case that a reference to a \u201ctheft offense\u201d in R.C. 2911.02(A)(3) incorporates the elements of theft set forth in R.C. 2913.02(A)(1). It then concludes that because theft includes the mental states of \u201cpurpose\u201d and \u201cknowingly,\u201d the reference supplies a mens rea to R.C. 2911.02(A)(3) so that no analysis under R.C. 2901.21(B) is warranted. But \u201ctheft offense\u201d is defined by statute to have the same meaning as in R.C. 2913.01,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that is, a variety of meanings. R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>2911.02(C). Not all \u201ctheft offenses\u201d contain a culpable mental state. <em>See </em>R.C. 2911.12(B), 2913.43, and 2921.41.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AUK\">Mathias H. Heck Jr., Montgomery County Prosecuting Attorney, and Andrew T. French, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Anx\">Murr, Compton, Claypoole &amp; Macbeth and Charles M. Blue, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">{\u00b6 30} The majority broadly declares that \u201cDivision (A) [of R.C. 2911.02] expressly predicates every robbery on the elements of a completed or attempted Theft offense/ <em>including all culpable mental states.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Majority opinion at \u00b6 8. But R.C. 2911.02(A)(3), the offense we are discussing, says nothing about culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">{\u00b6 31} I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s use of a predicate offense to supply a mens rea when the section defining the offense itself does not specify a mens rea. The use of force or the threat of the immediate use of force on another distinguishes third-degree-felony robbery from other theft offenses. Without the use of force, Tolliver could not have been convicted of robbery. In my opinion, we should look only at the language in the section that defines the offense. Because R.C. 2911.02(A)(3) does not expressly specify any degree of culpability, we must then decide whether the General Assembly indicated a purpose to impose strict liability for this offense involving the use or threat of the use of force. The mere lack of a mental state is not sufficient to show strict liability. The General Assembly must plainly indicate that intention in the statute. R.C. 2901.21(B). Because there are no words to that effect in the offense of third-degree-felony robbery, I would use the default mens rea of recklessness and apply it to the use or the threat of the immediate use of force against another, rather than assume that the offense is one of strict liability. I would therefore affirm the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b592-7\">Pfeifer and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AIA\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Timothy Young, Ohio Public Defender, and Kenneth R.
