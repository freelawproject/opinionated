For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">{\u00b6 2} In September 2008, Kirkpatrick was sentenced after pleading guilty to 16 counts of breaking and entering and one count of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity. Trumbull County Common Pleas Court Judge John Stuard sentenced Kirkpatrick to five years of community control, including the requirement that Kirkpatrick enter and successfully complete a program called \u201cTeen Challenge\u201d (sometimes also called \u201cLife Challenge\u201d). Judge Stuard warned that any violation of community control could result in the imposition of a nine-year prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-13\">{\u00b6 3} On April 16, 2009, after Kirkpatrick admitted to violating the terms of his release, Judge Stuard sentenced him to a total prison term of nine years.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-14\">{\u00b6 4} Kirkpatrick appealed. The court of appeals held that Kirkpatrick\u2019s sentence for engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity exceeded the permissible two-to-eight year range for a second-degree felony and remanded the case for resentencing. 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2009-T-0007, 2009-0hio-6519, 2009 WL 4863392.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-15\">{\u00b6 5} The trial court resentenced Kirkpatrick to a total prison term of nine years, with eight of the years attributed to the conviction for engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity. The court of appeals affirmed. 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2010-T-0025, 2010-Ohio-6578, 2010 WL 5622074.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-16\">\n<em>The mandamus complaint</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b562-17\">{\u00b6 6} On January 10, 2013, Kirkpatrick filed an original action seeking a writ of mandamus compelling Judge Stuard to resentence him. (Judge Stuard is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>longer on the bench, and Judge Ronald J. Rice has been substituted as respondent.) Kirkpatrick\u2019s claims all arise out of alleged defects in the 2008 sentencing order.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">{\u00b6 7} The court of appeals dismissed the petition on September 16, 2013, in large part because Kirkpatrick\u2019s allegations, even if true, were \u201clegally insufficient to demonstrate that he has a \u2018right\u2019 to another sentencing hearing.\u201d 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2013-T-0004, 2013-Ohio-3978, 2013 WL 5220918, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">{\u00b6 8} Kirkpatrick timely appealed to this court, and the matter is now fully briefed.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">\n<em>Legal analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">{\u00b6 9} Kirkpatrick argues that his first sentencing order is void, based on five defects:</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">{\u00b6 10} (1) \u201cTeen Challenge\u201d is a 12-month program, but the maximum residential sanction under the Ohio Revised Code is six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">{\u00b6 11} (2) The \u201cTeen Challenge\u201d residential sanction is void because the sentencing entry did not specify the length of the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">{\u00b6 12} (3) The trial court did not advise him of several of the community-control sanctions on the record during the first sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">{\u00b6 13} (4) The first sentencing order failed to separately state the basis of the nine-year \u201creserve\u201d sentence to be imposed upon a violation of community-control release.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-13\">{\u00b6 14} (5) Because the nine-year \u201creserve\u201d sentence exceeded the maximum sentence permissible for a second-degree felony, he did not receive valid notice of the reserve sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-14\">{\u00b6 15} Each of these contentions attacks the validity of the 2008 sentencing order. However, that order has been superseded by not one but two subsequent orders. Kirkpatrick\u2019s contentions are therefore moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-15\">{\u00b6 16} Kirkpatrick offers only one argument to explain why defects in the 2008 entry should make the subsequent entries void as well. According to Kirkpatrick, because \u201cthe one-year alternative residential sanction was and is void * * *, there was no valid sanction to violate, and the Trial Court had no power to impose the reserve prison term.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-16\">{\u00b6 17} To the contrary, even if the 2008 entry were defective, the court still had jurisdiction to resentence him, given that Kirkpatrick has never challenged the validity of his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-17\">{\u00b6 18} Judge Stuard\u2019s April 16, 2009 order makes clear that he sentenced Kirkpatrick to a term of nine years not as a punishment for violating community control, but because he considered nine years to be the appropriate sentence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>And Judge Stuard later corrected the error in that order when he sentenced Kirkpatrick to the nine-year sentence he is now serving. Kirkpatrick has not established any defect in his current sentence, and therefore he has shown no legal right to a new sentencing hearing.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"APm\">Jason W.

Waters v. Spaeth, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 55, 2012-Ohio-69, 960 N.E.2d 452, \u00b6 6. Kirkpatrick has not satisfied these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">{\u00b6 20} Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b564-8\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
