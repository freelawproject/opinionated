Defendant-appellant, Anthony Kirkland, was convicted of the aggravated murder of two girls in Hamilton County between 2006 and 2009. He was also convicted of the murder of two other women.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">{\u00b62} On the first morning of trial, Kirkland voluntarily pled guilty to the murders of Mary Jo Newton and Kimya Rolison, as well as to two counts of abuse of a corpse. The jury convicted Kirkland on all remaining charges, including aggravated murder with death specifications for the deaths of Esme K. and Casonya C., and recommended a sentence of death. The trial court accepted the recommendation and sentenced Kirkland accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">{\u00b6 3} For the reasons explained below, we affirm Kirkland\u2019s convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">\n<em>The State\u2019s Evidence at Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b237-14\">{\u00b6 4} On the night of May 3, 2006, around 11:00 p.m., 14-year-old Casonya C. left the home of her grandmother, Patricia C. She took her book bag, gym shoes, and cell phone with her. Her grandmother assumed Casonya meant to spend the night at her mother\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-15\">{\u00b6 5} Around midnight, Casonya called her friend Tania H. from the front porch of her friend\u2019s house. Tania told Casonya she was already in bed and did not want to go out, so Casonya said she was going back home.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-16\">{\u00b6 6} After leaving Tania\u2019s house, as she headed for her grandmother\u2019s house, Casonya spoke on the phone with her boyfriend, Ra\u2019Shaud B. The two were having an argument when suddenly the phone cut off. Ra\u2019Shaud tried for three days to reach Casonya by telephone, but he never spoke to her again.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>{\u00b6 7} The next morning, Casonya did not show up at school. Casonya\u2019s mother indicated that she had not seen her daughter, and calls to Casonya\u2019s cell phone went to voicemail.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">(\u00b6 8} At approximately 1:30 p.m. on May 4, 2006, Patricia C. called the police to report that her granddaughter was missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">{\u00b6 9} On May 9, 2006, city workers doing landscaping discovered a body underneath a pile of old tires. The body was located in a secluded wooded area, approximately ten feet down the hillside from the end of a dead-end road.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">{\u00b6 10} The body was heavily charred and decomposed, so much so that the responding officer could not determine the race or gender of the body. The front teeth had been recently knocked out. The only clothing on the body was a sock on one foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">(\u00b6 11} Just beyond the end of the road, police found a burn pit, a charred site where they believed that the body was burned before it was dragged down the hillside and buried under the tires. And near the pit they found a long piece of timber, charred at one end, that appeared to have been used as a poker to stir the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">{\u00b6 12} The forensic pathologist was unable to do a rape examination because the pelvic area was almost completely charred. Investigators were also unable to look for DNA evidence under the victim\u2019s fingernails because the hands and forearms were completely charred.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">{\u00b6 13} The body was positively identified as that of Casonya C. by comparison of dental x-rays.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">{\u00b6 14} One month later, on June 15, 2006, the still hot and smoking remains of a second human body were found approximately 35 feet from the end of a dead-end street. The right foot was found 37 feet from the body. Tests indicated that the fire was started using either lighter fluid or paint thinner.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">{\u00b6 15} The autopsy was unable to determine a cause of death but did demonstrate that the victim was already dead when the body was set on fire. The body was eventually identified as that of Mary Jo Newton by comparison of dental records.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-13\">{\u00b6 16} In the spring of 2008, skeletal remains of a third victim were discovered in a heavily wooded area at the end of another dead-end street. The bones were scattered, and the hands and feet were never found.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-14\">{\u00b6 17} The cause of death was a sharp-force injury to the neck caused by a cutting instrument. The bones showed traces of burning on the face, the front of the hip bones, and the thigh bones. A forensic anthropologist determined that the victim was most likely an African-American woman, probably between 30 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>55 years of age. However, the victim\u2019s identity remained unknown for nearly one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">{\u00b6 18} On the afternoon of Saturday, March 7, 2009, 13-year-old Esme K. left her home to go jogging, wearing her iPod and a purple watch. Esme K.\u2019s mother called 9-1-1 at 4:21 p.m. to report Esme missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">{\u00b6 19} Police searched abandoned houses and nearby woods. Eventually, two canine-unit officers spotted a man, later identified as Anthony Kirkland, sitting underneath some fir trees in the nearby woods.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">{\u00b6 20} The officers saw knives protruding from his left pants pocket, so they disarmed him and searched him. They found a purple watch and an iPod in his pockets. Etched on the back of the iPod were the words \u201cProperty of Esme [K].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">{\u00b6 21} The officers placed Kirkland in handcuffs. Kirkland initially gave his name as Anthony Palmore. He claimed that he had found the watch and iPod in the woods. The police read Kirkland his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">{\u00b6 22} Efforts to confirm his identity through police databases were unsuccessful, but after about 20 minutes, Kirkland gave his real name. As the search for Esme continued, police transported Kirkland to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">{\u00b6 23} At around 3:00 in the morning, searchers found the body of Esme K. in the woods. She was naked except for her shoes and socks. Her body was propped up against a tree branch, with her arms crossed and her legs spread. Her groin, inner thighs, and left hand had all been severely burned.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">{\u00b6 24} The official cause of death was asphyxiation due to ligature strangulation, confirmed by a fracture of the hyoid bone, ligature marks on the neck, and petechiae on her face consistent with a long struggle. There was also evidence of premortem trauma to Esme\u2019s vagina consistent with rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">{\u00b6 25} Police found Esme\u2019s top a few days later in the parking lot of a nearby vacant building. The shirt had burn holes and had been cut open in the front. A trail of burnt clothing led police to a white plastic bag containing Esme\u2019s grey sweatpants and underpants. The zipper pocket of the sweatpants was burned, but the underwear was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">{\u00b6 26} Investigators took DNA samples from Kirkland\u2019s hands, his penis, and a stain on his boxer shorts, and in all three cases, DNA consistent with Esme\u2019s was found. Partial shoe prints in the woods were consistent with the type of sneaker Kirkland wore at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">{\u00b6 27} On the morning of March 8, 2009, Detective Keith Witherell interviewed Kirkland. Witherell had previously interviewed Kirkland on March 15, 2007, in connection with the homicides of Casonya and Mary Jo. During the 2007 interrogation, Kirkland viewed a photograph of Casonya and said that he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>recognize her. He admitted that he knew Mary Jo and that the nature of their relationship was sexual, but denied having anything to do with her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">{\u00b6 28} In 2007, police had no forensic evidence tying Kirkland to the murders, no eyewitnesses, and no admissions from Kirkland. Consequently, they were unable to arrest or charge him.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">{\u00b6 29} The first March 2009 interview lasted over four hours. A video recording of that interview was introduced into evidence and played for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">{\u00b6 30} During that interview, Kirkland offered multiple, inconsistent versions of events. At the outset, he professed confusion as to the reason for his arrest, telling officers that he thought they brought him in because of outstanding warrants relating to an altercation with his ex-girlfriend\u2019s current boyfriend and that he had no idea he was there because of the missing girl.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">{\u00b6 31} He repeatedly denied seeing a young girl jogging (or anyone else) in the vicinity of the reservoir near where he was found. He acted as if he did not even know the race of the missing girl. And he professed surprise to learn that the watch and radio,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which he continued to insist he stumbled upon while walking in the woods, belonged to the missing girl.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">{\u00b6 32} After further questioning, Kirkland admitted meeting Esme at the reservoir and told detectives that he could take them to her. He said that the two literally ran into one another and that the collision caused Kirkland to drop his beer and lose his temper. He punched Esme multiple times and kicked her. But he claimed to have left her alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">{\u00b6 33} After detectives told Kirkland that her body had been found, he changed his story. First claiming to have no memory of events, Kirkland then admitted chasing Esme into the woods. But he continued to claim that he left her injured but alive, and he repeatedly insisted that she was wearing clothes when he left her.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">{\u00b6 34} As the questioning continued, Kirkland claimed to have left Esme alive with a man he knew only as Pedro. But when challenged, Kirkland confessed knowing all along that she was dead. He admitted that he had returned to the reservoir some hours after the murder to move the body.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">{\u00b6 35} Kirkland said Esme died \u201cbecause of my hatred.\u201d But when asked directly if he had killed her, he still said no, and as the interview concluded, Kirkland was still insisting that he had learned the location of the body from Pedro.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">{\u00b6 36} A second interview of Kirkland began approximately two hours later. This time, Detective William Hilbert questioned Kirkland about Mary Jo and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Casonya. The interview occurred in two sessions, the first lasting about two and one-half hours, and the second less than 90 minutes. Video recordings of those interviews were introduced into evidence, and a redacted version was played for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">{\u00b6 37} Kirkland gave the following account of Mary Jo\u2019s murder:</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">{\u00b6 38} He first met Mary Jo at the bus stop across the street from the downtown Justice Center. She worked as a prostitute to support a drug habit. She was just getting out of the Justice Center when Kirkland met her. He and Mary Jo had sex together a couple of times.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">{\u00b6 39} On the day she died, Kirkland picked her up in the College Hill area. They went to a liquor store together, then to a Rally\u2019s for food. They took some drugs. Next they went by the house of Kirkland\u2019s girlfriend, who was at work at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">{\u00b6 40} As they continued to drive, an argument broke out. Kirkland choked Mary Jo to death from behind. Then he drove to Avondale and dumped her body at the end of a dead-end street. He had a gas can in his vehicle that he used to set the body on fire. According to Kirkland, he burned the body because fire purifies and burning the body was \u201ca proper burial\u201d like the Vikings did. It was still daylight at the time, but no one was around, so Kirkland stayed to watch the flames.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">{\u00b6 41} Hilbert shifted the conversation to Casonya, and Kirkland offered this account:</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">{\u00b6 42} He first saw Casonya at the top of a bridge that crosses Interstate 71 near Walnut Hills High School. It was around 1:00 in the morning. Kirkland was sitting smoking marijuana. He heard Casonya having an argument with somebody on her cell phone, and when she saw him smoking, she hung up the phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">{\u00b6 43} According to Kirkland, Casonya asked him about the marijuana, he asked if she was old enough for that, and she answered she was old enough to be doing a lot of things.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-13\">{\u00b6 44} That led to a conversation in which Kirkland gave her $20 and agreed to go as high as $60. He says the money was to pay her just to talk. The two had an argument about, according to Kirkland, \u201cgirls playing games.\u201d Casonya threw the money back at him. At that point, Kirkland got mad and grabbed Casonya. She kneed him, and he strangled her.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-14\">{\u00b6 45} Before the altercation, the pair had crossed the bridge together and descended to Victory Parkway. From there, Kirkland carried her dead body to a wooded area where he burned her, using lighter fluid he took from a nearby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>house. He then carried her burned body down the hill and covered the body with tires because he was scared. He stayed with the body all night long.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">{\u00b6 46} Kirkland then offered the following account of Esme\u2019s murder:</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">{\u00b6 47} At around 8:00 in the afternoon, as he was walking near the reservoir, Esme ran into him. She was apologetic, which only enraged Kirkland. He punched her, called her names, and demanded to know her name and what music she was listening to. At some point, he chased her into the woods, she tripped over a small fence, and he continued to punch and choke her.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">{\u00b6 48} At first, Kirkland denied raping Esme. But then he told Hilbert that Esme said that \u201cshe would do whatever I wanted, just don\u2019t hurt her,\u201d and he asked to have sex with her. However, he was unable to penetrate her completely, so he made her masturbate him manually. Then he choked her to death with his bare hands because he did not believe her when she said she would not tell anyone. In a subsequent interview, he elaborated that he had used a rag to strangle Esme when his efforts to kill her with his bare hands failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">{\u00b6 49} He propped up her body against a tree and stayed for two hours talking to her, apologizing to her. Then he tried to start a fire using her clothes as an accelerant. It was dark when he left to find lighter fluid \u201cto perform the ritual.\u201d He ate some food from a garbage can and eventually returned to the woods (but not the body), where he fell asleep until the police found him.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">{\u00b6 50} A third interview of Kirkland \u2014 also shown to the jury \u2014 commenced 30 minutes later. In the interview, detectives asked him about the unidentified burned body found in the spring of 2008. At first, Kirkland claimed to have killed only three victims. And then, after a great deal of discussion, Kirkland announced, \u201cI, three \u2014 I wasn\u2019t honest totally. * * * It was one more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">{\u00b6 51} Kirkland knew her as Kim. She was working as a prostitute when he met her on Reading Road in December 2006. He paid her $40, and they had sex. As they continued to drive together, an argument broke out, and Kirkland pulled the car over. He stabbed Kim in the throat with her own knife. He dumped her body up a dead-end hill. He laid the body out on a bed of wood and sprayed it with lighter fluid, then covered the body. He returned a few weeks later, to find the skeleton still in place, but the leg bones missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">{\u00b6 52} Police tried to identify those remains using information provided by Kirkland, including the fact that on the night she died, she and Kirkland had had an encounter with a uniformed police officer in Clifton who told them they could not be in a public park after dark. An investigator reviewed a month\u2019s worth of records showing license-verification requests sent by Cincinnati police to the state of California. The search revealed that on December 22, 2006, a police officer working in Clifton ran an \"inquiry on a California driver\u2019s license belonging to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Kimya Bodi Iamaya Corrine Rolison, whose date of birth roughly matched the one Kirkland remembered seeing on her license. The Rolison family confirmed that Kimya was missing. Dental records confirmed the identity of the body.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">{\u00b6 53} After the state finished playing the videotapes of Kirkland\u2019s confessions, and over the defense\u2019s objection, the state called Kylah W. to testify. Kylah testified that she was 13 years old in the fall of 2007. At the time, Kylah was living with her mother. Kirkland was a friend of her mother\u2019s who would sometimes stay with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">{\u00b6 54} Kylah testified that on September 26, 2007, she arrived home from school at about 3:30 in the afternoon and found herself alone in the apartment with Kirkland. Kylah was hungry, so she decided to cook herself a hamburger. She left the food cooking on low to go into her bedroom to talk to a friend on the telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">{\u00b6 55} According to Kylah, Kirkland knocked on her bedroom door, then opened the door, put the hamburger on top of her dresser, and left the room, closing the door behind him. Kylah continued her telephone conversation. But a short time later, Kirkland opened her door again, and this time his \u201cbottoms\u201d were down and his privates were exposed. Kirkland stood in the doorway without entering. Kylah repeatedly told him to get out of her room, which he eventually did.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">{\u00b6 56} Five or ten minutes later, Kirkland returned again. He was still exposing himself. This time he was carrying a piece of paper, and he approached Kylah and held the paper so she could read it. The note read, \u201cI want to be the first to eat you out and I\u2019ll pay you.\u201d Kylah continued telling him to leave, and Kirkland did.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">{\u00b6 57} But he came to her room a fourth time. This time he was dressed. He walked into her room, placed five dollars on the dresser, and walked out.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">{\u00b6 58} Unsure what to do, Kylah stayed on the phone with her friend for another ten minutes and then left the apartment. When she later told her mother what had happened, her mother told Kirkland to get out of the apartment, and then the two women went to the local police station to report the incident. Kirkland was eventually convicted of importuning and served about one year in prison, a fact the jury did not learn until the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">\n<em>The Defense Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">{\u00b6 59} The defense did not call witnesses during the guilt phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-14\">\n<em>Procedural History of the Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b243-15\">{\u00b6 60} On March 17, 2009, the state filed a 12-count indictment against Kirkland. The indictment included four counts of aggravated murder with death-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>penalty specifications. Count Two charged Kirkland with the aggravated murder of Casonya C. while committing or attempting to commit rape, a death-penalty specification under R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), and Count Four charged Kirkland with the aggravated murder of Casonya C. while committing or attempting to commit aggravated robbery, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). Counts Two and Four included \u201ccourse-of-conduct\u201d death-penalty specifications. R.C. 2929.04(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">{\u00b6 61} Counts Nine and Eleven contained rape and robbery aggravated-murder charges in connection with the death of Esme K. Each of these counts also included a course-of-conduct specification as well as an escape-detection-or-apprehension specification under R.C. 2929.04(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">{\u00b6 62} The indictment contained eight additional counts: Count One, attempted rape of Casonya; Count Three, aggravated robbery of Casonya; Count Six, murder of Mary Jo Newton; Count Eight, attempted rape of Esme K.; Count Ten, aggravated robbery of Esme K.; and Counts Five, Seven, and Twelve, gross abuse of a corpse.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">{\u00b6 63} Kirkland was indicted separately for murder and abuse of a corpse relating to Kimya Rolison. Over objection, the two indictments were consolidated for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">(\u00b6 64} On the morning of trial, Kirkland voluntarily entered a plea of guilty to the murder and abuse-of-a-corpse charges relating to Mary Jo Newton and Kimya Rolison. On March 12, 2010, the jury found Kirkland guilty on all the remaining counts, including all the death-penalty specifications, and recommended a sentence of death. For purposes of sentencing, the court merged the escape-detection specifications with the specifications of felony murder while attempting rape or robbery. The court then sentenced Kirkland to death for the aggravated murder of Esme K. while committing or attempting to commit a rape and for the aggravated murder of Casonya C. while committing or attempting to commit a robbery. The court also sentenced Kirkland to 70 years to life for the murders of Mary Jo Newton and Kimya Rolison.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">\n<em>Legal Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">{\u00b6 65} Kirkland seeks reversal of his convictions of aggravated murder and the sentence of death in ten propositions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">1. The admission of Kylah W.\u2019s testimony (Proposition of Law I)</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">{\u00b6 66} In his first proposition of law, Kirkland argues that the trial court violated Evid.R. 404(B) by allowing Kylah W. to testify that when she was 13 years old, Kirkland exposed himself to her and offered her $5 to engage in oral sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>{\u00b6 67} The trial court has broad discretion in the admission and exclusion of evidence, including evidence of other acts under Evid.R. 404(B). <em>State v. Morris, </em>132 Ohio St.3d 337, 2012-Ohio-2407, 972 N.E.2d 528, \u00b6 22. Unless the trial court has \u201cclearly abused its discretion and the defendant has been materially prejudiced thereby, this court should be slow to interfere\u201d with the exercise of such discretion. <em>State v. Hymore, </em>9 Ohio St.2d 122, 128, 224 N.E.2d 126 (1967). We have defined \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d as an \u201cunreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable use of discretion, or as a view or action that no conscientious judge could honestly have taken.\u201d <em>State v. Brady, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 375, 2008-Ohio-4493, 894 N.E.2d 671, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">{\u00b6 68} Evid.R. 404(B) states that \u201c[ejvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\u201d Such evidence may, however, be admissible for other purposes, \u201csuch as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d Evid.R. 404(B). Similarly, R.C. 2945.59 allows the admission of other-acts evidence tending to show a defendant\u2019s \u201cmotive or intent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant\u2019s scheme, plan, or system in doing the act in question.\u201d Generally, evidence of other acts is admissible if it is offered for a purpose other than to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity with that character, Evid.R. 404(B), it is relevant when offered for that purpose, Evid.R. 401, and the danger of unfair prejudice does not substantially outweigh its probative value, Evid.R. 403. <em>State v. Williams, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012-Ohio-5695, 983 N.E.2d 1278, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">{\u00b6 69} The trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting Kylah\u2019s testimony. The state introduced the evidence of her encounter with Kirkland for a valid purpose other than proving character in order to show that he had acted in conformity with that character: to show that Kirkland offered money to Casonya not \u201cjust to talk\u201d with her, as he told police, but that he had a sexual intent and motive for doing so. Nor did the trial court admit Kylah\u2019s testimony as proof of character. In fact, in its final instructions to the jury, the trial court told the jury that it could not consider evidence of any other acts for such a purpose. We presume that the jury followed this limiting instruction. <em>See id. </em>at \u00b6 23. Kylah\u2019s testimony was relevant to the attempted-rape allegations involving Casonya because it tended to show a fact \u201cof consequence,\u201d i.e., that Kirkland had a sexual interest in Casonya and a sexual purpose for approaching her. Evid.R. 401. Moreover, the attempted rape of Casonya was one of the only crimes the defense contested during the guilt phase, and Kylah\u2019s testimony was relevant to refute the defense\u2019s suggestion that Kirkland had an innocent purpose for offering Casonya money and that he did not have sex with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>{\u00b6 70} Finally, the danger of unfair prejudice did not substantially outweigh the probative value of Kylah\u2019s testimony. The trial court reduced any danger of undue prejudice in its limiting instruction to the jury. <em>See State v. Jones, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 10, 2012-Ohio-5677, 984 N.E.2d 948, \u00b6 194 (limiting instruction \u201cminimized the likelihood of any undue prejudice\u201d caused by the admission of Evid.R. 404(B) evidence); <em>see also Williams </em>at \u00b624. The only claim of prejudice in Kirkland\u2019s brief is his conclusory statement that Kylah\u2019s testimony \u201cmade the difference between life and death,\u201d a statement that seems to refer to the outcome of the mitigation phase rather than the guilt phase. Kirkland supports this claim by citing two newspaper articles that contain posttrial statements from the prosecuting attorney and one victim\u2019s stepmother. These materials are not in the record, and we cannot consider them. <em>State v. Ishmail, </em>54 Ohio St.2d 402, 377 N.E.2d 500 (1978), paragraph one of the syllabus (\u201cA reviewing court cannot add matter to the record before it, which was not part of the trial court\u2019s proceedings, and then decide the appeal on the basis of the new matter\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">{\u00b6 71} We overrule Kirkland\u2019s first proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">2. Ineffective assistance of counsel (Proposition of Law II)</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">{\u00b6 72} In his second proposition of law, Kirkland alleges two incidents of ineffective assistance of counsel. First, Kirkland alleges that his trial counsel told the jury in the mitigation-phase opening statement that an uncle would testify to explain why Kirkland\u2019s parents were not in attendance and why Kirkland should receive a sentence other than death. But the uncle was not called to the stand, and the jury was given no explanation in closing argument for the uncle\u2019s absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">{\u00b6 73} The record does not show defense counsel making any such representation to the jury in an opening statement, either at the guilt phase or the mitigation phase. Defense counsel told <em>the judge </em>that a family member might testify but later reported that the family would not cooperate. Those statements were made outside the presence of the jury. The record does not support this allegation of ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">{\u00b6 74} The second alleged deficiency concerns the testimony of Kirkland\u2019s mitigation expert witness, Dr. Scott Bresler, a forensic psychiatrist, who testified that Kirkland is a psychopath. Dr. Bresler testified that psychopaths have reduced serotonin levels and that a low serotonin level is associated with impulsive aggression. On cross-examination, Dr. Bresler conceded that no brain scans or chemical tests were performed on Kirkland. Kirkland now alleges that his counsel was ineffective for failing to arrange blood tests for possible lack of serotonin.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>{\u00b6 75} To prove an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must satisfy a two-prong test. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). First, he must establish that counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable representation. <em>Id. </em>at 687. And second, he must show that the deficient performance caused him prejudice. <em>Id. </em>A defendant can establish prejudice by showing a reasonable probability that but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the trial would have been different. <em>State v. Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989), paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">{\u00b6 76} Kirkland cannot prevail on this claim at this stage of the proceedings. To prove prejudice, he would need to show that the results of a serotonin test would support his case. In other words, he would need to supply proof outside the record, which this court cannot consider on direct appeal. <em>State v. Madrigal, </em>87 Ohio St.3d 378, 390-391, 721 N.E.2d 52 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">{\u00b6 77} We overrule Kirkland\u2019s second proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">3. Prosecutorial misconduct (Proposition of Law III)</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">{\u00b6 78} In his third proposition of law, Kirkland alleges prosecutorial misconduct in the course of penalty-phase closing arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">{\u00b6 79} Allegations of prosecutorial misconduct implicate due-process concerns, and the touchstone of the analysis is the \u201c \u2018fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Newton, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 13, 2006-Ohio-81, 840 N.E.2d 593, at \u00b6 92, quoting <em>Smith v. Phillips, </em>455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982). The test for prejudice in closing arguments, including penalty-phase closing arguments, is \u201c \u2018 \u201cwhether the remarks were improper, and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected substantial rights of the defendant.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Braden, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 354, 2003-Ohio-1325, 785 N.E.2d 439, \u00b6 83, quoting <em>State v. Hessler, </em>90 Ohio St.3d 108, 125, 734 N.E.2d 1237 (2000), quoting <em>State v. Smith, </em>14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 470 N.E.2d 883 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">{\u00b6 80} By the time the jury heard closing arguments in the penalty phase, Kirkland had already pled guilty to the murders of Mary Jo Newton and Kimya Rolison. In urging the jury to return a sentence of death for the other two murders, the prosecutor told the jury: \u201cFinally, for the murder of Mary Jo and Kimya, which he admitted to before opening statements, he\u2019s going to jail for the rest of his life now. He\u2019s gone. <em>So I guess Casonya and Esme are just freebies for him </em>\u2014 \u201d (Emphasis added.) The trial court did not sustain the defense\u2019s objection. Thereafter, the prosecutor stated, \u201cAgain, and I\u2019ll be very clear about this, [life in prison] should not be something you even consider, okay. He\u2019s going to jail on those other two for the rest of his life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>{\u00b6 81} According to Kirkland, the message to the jury was plain: if you do not return a recommendation of death, Kirkland will receive no punishment for two murders. Kirkland challenges these statements as improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">{\u00b6 82} We agree. \u201c[I]t is improper for a prosecutor to argue that a sentence less than death is meaningless and would not hold the defendant accountable for a victim\u2019s death when he is already serving a life sentence.\u201d <em>Hanson v. State, </em>2009 OK CR 13, 206 P.3d 1020, \u00b6 24. In capital-sentencing deliberations, the jury must weigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the offense. But by suggesting that Kirkland would receive no punishment for killing Esme and Casonya unless the jury returned a verdict of death for their murders, the state asked the jury to set aside its proper assignment and return a recommendation of death based on improper considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">{\u00b6 83} We also find that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument prejudicially affected Kirkland\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">{\u00b6 84} For a prosecutor\u2019s closing argument to be prejudicial, the remarks must be \u201cso inflammatory as to render the jury\u2019s decision a product solely of passion and prejudice.\u201d <em>State v. Williams, </em>23 Ohio St.3d 16, 20, 490 N.E.2d 906 (1986). To determine whether the remarks were prejudicial, the court must review the closing argument in its entirety. <em>State v. Slagle, </em>65 Ohio St.3d 597, 607, 605 N.E.2d 916 (1992); <em>State v. Moritz, </em>63 Ohio St.2d 150, 157, 407 N.E.2d 1268 (1980). Thus, the court must consider all of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, irrespective of whether the defense preserved an objection. <em>State v. Keenan, </em>66 Ohio St.3d 402, 410, 613 N.E.2d 203 (1993) (\u201ceven though the defense waived objection to many remarks, those remarks still form part of the context in which we evaluate the effect on the jury of errors that were not waived\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">{\u00b6 85} The objectionable statements in the state\u2019s closing argument fall into a number of categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">\n<em>References to the subjective experiences of the victims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">{\u00b6 86} It is error for a prosecutor to invite the jury to consider what the victim experienced and felt in her last moments of life, because it improperly \u201c \u2018invites the jury to speculate on facts not in evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Lynch, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 514, 2003-Ohio-2284, 787 N.E.2d 1185, \u00b6 122, quoting <em>State v. Wogenstahl, </em>75 Ohio St.3d 344, 357, 662 N.E.2d 311 (1996); <em>State v. Combs, </em>62 Ohio St.3d 278, 283, 581 N.E.2d 1071 (1991). The state\u2019s closing argument employed this method on a number of occasions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-10\">What was it like for Casonya that night? It was dark, she\u2019s alone, and the only person escorting her is him. * * * What was it like for her then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>* * * [AJfter he confronts Esme on the back of that building, he talks about how she\u2019s cringing and he\u2019s calling her names. You\u2019re nothing but a lying bitch, this little girl, 4-foot-ll. What did that evoke in her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-5\">And she\u2019s petrified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">What\u2019s this little girl going through naked in the woods except for her shoes and this little top? * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">We know at some point she\u2019s actually vomiting on herself she\u2019s so terrified. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-9\">* * * [Y]ou saw all the scrapes and cuts and raw skin on her back and on her behind. She probably never even felt that because of the horrible pain between her legs at that point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">\n<em>Facts outside the record</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">{\u00b6 87} A closing argument that goes beyond the record in order to arouse an emotional response in the jury may be prejudicial. <em>State v. Loza, </em>71 Ohio St.3d 61, 78-79, 641 N.E.2d 1082 (1994). Although the prosecution is entitled to a degree of latitude in closing argument, it is improper for prosecutors to incite the jurors\u2019 emotions through insinuations and assertions that are not supported by the evidence and that are therefore \u201ccalculated to mislead the jury.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>14 Ohio St.3d at 14, 470 N.E.2d 883.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">{\u00b6 88} After graphically describing the strangulation of Esme, the prosecutor concluded by saying, \u201c[S]he\u2019s not fighting anymore. She\u2019s not struggling. She just pounds her little hands on the ground and digs into the dirt. At that point she\u2019s no longer begging that man to let her live. <em>She\u2019s begging that man to let her die.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Nothing in the record supports the claim that Esme begged Kirkland to let her die.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-13\">{\u00b6 89} To generate jury sympathy for Casonya, the prosecutor said, \u201c[Y]ou talk about tough childhoods. How about her? Her dad is in prison when she\u2019s born. She hardly ever sees him. Her mom chose drugs over her little girl, and as a result she\u2019s brought up with some other brothers and sister and cousins by her grandma.\u201d None of this information is in the record. Casonya\u2019s grandmother, Patricia C., testified that she had custody of Casonya and two of her brothers \u201cbecause the mother ran into problems and the children were placed with me.\u201d Patricia did not identify the nature of the problems, much less testify that Casonya\u2019s mother chose drugs over her daughter. Nor is there any testimony about the father being in jail or Casonya living with sisters or cousins.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>\n<em>The \u201cnature and circumstances\u201d of the murder as aggravating circumstances</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">{\u00b6 90} While a prosecutor in the penalty phase of a capital trial may refer in closing argument to the nature and circumstances of the offense, that prosecutor may not \u201c \u2018make any comment before a jury that the nature and circumstances of the offense are \u201caggravating circumstances.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Were, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 448, 2008-Ohio-2762, 890 N.E.2d 263, \u00b6 209, quoting <em>Wogenstahl, </em>75 Ohio St.3d 344, 662 N.E.2d 311, paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>see also State v. Hale, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 118, 2008-Ohio-3426, 892 N.E.2d 864, \u00b6 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">{\u00b6 91} The state can describe the crime to prove the existence of the statutory aggravating factors. <em>Hale </em>at \u00b6 199-200 (a prosecutor described the circumstances of the murder to prove that the defendant acted with prior calculation and design, which is a statutory aggravating circumstance); <em>Newton, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 13, 2006-Ohio-81, 840 N.E.2d 593, at \u00b6 54 (the facts of the case were relevant to prove that the murder occurred while the defendant was in a prison); <em>State v. Jackson, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 53, 2005-0hio-5981, 836 N.E.2d 1173, at \u00b6 93 (the state could properly have victims testify in the penalty phase about their experience to establish the course-of-conduct aggravating circumstance).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">{\u00b6 92} The state may also argue the nature and circumstances of the offense to suggest that there is nothing mitigating about the circumstances of the offense. <em>State v. Davis, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 404, 2008-Ohio-2, 880 N.E.2d 31, \u00b6 324; <em>State v. Hoffner, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 358, 2004-Ohio-3430, 811 N.E.2d 48, \u00b6 79; <em>State v. Bryan, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 272, 2004-Ohio-971, 804 N.E.2d 433, \u00b6 178-179. And, if the defense argues that the nature or circumstances of the crime is actually mitigating, the state may argue the nature and circumstances of the offense to rebut the defense\u2019s assertion. <em>State v. Frazier, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 139, 2007-Ohio-5048, 873 N.E.2d 1263, at \u00b6 184; <em>State v. Smith, </em>87 Ohio St.3d 424, 443-444, 721 N.E.2d 93 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">{\u00b6 93} And finally, the state may argue the nature and circumstances of the aggravating offense to explain why the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigation evidence. <em>State v. Sheppard, </em>84 Ohio St.3d 230, 238, 703 N.E.2d 286 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">{\u00b6 94} But the state may not tell the decisionmaker that the nature and circumstances of the murder itself are the aggravating circumstances. <em>State v. Ketterer, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 70, 2006-Ohio-5283, 855 N.E.2d 48, \u00b6 165-166. Nor can the prosecutor tell the jury to weigh the circumstances of the murder as aggravating circumstances against the mitigation evidence. <em>State v. Skatzes, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 195, 2004-Ohio-6391, 819 N.E.2d 215, \u00b6 189; <em>State v. Clemons, </em>82 Ohio St.3d 438, 446-447, 696 N.E.2d 1009 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">{\u00b6 95} In this case, the prosecution repeatedly urged the jury to weigh the specific details of the murder against the mitigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>[Kirkland] wants you to say, hey, I\u2019m a psychopath, that outweighs what I did. It does just the opposite.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">And the last thing he tells us as he\u2019s choking the life out of that little girl and squeezing the last breaths out of her little body, he says she\u2019s not fighting anymore. She\u2019s not struggling. She just pounds her little hands on the ground and digs into the dirt. At that point she\u2019s no longer begging that man to let her live. She\u2019s begging that man to let her die. And thankfully it ended for her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\">\n<em>You\u2019ll never see a case with aggravating circumstances that weigh more or mitigation that weighs any less.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">* * * He takes a rag out of the back of his pocket. He twists it up and he slowly and methodically strangles Esme [K.] to death. She never fought. She dug her fingers into the dirt as she vomited and slowly died.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-10\"><em>Now, let\u2019s weigh that against the mitigation </em>that he is a psychopath and a self-proclaimed monster. Again, ladies and gentlemen, strike four, not even a close call.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">(Emphasis added.) With these remarks, the state led the jurors to believe that they had to weigh the circumstances of the murder itself against the mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">{\u00b6 96} In sum, we find that the state\u2019s closing remarks in the penalty phase were improper and substantially prejudicial. Accordingly, we conclude that Kirkland\u2019s third proposition of law is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">{\u00b6 97} Nevertheless, we decline to remand the case for a new sentencing hearing. Pursuant to R.C. 2929.05(A), this court must conduct its own independent evaluation of the capital sentence, and that evaluation can cure errors in penalty-phase proceedings. <em>See, e.g., Hale, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 118, 2008-Ohio-3426, 892 N.E.2d 864, at \u00b6 131-132 (improper questions of a penalty-phase witness were cured by the independent sentence review); <em>State v. Sanders, </em>92 Ohio St.3d 245, 267, 750 N.E.2d 90 (2001) (the independent review can cure a trial court\u2019s erroneous decision to exclude a witness, whose testimony had been proffered, from the mitigation hearing). In <em>State v. Mills, </em>62 Ohio St.3d 357, 373-374, 582 N.E.2d 972 (1992), for example, this court held that a prosecutor\u2019s sentencing argument was \u201cclearly improper\u201d but that the court\u2019s independent sentence evaluation would cure any prejudice the argument had caused.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-14\">{\u00b6 98} Accordingly, the issues raised in the third proposition of law will be cured by this court\u2019s review of the sentence, which will not consider the state\u2019s improper arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>4. \u201cAutomatic death\u201d jurors (Proposition of Law IV)</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">{\u00b6 99} In his fourth proposition of law, Kirkland claims ineffective assistance of counsel based on his trial counsel\u2019s alleged failure to weed out those jurors who would automatically vote for death without regard to mitigating factors. Kirkland asserts that his counsel performed only a \u201cgarden variety\u201d felony-jury selection, rather than a specialized, specific, and focused voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">{\u00b6 100} This proposition of law does not satisfy either prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test. Kirkland does not identify a question that his attorneys should have asked but did not, a question that they did ask but should not have, or a specific objection that they failed to raise. Therefore, we have no basis on which to conclude that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">{\u00b6 101} Likewise, we have no basis on which to conclude that the manner in which defense counsel conducted voir dire resulted in prejudice. In fact, defense counsel did identify at least one \u201cautomatic death\u201d member of the panel and successfully had that person removed for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">{\u00b6 102} We overrule Kirkland\u2019s fourth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">5. The weight of mitigation evidence (Proposition of Law V)</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">{\u00b6 103} In his fifth proposition of law, Kirkland challenges his sentence of death, given the alleged weight of mitigation. This presents an issue best addressed concurrently with the court\u2019s independent sentence evaluation, and we will discuss it in that context. <em>See Jones, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 10, 2012-Ohio-5677, 984 N.E.2d 948, at \u00b6 211 (consideration of a challenge to a trial court\u2019s weighing of aggravating and mitigating factors deferred until the independent sentence evaluation).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">6. Constitutional challenges to the death penalty (Proposition of Law VI)</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">{\u00b6 104} Kirkland\u2019s sixth proposition of law consists of nine subparts (some with multiple subheadings) challenging the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death penalty.

Use of the same jury at trial and sentencing burdens a defendant\u2019s rights to counsel and an impartial jury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">{\u00b6 111} This court rejected this argument in <em>State v.

Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes unconstitutionally fail to provide individualized sentencing because they require proof of aggravating circumstances during the guilt phase</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">{\u00b6 112} This court rejected this argument in <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 451, 2006-Ohio-1502, 844 N.E.2d 806, \u00b6 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">\n<em>Subpart 3(C).

Van Hook, </em>39 Ohio St.3d 256, 264, 530 N.E.2d 883 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-14\">\n<em>Subpart 3(D). R.C. 2929.0MB)(7) unconstitutionally allows a sentencer to convert mitigation evidence into an aggravating factor</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b253-15\">{\u00b6 114} This court rejected this argument in <em>State v.

R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) is unconstitutional because, by setting forth as aggravating factors the same felony-murder specifications that distinguish aggravated murder from murder, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) does nothing to narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aq6\">{\u00b6 115} This court rejected this argument in <em>State v. Henderson, </em>39 Ohio St.3d 24, 28-29, 528 N.E.2d 1237 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">\n<em>Subpart 5. R.C. 2929.08(D)(1) and 2929.04 are unconstitutionally vague</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AgY\">{\u00b6 116} This court rejected a vagueness challenge to R.C. 2929.03(D)(1) in <em>State v. McNeill, </em>83 Ohio St.3d 438, 453, 700 N.E.2d 596 (1998). We upheld R.C. 2929.04 in <em>State v.

The court\u2019s proportionality review is unconstitutional</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ARk\">{\u00b6 117} This court summarily rejected this argument in <em>Jones, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 10, 2012-Ohio-5677, 984 N.E.2d 948, at \u00b6 207, and <em>Scott, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 31, 2004-Ohio-10, 800 N.E.2d 1133, at \u00b6 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">\n<em>Subpart 7. Lethal injection is cruel and unusual punishment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AZr\">{\u00b6 118} Kirkland argues that lethal injection violates the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. However, the United States Supreme Court has affirmed the constitutionality of lethal injection as a method of execution. <em>Baze v. Rees, </em>553 U.S. 35, 128 S.Ct. 1520, 170 L.Ed.2d 420 (2008). This court has reached the same conclusion. <em>State v. Adams, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 508, 2004-Ohio-5845, 817 N.E.2d 29, \u00b6 131; <em>State v. Carter, </em>89 Ohio St.3d 593, 608, 734 N.E.2d 345 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">\n<em>Subpart 8. The death penalty violates Ohio\u2019s obligations under international charters, treaties, and conventions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A4H\">{\u00b6 119} This court has addressed most, but not all, of these claims before. In <em>State v. Phillips, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 72, 103-104, 656 N.E.2d 643 (1995), we held that capital punishment does not violate obligations owed under the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man. We reaffirmed this holding as to the Declaration in <em>State v. Issa, </em>93 Ohio St.3d 49, 69, 752 N.E.2d 904 (2001). And in <em>Short, </em>we rejected claims that the death penalty is barred by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the United Nations Covenant against Torture, and the international-law norm. 129 Ohio St.3d 360, 2011-Ohio-3641, 952 N.E.2d 1121, at \u00b6 138, citing <em>Buell v. Mitchell, </em>274 F.3d 337, 370-372 (6th Cir.2001); <em>People v. Perry, </em>38 Cal.4th 302, 322, 42 Cal.Rptr.3d 30, 132 P.3d 235 (2006); <em>Sorto v. State, </em>173 S.W.3d 469, 490 (Tex.Crim.App.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">{\u00b6 120} However, we have not previously addressed the contention that Ohio\u2019s death-penalty scheme violates the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination or the Convention Against Torture and Other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment of Punishment. But as noted above, we have repeatedly held that Ohio\u2019s death-penalty procedures are not unconstitutional or imposed in a racially discriminatory manner. <em>See, e.g., Short </em>at \u00b6 137; <em>Mink, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 350, 2004-Ohio-1580, 805 N.E.2d 1064, at \u00b6 103. And Kirkland \u201chas not advanced any argument that these issues, as defined under international law, differ in any significant way from the constitutional arguments * * * already addressed, e.g., that equal protection and arbitrariness would be evaluated differently under international law than they are under the United States or Ohio Constitutions.\u201d <em>State v. Skatzes, </em>2d Dist. Montgomery No. 15848, 2003-Ohio-516, 2003 WL 24196406, \u00b6 407; <em>see also State v. Tenace, </em>6th Dist. Lucas No. L-00-1002, 2003-Ohio-3458, 2003 WL 21500249, \u00b6 175-185. In short, these claims fail for the same reasons as prior death-penalty challenges based on international law.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">{\u00b6 121} Finally, in subpart 9, Kirkland presents a general challenge to the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death penalty. Because this claim is wholly conclusory, we summarily reject this argument. <em>Carter, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 607, 734 N.E.2d 345; <em>Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 179, 473 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">{\u00b6 122} For these reasons, we reject Kirkland\u2019s sixth proposition of law in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">7. Ohio\u2019s jury instructions (Proposition of Law VII)</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">{\u00b6 123} Consistent with the definition set forth in R.C. 2901.05(E), the trial court instructed the jury that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-10\">[rjeasonable doubt is present when the jurors, after they have carefully considered and compared all the evidence, cannot say they are firmly convinced of the truth of the charge. It is a doubt based on reason and common sense. Reasonable doubt is not mere possible doubt because everything relating to human affairs or depending on moral evidence is open to some possible or imaginary doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-11\">Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof of such character that an ordinary person would be willing to rely and act upon it in the most important of his or her own affairs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">Kirkland contends in his seventh proposition that the phrases \u201cwilling to act\u201d and \u201cfirmly convinced\u201d allowed the jury to convict based on a lower standard of proof, namely clear and convincing evidence, in violation of due process. And he alleges that the use of the phrase \u201cmoral evidence\u201d allowed the jury to convict based on subjective moral decisions, rather than demanding proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>{\u00b6 124} We have repeatedly upheld the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s reasonable-doubt instruction. <em>Frazier, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 139, 2007-Ohio-5048, 873 N.E.2d 1263, \u00b6 242; <em>State v. Gapen, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 358, 2004-Ohio-6548, 819 N.E.2d 1047, \u00b6 145. The phrases \u201cwilling to act\u201d and \u201cfirmly convinced\u201d adequately convey the difficult concept of reasonable doubt, and they do not establish a lower, clear-and-convincing standard. <em>State v. Nabozny, </em>54 Ohio St.2d 195, 201-203, 375 N.E.2d 784 (1978), citing <em>Holland v. United States, </em>348 U.S. 121, 139-140, 75 S.Ct. 127, 99 L.Ed. 150 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">{\u00b6 125} This court has not specifically discussed the constitutionality of the phrase \u201cmoral evidence.\u201d <em>Compare State v. Frazier, </em>8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 62557, 1994 WL 50703 (Feb. 17, 1994), <em>with State v. Frazier, </em>73 Ohio St.3d 323, 330, 652 N.E.2d 1000 (1995). However, the United States Supreme Court has considered the meaning of that phrase and concluded that the phrase \u201cmoral evidence\u201d means the same thing as \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Victor v. Nebraska, </em>511 U.S. 1, 10-12, 114 S.Ct. 1239, 127 L.Ed.2d 583 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">{\u00b6 126} Based upon <em>Victor, </em>we reject Kirkland\u2019s seventh proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">8. Imposition of costs on indigent defendants (Proposition of Law VIII)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">{\u00b6 127} In <em>State v. White, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 580, 2004-Ohio-5989, 817 N.E.2d 393, we held that the imposition of court costs upon an indigent defendant does not violate the Equal Protection Clause. In a subsequent decision, this court held that \u201calthough costs in criminal cases are assessed at sentencing and are included in the sentencing entry, costs are not punishment.\u201d <em>State v. Threatt, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 277, 2006-Ohio-905, 843 N.E.2d 164, \u00b6 15. If the imposition of costs does not constitute \u201cpunishment,\u201d it cannot implicate constitutional prohibitions on cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">{\u00b6 128} Kirkland asks the court to reconsider its rulings in <em>White </em>and <em>Threatt </em>but provides no compelling reason, such as an intervening change in United States Supreme Court precedent, to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">{\u00b6 129} Alternatively, Kirkland suggests that the court should stay the collection of costs. But the logic of <em>White </em>suggests no reason why felons should be exempt from payment of costs while they remain incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">{\u00b6 130} Accordingly, we reject Kirkland\u2019s eighth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">9. Insufficient evidence of attempted rape and/or aggravated robbery (Proposition of Law IX)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-13\">{\u00b6 131} Kirkland asserts that the state presented insufficient evidence to convict him of attempted rape or robbery in connection with the murder of Casonya C. At the close of the evidence, the defense moved for acquittal on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>these charges. The trial court denied the motion and allowed all the charges to proceed to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">{\u00b6 132} When reviewing a record for sufficiency, we must consider whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Leonard, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, \u00b6 77; <em>State v. Jenks, </em>61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus. The court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and defer to the trier of fact on questions of credibility and the weight assigned to the evidence. <em>State v. Fry, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 163, 2010-Ohio-1017, 926 N.E.2d 1239, \u00b6 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\n<em>Aggravated robbery</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">{\u00b6 133} Count Four of the indictment charged Kirkland with aggravated murder and included an aggravated-robbery specification. \u201cAggravated robbery\u201d means a theft offense in which the offender inflicts or attempts to inflict serious physical harm on another. R.C. 2911.01(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">{\u00b6 134} The state provided sufficient evidence to support the charge based on the fact that Casonya\u2019s backpack and cell phone were never located. Tania H. testified that Casonya always carried her book bag with her. Patricia C. testified that the book bag was missing. And Kirkland and Ra\u2019Shaud B. agreed that Casonya was talking on her cell phone at the time she encountered Kirkland. These facts are sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction for aggravated robbery. <em>See State v. Davis, </em>76 Ohio St.3d 107, 115-116, 666 N.E.2d 1099 (1996).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">\n<em>Attempted rape</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">{\u00b6 135} The relevant definition of rape is \u201cengaging] in sexual conduct with another when the offender purposely compels the other person to submit by force or threat of force.\u201d R.C. 2907.02(A)(2). A criminal attempt occurs when a person, \u201cpurposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, * * * engage[s] in conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.\u201d R.C. 2923.02(A). We have likened Ohio\u2019s definition of \u201cattempt\u201d to that in the Model Penal Code, which requires that the offender not only intended to commit the completed offense, but also engaged in conduct constituting a substantial step toward completing the offense. <em>State v. Woods, </em>48 Ohio St.2d 127, 132, 357 N.E.2d 1059 (1976), <em>overruled on other grounds, State v. Downs, </em>51 Ohio St.2d 47, 364 N.E.2d 1140 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>(1977). \u201cTo constitute a substantial step, the conduct must be strongly corroborative of the actor\u2019s criminal purpose.\u201d <em>Woods </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">{\u00b6 136} Kirkland confessed to killing Casonya after she rejected his offer of money \u201cto talk.\u201d Any rational juror could have equated this offer with an offer of sex, and even Kirkland concedes \u201csoliciting Casonya to have sex for hire\u201d in his brief. Kirkland\u2019s description of the conversation with Casonya was replete with sexual innuendo. Kirkland told police that when he asked Casonya if she was old enough to smoke marijuana, she replied that \u201cshe was old enough to be doing a lot of things.\u201d According to Kirkland, he began arguing with Casonya about \u201cgirls playing games\u201d and th\u00e9 \u201cthings that some women wouldn\u2019t do,\u201d and Casonya threw the money back at him.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">{\u00b6 137} That Kirkland attacked Casonya <em>only after </em>she refused his sexual advances created a strong inference that he acted with a sexual purpose \u2014 that being, to forcibly compel from her what she had refused to give him. The physical evidence corroborated this purpose. Casonya\u2019s body was found in the woods, with nothing more than one sock, indicating that Kirkland transported her to a secluded area and forcibly undressed her. <em>See State v. Scudder, </em>71 Ohio St.3d 263, 274-275, 643 N.E.2d 524 (1994) (finding that the location of the victim\u2019s pants around her ankles and underwear at midthigh supported the conclusion that she was forcibly undressed); <em>State v. Biros, 78 </em>Ohio St.3d 426, 448, 678 N.E.2d 891 (1997) (the fact that the victim\u2019s sweater, pants, and undergarments were never found revealed the defendant\u2019s \u201cconcealment or destruction\u201d of evidence and \u201cconsciousness of guilt\u201d for purposes of proving attempted rape). Moreover, Kirkland burned Casonya\u2019s entire body so severely that her \u201cpelvic area had almost been completely charred by fire,\u201d and so similarly to that of 13-year-old Esme K., whom he did confess to raping. This court has previously found that the \u201cevisceration\u201d of a victim\u2019s sexual organs can create a \u201creasonable inference\u201d of an \u201cattempt[ ] to conceal evidence of rape or attempted rape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While there was no testimony about where the fire originated on Casonya\u2019s body, there was evidence that the burning of Esme\u2019s body originated in her pubic area. Kirkland\u2019s burning of Casonya revealed the consciousness of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">{\u00b6 138} Viewing the evidence, including all permissible inferences, in favor of the state, we find that any rational trier of fact could conclude that Kirkland formed a purpose to forcibly rape Casonya and engaged in a course of conduct\u2014 i.e., grabbing, choking, transporting her to a secluded area, and undressing her\u2014 qualifying as a substantial step toward the completion of that crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">{\u00b6 139} Accordingly, we overrule Kirkland\u2019s ninth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">10. Cumulative error (Proposition of Law X)</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">{\u00b6 140} In his tenth proposition of law, Kirkland argues that the court should reverse his conviction based on the doctrine of cumulative error. Under that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>doctrine, this court will reverse a conviction when the cumulative effect of errors deprives a defendant of a fair trial even though each of the instances of trial-court error does not individually constitute cause for reversal. <em>State v. Powell, </em>132 Ohio St.3d 233, 2012-Ohio-2577, 971 N.E.2d 865, at \u00b6 223; <em>State v. DeMarco, </em>31 Ohio St.3d 191, 196-197, 509 N.E.2d 1256 (1987). Cumulative error does not apply in cases such as this one where any error in the trial court is curable through the court\u2019s independent review. <em>State v. Brown, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 51, 2003-Ohio-5059, 796 N.E.2d 506, \u00b6 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\n<em>Independent Sentence Evaluation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">{\u00b6 141} Having considered Kirkland\u2019s propositions of law, this court must now independently review Kirkland\u2019s death sentence. First, the court must review and independently weigh all facts and other evidence disclosed in the record, \u201cand consider the offense and the offender to determine whether the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing outweigh the mitigating factors in the case, and whether the sentence of death is appropriate.\u201d R.C. 2929.05(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\n<em>Aggravating circumstances</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">{\u00b6 142} The evidence at trial established beyond a reasonable doubt that Kirkland murdered Esme K., with the aggravating circumstance of murdering her while committing or attempting rape or aggravated robbery. The evidence also established beyond a reasonable doubt that he murdered Casonya C. with the aggravating circumstance of murdering her while committing or attempting aggravated robbery or rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">{\u00b6 143} The jury also found an additional aggravating circumstance in connection with each murder, namely that the murders were part of a course of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">\n<em>Mitigating evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">{\u00b6 144} Against these aggravating circumstances, this court must weigh the evidence in mitigation submitted by Kirkland.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">{\u00b6 145} Kirkland called a single witness to testify in mitigation. Dr. Scott Bresler testified that he had performed an evaluation of Anthony Kirkland. He diagnosed Kirkland as having \u201can adjustment disorder with mixed emotional issues and conduct\u201d as well as an antisocial personality disorder. Kirkland\u2019s condition causes him to have trouble thinking as well as difficulty in emotions, interpersonal functioning, and impulse control. In lay terms, he is a psychopath.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">{\u00b6 146} Dr. Bresler testified that the condition manifests in unlawful behaviors, a pattern of deceitfulness, impulsivity, irritability, extreme aggressiveness, reckless disregard for the safety of himself and others, \u201ca consistent kind of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>irresponsibility over a life force,\u201d and lack of remorse. The problem manifests at an early age. Individuals appear to be genetically predisposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">{\u00b6 147} At the same time, the circumstances of his upbringing played a role. Kirkland\u2019s biological father was alcohol-dependent and extremely violent toward Kirkland and his mother. Until his father left (when Kirkland was about nine or ten), Kirkland was often beaten by his father, often watched his father beat his mother, and was forced to watch his father rape his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">{\u00b6 148} By his early teens, Kirkland had engaged in extensive substance abuse. He often fought with other kids. He suffered from depression, for which he did not seek treatment until his adult years.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">{\u00b6 149} Meanwhile, his mother remarried and got help for herself and some of the children, but not Kirkland, who was the oldest. As a result, his attachment to his family, which the forensic psychiatrist testified allows a person to adapt to the world and to live responsibly, was damaged. Throughout his adulthood, he formed no stable relationships, maintained no steady income, drank and took drugs, and, after his release from prison, became homeless. According to Dr. Bresler, Kirkland \u201ccannot live responsibly in society ever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">{\u00b6 150} Dr. Bresler also testified that Kirkland was able to justify his crimes, with one exception: he cannot rationalize his killing of Esme K., and \u201cso oftentimes when he talks about her he\u2019ll cry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">{\u00b6 151} Finally, Dr. Bresler stated that Kirkland would have a difficult time adjusting to life in prison, but prison can handle him, as shown by the fact that he had already spent 17 years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">{\u00b6 152} This statement from Dr. Bresler was the first time the jury learned that Kirkland spent an extended period of time in jail. Kirkland went to prison in 1987 after murdering Leola Douglas and setting her on fire. And while he was incarcerated, he threatened various prison officials and staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">{\u00b6 153} Finally, Dr. Bresler testified on cross-examination that Kirkland\u2019s sisters were sexually abused by their father, and also by Kirkland himself when he was 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">{\u00b6 154} Kirkland made a brief unsworn statement to the jury. He accepted responsibility for the deaths of the four women. He said he \u201cget[s] so angry and cannot stop [himjself,\u201d though he acknowledged that was no excuse. He expressed a desire to be locked away forever. \u201cI cannot believe how horrible I am.

Cunningham, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 197, 2004-Ohio-7007, 824 N.E.2d 504, \u00b6 138; <em>Hoffner, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 358, 2004-Ohio-3430, 811 N.E.2d 48, at \u00b6 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">{\u00b6 157} \u2022 His abusive childhood: The court accords some, but not decisive, weight to evidence that the defendant suffered an abusive childhood. <em>Powell, </em>132 Ohio St.3d 233, 2012-Ohio-2577, 971 N.E.2d 865, at \u00b6 276; <em>Hale, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 118, 2008-Ohio-3426, 892 N.E.2d 864, at \u00b6 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">{\u00b6 158} \u2022 His history of alcohol and drug abuse: A history of drug and alcohol abuse is entitled to weight in mitigation. <em>Scott, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 31, 2004-Ohio-10, 800 N.E.2d 1133, \u00b6 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">{\u00b6 159} \u2022 His confession and cooperation with police: A defendant\u2019s confession and cooperation with law enforcement are mitigating factors. <em>State v. Bethel, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 416, 2006-Ohio-4853, 854 N.E.2d 150, \u00b6 191. The mitigation value of Kirkland\u2019s confessions would usually receive little weight, given that he initially lied to police and tried to blame Esme K.\u2019s murder on the fictitious Pedro. <em>State v. Perez, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 122, 2009-Ohio-6179, 920 N.E.2d 104, \u00b6 247. However, in the peculiar circumstances here, we believe Kirkland\u2019s confession is entitled to serious consideration because the information he voluntarily provided enabled the police to identify the body of Kimya Rolison, and thus her family was able to learn what had happened to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">{\u00b6 160} \u2022 Remorse: Apologies and expressions of remorse in an unsworn statement are given some mitigating weight. <em>State v. Trimble, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 297, 2009-Ohio-2961, 911 N.E.2d 242, at \u00b6 327. Although the transcript cannot capture his tone or affect, there is no question that Kirkland expressed a good deal of self-loathing in his unsworn statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">{\u00b6 161} The sincerity of his remorse was a hotly contested issue. Dr. Bresler testified that Kirkland cried during their sessions when he talked about killing Esme K. Detective Hilbert, on the other hand, had the impression that when Kirkland cried during his police interviews, it was more out of self-regard than concern for the victims. Kirkland\u2019s allocution consisted of six simple words: \u201cOffer an apology to the family.\u201d The statement is revealing: he apologized to the <em>family, </em>singular, probably the family of Esme K. Whatever credit he is due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>for his remorse over killing Esme is offset by his apparent lack of remorse for the pain and suffering he caused his other victims and their families. His expressions of remorse are too infrequent, too ambiguous, and ultimately too self-serving to justify according them significant weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">{\u00b6 162} \u2022 Mercy: The trial court gave some mitigating value to Kirkland\u2019s request for mercy in his unsworn statement. But mercy is not a mitigating factor. <em>State v. O\u2019Neal, </em>87 Ohio St.3d 402, 416, 721 N.E.2d 73 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">{\u00b6 163} In <em>State v. Tenace, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 255, 2006-Ohio-2417, 847 N.E.2d 386, \u00b6 97-106, this court vacated a death sentence on the grounds that the aggravating circumstances of the offense did not outweigh the mitigating factors. The court afforded great weight to the tragic circumstances of Tenace\u2019s childhood. Both his parents were criminals and substance abusers, and they were neglectful and abusive to the children. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 103. Tenace was sexually abused himself, including being sold by his mother for sexual services, and forced to watch the sexual abuse of his sister. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 102. He was exposed to substance abuse by his mother and her boyfriends, who encouraged him to commit crimes. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">{\u00b6 164} In contrast, we declined to vacate the death sentence based on childhood circumstances in <em>State v. Mundt, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 22, 2007-Ohio-4836, 873 N.E.2d 828, \u00b6 206. Mundt\u2019s mother had eight children by four different fathers. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 192. A children\u2019s protective agency removed Mundt from his mother\u2019s custody for one month when he was an infant. <em>Id. </em>And when he was approximately five years old, his mother voluntarily surrendered custody of her children because she was homeless. <em>Id. </em>However, this court concluded that Mundt\u2019s mitigation evidence \u201cpresent[ed] nothing comparable to <em>Tenace.\u201d Id. </em>at \u00b6 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">{\u00b6 165} Kirkland\u2019s case falls somewhere between the extremes represented by <em>Tenace </em>and <em>Mundt. </em>The testimony of pervasive physical and sexual abuse in Kirkland\u2019s home exceeds anything alleged by Mundt. At the same time, it does not equate to the facts in <em>Tenace. </em>Kirkland was abused by one parent, his father, George Palmore. So unlike Tenace, Kirkland had one nonabusive parent in his life. Moreover, his father left the home when Kirkland was nine or ten years old, and there is no evidence that any abuse continued during his teen years when he lived with his mother. The fact that Kirkland is a psychopath from a dysfunctional home is tragic, but not sufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstances of his crimes, even when coupled with the other mitigating factors identified above.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">{\u00b6 166} We therefore affirm the sentence and, in doing so, reject Kirkland\u2019s contention that the aggravating circumstances did not outweigh the mitigating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>\n<em>Proportionality review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">{\u00b6 167} The second part of the court\u2019s independent review requires us to decide whether a sentence of death satisfies the requirement of proportionality. R.C. 2929.05(A) requires this court to \u201cconsider whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">{\u00b6 168} In <em>Jones, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 10, 2012-Ohio-5677, 984 N.E.2d 948, at \u00b6 265, this court affirmed the defendant\u2019s death sentence for aggravated murder in the course of committing a rape. The court has also affirmed death sentences in cases combining a course-of-conduct specification with a robbery-murder specification. <em>See Perez, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 122, 2009-Ohio-6179, 920 N.E.2d 104, at \u00b6 253, and cases cited therein.

The state argues that \u201c[pjhone records demonstrated the continued use of the phone after Casonya\u2019s death,\u201d thus suggesting that Kirkland had possession of the cell phone.

The state had a seemingly airtight case against Kirkland, but overzealousness in both the guilt and punishment phases has tainted its efforts; this court will taint the law if we bless the state\u2019s actions. In regard to the penalty phase, I concur in Justice Lanzinger\u2019s opinion that Kirkland should be resentenced due to the prejudicial effects of prosecutorial misconduct. In regard to the guilt phase, I write separately to dissent from the majority\u2019s holding sustaining Kirkland\u2019s conviction on the attempted rape of Casonya C.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">{\u00b6 170} I dissent from the majority\u2019s holding regarding the \u201cother acts\u201d evidence introduced at trial through the testimony of Kylah W. Kylah testified that when she was 13 years old, Kirkland had exposed himself to her and solicited sex from her. In my judgment, Evid.R. 404(B) should have precluded the admission of that testimony; also, its admission was unfairly prejudicial pursuant to Evid.R. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>{\u00b6 171} The state\u2019s theory is that Kirkland\u2019s September 26, 2007 offer to pay Kylah for a sex act is evidence that is admissible to prove that Kirkland attempted to rape Casonya over a year earlier, in May 2006. There is no doubt that the testimony regarding Kirkland\u2019s exposing himself to Kylah and offering to pay her for a sex act are revelatory. The acts show him to be an evil person who sexualizes underage girls and is willing to pay for sex. That is, the evidence demonstrates his <em>character. </em>The state admitted as much in its closing argument when it told the jury that the kind of a man who would pay a girlfriend\u2019s child for sex acts is the kind of man who would rape Casonya:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">First count, again, is a charge of attempted rape; that when he approached Casonya [C.] on that bridge, when he walked with her and when he offered her money, it was an act, it was an attempt to have sexual contact with her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">And, again, this is where the other acts testimony comes in. * * * This is a young girl [Kylah W.] that actually was the daughter of one of his girlfriends, but he sees her as he sees all women, as a sex object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">And what does he do, offers this little 13-year-old girl, whose mother actually is nice enough to let him live there from time to time, five dollars for, his words, to be the first to eat her out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-9\">But he wants you to believe that when confronted by a stranger, a 14-year-old girl walking across the bridge, he offered her 20 dollars and it got up to 60 dollars to talk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-10\">Well, I\u2019m sure if this little girl was offered 60 dollars just to talk, she would have taken it, but something he said or did made her take that money, throw it back in this predator\u2019s face and knee him. Did she do that because he said let\u2019s talk, or did he say I want to have sex with you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-11\">^ Hi Hi</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-12\">You look at his pattern. You look at what he does when he sees a woman. You see what\u2019s in his eyes. He sees sex. And he\u2019s going to get it. He\u2019ll barter for it, he\u2019ll pay for it, but he\u2019s gonna get it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-13\">We don\u2019t know if he was successful or not [in raping Casonya C.]. He did a pretty good job destroying it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-14\">As demonstrated by the state\u2019s use of the evidence in closing argument, Kylah\u2019s testimony was not relevant to prove any consequential fact. Its only probative value was to show that Kirkland is a very bad person who would pay for sex with an underage girl, and therefore he <em>must </em>have raped Casonya.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>{\u00b6 172} Evidence that an accused committed a crime other than the one for which he is on trial is not admissible when its sole purpose is to show the accused\u2019s propensity or inclination to commit crime, that is, to show that he acted in conformity with his bad character. <em>State v. Curry, </em>43 Ohio St.2d 66, 68, 330 N.E.2d 720 (1975). Evid.R. 404(B) codifies the common law with respect to evidence of other acts of wrongdoing and is construed against admissibility. <em>State v. Lowe, </em>69 Ohio St.3d 527, 530, 634 N.E.2d 616 (1994). The standard for determining the admissibility of such evidence is strict. <em>State v. Broom, </em>40 Ohio St.3d 277, 533 N.E.2d 682 (1988), paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">{\u00b6 173} Evid.R. 404(B) establishes when other-acts evidence is admissible:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The majority rules that Kylah\u2019s testimony is admissible under Evid.R. 404(B) because Kirkland\u2019s act \u2014 soliciting Kylah \u2014 demonstrated that \u201che had a sexual intent and motive\u201d for offering Casonya, money. Majority opinion at \u00b6 69. But Kirkland faces the death penalty for the death of Casonya not because he offered her money for a sex act but because he allegedly attempted to rape her before killing her. Intent to solicit sex is not the same thing as intent to compel sex. And murder committed in anger because a sexual advance has been refused is not the same crime as murder in the course of rape. The state needed to show, pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B), that the act of soliciting Kylah established a motive for the attempted rape of Casonya or that the act of soliciting Kylah established that Kirkland\u2019s intent was to rape Casonya. On the pivotal question of whether Kirkland attempted to rape Casonya, Kylah\u2019s testimony sheds no light. When Kylah rejected Kirkland\u2019s proposition, he did not rape her. He walked away. Thus, Kirkland\u2019s bad act shows no intent or motive regarding the crime at issue, and the testimony is not admissible under Evid.R. 404(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">{\u00b6 174} Further, I would find Kylah\u2019s testimony inadmissible under Evid.R. 403 because its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Because of the complete lack of corresponding operative facts between the behavior toward Kylah and the murder of Casonya, Kylah\u2019s testimony was of limited probative value. Kylah was the daughter of a friend of Kirkland, and he would sometimes stay with the family. Kirkland exposed himself to Kylah while she was in her bedroom, but then left the room. He returned with a note offering to pay her for a sex act and then left the room <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>again. Finally, after again entering the room \u2014 while dressed \u2014 he put a five-dollar bill on her dresser and then left. Kirkland did not react violently when Kylah refused his offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\">{\u00b6 175} In contrast, Casonya was a stranger. The encounter between Kirkland and Casonya occurred randomly, in public, and at night. There is no evidence that Kirkland solicited Casonya for sex or that Kirkland exposed himself to her. Finally, after offering money to Casonya, Kirkland responded with violence when she threw the money back at him. The question in this case is whether there was a rape at all. Kirkland\u2019s criminal but nonviolent activity with Kylah is being offered to show that a rape occurred. That is, a situation where no rape occurred is being used as evidence that a rape occurred. The evidence is thus of limited probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">{\u00b6 176} Kylah\u2019s testimony was undoubtedly prejudicial, even to a defendant as demonstrably repugnant as Kirkland. The majority mentions a newspaper article that it dared not quote because it is not in the record. The defense claims that it demonstrates prejudice. I will save the reader the trip to the Internet: Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters told the Cincinnati Enquirer that Kylah\u2019s testimony was pivotal in Kirkland\u2019s conviction for the capital murder of Casonya:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\">Deters wonders if the jury would have recommended the death sentence in the case involving Casonya without the girl\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">\u201cI think it would have been a coin flip,\u201d Deters said. \u201cThere is no question she made the difference in Casonya\u2019s case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Perry, <em>Deters: Teen\u2019s testimony could seal killer Anthony Kirkland\u2019s fate, </em>The Cincinnati Enquirer (March 31, 2010). Certainly, Prosecutor Deters was attempting to publicly recognize a young girl for her courage and may have overstated her importance in the case, but there can be no doubt that Kylah\u2019s testimony was highly prejudicial against Kirkland.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">{\u00b6 177} Without question, evidence that a grown man sexually solicited and exposed himself to a girl he knew to be 13 years old is prejudicial. The testimony was <em>unfairly </em>prejudicial because the state, by its own admission, used the testimony to convince the jury that Kirkland <em>must </em>have tried to rape Casonya. The state rested its entire opposition to Kirkland\u2019s Civ.R. 29 motion on Kylah\u2019s testimony: \u201cSpecifically in regard to the attempted rape on Casonya [C.], this last witness [Kylah] has shown there was a common scheme or plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>{\u00b6 178} Because the other-acts testimony reflected on Kirkland\u2019s character, did not meet the requirements of Evid.R. 404(B), and was unfairly prejudicial under Evid.R. 403, I would find that Kirkland\u2019s first proposition of law has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">{\u00b6 179} Kirkland asserts in his ninth proposition of law that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of attempted rape in connection with the murder of Casonya C. At the close of the evidence, the defense made a Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal on that charge. The trial court denied the motion and allowed all charges to proceed to the jury. I would find that there is insufficient evidence to convict Kirkland of attempted rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">{\u00b6 180} When reviewing a record for sufficiency, the court must consider whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Leonard, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, at \u00b6 77; <em>State v. Jenks, </em>61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus. The court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and defer to the trier of fact on questions of credibility and the weight to assign evidence. <em>State v. Fry, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 163, 2010-Ohio-1017, 926 N.E.2d 1239, at \u00b6 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">{\u00b6 181} The crime of rape is \u201cengaging] in sexual conduct with another when the offender purposely compels the other person to submit by force or threat of force.\u201d R.C. 2907.02(A)(2). The crime of attempted rape is complete when an offender purposely engages in conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense of rape. R.C. 2923.02(A). We have explained a \u201ccriminal attempt\u201d as an act \u201cconstituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate\u201d in an offender\u2019s commission of the crime. <em>State v. Woods, </em>48 Ohio St.2d 127, 357 N.E.2d 1059 (1976), at paragraph one of the syllabus. To constitute a \u201csubstantial step,\u201d the conduct must be strongly corroborative of the offender\u2019s purpose to commit the crime, thus directing attention to the offender\u2019s overt acts. <em>State v. Group, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 248, 2002-Ohio-7247, 781 N.E.2d 980, at \u00b6 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">{\u00b6 182} The element of force for purposes of proving the attempted rape of Casonya C. is obvious and indisputable. The question, then, is what overt acts were presented as evidence to prove that Kirkland attempted to compel sexual conduct. The police collected no physical evidence of rape from a rape kit, because the fire damage to Casonya\u2019s body, specifically her pelvic area, prevented the forensic pathologist from taking any specimens. And during his police interrogation, Kirkland repeatedly denied having sex with Casonya.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>{\u00b6 183} The majority states that Kirkland\u2019s offer of money to Casonya \u201cto talk\u201d was an offer of sex. But without Kylah\u2019s testimony, the state had no evidence from which to conclude that the offer of money was for sexual services. And even if there were evidence that Kirkland offered Casonya money for sex, that evidence would not be probative of whether he attempted to rape her before he killed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">{\u00b6 184} The majority points to physical evidence that it says is consistent with a sexual purpose behind the murder. Casonya was found naked save for a single sock. The state argues that that fact, standing alone, is sufficient to sustain the attempted-rape conviction. However, even in the cases cited by the majority, the naked condition of the body was not the sole evidence of sexual assault. <em>See State v. Scudder, </em>71 Ohio St.3d 263, 274-275, 643 N.E.2d 524 (1994); <em>State v. Biros, 78 </em>Ohio St.3d 426, 447-448, 678 N.E.2d 891 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">{\u00b6 185} This court\u2019s holding in <em>State v. Heinish, </em>50 Ohio St.3d 231, 553 N.E.2d 1026 (1990), suggests that the naked condition of the body, standing alone, is insufficient to sustain a conviction for aggravated rape. In <em>Heinish, </em>the murdered victim was found with her jeans partially unzipped and pulled down several inches from her hips. <em>Id. </em>at 232. Her shoes, jacket, and watch were missing, and there was no underwear on the body. There was also a saliva stain on the crotch of her jeans that, according to laboratory tests, was consistent with the defendant\u2019s. Despite this evidence, this court vacated Heinish\u2019s attempted-rape conviction, because \u201c[e]vidence of finding the victim\u2019s body in the condition noted above does not allow the fact-finder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that an attempted rape has occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">{\u00b6 186} The burning of Casonya\u2019s body, coupled with other-acts evidence concerning Kirkland\u2019s sexual assault of another victim, Esme K., presents a closer call. According to the state, Kirkland\u2019s intent to rape Casonya is evident from the fact that he raped Esme: \u201cThe stark similarities between the defendant\u2019s attack on Esme [K.], i.e., the beating, the vaginal burning, the nude body, are particularly relevant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">{\u00b6 187} When Kirkland burned the body of Esme K. \u2014 a girl we know he did rape \u2014 he started the fire in her pubic area. Based on that evidence, the state argues for an inference of rape of Casonya C. because the fire was started in or was concentrated in the vaginal area, which the state characterizes as an obvious attempt to destroy any evidence of rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">{\u00b6 188} However, the record does not support the state\u2019s assertion that the fire was started in or concentrated on Casonya\u2019s vaginal area. Obinna Ugwu, M.D., a deputy coroner and forensic pathologist employed by the county, offered no testimony as to the origin point of the fire on Casonya\u2019s body. The only opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>came from Elizabeth Murray, Ph.D., a forensic anthropology consultant. Dr. Murray testified that \u201c[i]t looked like the center of the fire was at the center of the body.\u201d Dr. Murray was not asked to clarify whether, by \u201cthe center of the body,\u201d she meant the vaginal area or somewhere on the torso. However, it is clear in context that she meant the latter: she testified that the hands and forearms were most burned because they were likely folded across the body. Also, she noted that the legs were not as severely burned, suggesting again that she believed the fire began higher on the body. In fact, Casonya\u2019s legs were the only part of the body not substantially charred by the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">{\u00b6 189} Burning Casonya\u2019s body may well have been an attempt to destroy evidence of her murder, not to destroy evidence of an attempted rape. Kirkland burned the bodies of all four of his victims, not just Esme and Casonya. Ultimately, all the state was able to prove was that Kirkland destroyed the bodies of his victims, including the bodies of two victims who were not raped. The fact that he burned Casonya\u2019s body is not probative evidence of whether he attempted to rape her first.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">{\u00b6 190} In summary, the state presented insufficient evidence of attempted rape, and I would therefore reverse Kirkland\u2019s conviction on that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">{\u00b6 191} In conclusion, I believe that the case should be remanded for resentencing without a consideration of the attempted rape of Casonya Crawford as an aggravating circumstance. The protections afforded by state law and our Constitutions are only as meaningful as this court\u2019s willingness to recognize them.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b269-8\">Lanzinger, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A7q\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">{\u00b6 192} I concur in the judgment affirming Kirkland\u2019s convictions. But because I believe that the prosecutorial misconduct in this case violated Kirkland\u2019s rights to due process, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to affirm his death sentence and would remand the case for a new sentencing hearing pursuant to R.C. 2929.06(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">{\u00b6 193} Although I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s closing argument prejudicially affected Kirkland\u2019s substantial rights,\u201d majority opinion at \u00b6 83, I disagree with the majority\u2019s decision declining to remand the case for a new sentencing hearing. Our procedures for sentencing in capital cases charge two independent bodies with evaluating whether the death penalty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>is proper: the jury or a three-judge panel at the trial level and this court at the appellate level. In cases like this, where a jury has recommended a sentence of death, our independent review of a death sentence should occur only if proper sentencing-phase procedures were followed leading up to the jury\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">{\u00b6 194} While R.C. 2929.05(A) provides that we must conduct an independent evaluation of the death sentence, we should not conduct this evaluation when the sentence was recommended by a jury that was exposed to substantial and prejudicial prosecutorial misconduct. We have typically used our independent evaluation of the death sentence to correct errors of law by the trial court in its sentencing opinion. <em>See, e.g., State v. Lang, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 512, 2011-Ohio-4215, 954 N.E.2d 596, \u00b6 298; <em>State v. Fox, </em>69 Ohio St.3d 183, 191, 631 N.E.2d 124 (1994). By declining to remand this case, the majority fails to preserve the unique role of the jury in capital cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">{\u00b6 195} As noted in the majority opinion, a prosecutor\u2019s closing argument is prejudicial when it is \u201cso inflammatory as to render the jury\u2019s decision a product solely of passion and prejudice.\u201d <em>State v. Williams, </em>23 Ohio St.3d 16, 20, 490 N.E.2d 906 (1986). The majority opinion cites repeated remarks by the prosecutor that meet this standard in this case, and it concludes that \u201cthe state\u2019s closing remarks in the penalty phase were improper and substantially prejudicial.\u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 96. This conclusion is borne out by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">{\u00b6 196} Because the prosecutorial misconduct in this case potentially rendered the jury\u2019s decision recommending death \u201ca product solely of passion and prejudice,\u201d it cannot be cured by this court\u2019s independent review of the sentence. While our own evaluation can cure errors occurring during the penalty phase, it cannot cure an error that may'have caused the jury to recommend a sentence that is solely a product of prejudice. The majority cites <em>State v. Mills, </em>62 Ohio St.3d 357, 373-374, 582 N.E.2d 972 (1992). In <em>Mills, </em>however, there were far fewer instances of prosecutorial misconduct, and the defendant failed to object. Most significantly, we did not conclude that the state\u2019s actions were substantially prejudicial. Kirkland\u2019s case, on the other hand, is not a case in which offhand remarks by the prosecutor may have had a negligible effect. Here, the majority <em>has </em>concluded that the prosecutorial misconduct was substantially prejudicial. I do not believe that we can conduct an independent review of a death sentence that was not properly recommended, and I therefore would reverse the judgment and remand for a proper sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">{\u00b6 197} Reversing the judgment sentencing Kirkland to death would not mean that he has escaped the death penalty for his actions. Because this case would be remanded due to an error that occurred during the sentencing phase of the trial, Kirkland would still be eligible for the death penalty pursuant to R.C. 2929.06(B). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Although the crimes Kirkland is alleged to have committed are horrific, due process requires that a jury be free from prejudice before recommending the death penalty. Due process, in my view, demands a reversal and remand for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b271-5\">O\u2019Neill, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ARO\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">{\u00b6 198} As a justice and as a citizen, it is truly difficult in this ease to separate personal outrage from clinical constitutional analysis. The latter, however, is required by my oath of office. Anthony Kirkland\u2019s actions were monstrous \u2014 he must be punished and society must be vigilantly protected from him. He deserves nothing less than life in prison without possibility of release, and the horror of his crimes certainly makes it easy to suggest that death is the only fit punishment for him. But because the death penalty \u201cis inherently both cruel and unusual,\u201d <em>State v. Wogenstahl, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 1437, 2013-Ohio-164, 981 N.E.2d 900, \u00b6 2 (O\u2019Neill, J., dissenting), I cannot accept that easy suggestion. And because the majority\u2019s analysis results in a denial of the defendant\u2019s right to a fair jury trial, even if I believed that the death penalty could be constitutionally imposed, I would still be compelled to dissent in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">{\u00b6 199} The majority correctly concludes that the state\u2019s closing remarks in the penalty phase \u201cwere improper and substantially prejudicial.\u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 96. <em>Compare </em>Carter, <em>Harmless Error in the Penalty Phase of a Capital Case: A Doctrine Misunderstood and Misapplied, </em>28 Ga.L.Rev. 125, 131, 134 (1993) (discussing harmless, as opposed to prejudicial, error). But instead of reversing the sentence and remanding for a new sentencing hearing, the majority holds that our independent evaluation and approval of the capital sentence cured the errors in the penalty-phase proceedings. I disagree. This court has relied upon its independent review to \u201ccure\u201d trial-court penalty-phase deficiencies in preparing a written sentencing opinion, <em>State v. Gumm, </em>73 Ohio St.3d 413, 424, 653 N.E.2d 253 (1995), allowing improper testimony from a state expert witness, <em>State v. Hale, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 118, 2008-Ohio-3426, 892 N.E.2d 864, \u00b6 132, and giving erroneous jury instructions, <em>State v. Dixon, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 328, 2004-Ohio-1585, 805 N.E.2d 1042, \u00b6 84. Today, it holds that independent review of a sentence can also \u201ccure\u201d prejudicial penalty-phase prosecutorial misconduct that this court has repeatedly determined to be improper: arguing facts outside the record, arguing the subjective experiences of the victim, and arguing that the circumstances of the murder are themselves aggravating factors. That holding, in my opinion, undermines the very foundation of the jury system in Ohio. And it does not comport with the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>which in this context requires that the facts permitting the imposition of a death sentence must be found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">{\u00b6 200} In <em>Clemons v. Mississippi </em>494 U.S. 738, 745, 110 S.Ct. 1441, 108 L.Ed.2d 725 (1990), the United States Supreme Court held that it was permissible for the Mississippi Supreme Court to impose a sentence of death based on its independent reweighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances after the state court struck down as unconstitutional one of the aggravating factors found by the jury. This court has recognized that Ohio\u2019s system for imposing and reviewing death sentences is analogous to the Mississippi system approved in <em>Clemons. See State v. Landrum, </em>53 Ohio St.3d 107, 124, 559 N.E.2d 710 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">{\u00b6 201} But in <em>Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 609, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002), the United States Supreme Court concluded that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial required that a jury, rather than a judge, find the presence of aggravating circumstances necessary for the imposition of the death penalty. The Supreme Court stated that \u201c[t]he right to trial by jury guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment would be senselessly diminished if it encompassed the factfinding necessary to increase a defendant\u2019s sentence by two years, but not the factfinding necessary to put him to death.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">{\u00b6 202} When it is applied to this case, <em>Clemons, </em>standing alone, would compel the conclusion that this court does not violate the United States Constitution by \u201ccuring\u201d prejudicial errors in the penalty phase of a death-penalty case by independently reviewing the death sentence. But I simply cannot accept the proposition that our independent review somehow comports with the Sixth Amendment right to have a jury weigh mitigating and aggravating circumstances. In my opinion, <em>Clemons </em>is inconsistent with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncement in <em>Ring, </em>because <em>Clemons </em>rests on a premise \u2014 \u201cthe Sixth Amendment does not require that a jury specify the aggravating factors that permit the imposition of capital punishment, nor does it require jury sentencing, <em>even </em>where the sentence turns on specific findings of fact\u201d \u2014 that <em>Ring </em>has shown to be faulty. (Citation omitted.) <em>Clemons at </em>746. As <em>Ring </em>demonstrates, the Sixth Amendment requires <em>precisely </em>those things: \u201cenumerated aggravating factors operate as \u2018the functional equivalent of an element of a greater offense,\u2019 [and therefore] the Sixth Amendment requires that they be found by a jury.\u201d <em>Ring </em>at 609, quoting <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 494, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.E.2d 435 (2000), fn. 19. Moreover, in <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2155, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), the court concluded that any fact that increases the mandatory minimum punishment for a crime \u201cis an \u2018element\u2019 that must be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>See also id. </em>at 2165-2166 (Sotomayor, J., concurring) (demonstrating how <em>Ring </em>compels the decision in Alleyne).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ary\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Joseph T. Deters, Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney, and William E. Breyer, Chief Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AS_\">Herbert E. Freeman and Bruce K. Hust, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">{\u00b6 203} In short, as one federal judge has observed, \u201c[i]f a defendant has a right to have a jury find all the facts that make him eligible for the death penalty, he must also have the right to have a jury make the final determination that he actually will be sentenced to death.\u201d <em>Baston v. Bagley, </em>420 F.3d 632, 639, fn. 1 (6th Cir.2005) (Merritt, J., dissenting) (arguing that <em>\u201cRing </em>has overruled <em>Clemons </em>\u201d). In light of <em>Apprendi, Ring, </em>and <em>Alleyne, </em>it seems obvious that <em>Clemons </em>is bad law that will someday be explicitly overruled. And given that this court has already concluded that the defendant\u2019s penalty-phase hearing was unfair, it compounds that unfairness for this court to simply reimpose the death penalty instead of remanding the case for a sentencing jury to make that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">{\u00b6 204} I have stated my belief that capital punishment itself is unconstitutional; with today\u2019s decision, the court plainly demonstrates that Ohio\u2019s system of imposing and reviewing death sentences is unconstitutional as well. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
