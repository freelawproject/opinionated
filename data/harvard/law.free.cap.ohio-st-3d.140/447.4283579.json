The terms of Falfas\u2019s relationship with Cedar Fair were detailed in a written employment agreement signed by both parties. In his role as chief operating officer, Falfas reported directly to Cedar Fair\u2019s chairman of the board, president, and chief executive officer, Richard Kinzel, and was responsible for\u2014 among other duties \u2014 negotiating contracts for and purchasing shows that were performed in Cedar Fair\u2019s amusement parks. In June 2010, Falfas became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>aware that Kinzel was unhappy with the contract and budgeting for one of those shows, and Kinzel\u2019s dissatisfaction led to a 94-second phone call between the two men on the afternoon of June 10, 2010. After that phone call, Faifas believed that Kinzel had fired him, but Kinzel believed that Faifas had resigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">{\u00b6 3} Falfas\u2019s termination ultimately became the subject of binding arbitration, and the arbitration panel found that Faifas had not resigned but had been terminated for reasons other than cause. The panel went on to conclude that \u201cequitable relief is needed to restore the parties to the positions that they held prior to the breach of the Employment Agreement,\u201d and, despite the fact that nearly eight months had passed since Falfas\u2019s employment had ended, the arbitration panel ordered Cedar Fair to reinstate Faifas \u201cto the position he held prior to his wrongful termination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">{\u00b6 4} It is the propriety of this order of reinstatement that we address today. Cedar Fair appealed the arbitration decision to the Erie County Court of Common Pleas. The trial court concluded that the arbitration panel\u2019s order of reinstatement went beyond the authority the panel was granted under the employment contract. The Sixth District Court of Appeals reversed that decision, concluding that the arbitration panel had the authority to order Falfas\u2019s reinstatement under the contract and that reinstatement was consistent with Ohio law. Cedar Fair appealed to this court, and we accepted jurisdiction to determine whether an arbitration panel\u2019s order of reinstatement of a terminated employee is an available remedy for an employer\u2019s breach of contract. 136 Ohio St.3d 1491, 2013-0hio-4140, 994 N.E.2d 462. We conclude that specific performance is not an available remedy for breach of an employment contract unless it is explicitly provided for in the contract or by an applicable statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">{\u00b6 5} The authority of an arbitrator to interpret and enforce a contract is drawn from the contract itself, and for this reason we have held that \u201c[a]n arbitrator\u2019s authority is limited to that granted him by the contracting parties, and does not extend to the determination of the wisdom or legality of the bargain.\u201d <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Local Union No. 200, United Rubber, Cork, Linoleum &amp; Plastic Workers of Am., </em>42 Ohio St.2d 516, 519, 330 N.E.2d 703 (1975). The Ohio statute governing when a court may vacate an arbitrator\u2019s award provides that \u201cthe court of common pleas shall make an order vacating the award upon the application of any party to the arbitration\u201d if the award was the product of corruption, fraud, or undue means; if any arbitrator was partial or corrupt; if the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct or misbehavior; or if \u201c[t]he arbitrators exceeded their powers.\u201d R.C. 2711.10(A) through (D). This statute is substantively equivalent to the analogous provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, and we have often used federal law in aid of our application of the statute. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number><em>Compare </em>R.C. 2711.10 <em>with </em>9 U.S.C. 10(a)(1) through (4); <em>see Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>at 520, 522-523 (quoting federal case law while applying R.C. 2711.10). And we have held that the statutory authority of courts to vacate an arbitrator\u2019s award is extremely limited. <em>See, e.g., Assn. of Cleveland Fire Fighters, Local 93 of the Internatl. Assn. of Fire Fighters v. Cleveland, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 476, 2003-Ohio-4278, 793 N.E.2d 484, \u00b6 13. \u201cWere the arbitrator\u2019s decision to be subject to reversal because a reviewing court disagreed with findings of fact or with an interpretation of the contract, arbitration would become only an added proceeding and expense prior to final judicial determination. This would defeat the bargain made by the parties * * <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>at 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">{\u00b6 6} So long as arbitrators act within the scope of the contract, they have great latitude in issuing a decision. An arbitrator\u2019s improper determination of the facts or misinterpretation of the contract does not provide a basis for reversal of an award by a reviewing court, because \u201c[i]t is not enough * * * to show that the [arbitrator] committed an error \u2014 or even a serious error.\u201d <em>Stolt-Nielsen, S.A. v. AnimalFeeds Internatl. Corp., </em>559 U.S. 662, 671, 130 S.Ct. 1758, 176 L.Ed.2d 605 (2010). Moreover, we have held that arbitrators have \u201cbroad authority to fashion a remedy, even if the remedy contemplated is not explicitly mentioned\u201d in the applicable contract. <em>Queen City Lodge No. 69, Fraternal Order of Police, Hamilton Cty., Ohio, Inc. v. Cincinnati, </em>63 Ohio St.3d 403, 407, 588 N.E.2d 802 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">{\u00b6 7} Notwithstanding these principles, under R.C. 2711.10(D) arbitrators can exceed their powers by going beyond the authority provided by the bargained-for agreement or by going beyond their contractual authority to craft a remedy under the law. <em>See, e.g., Oxford Health Plans, L.L.C. v. Sutter, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2064, 2068, 186 L.Ed.2d 113 (2013) (analyzing 9 U.S.C. 10(a)(4) of the Federal Arbitration Act). Arbitrators act within their authority to craft an award so long as the award \u201cdraws its essence\u201d from the contract \u2014 that is, \u201cwhen there is a rational nexus between the agreement and the award, and where the award is not arbitrary, capricious or unlawful.\u201d <em>Mahoning Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation &amp; Dev. Disabilities v. Mahoning Cty. TMR Edn. Assn., </em>22 Ohio St.3d 80, 488 N.E.2d 872 (1986), paragraph one of the syllabus. <em>Accord Oxford Health Plans </em>at 2068. So long as there is a good-faith argument that an arbitrator\u2019s award is authorized by the contract that provides the arbitrator^ authority, the award is within the arbitrator\u2019s power, but an award \u201cdeparts from the essence of a [contract] when: (1) the award conflicts with the express terms of the agreement, and/or (2) the award is without rational support or cannot be rationally derived from the terms of the agreement.\u201d <em>Ohio Office of Collective Bargaining v. Ohio Civ. Serv. Emps. Assn., Local 11, AFSCME, AFL-CIO, </em>59 Ohio St.3d 177, 572 N.E.2d 71 (1991), syllabus. And finally, we note that it is well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>settled that \u201c \u2018an arbitrator is confined to interpretation and application of the [contract]; he does not sit to dispense his own brand of industrial justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 180, quoting <em>United Steelworkers of Am. v. Ent. Wheel &amp; Car Corp., </em>363 U.S. 593, 597, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">{\u00b6 8} In short, if it can be fairly argued that the arbitrators\u2019 award of reinstatement to Faifas was contemplated by the contract at issue here and that the law arguably authorizes the award, the reinstatement should be upheld. These are quite deferential standards, but after analysis, we are compelled to conclude that by ordering Cedar Fair to reinstate Faifas, the arbitration panel exceeded its powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">{\u00b6 9} Cedar Fair\u2019s employment agreement with Faifas contains four separate sections that are relevant to whether the agreement gave the arbitration panel the power to order Falfas\u2019s reinstatement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\">7. Termination by Cedar Fair Other Than for Cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">(a) If, other than pursuant to Section 10 or Section 12 hereof, Cedar Fair shall terminate Executive\u2019s employment (including by written notice of intent, pursuant to Section 2 hereof, not to renew this Agreement), then [Executive shall receive his base salary for either one year or the remaining employment term, whichever is longer, and shall receive certain continuing benefits as specifically detailed in this Section].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-8\">AH other benefits provided by Cedar Fair shall end as of the last day of Executive\u2019s active employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-9\">10. Termination for Cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-10\">(a) Cedar Fair may terminate Executive\u2019s employment for Cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-12\">(b) If Executive\u2019s employment shall be terminated for Cause, Cedar Fair shall pay Executive, in a lump sum, on the twentieth (20th) business day following the date of termination for Cause, his Base Salary through the date of his termination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-13\">(c) Cedar Fair shall have no further obligations to Executive under this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-14\">11. Termination By Resignation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-15\">In the event Executive resigns his employment, all benefits and compensation shall cease on the last day of Executive\u2019s active employment with Cedar Fair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-16\">:|: * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>19. Arbitration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\">(e) * * * The arbitration panel shall have authority to award any remedy or relief that an Ohio or federal court in Ohio could grant in conformity with applicable law on the basis of the claims actually made in the arbitration. The arbitration panel shall not have the authority either to abridge or change substantive rights available under the existing law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">(Boldface and underlining sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">{\u00b6 10} The evidence presented at the arbitration hearing focused almost entirely on whether Faifas had resigned his position with Cedar Fair. Based on that evidence, Cedar Fair argued that Section 11 controlled and that Faifas was not entitled to any kind of postemployment compensation, because he had resigned. Faifas, by contrast, argued that he had been terminated without cause and that he was entitled to either reinstatement under Section 19(c) of the contract, with full continuing compensation and benefits as if he had not been terminated, or to compensation and benefits according to Section 7 of the contract. The parties agreed that Faifas had not been terminated for cause and therefore that Section 10 of the contract was not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">{\u00b6 11} The arbitration panel concluded that \u201cFaifas was terminated for reasons other than cause\u201d and that \u201cthe facts fail to establish resignation.\u201d Based on this finding, Cedar Fair argues that the arbitration panel\u2019s power was limited to awarding Faifas the period of continuing compensation and benefits he was entitled to receive under Section 7 of the contract, which by its plain terms is a liquidated-damages provision in case of termination other than for cause. In support of this view, Cedar Fair points out that Section 2 of the employment agreement provided that \u201cCedar Fair shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at any time, subject to the obligations to provide the benefits and make the payments provided herein.\u201d But Faifas argues that because the panel also determined that \u201cequitable relief is needed to restore the parties to the positions that they held prior to the breach of the Employment Agreement,\u201d and that because the panel was authorized under Section 19(c) of the contract \u201cto award any remedy or relief that an Ohio or federal court in Ohio could grant in conformity with applicable law,\u201d the award of reinstatement was proper. Thus, the issue is whether the arbitration panel could conclude in good faith that specific performance in the form of reinstatement was an available legal remedy under the law and therefore under Section 19(c) of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">{\u00b6 12} Framed this way, the question suggests its own answer. It is hardly controversial to recognize that an order of specific performance is rarely an appropriate remedy for breach of an employment agreement. It is, for example, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>common for first-year law students to review the case of <em>Lumley v. Wagner, </em>42 Eng.Rep. 687 (1852), in which the court observed that it lacked the power to order a singer who had contracted to perform at the plaintiffs theater to specifically complete her contract. <em>Id. </em>at 693. Ohio has long followed the same rule. <em>See Port Clinton RR. Co. v. Cleveland &amp; Toledo RR. Co., </em>13 Ohio St. 544, 550 (1862) (\u201cIn the case of a contract for personal service, it may be that, on a refusal to perform the contract, an action for damages would not afford adequate relief, and yet it is clear that a court of equity will not attempt to enforce specifically such a contract\u201d). <em>Accord Hoffman Candy &amp; Ice Cream Co. v. Dept. of Liquor Control, </em>154 Ohio St. 357, 96 N.E.2d 203 (1950), paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">{\u00b6 13} In <em>Masetta v. Natl. Bronze &amp; Aluminum Foundry Co., </em>159 Ohio St. 306, 112 N.E.2d 15 (1953), paragraph two of the syllabus, this court held that \u201c[a] court of equity will not, by means of mandatory injunction, decree specific performance of a labor contract existing between an employer and its employees so as to require the employer to continue any such employee in its service or to rehire such employee if discharged.\u201d <em>Masetta </em>is squarely within the mainstream on this question; surveying the cases related to the issue, the authors of a frequently cited treatise have observed that \u201c[o]n occasion an employee has sought specific performance of an employment contract against an employer. Such relief has almost invariably been denied. Such enforcement * * * would involve difficulty of supervision and, often, forc[e] the continuance of a distasteful personal relationship.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) Calamari &amp; Perillo, <em>The Law of Contracts, </em>Section 16.5, at 618 (4th Ed.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">{\u00b6 14} To be fair, there are some exceptions to this general rule. Most notably, collective-bargaining agreements, civil-service laws, and civil-rights laws have all endorsed reinstatement as a remedy for wrongful termination of employment. <em>See, e.g., </em>29 U.S.C. 626(b) (\u201cIn any action brought to enforce [the Age Discrimination in Employment Act] the court shall have jurisdiction to grant such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate to effectuate the purposes of this chapter, including without limitation judgments compelling employment, reinstatement or promotion\u201d). <em>See also, e.g., </em>R.C. 4112.05(G)(1) (including \u201creinstatement\u201d as an available remedy if the Ohio Civil Rights Commission determines that a respondent has engaged in an unlawful discriminatory practice). Recognizing these developments, this court has held that \u201cspecific performance of a reinstatement provision in a settlement agreement is appropriate when * * * the settlement agreement provides for reinstatement <em>in clear and unambiguous terms and when the settlement promise of reinstatement is given in exchange for the relinquishment of a statutorily-created right to reinstatement.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>State ex rel. Wright v. Weyandt, </em>50 Ohio St.2d 194, 199, 363 N.E.2d 1387 (1977). In <em>Wright, </em>this court held that a clear bargained-for promise of reinstate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>ment in an agreement could be enforced by specific performance. But even in light of <em>Wright, </em>the general rule forbidding compulsory performance survives\u2014 those exceptions discussed above would make no sense if it were otherwise. In short, unless a statute or the employment contract says otherwise, the rule in Ohio remains that specific performance is not an available remedy for breach of an employment contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">{\u00b6 15} It is at best a strained conclusion that Section 19(c), which authorizes the arbitration panel to award \u201cany remedy or relief that an Ohio or federal court in Ohio could grant\u201d is sufficient to authorize reinstatement \u201cin clear and unambiguous terms,\u201d as did the settlement agreement in <em>Wright. </em>In order to maintain his argument that reinstatement is an available remedy, Faifas relies\u2014 in large part \u2014 on a single phrase from this court\u2019s decision in <em>Worrell v. Multipress, Inc., </em>45 Ohio St.3d 241, 543 N.E.2d 1277 (1989). In <em>Worrell, </em>we noted in passing that \u201cfront pay is an equitable remedy designed to financially compensate employees where \u2018reinstatement\u2019 of the employee would be impractical or inadequate. In such circumstances an award of front pay enables the court to make the injured party whole, although reinstatement is the preferred remedy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 246. Faifas argues that because we recognized reinstatement as \u201cthe preferred remedy\u201d in <em>Worrell, </em>the arbitration panel\u2019s award of reinstatement was a \u201cremedy or relief that an Ohio or federal court in Ohio could grant in conformity with applicable law,\u201d and therefore it should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">{\u00b6 16} But this argument relies on reading the quoted words in isolation from the remainder of the opinion and completely out of the context in which those words appear: as dictum grounded in discussing the remedies available under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (\u201cADEA\u201d). The <em>Worrell </em>opinion directly supported the sentence at issue by citing <em>Cassino v. Reichhold Chems., Inc., </em>817 F.2d 1338 (9th Cir.1987). In <em>Cassino, </em>the court, after quoting 29 U.S.C. 626(b) and its specific authorization of \u201creinstatement\u201d as one avenue of relief, stated that while \u201creinstatement is the preferred remedy <em>in these cases, </em>it may not be feasible where the relationship is hostile or no position is available due to a reduction in force.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 1346. <em>Worrell </em>does not even begin to suggest that reinstatement to employment is the \u201cpreferred remedy\u201d in all personal-services-contract disputes, which would be a manifestly incorrect understanding of the law. The opinion merely notes, far more prosaically, that reinstatement is a statutorily preferred remedy for wrongful dismissal <em>under the ADEA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">{\u00b6 17} Falfas\u2019s reading of <em>Worrell </em>would have the statutory exception favoring reinstatement in employment-discrimination cases swallow the general common-law rule forbidding reinstatement in employment cases. But <em>Worrell </em>itself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>actually rejects this argument, observing as it does that \u201cthe usual remedy in breach of contract cases for wrongful discharge is to pay the injured party the difference between any wages due under the contract from the date of discharge until the contract term expires.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 246. Moreover, the actual holding of <em>Worrell, </em>ironically, more closely supports the remedy advocated by Cedar Fair. <em>See id. </em>at 247 (\u201cWe hold that, as a result of breach of an employment contract where an employee has been wrongfully discharged, front pay, or lost future wages, may be awarded as compensation between the date of discharge and reemployment in a position of equal or similar status\u201d). In short, it cannot be fairly argued that Falfas\u2019s interpretation of <em>Worrell </em>is even reasonable, let alone that it is a correct statement of the law \u2014 the only way this argument could work at all is to ignore everything other than the words \u201cpreferred remedy.\u201d We simply cannot hold that the arbitration panel acted within its authority in disregarding the general rule against reinstatement when the employment agreement here lacks the \u201cclear and unambiguous terms\u201d authorizing reinstatement that were present in <em>Wright.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">{\u00b6 18} We finally observe that Falfas\u2019s reading of Section 19(c) of the agreement is completely undermined by the existence of Sections 7, 10, and 11, which address the generally understood possibilities here: termination without cause, termination for cause, and resignation. The arbitration panel specifically found that Faifas was terminated without cause, and therefore, as the trial court concluded, Faifas was entitled to \u201chis back pay and other benefits he enjoyed * * * as if the employment relationship had not been severed,\u201d as outlined in Section 7 of the agreement. Section 7, as Cedar Fair has argued to this court, quite clearly includes a liquidated-damages provision designed to set forth the compensation and benefits to which Faifas is entitled on account of Cedar Fair\u2019s decision to terminate his employment contract without cause. The record before us demonstrates that the parties to the contract envisioned precisely what happened here. Nearly eight months passed between Falfas\u2019s termination and the arbitration panel\u2019s award. How could a large business entity like Cedar Fair properly function if an arbitration panel was authorized to force it to reemploy an unwanted senior officer after it had obviously moved on? Why would any such entity or employee agree to give an arbitration panel the power to cause such disruption? And why should the broad language in Section 19(c) be interpreted to allow such a result when Section 7, by implication, forbids it?</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">{\u00b6 19} For all these reasons, we hold that specific performance is not an available remedy for breach of an employment contract unless it is explicitly provided for in the contract or by an applicable statute and that the arbitration panel in this case exceeded its authority by holding otherwise. Because the fact-finder determined that Faifas was terminated for reasons other than for cause, he is entitled to his base salary for either one year or his remaining employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>term, whichever is longer. That matter and other concerns are to be addressed by the trial court upon remand. But the contract clearly does not entitle him to reinstatement. We accordingly reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand this case to the Erie County Court of Common Pleas for further proceedings.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A3q3\">Organ Cole &amp; Stock, L.L.P., Douglas R.
