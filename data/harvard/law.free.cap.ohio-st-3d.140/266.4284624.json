On July 15, 2013, relator, Ohio State Bar Association, charged Corrigan with professional misconduct after he was arrested and pleaded no contest to charges of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol and impeding the roadway. Corrigan, a judge of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, was discovered slumped over the steering wheel of his vehicle, which was stopped in an intersection, while the vehicle\u2019s transmission was in the drive position and his foot was on the brake.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>{\u00b6 2} A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline considered the cause on the parties\u2019 consent-to-discipline agreement. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 11. An amended consent-to-discipline agreement was subsequently filed that restated the parties\u2019 recommended sanction and cited a case in support of that recommendation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">{\u00b6 3} In the amended consent-to-discipline agreement, Corrigan stipulates to the facts alleged in relator\u2019s complaint and agrees that his conduct violated Jud.Cond.R. 1.2 (requiring a judge to act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary and to avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">{\u00b6 4} The parties stipulate that the mitigating factors present include Corrigan\u2019s lack of a prior disciplinary record, his full and free disclosure to the disciplinary board, his voluntary participation in the Ohio Lawyers Assistance Program, and the imposition of other penalties, including a three-day jail sentence or driver-intervention program, the payment of a $500 fine and court costs, a one-year driver\u2019s license suspension, and a one-year period of community control. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a), (d), and (f). The parties do not note any aggravating factors. Based upon these factors, the parties stipulate that the appropriate sanction for Corrigan\u2019s misconduct is a public reprimand.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">{\u00b6 5} The panel and board found that the amended consent-to-discipline agreement conforms to BCGD Proc.Reg. 11 and recommend that we adopt the agreement in its entirety. In support of its recommendation, the panel refers to <em>In re Complaint Against Resnick, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 160, 2005-Ohio-6800, 842 N.E.2d 31 (a public reprimand was an appropriate sanction for a justice arrested and convicted of driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol); <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Connor, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 100, 2004-Ohio-6902, 822 N.E.2d 1235 (a six-month stayed suspension conditioned on compliance with the terms of the lawyers-assistance program was an appropriate sanction for a judge involved in multiple alcohol-related events); <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Bowling, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 138, 2010-Ohio-5040, 937 N.E.2d 95 (a public reprimand was an appropriate sanction for a magistrate\u2019s use of marijuana as a means of self-medication).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">{\u00b6 6} We agree that Corrigan violated Jud.Cond.R. 1.2 and, as stated in the parties\u2019 amended agreement, that this conduct warrants a public reprimand. Therefore, we adopt the parties\u2019 amended consent-to-discipline agreement.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AJ-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Brian S.
