At this stage, the government need not prove violations of the Bank Secrecy Act, or who may have violated the statute, for the enforcement action to arise under United States banking law. \"[T]o establish jurisdiction for purposes of enforcing a grand jury subpoena, the [government] need not prove what would be necessary to confer jurisdiction over the companies for purposes of trial....

Consequently, subjecting the banks to this Court's jurisdiction is, simply put, not unfair. Indeed, two of the banks consented to personal jurisdiction for matters arising under United States banking law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Consent to Jurisdiction-Bank One; Consent to Jurisdiction-Bank Two. Beyond that, each bank has funneled over a million dollars through the United States on behalf of [REDACTED]. As the Second Circuit has said about such correspondent banking activity, \"[i]t should hardly be unforeseeable to a bank\n   that selects and makes use of a particular forum's banking system that it might be subject to the burden of a lawsuit in that forum for wrongs related to, and arising from, that use.\"\n   <em>\n    Licci\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3708878\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/732/161/#p170\">\n    732 F.3d at 171-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The government has offered Bank One and Bank Two the option of simply mailing the requested records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Grand Jury Subpoena Ltr. (\"Although you are not required to do so, if it is more convenient for you, you may send the requested records to the undersigned United States Attorney in lieu of personally appearing before the Grand Jury on the date indicated.\"). Similarly, the administrative subpoena calls only for Bank Three to produce records. Admin. Subpoena (\"Compliance can be made by mailing the requested documents via courier....\"). None of the banks contends that locating those records will be difficult. To the contrary, Bank Two has given assurances that the requested documents can be collected in days,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Bank Two's Opp'n at 16; Bank Two's Sur-Reply at 3, and Bank Three \"took steps to collect and preserve documents\" shortly after receiving the subpoena,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Bank Three GM Decl. \u00b6 14;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Mar. 23, 2018 U.S. Counsel Ltr. at 1-2.

With the documents already, or easily, collected, now the banks need only put them in the mail, hardly a burden. To the extent that further legal issues will arise from enforcement of the subpoenas, the well-resourced banks are all fully able to ensure adequate representation of their interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Additionally, for reasons discussed more thoroughly in Section III.C.2,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , the remainder of the banks' specific arguments are unavailing: the risk that any of the banks will be penalized in China for complying with the subpoenas is overblown; the United States, which seeks these records as part of an investigation into North Korea's nuclear weapons program, does not have an alternative route to obtain them since the MLAA, at least for banking records, is unproductive; and while China does have a legitimate interest in a sound financial system, Chinese law permits the disclosure of banking records in analogous circumstances and therefore appreciates that banking systems do not crumble because the government can obtain some records for law enforcement purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   * * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   All told, each bank has purposefully availed itself of the United States financial market through correspondent banking activity, including transactions on behalf of [REDACTED].

Subpoena, \"is not restricted to 'records related' to a correspondent account 'in the United States,' but rather appears to address\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   correspondent account, including accounts located abroad that have no relation to the United States.\" Bank Three's Opp'n at 33 (emphasis in original);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Bank Three's Sur-Reply at 4. Bank Three has correspondent accounts in countries other than the United States, and the subpoena covers those accounts too. Bank Three's Sur-Reply at 4. Additionally, Bank Three continues, the subpoena, by encompassing signature cards, account ledgers cards, account statements, and due diligence records for the target account and transactions, is not limited to records related to Bank Three's correspondent account in the United States.

First, the bank's insistence that every record encompassed by the subpoena must itself \"relate to\" a correspondent bank account in the United States entirely ignores the final clause of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205318\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k)(3)(a)(i), which authorizes subpoenas for \"records maintained outside the United States relating to the deposit of funds into the foreign bank.\" Bank Three cites that clause at the outset of its opposition,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Bank Three's Opp'n at 2, but otherwise ignores it. The bank's sur-reply is no better.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bank Three's Sur-Reply at 3-6. Indeed, under the disregarded final clause, a subpoena for records revealing the source of funds that [REDACTED] deposited into Bank Three and then funneled through the United States correspondent account, which might include records without a direct tie to the United States account, are accessible. As the government argued at the hearing, the final clause appreciates that \"bank records can't be looked at in a vacuum, that money doesn't just appear there.... [T]he flow of funds are related.... [S]o when there is a foreign currency transaction that occurs in China, and that's what infuses the money into the account that illegally sends money here, absolutely that's related.\" Mar. 5, 2019 Tr. at 92:14-24.

Other factors might be relevant too.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Although never having articulated neatly the comity standard, the D.C. Circuit has endorsed the Second Circuit's two additional factors. Returning to\n   <em>\n    Sealed Case I\n   </em>\n   , the D.C. Circuit distinguished two cases in which the Eleventh Circuit affirmed enforcement of subpoenas against foreign entities for records held abroad as instances in which the contemnor had not acted in good faith.\n   <em>\n    Sealed Case I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331628,10546679\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/825/494/\">\n    825 F.2d at 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (distinguishing\n   <em>\n    In re Grand Jury Proceedings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1478163\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/691/1384/\">\n    691 F.2d 1384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 1982) and\n   <em>\n    In re Grand Jury Proceedings Bank of Nova Scotia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"623007\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/740/817/#p826\">\n    740 F.2d 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 826 (11th Cir. 1984) ). The banks' good faith, then, is properly considered. So too is the hardship that compliance would impose. On that issue, the D.C. Circuit, again in\n   <em>\n    Sealed Case I\n   </em>\n   , wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   A decision whether to enter a contempt order in cases like this one raises grave difficulties for courts. We have little doubt, for example, that our government and our people would be affronted if a foreign court tried to compel someone to violate our laws within our borders. The legal expression of this widespread sentiment is found in basic principles of international comity. But unless we are willing simply to enter contempt orders in all such cases, no matter how extreme, in utter disregard of comity principles, we are obliged to undertake the unseemly task of picking and choosing when to order parties to violate foreign laws. It is conceivable that we might even be forced to base our determination in part on a subjective evaluation of the content of those laws; an American court might well find it wholly inappropriate to defer to a foreign sovereign where the laws in question promote, for example, torture or slavery or terrorism.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331628,10546679\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/825/494/\">\n    825 F.2d at 498-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Explicitly, the D.C. Circuit recognized that unless courts are to disregard comity entirely, courts must decide when to enforce an order that will conflict with foreign law. The hardship of the conflict is an essential part of that analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Thus, whether, as a matter of comity, enforcing the subpoenas here would be unreasonable depends on application of the seven factors that the Second Circuit has clearly articulated and the D.C.

Moreover, the government \"declined to pursue an MLAA request\" as an alternative means of seeking the documents. Bank Two's Opp'n at 18. Although the delay and decision to forgo a possible means for obtaining the records suggest that the current investigation is not urgent, those facts are not as damning as appears at first blush. In between issuing the subpoenas and filing the motions to compel, the Department of Justice twice sent a delegation to China to discuss China's\n   responsiveness to MLAA requests.

Moreover, the Department of Justice was engaged in intra- and inter-agency deliberations during the interim about the most prudent way to secure the records.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18; FBI Decl. \u00b6 80.

Bank One agrees in part, appreciating that the subpoenas seek records \"related only to one entity and one account for a specific time period,\" but argues that the subpoena is too broad because \"it requests production of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   records\" related to [REDACTED], which sweeps in \"documents unrelated to the alleged illicit U.S. dollar payments made by [REDACTED] for the benefit of the North Korean government.\" Bank One's Opp'n at 22-23.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   As the government points out, \"[REDACTED] solely existed as a front company for [REDACTED].\" Gov't's Reply at 29 (citing FBI Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-10). Thus, contrary to Bank One's position, all [REDACTED] records relate to the conduct under investigation. Given the nature of that investigation, the subpoenas hardly could be narrower.

In response to the DOJ declaration, the MOJ identifies one occasion in which China responded to a 2017 MLAA request and notes that in another case, when China took several years to respond to an MLAA request, the two countries had been communicating about the request in the interim.

The banks' compliance, however, gets the government only part way to the records sought. The MOJ's compliance, as well as that of other Chinese authorities, also is necessary, and that cooperation is doubtful. Through three letters, the MOJ has expressed how it will handle an MLAA request in this case. The first, the MOJ's March 2018 letter to Bank Three, explained that the MOJ would \"review and handle [an MLAA request] timely in accordance with the [MLAA] and relevant PRC laws.\" Mar. 22, 2018 MOJ Ltr. The second, a January 2019 letter addressed to the Court, said that the MOJ \"would timely review and handle the requests for assistance sought by the DOJ in accordance with the [MLAA] and applicable domestic laws. For the request in line with the [MLAA], China will provide the assistance to the United States accordingly.\" Jan. 6, 2019 MOJ Ltr. at 4. The third, a follow up letter to the Court, explained that \"if the DOJ makes a MLA[A] request in the present case, the MOJ will promptly review and process it. To be more specific, if such a US request complies with the applicable provisions of the [Law of the PRC on International Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters] and the MLAA, the MOJ will promptly transfer the request to Competent Authorities of China for further review and execution.\" Feb. 26, 2019 MOJ Ltr. at 3. The MOJ provided assurances about its own promptness but not about other Chinese government components' review process. Nor did the MOJ promise that the response would be usable to the United States government but preemptively invited the United States to \"make a supplement[al] request or clearly express the requirements, and we will timely process and respond to that request.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4288692\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/910/548/#p557\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   These MOJ letters harm the banks' case more than help. First, the MOJ's third letter clarifies that the MOJ is not the last level of Chinese review. So even if the banks' and the MOJ's commitments are sound, other Chinese agencies will be involved. Those authorities have made zero commitments in this case. Second, the MOJ assures that even if initial production does not generate records usable in an American court, the MOJ will consider\n   supplementary requests. That back and forth, which might never culminate in the release of usable records, could take years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DOJ Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 13a; Feb. 26, 2019 MOJ Ltr. at 7. Third, the MOJ's final letter introduces a separate Chinese law-the International Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters-that any MLAA request must satisfy. That law puts both the MOJ and \"the National Supervisory Committee, the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of State Security and other departments ... in charge of international criminal judicial assistance,\" and makes those government agencies \"responsible for examining and handling ... criminal judicial assistance requests made by foreign countries.\" Bank Two's Opp'n, Decl. of Professor of Law and Vice Dean at Peaking University Law School (\"Bank Two Expert Decl.\"), Ex.

In August 2016, the Department of Justice prepared and sent an MLAA request for bank records related to Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Co., Ltd., another agent of North Korea. FBI Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 14-16, 71. During an August 12, 2016 meeting, \"Chinese authorities nominally agreed to work jointly with the U.S. authorities and requested a working group meeting to further discuss cooperation with DOJ officials familiar with the [Dandong] investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72.

A new MLAA request was sent in April 2017, and the Department of Justice still has not received a response. FBI Decl. \u00b6 74; DOJ Decl. \u00b6 13c. The Department of Justice no longer needs to take overtures of China's willingness to assist the United States' with investigations into North Korea seriously.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Why not, Bank Two, asks, make the government try at least one last time to explore the MLAA route given that, \"the MOJ's credibility with this Court and every other federal court would be at issue if it did not fulfill its commitment.\" Bank Two's Sur-Reply at 7. Despite the facial reasonableness of this suggestion, forcing such a request would be ill-conceived. The United States and China have different interests as to North Korea. FBI Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 80-81.

Bank Three \"does not dispute that the United States has a strong interest in combating money laundering and enforcing international sanctions,\" Bank Three's Opp'n at 23, but argues that compelling production may frustrate those interests by having a \"chilling effect on future communications by Chinese bank,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 24 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wultz v.

Bank One's Opp'n at 26; Bank Two's Opp'n at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Non-enforcement of the subpoenas would undermine the United States' interests a great deal. First, the argument that no interest of the United States would be undermined because the United States has an alternative means of obtaining the same records is misdirected. Beside being factually incorrect, that argument bleeds together the fourth and fifth factors. Whether the government has alternative ways of getting the documents is a stand-alone consideration and not a reason to discount whether non-enforcement would undermine the United States' interests. Indeed, if the availability of an alternative were given the dispositive significance that Bank One and Bank Two suggest, none of the remaining factors would have to be considered. The consequence would be a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   rule of first resort to any international treaty despite the Supreme Court having rejected such a rule, at least when, as here, the relevant treaty does not contain exclusivity language.\n   <em>\n    Societe Nationale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217178\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/522/#p555\">\n    482 U.S. at 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217178\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/522/#p555\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We therefore decline to hold as a blanket matter that comity requires resort to Hague Evidence Convention procedures....\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   DOJ Decl. \u00b6 7 (\"The MLAA contains no provision stating that it shall be the exclusive mechanism for the parties to obtain evidence from one another.\"). As for Bank Three's argument that compelling disclosure would actually harm the United States' national security interest, this is a point to which the Executive Branch is owed some deference.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus, for this factor, non-enforcement is properly considered an impediment to the United States' national security interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   On the other side of the balance, the government characterizes China's national interest as \"protecting the [purported] right to privacy incorporated into its bank secrecy laws.\" Gov't's Mot.-Bank One at 24-25 (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Grand Jury Proceedings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1478163\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/691/1384/\">\n    691 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1391 );\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Gov't's Mot.-Bank Three at 25-26. That characterization of the Chinese interest implicated here, the banks say, is too dismissive. Rather, China's interest is \"upholding its\n   bank secrecy laws, which are designed to protect customer privacy, maintain customer confidence in commercial banks, and ensure the stability of the country's financial system.\" Bank Two's Opp'n at 19 (citing Bank Two Expert Decl. \u00b6 13, ECF No. 3-3 (No. 18-176)). Bank Three paints with a similar brush, describing China's interest as \"promoting confidence in a developing banking system.\" Bank Three's Opp'n at 23. Finally, Bank One cites a number of laws that an order compelling compliance would violate-including \"banking laws and regulation, cybersecurity laws, administrative regulations, criminal and judicial assistance laws\"-and adds that \"[s]uch an outcome would undoubtedly undermine the legitimate interest of a foreign sovereign.\" Bank One's Opp'n at 26-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   China's interest in the development of a sound banking system is legitimate, contrary to the government's assertions otherwise, Gov't's Reply at 18, and bank secrecy laws protect that interest. Nevertheless, China's interest would not be undermined by enforcement of the subpoenas. Under Chinese law, Chinese banks may disclose bank records to a \"competent organ\" if that organ has presented to the bank a notice required by Chinese regulation. Bank Two Expert Decl. \u00b6 19. Competent organs include \"judicial organs, administrative organs, military organs and public institutions exercising administrative functions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. While allowing for limited disclosure to Chinese authorities does not mean that similar disclosure to United States authorities would be legal under Chinese law, these exceptions reflect that even Chinese authorities recognize that bank secrecy can co-exist with limited disclosure to government agencies. Therefore, insofar as the laws at issue here further China's interest in a stable banking system, disclosure to the United States in response to an investigatory subpoena is not a detriment to that interest. Other courts have drawn a similar inference from Chinese laws permitting disclosure of bank records to the Chinese government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Grand Jury Proceedings\n   </em>\n   , 532 F.2d at 408 (\"Field seeks to prohibit a United States grand jury from obtaining information that would have been obtainable by officials there for their own investigations.

The MOJ's counsel was sought prior to the government having initiated proceedings to compel compliance with the subpoenas and the Chinese government has consistently resisted the United States' attempts to enforce subpoena compliance as contrary to Chinese law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gucci II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264793\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/122/\">\n    768 F.3d at 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing letter from the Commission and the People's Bank as proclaiming that \"China's laws prohibit commercial banks from ... turning over account records pursuant to foreign court orders\"). Nevertheless, as previously noted the, the MOJ letters contribute little to the banks' case. If anything, the MOJ is circumspect about what penalties will result if the banks comply. The MOJ's first letter advises Bank Three that \"the banking regulatory authorities will impose administrative penalties and fines on you, and you may bear civil or criminal liabilities depending on your situation.\" Mar. 22, 2018 MOJ Ltr. From the beginning, the MOJ is non-committal about civil and criminal penalties. In addition, the allusion to civil liability gives the impression that the MOJ is not enmeshed in the details of the case. While the letter promises administrative sanctions, only fines are referenced and nothing about the severity of such fines is mentioned. The second letter gives somewhat more detail, explaining that, under China's Commercial Banking Law, if the banks comply with the subpoenas they \"will be subject to administrative penalties such as fines, suspension of banking operation and revocation of license and so on, civil suits from the account holders whose accounts have been\n   illegally interfered with, and even criminal liabilities according to different circumstances.\" Jan. 6, 2019 MOJ Ltr. at 3. Yet, like the first letter, this letter gives no concrete indication criminal penalties are likely and fails to reference how [REDACTED]'s dissolution affects any civil liability. Additionally, although the second letter says sanctions \"will\" be imposed, that letter's reference to administrative penalties lists only possible sanctions rather than what penalties the banks will face. Moreover, the introduction of suspending the bank's operating licenses is a departure from the first letter. Finally, nothing about the second letter, or the first for that matter, suggests the administrative penalties will amount to more than nominal fines. The MOJ's letters, then, provide only thin support to the banks' case that court-ordered compliance with the subpoenas will trigger substantial punishment from Chinese authorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   In sum, the banks have established a basis in Chinese law for the imposition of punishment should any of the banks be compelled to comply with the subpoenas. Yet, such penalties, severe or otherwise, would be unprecedented. While the MOJ has said that the three banks, if they comply, will face administrative penalties, the MOJ's letters do not suggest that the Chinese government is inclined to take the counter-intuitive step of imposing heavy penalties against banks in which the Chinese government has a substantial ownership interest. At most, this factor tips ever so slightly toward the banks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <em>\n    g) Good faith\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Finally, the government agrees that none of the banks has acted in bad faith.

To recap, the records' Chinese origins, the slim chance of the banks suffering some hardship if forced to comply, and the banks' good faith through this process all militate against enforcement of the subpoenas. Conversely, the importance of the subpoenaed records, the specificity of the subpoenas, the lack of alternative channels for obtaining the records, and the risk of undermining a United States national security interest at the pinnacle of importance, all favor enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Per the government, \"[t]he balance of national interests is arguably the most important comity factor.\" Gov't's Mot.-Bank One at 23 (citing\n   <em>\n    Richmark Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524342\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/959/1468/#p1476\">\n    959 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1476 );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Gov't's Reply at 17 (calling the respective interests of the sovereigns the \" 'first and most important factor' of the Restatement test\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Grand Jury Proceedings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10590325\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/532/404/#p407\">\n    532 F.2d 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 407 (5th Cir. 1976) )).

The most important factor, the interests of the relevant countries, could not fall more firmly in favor of enforcement. National security is at stake on one side; on the other, no national interest is compromised. Additionally, the United States government has subpoenaed only records relevant to its national security investigation and has done so because no effective alternative method of accessing those critical records exists. The banks' potential hardship is speculative, and, in any event, any penalty is unlikely to be consequential. While the\n   records originated in China, and the banks, commendably, have acted in good faith, the importance of those factors pale in comparison to the remainder of the calculus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Application of the factors redound strongly in favor of compelling compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
