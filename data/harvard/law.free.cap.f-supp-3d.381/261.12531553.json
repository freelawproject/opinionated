Sheppard alleges that Marshak has interfered with Sheppard's business opportunities by threatening to sue concert promoters or producers for promoting Sheppard's performances under the Drifters' name. Preston Decl. \u00b6 10. According to Sheppard, these threats have caused at least two of his potential performances to be canceled - a January 2017 performance at a showcase\n   produced by the Association of Performing Arts Professionals at the Hilton Hotel in New York City and a June 2017 New Jersey concert.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11136925\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/240/184/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-13 &amp; Ex.

E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Sheppard moves to vacate the injunction against him on two grounds. He asserts that the Court should vacate the injunction pursuant to the catch-all provision in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6) or, alternatively, under Rule 60(d)(3), which provides that a court can set aside a judgment for fraud on the court. Marshak argues that Sheppard's motion is untimely and does not implicate the extraordinary circumstances necessary to vacate the injunction under Rule 60(b)(6). Marshak also argues that Sheppard has presented no evidence of fraud on this Court for purposes of Rule 60(d)(3). Marshak adds that Sheppard has consistently violated the Court's injunction and thus Sheppard's unclean hands prevent him from obtaining the relief he seeks.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Marshak Decl. Ex. 5. Marshak's arguments are persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Under Rule 60(b)(6), a motion to vacate a judgment may be granted \"for any other reason justifying relief.\" This catch-all provision, however, should be invoked only when there are \"extraordinary circumstances\" that \"work an extreme and undue hardship.\"\n   <em>\n    Nemaizer v. Baker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1587147\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/793/58/#p63\">\n    793 F.2d 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 63 (2d Cir. 1986). Moreover, \"a motion under Rule 60(b)(6), like motions under all parts of the Rule, must be made within a reasonable time.\"\n   <em>\n    Truskoski v. ESPN, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12034673\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/60/74/#p77\">\n    60 F.3d 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 77 (2d Cir. 1995) (quotation marks omitted);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1). And equitable considerations, such as unclean hands, factor into whether to grant a Rule 60(b)(6) motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sony Corp. v. S.W.I. Trading, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7853699\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/104/535/#p541\">\n    104 F.R.D. 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 541 (S.D.N.Y. 1985) (\"[D]efendant cannot avail himself of the equitable considerations governing the application of [ Rule] 60(b)(6) because of his unclean hands, both in violating plaintiffs' trademark and in violating the settlement agreement with plaintiffs not to infringe the ... trademark.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In this case, Sheppard brings a Rule 60(b)(6) motion more than thirty years after the injunction that he seeks to vacate was issued. He provides two unconvincing excuses for the delay. First, Sheppard \"believes\" that he did not learn of the\n   <em>\n    Treadwell\n   </em>\n   case finding the Mark invalid until sometime \"within the last five years.\" Preston Reply Decl. \u00b6 20. Second, he contends that he did not previously bring this motion because it was only recently that Marshak began enforcing the injunction by threatening to sue individuals with whom Sheppard contracted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Sheppard's single, summary contention that he \"believes\" that he did not learn of the\n   <em>\n    Treadwell\n   </em>\n   case until sometime within the last five years is not persuasive evidence of that fact, and in any event five years is not a reasonable time to wait to bring a Rule 60(b)(6) motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v. Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11085918\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/252/191/#p201\">\n    252 F.3d 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 201 (2d Cir. 2001) (\"We do not think that three and one-half years from the date judgment was entered is a reasonable time [under Rule 60(b)(6) ].\");\n   <em>\n    Truskoski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12034673\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/60/74/#p77\">\n    60 F.3d at 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that seventeen months was not a reasonable\n   time under Rule 60(b)(6) ). Moreover, Sheppard's second argument boils down to this: he could violate the injunction at will until recently, and therefore he did not need to bring this motion. This argument is untenable and, if anything, highlights Sheppard's unclean hands, which weighs against granting his motion. Similarly, the \"extreme and undue hardship\" Sheppard claims to be suffering because of the injunction is that he cannot gain business by violating the injunction and wrongfully using the Drifters' name. In sum, Sheppard's Rule 60(b)(6) theory is unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Sheppard's alternative Rule 60(d)(3) theory is also unpersuasive. Rule 60(d)(3) permits a court to \"set aside a judgment for fraud on the court.\" \"Fraud on the court is fraud which seriously affects the integrity of the normal process of adjudication.\"\n   <em>\n    Transaero, Inc. v. La Fuerza Area Boliviana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10507148\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/24/457/#p460\">\n    24 F.3d 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 460 (2d Cir.),\n   <em>\n    on reh'g in part sub nom.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Transaero, Inc. v. La Fuerza Aerea Boliviana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1852372\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/648/\">\n    38 F.3d 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 1994) (quotation marks omitted). The concept \"embrace[s] only that species of fraud which does or attempts to, defile the court itself, or is a fraud perpetrated by officers of the court so that the judicial machinery cannot perform in the usual manner its impartial task of adjudging cases that are presented for adjudication.\"\n   <em>\n    Kupferman v. Consol. Research &amp; Mfg. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"724249\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/459/1072/#p1078\">\n    459 F.2d 1072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1078 (2d Cir. 1972) (quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Sheppard provides no evidence of fraud on the Court itself. Rather, he argues only that Marshak made allegedly fraudulent representations to the PTO, and that this Court in turn relied upon those representations. In this case, Judge Pollack carefully considered the relationship of Marshak, a manager of \"The Drifters\"; George Treadwell, another manager of the group who was succeeded by his widow, Faye Treadwell; and Sheppard, a former performer with the group. Judge Pollack specifically found that the representation by Marshak's assignors to the PTO that no other group had the right to use the Mark was not a willful, material misstatement because, among other reasons, the group managed by Faye Treadwell had performed largely outside the United States. That Treadwell lacked any right to use the Mark receives some support from the jury verdict in the\n   <em>\n    Treadwell\n   </em>\n   case which, although vacated by the district court, found that Treadwell had abandoned use of the Mark. Judge Pollack also relied on a prior decision by Judge Weinfeld which had similarly upheld Marshak's use of the Mark over objections that the trademark application contained false statements as to Marshak's exclusive and continuous use of the Mark.\n   <em>\n    Marshak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7402696\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/666/590/\">\n    666 F.Supp. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   595-96 (citing\n   <em>\n    Marshak v.

The fact that the\n   <em>\n    Treadwell\n   </em>\n   court found that Faye Treadwell had the right to the Mark at the time Marshak applied for a registration for the Mark in no way indicates that the representations to this Court, which were thoroughly vetted, were material misrepresentations to the Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In any event, allegedly false representations made to the PTO are not tantamount to defrauding the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Broyhill Furniture Indus., Inc. v.

Cir. 1993). Sheppard argues that this case mirrors\n   <em>\n    Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co.\n   </em>\n   , a case in which the Supreme Court found fraud upon the court, but\n   <em>\n    Hazel-Atlas\n   </em>\n   involved \"a deliberately planned and carefully executed scheme to defraud not only the Patent Office but the Circuit Court of Appeals.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142921\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/322/238/#p245\">\n    322 U.S. 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 245,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142921\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/322/238/#p245\">\n    64 S.Ct. 997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142921\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/322/238/#p245\">\n    88 L.Ed. 1250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1944).

The issue of Faye Treadwell's rights to the Mark was in fact aired before the Court and Sheppard points to no fraud on the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Additionally, Sheppard's fraud on the court argument is a thinly veiled attempt to reargue the defense he raised before this Court more than thirty years ago - that Marshak obtained the Mark by fraud. \"However, a party may not use a Rule 60 motion as a means to relitigate a case.\"\n   <em>\n    Ptak Bros.
