Since 2014, J.W., a resident of the District, has been enrolled in Stuart Hall School (\"Stuart Hall\"), a private boarding school in Staunton, Virginia. She is eligible for special education services. It is uncontested that in August 2015, the District of Columbia Public Schools (\"DCPS\") unilaterally decided that she was ineligible for those services without proper notice to her parents, an evaluation, an individualized education program (\"IEP\"), and an appropriate placement for the 2015-2016 school year. After an administrative due process hearing in November 2015, an impartial Hearing Officer determined that DCPS denied J.W. a free appropriate public education (\"FAPE\") by terminating her special education services without an evaluation, an IEP, and an appropriate placement. The Hearing Officer also determined that DCPS violated IDEA by failing to provide Ms. Wimbish with prior written notice of its ineligibility determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In fashioning a remedy, the Hearing Officer issued an HOD that imposed certain conditions. First, the HOD required Ms. Wimbish to obtain written permission from Stuart Hall for DCPS to conduct observations and interviews there, with Ms. Wimbish to bear the costs associated with any legal action to compel Stuart Hall to authorize the on-site observations and interviews by DCPS. Second, the HOD restricted Ms. Wimbish's future due process complaints in that she could not challenge the adequacy of J.W.'s evaluation if DCPS determined that J.W. was ineligible for special education. Despite finding that J.W. was entitled to an evaluation before DCPS' decision that she was no longer a child with a disability, the HOD declined to order any further assessments of J.W. Ms. Wimbish challenges these portions of the HOD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Ms. Wimbish asks this Court to, among other things, order the District to: (1) conduct a full evaluation of J.W. in all areas of suspected disability, and if she disagrees with that evaluation, an independent educational evaluation (\"IEE\") at public expense in line with market rates; (2) convene a meeting of J.W.'s IEP team to review the evaluations, determine her eligibility, and develop an IEP for J.W. if she is eligible to receive an IEP; (3) maintain J.W.'s placement at Stuart Hall until an IEP is developed or she is determined to be ineligible for special education services; and (4) reverse certain portions of the HOD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pending before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. Upon careful consideration of the parties' submissions, the applicable law, and the entire record, the Court concludes that: (1) the Hearing Officer erred in ordering Ms. Wimbish to obtain written permission from Stuart Hall for DCPS to conduct on-site observations and interviews and requiring\n   her to bear the costs associated with any legal action to compel those observations and interviews there; and (2) the Hearing Officer did not provide a reasoned explanation for restricting Ms. Wimbish's ability to challenge the adequacy of J.W.'s evaluation in future due process complaints. Because the Hearing Officer did not provide an adequate remedy for DCPS' failure to conduct an evaluation of J.W. before its ineligibility determination, the Court directs the District to conduct a full evaluation of J.W. Therefore, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the District's cross-motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Hearing Officer also issued an order and explained that \"the specificity of [the] Order [was] required due to the apparent inability of the parties and their counsel to work cooperatively, even to schedule meetings.\" HOD, ECF No. 35-2 at 43 n.15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, the order imposed certain conditions on the parties.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290543\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/153/4/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290543\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/153/4/\">\n    at 43-50, \u00b6\u00b6 1-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Two of those conditions are relevant here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290543\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/153/4/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290543\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/153/4/\">\n    at 44-45, \u00b6\u00b6 8-15, 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, the Hearing Officer required Ms. Wimbish to \"obtain written authorization from a non-public, parochial, out-of-state boarding school to allow DCPS to observe their school or, if the school resists, to shoulder the financial burden of forcing the school to allow the DCPS observation through legal action.\" Pls.'

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Ms. Wimbish seeks the partial reversal of the HOD on three grounds: (1) the Hearing Officer erred in \"conditioning J.W.'s right to a FAPE on Ms. Wimbish['s] ability to fund a type of legal proceeding that does not exist and [that she] could not afford even if it did[;]\" (2) the Hearing Officer \"violated [her] right to bring a due process complaint by improperly limiting the subject matter of any future due process complaints[;]\" and (3) the Hearing Officer \"refused\" to order the District to comply with IDEA and \"fully evaluate\n   J.W.\" Pls.' Mem., ECF No. 43-1 at 1. The Court addresses each argument in turn, concluding that Ms. Wimbish has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the Hearing Officer erred in: (1) requiring her to compel Stuart Hall to allow DCPS to conduct observations and interviews at Stuart Hall; and (2) restricting her ability to bring an administrative due process challenge for future actions by DCPS. The Court also concludes that the Hearing Officer erred as a matter of law by denying a full evaluation of J.W. before DCPS decided that she was no longer eligible for special education services. Ms. Wimbish is therefore entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Hearing Officer Erred in Requiring Ms. Wimbish to Compel Stuart Hall to Allow DCPS to Conduct Observations and Interviews at Stuart Hall\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Ms. Wimbish asks this Court to reverse and strike the portion of the HOD that ordered her to \"secure access for DCPS employees to observe Stuart Hall's campus\" because it conditions \"J.W.'s receipt of a FAPE on Ms. Wimbish's ability to pay for legal action against Stuart Hall\" and she \"cannot comply with [that] order as a matter of legal impossibility because no cause of action exists to implement the order.\" Pls.'

The District argues that this condition was appropriate, in part, because \"Ms. Wimbish unilaterally chose for J.W. to attend [Stuart Hall].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. The District contends that Ms. Wimbish has not taken any action to obtain a court order to allow the observations at Stuart Hall, and she has \"failed to account for what, if any, costs would be associated with obtaining said court order.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply, ECF No. 50 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court is not persuaded by the District's arguments.

Because IDEA neither requires her to gain access for DCPS to observe on Stuart Hall's campus nor pay for legal action against Stuart Hall, Ms. Wimbish has demonstrated that the Hearing Officer erred in ordering her to do so.
