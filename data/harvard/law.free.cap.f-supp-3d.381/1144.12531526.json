Lanza, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case involves an attempt by a tribal court to assert jurisdiction over a party that never set foot within the tribe's reservation, never contracted with any tribal members or organizations, and never expressly directed any activity within the reservation's confines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Employers Mutual Casualty Company (\"EMC\") is an Iowa-based insurance company. In 2004, EMC sold commercial general liability policies to Service Station Equipment and Sales, Inc. (\"SSES\") and Milam Building Associates, Inc. (\"Milam\"). Neither company has any tribal affiliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   While these insurance policies were in place, SSES and Milam were each hired to perform certain work on a gas station in Chinle, Arizona. This gas station was situated on tribally-owned land within the Navajo Nation reservation. In March 2005, an employee of a subcontractor that had been hired by Milam accidentally breached a fuel line. This breach, which went undetected for five months, caused over 15,000 gallons of gasoline to leak into the ground. In response, the Navajo Nation sued an array of parties, including SSES, Milam, and EMC, in Navajo tribal court. EMC, in turn, moved to dismiss on the ground that it wasn't subject to tribal jurisdiction. After the tribal courts rejected this argument, EMC filed this action in federal court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As explained below, the Court agrees with EMC that it isn't subject to tribal jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has never held that a tribal court has jurisdiction over a non-member, and although the Ninth Circuit has issued several decisions\n   recognizing (or noting the possibility of) such jurisdiction, those cases have almost exclusively involved instances where a non-member was physically present on tribal land and thereafter engaged in the conduct giving rise to liability. Moreover, to the extent the Ninth Circuit has suggested an insurance company may be sued in tribal court despite the absence of any physical presence on tribal land, its decisions have been limited to circumstances where the policyholder was a tribal member and the insurance company engaged in conduct specifically directed toward the reservation. No court has ever recognized tribal jurisdiction under the circumstances presented here, where an insurance company simply sold a policy to a non-tribal member. The Court thus concludes this case doesn't satisfy either of the jurisdictional tests recognized by the Ninth Circuit: (1) EMC isn't subject to jurisdiction under the \"right to exclude\" test because EMC has never done anything to enter tribal land (and thus can't be excluded), and (2) neither of the exceptions recognized in\n   <em>\n    Montana v.

(Doc. 1-2 at 93-97.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This case concerns a parcel of land in Chinle, Arizona that is owned by the Navajo Nation and located within the Navajo Nation reservation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 5.) In approximately 1955, the Navajo Nation leased the parcel to several tribal members, who thereafter began operating a gas station on the site. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) In 1997, these tribal members entered into a sublease with Pic-N-Run, a company based in Flagstaff, Arizona, to operate the gas station. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Until 2004, fuel was stored at the site in three underground storage tanks (\"USTs\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) At some point, Pic-N-Run decided to replace the USTs with above-ground petroleum storage tank systems (\"ASTs\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Pic-N-Run hired SSES and/or another company to assist with the UST-to-AST conversion and separately hired Milam to perform some other renovation work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the time they performed this work, both SSES and Milam were covered by commercial general liability policies issued by EMC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 10, 12.) Neither company has any tribal affiliation. SSES is \"a non-Indian Arizona corporation whose officer is ... a non-Indian individual\" and Milam is \"a non-Indian Texas corporation whose officers are ... both non-Indians.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) Additionally, EMC is not \"a member or member entity of the Navajo Nation,\" \"does not have a contractual relationship with the Navajo Nation,\" and issued both of the relevant insurance policies from locations (Show Low, Arizona and Flagstaff, Arizona) that are not within the Navajo Nation reservation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 3, 10, 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In March 2005, an employee of a subcontractor that had been hired by Milam accidentally breached a fuel line. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12, 13.) This breach, which went undetected\n   for five months, caused over 15,000 gallons of gasoline to leak into the ground. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) During a subsequent investigation, it was determined that multiple other gasoline leaks had occurred on the site \"from the mid-1940s to the mid-1980s and between 1974 and 1978.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In August 2009, the United States Environmental Protection Agency issued an administrative order (the \"EPA Order\") under what's commonly known as the Resource Conservation Recovery Act (\"RCRA\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) The EPA Order was issued against various potentially responsible parties (\"PRPs\"), including Milam's officers, the tribal members who had subleased the land to Pic-N-Run, and Pic-N-Run. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) SSES was not subject to the EPA Order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Additionally, no insurance companies were subject to the EPA Order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In November 2013, the Navajo Nation brought an action in Navajo tribal court to recover monetary damages and \"n\u00e1ly\u00e9\u00e9h\" arising from the gas leak.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In January 2014, EMC filed a motion to dismiss based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction and standing. (Doc. 1-2 at 82-91.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In February 2018-more than four years later-the tribal court issued an order denying the motion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 103-118.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On March 9, 2018, EMC filed a petition for a writ of prohibition with the Navajo Supreme Court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 120-139.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On March 25, 2018, the Navajo Supreme Court issued an order denying the petition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 141-42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On May 25, 2018, EMC filed its complaint in this matter, which seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. (Doc. 1.)

Thus, it's difficult to fathom how the right-to-exclude framework could be construed to confer tribal jurisdiction over a lawsuit against EMC. The theory underlying that framework is that, because a tribe has the sovereign right to exclude non-members from entering its land, the tribe must have the corollary right to adjudicate disputes arising from non-member conduct occurring on its land. Yet here, EMC never set foot on the Navajo Nation's land. Because the tribe couldn't have \"excluded\" EMC from engaging in the conduct at issue (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   selling insurance policies to non-member corporations at off-reservation locations), it follows that the \"right to exclude\" framework doesn't supply a valid pathway to tribal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   This outcome is consistent with the handful of cases, cited by Defendants, in which courts suggested it may be possible to sue an insurance company in tribal court despite the absence of any physical presence on tribal land. All but one of those cases involved circumstances where the insurance company contracted directly with a tribal member when selling the policy and thereafter engaged in conduct directed toward the reservation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Allstate Indemnity Co. v.

Here, in contrast, the insurance policies at issue were general liability policies issued to non-Indian corporations, there are no facts suggesting that monthly premium statements were mailed to the reservation, and there are no facts suggesting that EMC's agents communicated with any tribal members after the spill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The one remaining insurance-company case cited by Defendants-\n   <em>\n    Admiral Ins. Co. v. Blue Lake Rancheria Tribal Court\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201144331\">\n    2012 WL 1144331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Cal. 2012) -bears a closer factual resemblance to this case. There, an insurer (Admiral) sold a policy to a non-tribal building contractor, which thereafter accepted an assignment of several employees from a tribal corporation to its jobsites.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. When those workers got injured, the contractor was sued in tribal court and the contractor filed a cross-claim against Admiral.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In response, Admiral sought a temporary restraining order in federal court enjoining the exercise of tribal jurisdiction over it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2-3. Because Admiral hadn't exhausted its tribal remedies, the district court declined to reach the merits of whether Admiral was subject to tribal jurisdiction. Instead, the court denied relief because, among other reasons, \"the record [was] not clear as to where exactly [the contractor's] Tribal Court crossclaim against Admiral arose.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. The court cautioned, however, that it had \"some doubts as to the Tribal Court's jurisdiction in this case\" and observed that\n   <em>\n    Allstate\n   </em>\n   was distinguishable because Admiral hadn't contracted with any tribal members or directed any of its conduct toward the reservation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Although there are portions of the\n   <em>\n    Admiral\n   </em>\n   decision that seem favorable to Defendants, it does not, in the final analysis, support their position. The\n   <em>\n    Admiral\n   </em>\n   court wasn't tasked with deciding whether tribal jurisdiction existed-due to Admiral's failure to exhaust, the court merely addressed whether the jurisdictional issue presented a \"colorable question.\" Here, EMC has exhausted its tribal remedies, so the jurisdictional issue is squarely presented. Moreover, the\n   <em>\n    Admiral\n   </em>\n   court expressed skepticism about whether jurisdiction actually existed and noted that\n   <em>\n    Allstate\n   </em>\n   was distinguishable. The Court shares that skepticism and concludes, for the reasons stated above, that it would be improper to construe the \"right to exclude\" framework as allowing tribal courts to exercise jurisdiction over parties that have never set foot on reservation land, interacted with tribal members, or expressly directed any activity within the reservation's borders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Finally, Defendants also contend that\n   <em>\n    Stock West Corp. v. Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10523972\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/942/655/\">\n    942 F.2d 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 1991), supports their claim that the conduct at issue here took place on tribal land. This argument is unavailing. Although the original three-judge panel's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Stock West\n   </em>\n   contained dicta discussing where tribal claims against insurance companies should be said to arise (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10523972\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/942/655/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 662 ), the Ninth Circuit subsequently agreed to rehear the case\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   and declined to adopt that portion of the three-judge panel's opinion.\n   <em>\n    Stock West Corp. v.

Moreover, the two Supreme Court cases discussed in the\n   <em>\n    Stock West\n   </em>\n   dicta didn't actually hold that claims against insurance companies arise on the reservation-both cases merely (and narrowly) held that exhaustion was required before challenging a tribal court's jurisdiction in federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Iowa Mut.

For the reasons discussed in Part A above concerning the right-to-exclude framework, this requirement isn't satisfied here. EMC didn't enter the reservation, expressly direct any conduct toward the reservation, or engage in any interactions with tribal members. The Court respectfully disagrees with Defendants' argument that selling an insurance policy without a tribal exclusion is tantamount to operating within a reservation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The second\n   <em>\n    Montana\n   </em>\n   exception is also inapplicable because Defendants haven't adequately established that EMC's conduct poses a threat to the tribe's economic security or health and welfare. It bears emphasizing that EMC didn't spill any gasoline or cause any environmental damage here. Instead, EMC is being sued largely as a precautionary measure. For\n   example, the Navajo Nation stated in the complaint filed in tribal court that \"[t]he Nation has an actual and justiciable interest in\n   <em>\n    maximizing insurance funds\n   </em>\n   ... and the Nation\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   be required to incur costs ... if the Policyholder Defendants' insurance does not pay.\" (Doc. 1-2 at 77, emphases added.) Similarly, the tribal court stated in its order denying EMC's motion to dismiss that EMC was subject to its jurisdiction because \"[t]he insurance relationship\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   make EMC responsible for remediating the spill\" and \"Milam and SSES\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   look to EMC to assist in paying for that cleanup.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 109, emphases added.) And during oral argument on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, defense counsel acknowledged that the record is unclear as to whether the Navajo Nation actually requires funding from EMC in order to remediate the damage arising from the gas spill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In the Court's view, this is too speculative of a basis to conclude the Navajo Nation met its burden of affirmatively establishing that its exertion of \"civil authority over the conduct of non-Indians\" is necessary because EMC's \"conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe.\"\n   <em>\n    Montana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188224\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/544/\">\n    450 U.S. at 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188224\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/544/\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the Navajo Nation obviously has a strong and legitimate interest in protecting the integrity of its land and water supply, the record doesn't establish that EMC's insurance funds are necessary to achieve this objective. For example, the parties have stipulated that the gasoline leaks at the gas station began as early as the 1940s and continued for decades before Milam and SSES did any work at the property. Thus, it's possible that the parties responsible for the earlier leaks will be held responsible for all or most of the remediation costs, not EMC's insureds. Nor does the record establish that Milam and SSES are unable to pay their hypothetical share of the remediation costs in the absence of insurance coverage. Finally, the parties have stipulated that the EPA has already issued an administrative order requiring various parties (not including EMC) to remediate the damage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In these respects, this case is quite dissimilar from the circumstances in which the Ninth Circuit has found the second\n   <em>\n    Montana\n   </em>\n   exception was satisfied. In\n   <em>\n    Knighton\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit emphasized that the non-member's conduct \"was of long duration and had a great impact on the Tribe.... [For example], Knighton made unreasonably risky investments that led to investment losses in excess of $ 1.2 million.... We conclude that this conduct threatened the Tribe's very subsistence and that the Tribe therefore retains the inherent power under the second\n   <em>\n    Montana\n   </em>\n   exception to regulate this conduct.\" 922 F.3d at 905,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201781404\">\n    2019 WL 1781404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *10. Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Grand Canyon Skywalk\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit concluded that jurisdiction was plausible under the second\n   <em>\n    Montana\n   </em>\n   exception in light of the enormous \"potential economic impact\" of termination of the contract at issue, which could result in damages as high as $ 50 million.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7342778,3566820\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/1196/\">\n    715 F.3d at 1206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
