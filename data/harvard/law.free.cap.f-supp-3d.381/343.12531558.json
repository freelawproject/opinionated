(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 126-2 \u00b6 1). The company is jointly owned by Colette Pelissier-Field (\"Pelissier-Field\") and Brigham Field. (Doc. 7-1 \u00b6 2). Malibu offers its works for download through a subscription-based website under the brand name \"X-Art.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Doc. 122-8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 7-1 \u00b6 4).

Content Partnerships with Tubesites\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As part of its advertising strategy, \"[a] few years ago,\" Malibu uploaded samples of its movies along with some full-length versions of its \"older productions\" to third-party \"tubesites\" hoping to drive traffic to its own website and to increase subscriptions. (Doc. 122-2 \u00b6 11; Doc. 122-4 \u00b6 3). \"Tubesites\" are websites modeled after YouTube.com, with content consisting primarily of user-uploaded videos and an interface allowing user engagement and participation in the form of \"comments\" and \"likes.\" Some of these tubesites provide an option to download copies of videos posted by other users. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 122-2 \u00b6 39; Docs. 126-12 to -31). Examples of tubesites providing adult pornographic content are Pornhub.com, Redtube.com, Youporn.com, and Xhamster.com. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 126-2 \u00b6\u00b6 5-6; Doc. 126-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Many of these tubesites offer \"content partner\" programs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 126-9;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 122-2 \u00b6 12). Malibu was a content partner with several tubesites, including Pornhub, Redtube, Youporn, and Xhamster.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 126-9;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 122-2 \u00b6 12). The parties dispute what it means to be a \"content partner\" with a tubesite. Malibu maintains that, through the content partnership, it was able to \"maintain its copyrights while directing\n   traffic to its subscription-based website.\" (Doc. 122-2 \u00b6 12). John Doe points to the terms of use for several of the tubesites carrying Malibu's content which warn that, although user-uploaders retain all ownership rights for uploaded content, they also grant certain licenses to both the tubesite and the tubesite's users. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 126-2 \u00b6 4; Doc. 126-60).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Malibu does not recall and has not retained records of which full-length videos it uploaded to tubesites as part of the content partner programs. (Doc. 126-2 \u00b6\u00b6 4, 8; Doc. 126-33 at 14-15). All of the copyrighted videos at issue in this litigation were available for download on various tubesites. (Doc. 126-2 \u00b6 11;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docs. 126-12 to -31). Malibu \"denies that it has posted all of\" the copyrights-in-suit to tubesites, but acknowledges that it may have posted some of them \"for promotional reasons under the expectation that the videos could not be downloaded and distributed by the website[']s viewers.\" (Doc. 126-62 at 10-11). Malibu does not deny that Pelissier-Field left a comment on one of the videos at issue on the Youporn tubesite under the handle \"Colette X-Art.\" (Doc. 126-2 \u00b6 9; Doc. 131-1 \u00b6 9;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 126-17 at 5). Malibu did not itself advertise its works for free to download or distribute on either its own website or on third-party tubesites. (Doc. 122-2 \u00b6 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. X-Cash Agents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Malibu also promotes its content through use of \"X-Cash agents.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   These agents sign up as \"affiliates\" of Malibu on X-Cash.com. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 126-2 \u00b6 14; Doc. 126-34 at 2). The agents are then provided access to certain of Malibu's content for sharing on their own websites with advertisements for and links redirecting visitors to X-Art.com. (Doc. 126-2 \u00b6 14; Doc. 126-34 at 2). Malibu pays the agents 50 percent \"of any sales directly from the billers.\" (Doc. 126-34 at 2). It is unclear from the record whether Malibu made any of the copyrights-in-suit available to these agents via X-Cash.com, but John Doe has adduced dozens of screenshots from tubesites and torrent sites suggesting that X-Cash agents may have uploaded various of Malibu's videos, including some of the copyrights-in-suit, to both tubesites and BitTorrent websites.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 126-50 to -59). Malibu does not directly respond to this evidence, but broadly denies that it ever uploaded its own work to the BitTorrent network or \"authorized anyone else to distribute its works through the BitTorrent protocol.\" (Doc. 131-1 \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    C. John Doe's Downloads\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   John Doe testified that he discovered Malibu's videos on the BitTorrent network while searching for a shareware computer design program of a similar name. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 122-7, John Doe Dep. 11:15-12:19,\n   13:16-14:18, 23:6-12 (\"Doe Dep.\")). He explained that while searching for the design program, the torrent search engine displayed results for X-Art videos. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He claimed that he then performed a Google search for the term \"X-Art\" and discovered torrent websites and tubesites offering free downloads of many of X-Art's videos. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) John Doe further claimed that he reviewed the tubesites' terms of service and was left with the impression that Malibu and X-Art had given broad permission to others to distribute and use their videos for free. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16:4-17:22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   John Doe admits that he downloaded 19 of the 20 copyrights-in-suit using the BitTorrent protocol. (Doc. 140-1 \u00b6 6;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 33 \u00b6 23; Doc. 126 at 16). He denies downloading the video \"In for the Night.\" (Doc. 33 \u00b6 23; Doe Dep. 15:15-16:3). John Doe testified that \"[i]t was just easier to [download them] via BitTorrent than it is from the distribution websites.\" (Doe Dep. 40:2-7). John Doe never communicated or had a relationship with Malibu before he downloaded its works via BitTorrent. (Doc. 122-2 \u00b6 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On November 25, 2015, Malibu commenced this action against John Doe, asserting a claim for violation of the United States Copyright Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , subsequently filing an amended complaint on April 14, 2016. Therein, Malibu contends that it is the registered owner of the copyrights-in-suit and that John Doe downloaded, copied, and redistributed the copyrighted works without authorization. The court has permitted John Doe to proceed by pseudonym for purposes of the pretrial phases of this litigation.\n   <em>\n    Malibu Media, LLC v. Doe\n   </em>\n   , No. 4:15-CV-2281,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20524248\">\n    2016 WL 524248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (M.D. Pa. Feb. 10, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   John Doe's responsive pleading rejects the bulk of Malibu's allegations and raises ten affirmative defenses. John Doe also lodged a number of counterclaims against Malibu, its attorney, and its principals, including Pelissier-Field, premised on his belief that Malibu knowingly defrauded John Doe and the public by holding itself out as a provider of free adult video content only to later bring infringement actions against those downloading that content. We dismissed all counterclaims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). We determined first that each counterclaim was barred by\n   <em>\n    Noerr - Pennington\n   </em>\n   immunity, which shields those who petition the government for relief unless they know their lawsuit to be \"objectively baseless.\"\n   <em>\n    Malibu Media\n   </em>\n   , 238 F.Supp.3d at 643-45 (citing\n   <em>\n    United Mine Workers v.

We further determined, assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that immunity did not apply, that John Doe had failed to offer any allegations to support his contention that Malibu \"intended ... to entrap\" him and others for purposes of common law fraud; that Malibu engaged in criminal extortion, fraud, or deception under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201963\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; or that Malibu deceived him into purchasing or leasing goods in violation of Pennsylvania's Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law, 73 PA.

Section 106 grants six exclusive rights to copyright owners, including the right \"to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies\" and \"to distribute copies ... of the copyrighted work to the public.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20106\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1), (3). Malibu contends that John Doe violated the first of these rights by downloading its copyrighted videos via BitTorrent and the second by both making available for distribution and in fact distributing the videos through the BitTorrent network.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   John Doe admits that he \"did or attempted to download nineteen (19) of the twenty (20)\" videos identified in the appendix to Malibu's amended complaint via BitTorrent. (Doc. 140-1 \u00b6 6;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 33 \u00b6 23; Doc. 126 at 16). John Doe denies that he ever downloaded or redistributed the twentieth video, \"In for the Night.\" (Doc. 33 \u00b6 23; Doe Dep. 15:15-16:3). As to the videos John Doe admits downloading, John Doe does not oppose or respond to Malibu's arguments regarding direct copyright infringement, (\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   Doc. 122 at 3-6\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Doc. 127), nor does he move separately for summary judgment on the merits of Malibu's infringement claim, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docs. 123, 126). The uncontroverted record evidence establishes that John Doe did download, offer for redistribution, and redistribute 19 of the 20 copyrights-in-suit. With the exception of the disputed video \"In for the Night,\" there is no genuine issue for trial and Malibu has established the second element of its copyright infringement claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Malibu has not directed the court to any evidence-contested or otherwise-showing that John Doe in fact downloaded or redistributed the contested video \"In for the Night.\" Absent such evidence, we cannot find as a matter of law that Malibu is entitled to summary judgment on the question of infringement as to this video. John Doe, however, has not cross-moved for summary judgment on the basis of failure of proof. Consequently, whether John Doe unlawfully copied or distributed \"In for the Night\" remains an issue for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Affirmative Defenses\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As we have observed throughout this litigation, John Doe effectively concedes copyright infringement (with the exception noted above) and leans almost exclusively on his affirmative defenses. The provenance and substance of each defense is John Doe's belief that Malibu, through its conduct, authorized both John Doe and the public at large to download and redistribute its works from anywhere on the internet. We will address each affirmative defense\n   <em>\n    seriatim.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Abandonment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   John Doe first contends that Malibu abandoned its copyrights by entering into content partner relationships with tubesites and uploading its works thereto knowing that such sites offer free downloads of uploaded works to users. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 33 \u00b6 34). Both parties move for summary judgment on this defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A copyright owner will be found to have abandoned its copyright \"only if there is an intent by the copyright proprietor to surrender rights in his work.\"\n   <em>\n    Dam Things from Denmark v.

Whether a copyright owner's actions evince an intent to abandon its copyright is a highly factual issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Malibu Media, LLC v.

Viewing the record in the light most favorable to Malibu, a jury could readily find that Malibu is a dedicated and diligent defender of its copyrights, that it was unaware that tubesites would offer its copyrighted material for free download and did not authorize the tubesites to do so, and that it accordingly did not abandon or waive its right to enforce the copyrights-in-suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   But viewing the evidence favorably to John Doe, a jury could also reasonably conclude that Malibu knew the tubesites would offer its works for free download but uploaded its videos anyway, intending to give some of them away as part of its promotional strategy. John Doe has adduced evidence that Malibu or its agents may have uploaded each of the full-length copyrights-in-suit to various tubesites. Malibu concedes that it may have done so for promotional purposes, but \"under the expectation that the videos could not be downloaded and distributed by the website[']s viewers.\" (Doc. 126-62 at 11). Yet a jury could infer from co-owner Pelissier-Field's engagement with users on tubesites that she-and, by extension, Malibu-was familiar with the capabilities of those sites, including the download function. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 126-2 \u00b6 9; Doc. 126-17 at 5). A reasonable jury may also find it compelling that Malibu introduced these videos into the digital ether without executing any type of written agreement with the tubesites or retaining a single record of which videos were uploaded to which tubesites. (Doc. 126-2 \u00b6\u00b6 4, 8; Doc. 126-33 at 14-15). Malibu has also failed to engage in any meaningful way with John Doe's evidence and arguments regarding use of X-Cash agents to promote Malibu's material. John Doe has adduced evidence establishing, by Malibu's own admission, that such a program exists, although the scope and nature of the X-Cash program and how it operates are not entirely clear. The evidence on this issue is thin but, at this juncture, it is unanswered by Malibu.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   To be clear, we do not conclude today that Malibu\n   <em>\n    has\n   </em>\n   abandoned its rights for any of the copyrights-in-suit. At trial, John Doe will need to convince the jury that Malibu intentionally abandoned its rights\n   to copy and to distribute as to\n   <em>\n    each\n   </em>\n   of the copyrights-in-suit. As we previously indicated, a finding by the jury that Malibu abandoned its rights to enforce one or more copyrights does not mean that Malibu's entire library of works is free for all internet users to download and share.\n   <em>\n    Malibu Media\n   </em>\n   , 238 F.Supp.3d at 646. We hold only that-based on an equivocal record compounded by less-than-pellucid Rule 56.1 statements-genuine disputes of fact remain for trial as to whether Malibu abandoned its right to enforce any or all of the copyrights-in-suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Actual or Implied License\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   John Doe next raises affirmative defenses of actual or implied license. His argument in support of these defenses is opaque. We construe John Doe's responsive pleading and instant briefing as asserting that Malibu (1) granted him an actual license to reproduce and distribute its copyrighted works through the terms of service on tubesites to which Malibu uploaded its videos and (2) granted him (and \"anyone in the world with access to a computer\") an implied license to copy and distribute its copyrighted works by developing content partner relationships with and uploading its videos to tubesites. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 33 \u00b6 37; Doc. 126 at 17-23; Doc. 127 at 8-11). Both parties move for summary judgment on the actual or implied license defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n    <em>\n     Actual License\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Rule 56 record is devoid of evidence that Malibu granted John Doe an express or actual license to download its copyrighted works via BitTorrent. In support of this defense, John Doe points to terms of use for a number of tubesites, including Pornhub, Redtube, and Youporn. The terms of use provide, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   For clarity, you retain all of your ownership rights in your Content. However, by submitting Content to the Website, you hereby grant the Website a worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable license to use, exploit, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, communicate, and perform the Content in connection with the Website's (and its successors' and affiliates') business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Website (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels.

In no circumstances will we be liable to you for any exploitation of any Content that you post.

The terms of use establish that Malibu, upon uploading a video, grants a broad and irrevocable license to the tubesite as well as a limited license to the tubesites' users. The terms of use grant a license to users to access user-uploaded content (such as Malibu's videos) \"\n   <em>\n    through the Website\n   </em>\n   \" and \"to use, reproduce, distribute, display, communicate and perform such content\n   <em>\n    as permitted through the functionality of the Website.\n   </em>\n   \" (Doc. 126-60 at 2-4 (emphasis added)). That limited user license has no application to John Doe, who concedes that he accessed Malibu's content and redistributed same through torrent sites rather than tubesites\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   There is no evidence in the Rule 56 record from which a juror could find that Malibu granted an express license to John Doe to download its videos from any source of his choosing. The court will grant summary judgment to Malibu on John Doe's actual license affirmative defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     Implied License\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   John Doe also asserts that Malibu, by its conduct, granted him an implied license to download and redistribute the copyrights-in-suit.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 33 \u00b6 37). We reject at the outset any suggestion that, by placing a portion of its collection on a limited number of tubesites, Malibu impliedly licensed every person in the world to download its entire collection of copyrighted materials from any source on the internet. As to John Doe individually, the Rule 56 record contains no evidence indicative of an implied licensure relationship by which Malibu authorized John Doe to download and redistribute its copyrighted works through the BitTorrent network.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 127 at 7-8). We again reiterate that nothing about the tubesites would indicate to a reasonable person that downloading and sharing the content\n   <em>\n    via BitTorrent\n   </em>\n   was permissible. Moreover, Malibu has adduced evidence\n   that its website and the version of each video downloaded by John Doe contained copyright notices. (Doc. 122-2 \u00b6\u00b6 51, 66). John Doe generally denies these facts, but he cites nothing in the record to refute Malibu's evidence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 140-1 \u00b6\u00b6 51, 66). We conclude that, viewing the record evidence in the light most favorable to John Doe, no juror could find him to be the \"innocent infringer\" contemplated by Section 504(c)(2).

Malibu has moved for summary judgment on each of these defenses, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docs. 122 at 20-21, 23, 24), and John Doe failed to respond, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 127).

We will otherwise deny the pending motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Rule 56 record bears out what we have intimated since the beginning of this litigation: there is simply no merit to John Doe's assertion that, by offering its content on various tubesites, Malibu expressly or implicitly signaled to John Doe that he was free to download and redistribute its content through the BitTorrent network. This theory finds no support in law, logic, or the instant Rule 56 record. There remain genuine and material disputes of fact, however, as to whether Malibu knowingly abandoned its right to enforce these particular copyrights by placing content on the internet for public consumption. Accordingly, this matter will be set for trial on the issues of (1) whether John Doe engaged in unauthorized copying of the disputed video \"In for the Night\" and (2) whether Malibu, itself or through the acts of its agents, abandoned its rights under the Copyright Act to the 20 copyrights-in-suit.

We have instructed that responsive statements of fact must include citations to record evidence supporting any assertion that a genuine issue remains to be tried, and we have admonished that noncompliance with Rule 56.1 will result in the court deeming Malibu's statement to be admitted. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 139; Doc. 142 \u00b6 2). Nor has Malibu properly complied with Rule 56.1 concerning responsive statements. Malibu's response does not admit, deny, or otherwise directly respond to John Doe's enumerated paragraphs. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 131-1).

Such conduct would exceed the scope of your Download License and constitute copyright infringement....\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    (Doc. 101-3 at 2).

The limitations of this license are of dubious relevance given that Malibu concedes the provision did not exist at the time John Doe downloaded and redistributed the copyrights-in-suit. (Doc. 122-2 \u00b6 45). Moreover, the terms of Pornhub's license refer to \"our Works\"-quite plainly referencing Pornhub's\n    <em>\n     original\n    </em>\n    works-and not to \"Content Posted by Users,\" which the terms of use address separately.
