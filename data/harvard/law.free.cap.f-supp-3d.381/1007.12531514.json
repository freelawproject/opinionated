DUFFIN, U.S. Magistrate Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On August 21, 2018, the United States filed a verified complaint for civil forfeiture in rem against the defendant property. Francis Burns, who is identified in the complaint as a person associated with the defendant property, has filed various documents with the court. (ECF No. 9, 11, 12, 16) It appears that Burns is, in part, attempting to assert a claim in the defendant property on behalf of World Burns, Inc., of which Burns identifies himself as an \"authorized representative.\" (ECF No. 12 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The United States has moved to strike the putative claim of World Burns, Inc. because it was not filed by an attorney. (ECF No. 13.) It also asks the court to strike the putative counterclaim of the claimants because a counterclaim is not permitted in a forfeiture action. (ECF No. 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   No one responded to the United States' motion. However, the court did receive a document captioned \"Motion for Settlement &amp; Release of Interest\" from Burns, to which he attached various documents. (ECF No. 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The United States' motion to strike will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   It is well-established that \"[a] corporation is not permitted to litigate in a federal court unless it is represented by a lawyer licensed to practice in that court.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
