Two undercover county detectives were traveling behind the plaintiff's vehicle. The plaintiff believed that the county detectives were following his vehicle too closely, so he started to \"brake check\" them. Apparently, this did not cause the county detectives to distance themselves from the plaintiff's vehicle as he had intended, and the plaintiff eventually stopped his vehicle on the side of the road. The county detectives also stopped their vehicle near the plaintiff's vehicle and an encounter occurred during which the plaintiff showed the undercover detectives (who did not identify themselves as law enforcement officers) his loaded firearm in a \"low ready\" position. Upon seeing the firearm, the county detectives did not proceed further, and the plaintiff drove away. The county detectives contacted a township police department about this encounter and it ultimately resulted in the plaintiff's arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The plaintiff was charged with multiple criminal offenses based on his having allegedly pointed a gun at the county detectives. After a trial, a jury acquitted the plaintiff of all charges. The plaintiff then filed the instant action in which he asserted claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and Pennsylvania state law against numerous defendants. At this stage of the proceedings, the only defendants remaining in the case are the county, the county's district attorney and first assistant district attorney, and the two county detectives. After a lengthy period of discovery, these defendants have now moved for summary judgment in their favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The court has thoroughly reviewed the applicable record and the parties' submissions. Despite construing the evidence of record in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and resolving all reasonable inferences in his favor, the court finds that summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the plaintiff's federal claims is appropriate here because the plaintiff did not suffer any constitutional violations as a matter of law. Because the court disposes of all federal claims in this case, the court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims and such claims are dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiff, Christopher Fitzgerald (\"Fitzgerald\"), initiated this action by filing a complaint on June 24, 2016, alleging various federal constitutional violations and state law claims against the defendants, Christopher Cruz (\"Detective Cruz\"), the Department of Corrections for Lehigh County, Todd Frey (\"Detective Frey\"), Edward D. Hozza, Jr. (\"Hozza\"), Linda Kulp (\"Kulp\"), Lehigh County, the Lehigh County District Attorney's Office, Assistant District Attorney Steven Luksa (\"ADA Luksa\"), Michael Marks (\"Marks\"), District Attorney James B. Martin (\"DA Martin\"), Tom Muller (\"Muller\"), Raymond Seiling (\"Seiling\"), Joseph Stauffer (\"Stauffer\"), Edward Sweeney (\"Sweeney\"), Whitehall Township, the Whitehall Township Board of Commissioners, and the Whitehall Township Police Department a/k/a the Whitehall Township Bureau of Police (collectively the \"Original Defendants\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 15-26, Doc.

First, Muller, Sweeney, and Lehigh County, collectively, and the Whitehall Defendants, separately, moved to dismiss the complaint. Doc. Nos. 8, 9. The court ultimately denied both motions as moot upon Fitzgerald's filing of an amended complaint. Am. Compl., Doc. No. 17; Order, Doc. No. 24. Next, the Original Defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint. Doc. Nos. 20-22. After oral argument, the court granted the Original Defendants' motions to dismiss and dismissed the amended complaint without prejudice to permit Fitzgerald to file a second amended complaint. Order, Doc. No. 31. On December 20, 2016, Fitzgerald filed a second amended complaint (\"SAC\") against most of the Original Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc.

The court heard oral argument on the motions on May 26, 2017. On May 30, 2017, the court entered an order which (1) by Fitzgerald's agreement, dismissed the claims against the remaining Whitehall Defendants without prejudice, and (2) denied their motion to dismiss as moot. Order, Doc. No. 47. The court resolved the remaining motions to dismiss via a memorandum opinion and order entered on August 3, 2017. Doc. Nos. 49, 50. In the memorandum opinion and order, the court granted parts of the motion to dismiss filed by DA Martin, ADA Luksa, Detective Cruz, and Detective Frey and (1) dismissed with prejudice Fitzgerald's (a) official capacity claims against them and (b) section 1983 malicious prosecution claim against DA Martin and ADA Luksa, and (2) dismissed without prejudice Fitzgerald's (a) malicious prosecution claim against Detective Cruz and Detective Frey, (b) section 1983 false arrest and false imprisonment claims against DA Martin, and (c) section 1983 civil conspiracy claims against DA Martin, ADA Luksa, Detective Cruz, and Detective Frey. Aug. 3, 2017 Mem. Op. at 11-12, 13-29, Doc. No. 49; Aug. 3, 2017 Order at 1-2, Doc. No. 50. The court denied the motion to the extent it sought dismissal of Fitzgerald's (1) section 1983 false arrest and false imprisonment claims against Detective Cruz and Detective Frey, and (2) state law claims against DA Martin, ADA Luksa, Detective Cruz, and Detective Frey. Aug. 3, 2017 Mem. Op. at 19-22, 29-30; Aug. 3, 2017 Order at 2. Concerning Lehigh County's motion to dismiss, the court granted the motion in part and dismissed without prejudice Fitzgerald's (1) section 1983 malicious prosecution claim, (2) section 1983 false arrest and false imprisonment claims, (3) section 1983 failure to train and supervise claim, and (4) section 1983 civil rights conspiracy claims. Aug. 3, 2017 Mem. Op. at 30-40; Aug. 3, 2017 Order at 2-3. The court denied the motion to the extent it sought dismissal of the state law claims. Aug. 3, 2017 Mem. Op. at 40; Aug. 3, 2017 Order at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The case proceeded through a lengthy period of discovery and, on June 14, 2018, Lehigh County filed a motion for summary judgment. Doc. No. 73. With leave of court, Fitzgerald filed a third amended complaint (\"TAC\") on June 29, 2018, in which he added a section 1983 claim for supervisory liability under\n   <em>\n    Monell v.

No. 81; TAC at 22 (Count I), Doc. No. 82. In the TAC, Fitzgerald presents five claims:\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (1) violation of civil rights under\n   section 1983 - based on\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   for failure to train and supervise against DA Martin, in his official capacity, and Lehigh County;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) false arrest and false imprisonment under section 1983 and the Fourth Amendment against Detective Cruz and Detective Frey (collectively the \"Detectives\"); (3) malicious prosecution under Pennsylvania law against all defendants; (4) false imprisonment under Pennsylvania law against DA Martin, the Detectives, and Lehigh County; and (5) false arrest under Pennsylvania law against DA Martin, the Detectives, and Lehigh County. TAC at 22-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 1, 2018, Lehigh County filed a motion for summary judgment on all claims asserted against it in the TAC. Doc. No. 88. DA Martin, ADA Luksa, and the Detectives (the \"Individual Defendants\") collectively filed a separate motion for summary judgment on all claims raised in the TAC. Doc. No. 89. To the extent that Lehigh County's previously filed motion for summary judgment addresses the state law claims raised in the TAC, the motion is also before the court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. No. 73. Fitzgerald filed a joint response in opposition to the defendants' motions for summary judgment on August 24, 2018. Doc. Nos. 93-95. Lehigh County and the Individual Defendants separately field reply briefs in response to Fitzgerald's opposition to the motions for summary judgment on September 5, 2018, and September 6, 2018, respectively. Doc. Nos. 98, 99. The court held oral argument on the motions for summary judgment on September 19, 2018. The motions are ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
