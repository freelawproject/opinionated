The Liquor Control Law prohibits \"any person, firm, partnership, or corporation\" from selling alcoholic beverages in Missouri \"without taking a license.\" \u00a7 311.050 RSMo. To obtain a license, an applicant must demonstrate \"good moral character\" and establish that he/she is \"a qualified legal voter and taxpaying citizen of the county, town, city or village\" to be served. \u00a7 311.060.1 RSMo. These requirements apply to the managing officer of any corporation seeking a license.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants previously filed a Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Complaint, which was granted for lack of standing under Rule 12(b)(1). Plaintiffs filed their Amended Complaint, followed by Defendants' filing of the instant Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint alleges the following:\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff Michael Schlueter is a Missouri resident who would purchase wine from out-of-state retailers and have it shipped to his Missouri home, if Missouri law permitted him to do so. Plaintiff Terrence French us a Missouri Resident who has been refused sales of wine by out-of-state retailers due to Missouri's Liquor Control Law that bans out-of-state sales, shipments, and delivery of wine from out-of-state sources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff Sarasota Wine Market, LLC d/b/a Magnum Wine and Tastings (\"Magnum Wine\") is a Florida Limited Liability Company that operates a retail wine store in Sarasota, Florida. Magnum Wine has received requests that it sell and ship wine to Missouri, but is unable to do so legally. It intends to sell and ship wines directly to consumers in Missouri if the laws prohibiting such sales and shipments are removed or declared unconstitutional. Plaintiff Heath Cordes is a citizen of Florida who works as a professional wine consultant, advisor, and merchant. Cordes owns and operates Magnum Wine. Plaintiffs intend to pay all taxes due on interstate wine sales and shipments, and comply with all other non-discriminatory state regulations, including obtaining licenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants Missouri Governor Michael L. Parson, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   , and Acting Supervisor of the Missouri Department of Public Safety, Division of Alcohol &amp; Tobacco Control Keith Hendrickson are all sued in their official capacities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the State of Missouri, a resident wine retailer can obtain a license from Defendants which allows it to sell, deliver, and ship by common carrier directly to Missouri consumers any wine that it has in its inventory. A Missouri wine retailer may obtain wine for resale from distributors, auction houses and private collections. The Defendants will issue such an off-premises retail license only to wine retailers located in the State of Missouri. Magnum Wine is not located in Missouri, is not eligible for a Missouri off-premises license, and is prohibited by law from selling, delivering or shipping wine from its inventory directly to consumers in Missouri. No other Missouri license is available to Magnum Wine and Tastings that would allow it to sell, deliver, and ship wine from its inventory to consumers in Missouri. It would obtain such a license if one were available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff Schlueter has contacted several out-of-state retailers either on the Internet or by phone in order to buy wines he cannot find in Missouri. These retailers include Magnum Wine, The Wine Library in New Jersey, and Federal Wine &amp; Spirits in Boston, Massachusetts. All of these retailers refused to sell and ship their wines to Schlueter because of Missouri law. Some wines that Schlueter wants to buy are not available in retail stores in Missouri but are available from retail stores in other states. Plaintiff French has also attempted to purchase wine from out-of-state wine retailers which claims he cannot obtain either in his hometown or in Missouri and has been denied these purchases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mangum Wine has been contacted by Schlueter who has attempted to buy wine and have it shipped to him in Missouri. Mangum has refused to complete this order due to Missouri's ban on out-of-state retail sales, shipments, and deliveries. Magnum Wine has lost profit of its sale of wine to Schlueter and other Missouri customers. Magnum Wine would obtain a license to sell, ship and deliver its wine directly to consumers in the State of Missouri if one were available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the course of his business, Plaintiff Cordes develops personal relationships with many of his customers, makes special wine purchases for them, consults with them about wine in person, by telephone and by Internet, and sells and delivers wine to them. Some of these customers live part of the year in Florida and part of the year in Missouri. Cordes has received requests from his customers to send wine to residents of Missouri as gifts but was unable to ship the specifically requested wines because the laws of Missouri prevent him from doing so. Cordes wants to practice his profession as a wine merchant in Missouri by consulting with, obtaining wines for, and delivering wines to Missouri residents, but is prevented from doing so by Missouri law. He has suffered economic harm as a result. Mr. Cordes has not applied to Missouri officials for a retail license because it would be futile to do so since he is not a resident of Missouri and residency is required for a retail wine dealer permit. If a license were available to Cordes on terms equivalent to those for Missouri citizens, he would obtain it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs' Complaint alleges that the portions of Missouri's Liquor Control Law that allow in-state retailers to ship wine to Missouri consumers while prohibiting out-of-state retailers from doing the same is unconstitutional for two reasons:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   First, Plaintiffs contend that the disparate treatment between in-state and out-of-state retailers violates the Commerce Clause because it discriminates against interstate commerce and protecting the economic interest of local businesses by shielding them from competition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs claim that the disparate treatment between residents and nonresidents violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV of the United States Constitution because Missouri bans wine sales and deliveries by out-of-state merchants and prohibits the issuance of licenses to nonresidents, thereby denying Cordes the privilege to engage in his occupation in the state upon the same terms as Missouri citizens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of standing and Rule (12)(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. For their 12(b)(6) motion, Defendants contend that the constitutional validity of Missouri's multi-tiered approach to regulating liquor distribution and sale has been upheld by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Southern Wine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049471\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/731/799/#p802\">\n    731 F.3d 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"[I]f a plaintiff lacks standing, the district court has no subject matter jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Faibisch v.

Therefore, motions to dismiss for lack of standing fall under the purview of Rule 12(b)(1), which permits a party to move to dismiss a complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \"Motions to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction can be decided in three ways: at the pleading stage, like a Rule 12(b)(6) motion; on undisputed facts, like a summary judgment motion; and on disputed facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Jessie v.

The parties do not rely on matters outside the pleadings, therefore the Court reviews Defendant's motion as a \"facial attack\" on jurisdiction. In a facial attack, \"the court restricts itself to the face of the pleadings, and the non-moving party receives the same protections as it would defending against a motion under Rule 12(b)(6).\"\n   <em>\n    Carlsen v.

Insofar as\n   <em>\n    Granholm\n   </em>\n   imported a balancing approach to regulations of the three-tier system, however, it drew a bright line between the producer tier and the rest of the system.

Plaintiffs do not allege and cannot show that the challenged portions of Missouri's Liquor Control Law provide differential treatment to in-state and out-of-state products and producers. Because Plaintiffs' claim concerns only the retailer tier of Missouri's liquor control system, it is foreclosed by the \"bright line\" between the producer tier and the rest of the system described in\n   <em>\n    Southern Wine\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the Eighth Circuit's statement in\n   <em>\n    Southern Wine\n   </em>\n   that \"[\n   <em>\n    Granholm\n   </em>\n   ] drew a bright line between the producer tier and the rest of the system\" is merely dictum that was unnecessary to the result in\n   <em>\n    Southern Wine\n   </em>\n   and thus should not be treated as binding authority. This argument is not well taken. In\n   <em>\n    Southern Wine\n   </em>\n   , the Eighth Circuit provided a wealth of reasoning that distinguishes discrimination against products and producers from discrimination in the other tiers of the liquor distribution system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 809-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The four-tier system is a legitimate exercise of Missouri's power under the Twenty-first Amendment to \"maintain an effective and uniform system for controlling liquor by regulating its transportation, importation, and use,\" including the ability to \"funnel sales through the [multi]-tier system.\"\n   <em>\n    Granholm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5881890\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/460/\">\n    544 U.S. at 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5881890\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/460/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While the state laws in\n   <em>\n    Granholm\n   </em>\n   failed to pass constitutional muster because they discriminatorily allowed only in-state producers to sidestep the tiered regulatory systems, the Missouri statutes in question require that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   alcohol sold directly to consumers in Missouri by retailers pass through Missouri's four-tier regulatory system \"funnel.\" To allow out-of-state retailers to ship directly to Missouri residents would not only burden in-state retailers, who would have to operate within the four-tier system while out-of-state retailers could circumvent the Missouri regulatory system entirely, it would also violate the Twenty-first Amendment by undermining Missouri's \"unquestionably legitimate\" system.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brooks v.
