Mr. Moran, who represented Plaintiff in 2014 when he was employed as a Narcotics Agent, testified that \"[d]uring the two days between the [pre-disciplinary] hearing of Tuesday, November 4th and Friday, [November 7th], I was in communication with Eri[k] Anderson regarding Mr. McIlmail's possible discipline and that to be imposed on other agents.
