Wolf\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    JUA I\n   </em>\n   \"), No. 1:17-CV-2041 (M.D. Pa.), declaring portions of Act 44 of 2017, P.L. 725, No. 44 (\"Act 44\"), to be violative of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and permanently enjoining enforcement of the Act's operative provisions. Finding the Pennsylvania Professional Liability Joint Underwriting Association (the \"Joint Underwriting Association\" or \"Association\") to be a private entity and its assets to be private property, we concluded that the state cannot expropriate to its own use funds held in the Association's coffers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The General Assembly responded by enacting Act 41 of 2018, P.L. 273, No. 41 (\"Act 41\"), on June 22, 2018. Act 41 deploys\n   <em>\n    JUA I\n   </em>\n   as a blueprint, endeavoring to avoid the constitutional infirmities that felled Act 44. Specifically, Act 41 purports to transform the Joint Underwriting Association into a governmental entity housed within the Commonwealth's Insurance Department (\"Department\") and operating under the control and oversight of the Commonwealth's Insurance Commissioner (\"Commissioner\"). It also seeks to accomplish indirectly what\n   <em>\n    JUA I\n   </em>\n   forbade the state from doing directly-forcing the transfer of the Association's assets to the Department. By order of July 18, 2018, we preliminarily enjoined enforcement of Act 41 pending merits review of the Joint Underwriting Association's constitutional claims.

We reiterate salient facts for context in addressing the parties' Rule 56 arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Joint Underwriting Association\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Joint Underwriting Association was established by statute as a nonprofit association organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The General Assembly created the Association in 1975 in response to a decline in the availability of medical malpractice insurance in the Commonwealth. (Doc. 33 \u00b6 3). The Association was initially established and organized by the Pennsylvania Health Care Services Malpractice Act of 1975, P.L. 390, No. 111 (the \"CAT Fund Statute\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The CAT Fund Statute authorized the Commissioner to either \"establish and implement\" or \"approve and supervise\" a \"plan\" for ensuring that medical professional liability insurance is made \"conveniently and expeditiously\" available to providers in the Commonwealth who cannot obtain insurance on the open insurance market.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CAT Fund Statute, \u00a7 801 (codified prior to repeal at 40 PA. STAT. AND CONS. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 1301.801). Section 801 provided that the plan \"may be implemented by a joint underwriting association,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526981\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/328/400/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526981\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/328/400/\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and Section 803 permitted insurers to consult and agree with each other as to \"organization, administration and operation of the plan\" and rates for coverage,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526981\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/328/400/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 803(a) (codified prior to repeal at 40 PA. STAT. AND CONS. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 1301.803). An \"Ad Hoc Industry Committee\" of insurers submitted the Joint Underwriting Association's original proposed plan of operations to the then-Commissioner, who approved same on December 30, 1975. (Doc. 33 \u00b6\u00b6 7-8). The plan established a 12-member board of directors, one member of which was appointed by the Commissioner, and vested authority in the board to \"decide all matters of policy and have authority to exercise all reasonable and necessary powers relating to the operation of the Association which are not specifically delegated by the plan to others or reserved to members of the Association.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11). The statute authorized the Commissioner to dissolve the plan if he deemed it unnecessary and authorized the Association to borrow funds from the state in the event of a deficit. CAT Fund Statute, \u00a7\u00a7 803(b), 808 (codified prior to repeat at 40 PA. STAT. AND CONS. STAT. ANN. \u00a7\u00a7 1301.803(b), -.808). The Association was granted Section 501(c)(6) status by the Internal Revenue Service in 1976 and has since maintained that status. (Doc. 33 \u00b6\u00b6 12-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The General Assembly repealed the CAT Fund Statute on March 20, 2002, replacing it with the current statutory framework, the Medical Care Availability and Reduction of Error Act (\"MCARE Act\"), 40 PA. STAT. AND CONS. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 1303.101\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   The MCARE Act is a sweeping piece of legislation, with an overarching goal of ensuring a \"comprehensive and high-quality health care system\" for the citizens of the Commonwealth.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526981\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/328/400/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1303.102(1).

The Fund offers a secondary layer of medical professional liability coverage for physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers and is funded primarily by annual assessments on those providers as a condition to practice in the Commonwealth.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526981\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/328/400/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1303.712(d)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The MCARE Act continued operation of the Joint Underwriting Association.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526981\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/328/400/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1303.731(a).

Instead, the General Assembly \"established\" the Association as \"a nonprofit joint underwriting association to be known as the Pennsylvania Professional Liability Joint Underwriting Association.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526981\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/328/400/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1303.731(a). Like its predecessor, the MCARE Act mandates membership in the Association for insurers authorized to write medical professional liability insurance in the Commonwealth.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526981\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/328/400/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The MCARE Act requires the Association to offer medical professional liability insurance to health care providers and entities who \"cannot conveniently obtain medical professional liability insurance through ordinary methods at rates not in\n   excess of\" rates applicable to those similarly situated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526981\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/328/400/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1303.732(a). The Act sets forth broad parameters for achieving this objective, tasking the Association to ensure that its insurance is conveniently and expeditiously available, offered on reasonable and not unfairly discriminatory terms, and subject only to the payment of a premium for which payment plans must be made available.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526981\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/328/400/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1303.732(b)(1)-(5). The MCARE Act prescribes four \"duties\" for the Association.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526981\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/328/400/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1303.731(b). It requires the Association to (1) submit a plan of operations to the Commissioner for approval, (2) submit rates and any rate modifications for Department approval, (3) offer insurance as described\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , and (4) file its schedule of occurrence rates with the Commissioner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1303.731(b)(1)-(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Association, like other insurers licensed to operate within the Commonwealth, is \"supervised\" by the Department through the Commissioner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1303.731(a);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 221.1-a to -.15-a, 1181-99. The MCARE Act otherwise provides that all \"powers and duties\" of the Association \"shall be vested in and exercised by a board of directors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1303.731(a). The board's composition, and all of the Association's operative principles, are set forth in a plan of operations developed by the Association with Department assistance and approval. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 33 \u00b6\u00b6 38-41);\n   <em>\n    JUA I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526647\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/324/519/\">\n    324 F.Supp.3d at 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The existing plan establishes a 14-member board of directors, which consists of the current Association president; eight representatives of member companies chosen by member voting; one agent or broker elected by members; and four health care provider or general public representatives who may be nominated by anyone and are appointed by the Commissioner. (Doc. 33 \u00b6 38). Under the plan, the Association may be dissolved (1) \"by operation of law\" or (2) at the request of its members, subject to Commissioner approval. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40). The plan provides that, \"[u]pon dissolution, all assets of the Association, from whatever source, shall be distributed in such manner as the Board may determine subject to the approval of the Commissioner.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Joint Underwriting Association writes insurance policies directly to its insured health care providers, and those policyholders pay premiums directly to the Association. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52). The Association is funded exclusively by policyholder premiums and investment income generated therefrom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46, 49, 50-51). It is not and has never been funded by the Commonwealth, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49), and it has historically held all premiums and investment funds in private accounts in its own name, (Doc. 41 \u00b6\u00b6 8-9; Doc. 52 \u00b6\u00b6 8-9;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 58 \u00b6\u00b6 8-9). Prior to enactment of Act 41, the MCARE Act insulated the Commonwealth from the Association's debts and liabilities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   40 PA. STAT. AND CONS. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 1303.731(c); (Doc. 33 \u00b6 32). The Association has never borrowed money to fund its operations, either in its current form or under the CAT Fund Statute which authorized the Association to borrow from the state. (Doc. 33 \u00b6\u00b6 19, 50). In the event of a deficit, the Association's plan of operations contemplates assessments on members in the form of a loan as one method of keeping the Association afloat. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 33-6 at 3). The Association has never assessed its members under this provision. (Doc. 33 \u00b6 46).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Association maintains contingency funds-its \"reserves\" and its \"surplus\"-which allow the Association to fulfill its insurance obligations in the event of greater-than-anticipated claims or losses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    JUA I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526647\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/324/519/\">\n    324 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   525-26 ; (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 33 \u00b6\u00b6 60, 62, 64, 72-74). An insurer's \"reserves\" are the \"best estimate of funds ... need[ed] to pay for claims that have been incurred but not yet paid.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   33 \u00b6 72). Its \"surplus\" represents \"capital after all liabilities have been deducted from assets.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73). The surplus operates as a \"backstop\" to ensure that unforeseen events do not impede an insurer's ability to meet obligations to its insureds. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74). As of December 31, 2016, the Joint Underwriting Association maintained a surplus of $ 268,124,502. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

STAT. AND CONS. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 1726-C). Act 85 is wide-ranging in scope, but its principal effect was to amend the General Appropriation Act of 2016 and balance the Commonwealth's budget. Act 85, \u00a7 1. Among other things, Act 85 provided for certain transfers to the Commonwealth's General Fund.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1(7). Pertinent here, Section 18 of Act 85 amended the Commonwealth's Fiscal Code to require a $ 200,000,000 transfer to the General Fund from the Joint Underwriting Association, repayable over a five-year period that was to begin in July 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Association did not transfer funds to the Commonwealth pursuant to Act 85.

The Act endeavors to fundamentally reshape the Joint Underwriting Association and alter its governance structure to give the Commonwealth direct control of the Association's assets and operations.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Act 41, \u00a7\u00a7 3-5. Specifically, Act 41 does the following:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n    (1) Finds that \"placing the Association within the Department will give the Commissioner more oversight of expenditures and ensure better efficiencies in the operation of the Association\";\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n    (2) Declares that the Association \"shall continue as an instrumentality of the Commonwealth\" and \"shall operate under the control, direction and oversight of the Department\";\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n    (3) Replaces the Association's current member-led board with a state-controlled board, consisting of three gubernatorial appointees and one member appointed by each of the president\n    <em>\n     pro tempore\n    </em>\n    and the minority leader of the Pennsylvania Senate and the speaker and the minority leader of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, with the chair of the board to be appointed by the Governor;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n    (4) Installs a new executive director to be hired by the Commissioner and compensated by the Commonwealth, to whom authority to act on behalf of the Association will be transferred within 30 days of the Act's effective date;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n    (5) Assumes Commonwealth liability for any claims or liabilities of the Association arising under its insurance policies;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n    (6) Mandates that the new board prepare and submit a new plan of operations to the Commissioner for approval within 60 days of the Act's effective date;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n    (7) Articulates with specificity the duties and responsibilities of and the authority granted to the new board; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n    (8) Provides that all documents, papers, and assets in the Association's possession shall be transferred to the Department within 30 days of the Act's effective date.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526647\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/324/519/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 3.

Therein, the Association challenges the constitutionality of Act 41 under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Association asserts that Act 41 violates the Substantive Due Process Clause (Count I), the Takings Clause (Count II), and the Contract Clause (Count III). It seeks declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to Section 1983 and the Declaratory Judgment Act,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Count IV). The amended complaint identifies two groups of defendants: Tom Wolf, Governor of the Commonwealth, and Jessica K. Altman, Insurance Commissioner of Pennsylvania, whom we will refer to as the \"executive defendants,\" and a group we refer to as the \"legislative defendants,\" comprising Joseph B. Scarnati, President\n    <em>\n     Pro Tempore\n    </em>\n    of the Senate; Jay Costa, Minority Leader of the Senate; Michael Turzai, Speaker of the House of Representatives; and Frank Dermody, Minority Leader of the House of Representatives.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    All defendants are sued in their official capacities.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    The Association moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction contemporaneously with the commencement of this case. We denied the request for temporary restraining order and expedited proceedings on the request for a preliminary injunction. Following oral argument on July 6, 2018, we granted the Association's motion and preliminarily enjoined enforcement of Act 41 pending merits review of the Association's claims.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     generally\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     JUA II\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526981\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/328/400/\">\n     328 F.Supp.3d 400\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

We carefully examined the Association's enabling legislation, the nature of the Association's function and the manner in which it performed that function, its governance and operational structure, the relative lack of Commonwealth control and the total dearth of Commonwealth responsibility, and the private source of the Association's funds before holding that both the Association and its assets are overwhelmingly private in nature.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 535-38.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    As to the Association itself, we determined that it is \"at its core, an insurance company,\" funded exclusively by privately-paid premiums and largely indistinguishable from other private insurers in the Commonwealth.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 535-36. Of greater import than the Association's function was its near-total independence from the state.

As we have already framed it, the dispositive inquiry is \"[w]hether the Commonwealth can now recapture the Association through\n    <em>\n     post hoc\n    </em>\n    legislation-irrespective of private rights and interests accrued by the Association over more than four decades\"-without constitutional consequence.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     JUA II\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526981\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/328/400/\">\n     328 F.Supp.3d at 410-11\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Our disposition of the Fifth Amendment issue raised by Act 41 is assuredly informed by\n    <em>\n     JUA I\n    </em>\n    . And many of the same constitutional concerns are implicated by this newest legislation. But the enactment of Act 41 alters the legal landscape, compelling scrutiny anew. Accordingly, we cannot find that the issues raised in\n    <em>\n     JUA I\n    </em>\n    are \"identical\" to the issues presently before the court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    <strong>\n     3.\n     <em>\n      Merits\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    We turn to the merits and begin from a simple premise: the Association, as it existed on May 17, 2018, is a private entity, and its funds are private property that cannot be taken by the government without just compensation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     JUA I\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526647\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/324/519/\">\n     324 F.Supp.3d at 538\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . From there, the parties' arguments take three divergent tacks. The executive defendants contend that Act 41 merely complies with\n    <em>\n     JUA I\n    </em>\n    by implementing criteria set forth therein to reconstitute the Association as a public entity. The legislative defendants assert that the holding in\n    <em>\n     JUA I\n    </em>\n    is in error, that the Joint Underwriting Association is a public entity in which the Commonwealth alone is interested, and that the state can do with the Association what it pleases. And the Association maintains that Act 41, like its predecessor Act 44, effects an unconstitutional taking of its private property. The court addresses each argument\n    <em>\n     seriatim.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    <strong>\n     a.\n     <em>\n      Executive Defendants: Answering JUA I\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    The executive defendants rely on Act 41 itself as the answer to the constitutional inquiry before the court. They remonstrate that Act 41 checks each of the boxes drawn by\n    <em>\n     JUA I\n    </em>\n    to transform the Association into a Commonwealth entity. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 44 at 6-11). They answer the court's inquiry of whether the state can retrospectively recapture a private entity and assume ownership of its private property with a firm but wholly unsupported \"yes.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 6-9).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    We expressed skepticism at the preliminary injunction stage with respect to this contention, which we construed as intimating that \"with a legislative vote and the stroke of the Governor's pen, what were private funds yesterday may become public funds tomorrow.\"\n    <em>\n     JUA II\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526981\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/328/400/\">\n     328 F.Supp.3d at 410\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

But as three lawsuits, more than a thousand pages of briefing, and multiple judicial opinions evince, the constitutional question\n    <em>\n     sub judice\n    </em>\n    is quite different from that presented in\n    <em>\n     Dartmouth\n    </em>\n    . Yes, the General Assembly did create the Association in response to a medical malpractice insurance crisis in the Commonwealth.

The legislative defendants invoke this afterthought as support for their view that a state-created institution cannot claim constitutional protection against its creator unless it is defending \"\n    <em>\n     individual\n    </em>\n    property interests\" in a representative capacity. (Doc. 53 at 15). We are unpersuaded that the\n    <em>\n     MMIA\n    </em>\n    court intended its\n    <em>\n     obiter dictum\n    </em>\n    , offered only after extensive discussion of MMIA's statutory framework and the extensive degree of state control, as the ultimate and singular delimiter of constitutional capacity to sue.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    As in\n    <em>\n     JUA I\n    </em>\n    , we again reject the suggestion that a statutorily-created insurance association may bring suit against the state only if the association's members have some personal stake in the entity-and then only on behalf of those members. We simply do not read the applicable authorities as espousing such a rule. Consequently, we maintain our holding from\n    <em>\n     JUA I\n    </em>\n    that a holistic approach, one which thoroughly examines the association's relationship to the state through the prism of,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , its function, autonomy, and statutory treatment as well as the nature (including the source) of its funds, best answers whether a statutorily-created nonprofit is private or public for constitutional purposes.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    The Joint Underwriting Association, since its inception, has been a private institution. It has operated just like a private insurance company for decades.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    It is privately funded and organized and has never received public funding. Until Act 41, the Commonwealth explicitly disclaimed any responsibility for the Association's debts and liabilities. The Association covers its own operating expenses and bears its own aggregate insurance risk. Its plan of operations contemplates borrowing and reimbursable member assessments, not state financial support, in the event of a deficit. In stark contrast to\n    <em>\n     MMIA\n    </em>\n    , the Association is subject to minimal supervision by the Commissioner, in a manner not meaningfully different from private insurers. Given all of this, we will deny the legislative defendants' request that we reconsider and abandon our analysis and holding in\n    <em>\n     JUA I\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    We lastly address the legislative defendants' suggestion that this court's decision in\n    <em>\n     JUA I\n    </em>\n    conflicts with principles of federalism and deference to state legislative action. Defendants charge that \"federal courts should not wield the federal constitution like a ruler, rapping knuckles whenever they disagree with state governance.\" (Doc. 37 at 16). We agree, as we have at\n    each stage of these lawsuits, that the legislature has wide discretion to experiment with its police powers. The Supreme Court observed as much in\n    <em>\n     Dartmouth\n    </em>\n    , stating that federal courts charged with constitutional review of state legislative acts must approach their task with \"cautious circumspection.\"\n    <em>\n     Dartmouth\n    </em>\n    , 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) at 625. That deference is not without limitation, however, and federal courts also have an obligation to hear the constitutional cases properly brought before them.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=533%20N.E.2d%201030\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    As the Supreme Court aptly noted, \"however irksome the task may be, this is a duty from which we dare not shrink.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=533%20N.E.2d%201030\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Our holdings in\n    <em>\n     JUA I\n    </em>\n    and here today flow not from our disagreement with exercise of legislative prerogative but from what the Fifth Amendment deems to be an unconstitutional abuse thereof.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    <strong>\n     c.\n     <em>\n      The Instant Takings Claim\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    The only inquiry that remains is whether the Joint Underwriting Association is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on its Takings Clause claim. We conclude that no genuine disputes of material fact persist and that the Association is entitled to summary and declaratory judgment. Act 41 is a repackaged and more intricate version of Act 44. The new legislation endeavors to do indirectly what\n    <em>\n     JUA I\n    </em>\n    told the Commonwealth it could not do directly. The only difference is that Act 41 amplifies its predecessor: where Act 44 purported to take only a portion of the Association's surplus funds,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Act 44, \u00a7 1.3, Act 41 attempts to take all of the Association's assets and to extinguish it as presently-privately-constituted,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Act 41, \u00a7\u00a7 3-5.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    The executive defendants reprise their argument that Act 41 does not contravene the Fifth Amendment because it does not \"take\" anything from the Joint Underwriting Association. (Doc. 44 at 9 n.1). They aver that the Association will continue to exist as a statutory entity within the Department, \"albeit as a new legislative manifestation,\" such that \"the funds are not being taken by a new owner.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) We rejected this argument at the preliminary injunction stage, and we reject it again now. Act 41 transfers complete control of the Association to the Commonwealth and grants ownership and authority over the Association's assets thereto. The Act dismantles a private entity as it currently exists and transfers its assets\n    <em>\n     in toto\n    </em>\n    , as well as its administration, to the Commonwealth. There is, in this court's view, no genuine dispute as to whether Act 41 impermissibly takes the private property of a private entity without just compensation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    We acknowledge that the instant constitutional question is both novel and complex. The General Assembly must be afforded a wide berth to enact and to amend legislation in furtherance of its preferred objectives. But when it chooses to create a private entity to meet those objectives, in which the state is not alone or, indeed, at all interested, and over which the state retains virtually no control, that legislative discretion is bounded by the federal Constitution. This is precisely the case with the Joint Underwriting Association. We hold that the Fifth Amendment prohibits the Commonwealth from taking the private assets of the Association, either directly as in Act 44 or through the hostile takeover effected by Act 41, without just compensation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    <strong>\n     B.

The executive defendants counter, as they have before, that the public also has a considerable interest in legislative discretion and an unencumbered lawmaking process reflecting the public will. Defendants proffer no concrete harm (to the government or to the public) beyond this bare assertion. Their claim of abstract injury to public interest does not outweigh the actual constitutional injury to the Association. We do not doubt that the legislative and executive defendants had the public interest in mind when enacting Act 41 and continue to act in the name of that interest. We do not question that the public interest favors a balanced budget and the free and representative exercise of the legislative prerogative. But as we have stated both in this case and its predecessor, the Commonwealth cannot achieve a legitimate end through unconstitutional means.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     JUA II\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526981\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/328/400/\">\n     328 F.Supp.3d at 412\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     JUA I\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526647\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/324/519/\">\n     324 F.Supp.3d at 540\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

We resolutely disagree. This court does not hold, and has never held, that the General Assembly cannot repeal or amend the statute designating the Association as the state's insurer of last resort for medical professional liability coverage and assume the task of providing that coverage itself through a special fund within the Department or through a separate entity in which the state and the state alone has an interest. Counsel for the Association concedes that the General Assembly has authority to do all of these things. What happens to the Association and to its private funds at that hypothetical juncture is not before this court. We do not speculate whether the Association might, for example, continue as a private insurer and offer ordinary medical professional liability or other types of insurance. We hold only that the Commonwealth cannot take the\n    Association's private property in the manner contemplated by Act 41.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    We reiterate what we observed in closing in\n    <em>\n     JUA I\n    </em>\n    : when it created the Joint Underwriting Association, the General Assembly chose to solve a public health problem through a private, nonprofit association, over which the Commonwealth retained limited control, in which the Commonwealth had no financial interest, and for which the Commonwealth bore no responsibility. The Commonwealth cannot legislatively recapture this private association for the purpose of accessing its assets. The provisions of Act 41 which attempt to accomplish that objective are violative of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    We will grant summary and declaratory judgment and permanent injunctive relief to the Joint Underwriting Association.

We did so as part of a broader analysis contrasting the \"exhaustive statutory framework\" governing the MMIA with the skeletal treatment accorded the Association in the MCARE Act.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526647\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/324/519/\">\n       id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     Our point was not about who controlled the MMIA's board at any given time, but rather that the New York legislature had dictated the board's composition by statute (expressly reserving at least some seats for state appointees), whereas the MCARE Act left the question of board composition to the Association itself.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"7\">\n    <p id=\"p-114\">\n     We note that, even if we were to adopt the legislative defendants' construction that member interest is the lone prerequisite to suit, the record establishes that the Joint Underwriting Association's members\n     <em>\n      do\n     </em>\n     have some interest in the Association. The Association is organized as a nonprofit, and, by law, member companies do not share in profits as they did in\n     <em>\n      Asociaci\u00f3n\n     </em>\n     and\n     <em>\n      Morales\n     </em>\n     . The Association's reserves and its surplus are its first line of financial defense in the event it suffers a loss. (\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Doc. 33 \u00b6\u00b6 72-74). But thereafter, it is the Association's member insurance companies,\n     <em>\n      not\n     </em>\n     the Commonwealth, that would be held to account: under the Association's current plan of operations, members may be assessed to make up any loss until the Association can borrow sufficient funds to satisfy its deficit, repay borrowed funds, and reimburse members for assessments. (Doc. 33-6 at 3). Although the degree of member interest is not as enduring or direct as the member interest in\n     <em>\n      Asociaci\u00f3n\n     </em>\n     and\n     <em>\n      Morales\n     </em>\n     , it is member interest nonetheless and belies defendants' assertion that the state is \"alone\" interested in the Association.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"8\">\n    <p id=\"p-115\">\n     The legislative defendants insist throughout their briefing that the public-private distinction should not be drawn based on \"the commercial or charitable nature\" of the entity's services. (\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <em>\n      e.g.\n     </em>\n     , Doc. 37 at 18-19). Drawing on Justice Story's concurring opinion in\n     <em>\n      Dartmouth\n     </em>\n     for the proposition that state-created entities can include commercial endeavors such as colleges, hospitals, and banks, the legislative defendants urge that \"the 'commercial' purpose of a state-created entity does not remove it from [state] control.\" (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 19 (citing\n     <em>\n      Dartmouth\n     </em>\n     , 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) at 669 (Story, J., concurring) ). To be quite clear,\n     <em>\n      JUA I\n     </em>\n     did not hold that a commercial purpose renders an institution private rather than public. Rather, we determined that an entity's function, and particularly the manner in which it accomplishes that function in relation to the state, is but one factor to consider in assessing public-versus-private status. When we examined the Joint Underwriting Association's function, we considered not only its commercial purpose, but how it effected that purpose, including the source of the funds, where its risk was borne, and its mode of operation anent the state. Each of these elements informed our overall assessment of the Association's relationship to the Commonwealth. We neither held nor intended to imply that the Association is a private entity solely because it engaged in commercial activities.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
