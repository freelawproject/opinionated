Facts and Procedural Background in State Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On September 5, 2012, Johnson filed a pro se complaint in the Circuit Court of South Dakota, Second Judicial District, against sixteen defendants alleging various claims including that he was discriminated against on the basis of his disabilities.\n   <em>\n    Leslie Johnson v. Douglas Weber, Warden et. al.\n   </em>\n   , Civ. No. 12-3232 (Feb. 25, 2014). On December 9, 2013, the circuit court held a hearing on defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings, or in the alternative, summary judgment. The court held that defendants were entitled to summary judgment on Johnson's ADA claim because Johnson had not shown that he was disabled for purposes of the ADA. The court stated that while Johnson had indicated that he was elderly and must make use of a wheelchair, he had not shown that he was entirely confined to a wheelchair since the record indicated that a wheelchair was assigned to him if he had to walk any distance. The court also found that Johnson had not set forth any facts showing that he had been denied meaning access to the benefits of services, programs, and activities offered at the penitentiary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In considering a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the factual allegations of a complaint are assumed true and construed in favor of the plaintiff, \"even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of those facts is improbable, and that a recovery is very remote and unlikely.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl.

The summary judgment hearing on Johnson's ADA claims in circuit court was held on December 9, 2013, and the court's decision was issued on February 25, 2014. The court concluded that Johnson had not shown that he was disabled for purposes of the ADA because while Johnson had indicated that he was elderly and must make use of a wheelchair, the court found that the record demonstrated that was not entirely confined to a wheelchair. More than five years has passed since the circuit court addressed whether Johnson was \"disabled\" under the ADA and Johnson now alleges that he is confined to a wheelchair. Given these facts, the Court finds that Johnson is not precluded by the circuit court judgment from relitigating whether he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On a final note, the Court finds that although Johnson is not precluded from relitigating the issue of whether he is disabled under the ADA, Johnson may be precluded under the doctrine of res judicata from relitigating any issues \"which could have been properly raised and determined in [the] prior action.\"\n   <em>\n    Black Hills Jewelry Mfg.

Attached as exhibits to Johnson's complaint are numerous \"Kites\" and \"Informal Resolution Requests\" that Johnson has filed with MDSP either seeking an accommodation for his alleged disability, requesting that the prison bring certain aspects of their facility into ADA compliance, or requesting that staff refrain from retaliating against him for filing ADA grievances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \"Filing such [ ] grievance[s] is a protected activity under the ADA as long as [Johnson] had a reasonable good faith belief in the allegations contained in the grievance.\"\n   <em>\n    Amir v.

In their brief in support of their motion to dismiss, Defendants argue that Johnson did not possess \"any 'good faith belief' that the accommodations he requested were appropriate\" because he persisted in filing \"ADA Complaints\" even after the circuit court legally determined that he was not\n   \"disabled\" for purposes of the ADA. Defs.

However, the Court does find that the filing by Johnson of ADA grievances in close proximity in time to the circuit court's decision is pertinent to the question of whether Johnson possessed a reasonable good faith belief in the allegations contained in his grievances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In determining whether to appoint counsel to a pro se litigant's civil case, the district court considers the complexity of the case, the ability of the indigent litigant to investigate the facts, the existence of conflicting testimony, and the indigent's ability to present his claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11811789\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/146/538/#p546\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   At this early stage of litigation, Johnson appears able to adequately present his claims.

As the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals instructs, the Court will \"continue to be alert to the possibility that, because of procedural complexities or other reasons, later developments in the case may show either that counsel should be appointed, or that strict procedural requirements should, in fairness, be relaxed to some degree.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams v.
