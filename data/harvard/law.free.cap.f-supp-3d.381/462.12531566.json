Muhammad contends, among other things, that the Administrative Law Judge who presided over his hearing lacked the authority to decide his case because she was not appointed in the manner prescribed by the Constitution's Appointments Clause. The Commissioner acknowledges the infirmity of the appointment but contends that Muhammad forfeited his right to assert such a claim by not raising it before the ALJ or any point thereafter in the administrative process. Magistrate Judge Timothy Rice issued a Report and Recommendation (\"R &amp; R\") in which he concluded that Muhammad had not forfeited his right to challenge the propriety of the ALJ's appointment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Given that ruling, Judge Rice did not consider the merits of Muhammad's claims; he recommended instead that Muhammad's request for review be granted and the case be remanded to be heard\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   by a new ALJ. (ECF No. 25.) Upon consideration of the Administrative Record,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Judge Rice's R &amp; R, the parties' Objections and Responses thereto (ECF Nos. 29 &amp; 35), the Court sustains the\n   Commissioner's objections, overrules the R &amp; R and refers the case back to Judge Rice to address the merits of Muhammad's claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Muhammad filed for DIB on January 14, 2014. (Administrative Record (\"R.\") 91.) His application was initially denied on June 12, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 91-102.) Muhammad timely requested a hearing before an ALJ, which was held on April 21, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46-87, 113.) ALJ Susannah Merritt ruled on June 29, 2016 that Muhammad was not disabled. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-25.) In denying his claim, ALJ Merritt found that Muhammad was \"capable of making a successful adjustment to other work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.) Muhammad requested review of ALJ Merritt's decision by the Appeals Council on July 13, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 166-69.) On July 31, 2017, the Appeals Council denied his request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-6.) Muhammad was represented by counsel throughout the administrative process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 17, 2018, Muhammad filed this lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Compl., ECF No. 3). He submitted a brief and statement of issues on June 21, 2018 arguing, among other things, that he proved his inability to return to past work, that the ALJ failed to find his traumatic brain injury severe and overestimated his residual functional capacity and that the ALJ erroneously assigned insignificant weight to the opinion of the treating psychiatrist. (Br. &amp; Stmt. Issues, ECF No. 10.) On July 25, 2018, the Court referred the matter to Judge Rice for an R &amp; R. (ECF No. 12.) On August 13, 2018, almost two and a half years after his hearing before the ALJ, Muhammad filed his reply brief in which he challenged for the first time the constitutionality of ALJ Merritt's appointment.

(R &amp; R at 8.) The Magistrate Judge believed that Muhammad's Appointments Clause challenge (which is labeled a \"\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   \" claim in the R &amp; R,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   (R &amp; R at 2)) was \"unforeseeable\" prior to\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   because before that decision DOJ contended that ALJs were mere employees, not inferior officers under the Appointments Clause. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) According to the R &amp; R, DOJ's pre-\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   \"shifting position\" regarding the ALJs' status prevented claimants like Muhammad from realizing that they could challenge the constitutionality of a governmental agency official's appointment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.)

(R &amp; R at 11-12.) The R &amp; R states that an SSA ALJ is \"powerless\" to \"resolve\" or \"decide\" constitutional issues like Muhammad's Appointments Clause challenge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.) The only support given for this point is a January 30, 2018 SSA Emergency Message that instructed ALJs to state that they \"do not have the authority to rule on [an Appointments Clause challenge].\" Soc.

The issue is not whether the ALJ could resolve or decide an issue of constitutional law, but instead whether the SSA, alerted to the problem by Muhammad's timely objection, could have corrected any error in the ALJ's appointment or assigned a different ALJ to preside over Muhammad's hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   There seems to be little dispute that this could have been done. All the Commissioner needed to do was to appoint or reappoint the ALJs herself, given that \"inferior officers\" such as the ALJs can be appointed by the \"Heads of Departments.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. CONST. , art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2.
