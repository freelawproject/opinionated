INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Casual observations of a person's forays in and out of her home do not usually fall within the Fourth Amendment's protections. Here, the defendants ask the Court to consider whether a precise video log of the whole of their travels in and out of their home over the course of eight months, created by a camera affixed to a utility pole that could also read the license plates of their guests, raises Fourth Amendment concerns. After a thorough analysis of the parties' arguments and recent Supreme Court authority, the Court rules that it does. Accordingly, the Court ALLOWS the defendants' motions to suppress, ECF Nos. 326, 358.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Almost a year later, on December 20, 2018, the grand jury returned a superseding indictment\n   naming defendant Daphne Moore (\"Moore\"), Moore-Bush's mother, as well. ECF No. 206. Moore and Moore-Bush moved on April 22 and May 2, 2019, respectively, to suppress evidence that the Government collected using a video camera installed on a utility pole across the street from Moore's house (the \"Pole Camera\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.

Electronic Clerk's Notes, ECF No. 396. For the following reasons, the Court ALLOWS the motions to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court draws the facts from the parties' undisputed statements at the motion hearing and in their briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Government installed the Pole Camera on a utility pole across the street from Moore's house, located at 120 Hadley Street, Springfield, Massachusetts. Gov't Opp'n 1. The Pole Camera captured video of, but not audio from, events occurring near the exterior of Moore's house for approximately eight months. Gov't Opp'n 2; Tr. 15:4, ECF No. 414. During this time, Moore-Bush resided in Moore's house. Gov't Opp'n 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Pole Camera surveilled the driveway and part of the front of Moore's house. Tr. 34:13-15; Gov't Opp'n 2, 4. A tree partially obscured its view. Gov't Opp'n 2. Although the Pole Camera could zoom in so as to permit law enforcement officers to read license plates, it could not peer inside windows. Tr. 26:5-22. Law enforcement officers also could pan and tilt the camera. Gov't Opp'n 3. Additionally, law enforcement officers could operate the Pole Camera's zoom feature remotely. Tr. 13:19-14:14. The Pole Camera produced a digitized recording that the Government could search. Tr. 16:2-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Although the Government has not stated the exact nature of the evidence that it seeks to admit from the Pole Camera, the parties assume that the Government will introduce video, much of it the Pole Camera recorded well into its eight-month existence.

LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Moore-Bush and Moore argue that the Pole Camera's eight-month video log of Moore's house constitutes an unconstitutional search. Moore-Bush Mot. 1; Moore Mot. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Government does not justify its use of the Pole Camera with a warrant or probable cause.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Gov't Opp'n. Instead, it insists that its use of the Pole Camera does not amount to a search.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Consequently, as the parties have presented this case, the use of the Pole Camera violates the Fourth Amendment if its operation constitutes a search. Although there are some exceptions -- none of which the Government invokes here\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   -- courts exclude evidence that federal officers obtain using a search that violates the Fourth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dedrick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4221152\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/840/482/#p492\">\n    840 F.

Although the camera in\n   <em>\n    Bucci\n   </em>\n   pointed at the front of a house for eight months, law enforcement officers lacked the capability to control the camera remotely \"without being physically at the scene.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4061177\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/582/108/#p116\">\n    582 F.3d at 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That distinction is too thin to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Bucci\n   </em>\n   from this case, however, especially in light of the legal rules that the First Circuit applied. In\n   <em>\n    Bucci\n   </em>\n   , the First Circuit reasoned that the \"legal principle\" that \"[a]n individual does not have an expectation of privacy in items or places he exposes to the public\" disposed of the matter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4061177\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/582/108/#p116\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 116-17 (citing\n   <em>\n    Katz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11339173\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/389/347/#p360\">\n    389 U.S. at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11339173\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/389/347/#p360\">\n    88 S.Ct. 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

This Pole Camera, however, is unique in this Court's experience. As discussed above, this Pole Camera\n   did not require monitoring in real time because the Pole Camera created a digitally searchable log. The Government provides no evidence that pole cameras have long had this capability. Moreover, the Court observes that in three of the four post-\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   cases and in\n   <em>\n    Bucci\n   </em>\n   the Government could not magnify images without traveling to the scene.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203995902\">\n    2018 WL 3995902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 ;\n   <em>\n    Tirado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203995901\">\n    2018 WL 3995901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 ;\n   <em>\n    Tuggle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203631881\">\n    2018 WL 3631881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 ;\n   <em>\n    Bucci\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4061177\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/582/108/#p116\">\n    582 F.3d at 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Instead, the Court rules narrowly that several aspects of the Government's use of this Pole Camera does. Those aspects are the Pole Camera's (1) continuous video recording for approximately eight months; (2) focus on the driveway and front of the house; (3) ability to zoom in so close that it can read license plate numbers; and (4) creation of a digitally searchable log. Taken together, these features permit the Government to piece together intimate details of a suspect's life.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612910\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2206/#p2214\">\n    138 S.
