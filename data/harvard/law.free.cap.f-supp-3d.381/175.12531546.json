Thus, the Court finds the Settlement Agreement is a binding contract and need not to analyze extrinsic evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In the case at hand, there is a potential legally binding contract because both parties agreed to the conditions established in the Settlement Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 15-5. The Settlement Agreement is clear on its terms particularly in that Defendant would \"refrain now and in the future from using, adopting or registering, whether as trademarks, service marks corporate names, trade names, product names ... handles or social media account names ...or other designations consisting of or incorporating the [Plaintiff's] Marks, or any mark confusingly similar thereto.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.

In order for the Court to analyze if there is a breach of contract, a determination has to be made as to whether the conditions of the contract were infringed and, whether such infringement caused damages. Under Puerto Rico law, to properly assert a claim for a breach of contract, \"a party must sufficiently allege: (1) a valid contract; (2) breach of that contract; and (3) resulting damages.\"\n   <em>\n    First Med.

Therefore, by continuing to sell inventory after the phase-out date, Defendant could have potentially breached a Settlement Agreement that was in full force. Plaintiff need not to establish damages because according to the Settlement Agreement, Defendant agreed that \"a breach ... would give rise to irreparable harm ... for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, [Defendant] [agreed] that in the event of a breach ...

Plaintiff is establishing why the similarity of the marks could be confusing to consumers. The second\n   <em>\n    Pignons\n   </em>\n   factor is the similarity of services and customers. In the case at bar, both parties have similarities of services and customers because they target the general public in Puerto Rico and sell their product in similar ways; stores, online, among others.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1192170\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/657/482/#p487\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The third, fourth, and fifth\n   <em>\n    Pignons\n   </em>\n   factors are the similarity of advertising channels, channels of trade, and the customer relationship between the parties' channel trade.

The sixth\n   <em>\n    Pignons\n   </em>\n   factor is the evidence of actual confusion. In the instant case, Plaintiff has not provided the Court with any facts or allegations that can be construed as confusion. Plaintiff broadly states that a \"bottled water is an inexpensive product usually produced without careful consideration or care. As such, use by [Defendant] of the Infringing Mark increases the likelihood of confusion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1192170\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/657/482/#p487\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff only contends the reasons why the marks could cause confusion, but not evidence of an actual confusion that has been caused among its consumers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1192170\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/657/482/#p487\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The seventh\n   <em>\n    Pignons\n   </em>\n   factor is the Defendant's intent in adopting the mark. Plaintiff does not demonstrate whether they believe or have knowledge that Defendant has an intent to adopt the mark. Nevertheless, the First Circuit established \"that courts should not give great weight to a finding of lack of intent in determining likelihood of confusion because the presence or absence of intent does not impact the perception of consumers whose potential confusion is at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    I.P. Lund Trading ApS v. Kohler Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11776094\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/163/27/#p49\">\n    163 F.3d 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 49 (1st Cir. 1998). The mere fact that an alleged infringer \"intentionally copie[d] a trademark, may be presumed that he intended to cause confusion and profit thereby.\"\n   <em>\n    Boston Athletic Ass'n v. Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10522994\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/867/22/#p57\">\n    867 F.2d 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 57 (1st Cir. 1989). Lastly, the eighth\n   <em>\n    Pignons\n   </em>\n   factor is the strength of the Plaintiff's mark. The Court finds the strength goes back to when Plaintiff started selling the water bottle, which was in 2010.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 15 at 3. Moreover, Plaintiff complies with registering the trademarks before the United States Patent Trademark Office.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No 15-1; Docket No. 15-2; Docket No. 15-3. Thus, registration demonstrates that Plaintiff has ownership rights to the trademarks. Therefore, Plaintiff has a strong mark in the realm of selling and channels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff satisfies the two prongs to establish trademark infringement. However, the Court acknowledges that the issue was already discussed and agreed upon in the Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Motion to Dismiss under 12(B)(6)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Pursuant to the entirety of the Amended Complaint, the Court takes the well-pleaded facts in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff and determines there is a plausible claim for relief. Plaintiff satisfies the requirements to show there is a potential breach of contract. On the face of the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff demonstrates sufficient facts as to the existence of a binding contract with the Defendant. Plaintiff also presents adequate number of facts to establish the Defendant may have breached the Settlement Agreement. Most critical, Plaintiff argues the Settlement Agreement established that a breach of the contract would give rise to irreparable harm. Lastly, Plaintiff has properly pled factual allegations to establish there is a potential trademark infringement by satisfying the two prongs. Therefore, the Court finds Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to show a plausible entitlement to relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, Defendant's Motions\n   <em>\n    to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 25) is hereby\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . Having the Court ruled upon the\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   without the need to consider the documents that are subject of Defendant's\n   <em>\n    Motion to\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strike\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    Motion to Strike\n   </em>\n   is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
