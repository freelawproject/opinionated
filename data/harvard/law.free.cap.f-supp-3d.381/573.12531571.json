(Doc. 40.) The Government has filed a brief in support of its motion. (Doc. 41.) Plaintiffs Lynn Doe, Ann Doe, Ellen Doe, and Cindy Doe (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") have filed a response in opposition, (Doc. 46), and the Government has replied, (Doc. 49).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Also before this court is the Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint filed by Defendants Stephen J.

The Individual Defendants have filed a brief in support of their motion. (Doc. 43.) Plaintiffs have responded in opposition, (Doc. 47), and the Individual Defendants have replied, (Doc. 50). Defendants' Motion for a Stay in Light of Lapse of Appropriations is also before this court. (Doc. 48.) On March 14, 2019, this court heard oral argument on both motions to dismiss. For the reasons stated herein, the Government's Motion to Dismiss, (Doc. 40), will be granted in part and denied in part. The Individual Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, (Doc. 42), will be granted. And Defendants' Motion for a Stay, (Doc. 48), will be denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Jose Nevarez (\"Nevarez\"), an instructor at Department of Defense (\"DoD\") elementary schools located on the Fort Bragg military installation in North Carolina, sexually abused their children. (Amended Complaint (\"Am. Compl.\") (Doc. 39) \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2, 31.) Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit alleging wrongful acts and omissions by the Defendants, in violation of duties owed to Plaintiffs' children pursuant to a federal statute, DoD regulations, and North Carolina common law. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 13.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Parties\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff Lynn Doe is the mother and Guardian ad Litem for minors \"Robby\" and \"Timmy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff Ann Doe is the mother and Guardian ad Litem for minor \"Adam.\" (Am.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) Defendant McBroom was the principal at Fort Bragg's Pope Elementary School (\"Pope Elementary\") beginning in the fall of 2011 and during the relevant time thereafter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28, 94). Defendant Coleman was a counselor at Pope Elementary during the relevant time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) Defendant Marsh was the Fort Bragg District Superintendent during the relevant time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Factual Allegations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The facts, viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs do not allege when Nevarez was hired as an instruction at Fort Bragg's DoD-operated elementary schools. Whenever Defendants hired Nevarez to be a substitute teacher, teacher's aide, and paraprofessional educator (\"parapro\"), they allegedly did not conduct a thorough background check, in violation of DoD regulations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47-48, 50.) The background check Defendants did conduct failed to obtain information from Nevarez's home jurisdiction of Puerto Rico. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) Plaintiffs allege that a more thorough background check would have revealed prior allegations of sexual abuse from 2006, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46, 48), and that Defendant Marsh later \"admitted that had the background check been completed Nevarez would not have been hired.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Defendants did not conduct a thorough background check, Defendants were allegedly required to subject Nevarez to line-of-sight supervision or video monitoring in accordance with DoD regulations, which Defendants did not do. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49, 51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As a result, Plaintiffs allege that Nevarez sexually abused elementary school students from August 2010 through November 2012 at several Fort Bragg schools, including Pope Elementary. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Nevarez's Conduct at Pope Elementary\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   From 2010 until at least November 2011 and March 2012 at the latest, Nevarez was a substitute teacher and teacher's aide at Pope Elementary. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39, 121.) Robby, Timmy, Adam, Danny, and Wyatt (collectively, \"Minor Plaintiffs\") attended Pope Elementary during this time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) Minor Plaintiff Robby is autistic, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22), and Defendants assigned Nevarez to be Robby's parapro for the 2010-11 and 2011-12 academic years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39, 44, 192.) During this time, Nevarez allegedly sexually abused Minor Plaintiffs in school classrooms and bathrooms during school hours. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40-41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the spring of 2011, Danny became apprehensive about attending school and repeatedly stayed home. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 57, 59.) Danny and his mother met with a social worker in June 2011. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.) Danny's mother specifically asked the social worker if something occurring at school could be causing Danny's distress, which the social worker allegedly dismissed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60-61.) Shortly thereafter, Danny's mother met with the then-Principal of Pope Elementary, Joel Grim, to discuss Danny's newfound apprehension. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.) Plaintiffs allege that neither the social worker nor Principal Grim fully investigated Danny's change in behavior. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62, 65, 68.) Had they, Plaintiffs contend, they would have identified signs of sexual abuse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In September 2011, Nevarez allegedly sexually molested two unidentified Pope Elementary students. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On October 11, 2011, Adam began crying and told his mother that Nevarez made Adam sit on his lap and \"stroked his inner thigh\" during class. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 72, 74.) Adam screamed and told his mother that he did not want to sit on Nevarez's lap anymore. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.) Adam and his mother immediately met with Defendant Coleman, the school counselor at Pope Elementary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 78, 80.) Adam allegedly told Coleman that \"Nevarez was touching him and making him sit on Nevarez's lap and that he did not want to attend school anymore because he was scared that Nevarez would be there and touch him again.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81.) Coleman allegedly dismissed Adam's claims, defended Nevarez, and suggested that Adam had initiated any contact with Nevarez. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 82, 84.) Adam's mom responded that \"Adam was not responsible for Nevarez sexually abusing him.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86.) Coleman then asserted that Defendants took allegations of child abuse seriously, and she promised to report Adam's disclosure and make sure that it was investigated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs allege, upon information and belief, that Coleman informed Defendant McBroom, Pope Elementary's Principal, of Adam's disclosure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94.) Plaintiffs allege that neither Coleman nor McBroom investigated Adam's claim or reported Adam's disclosure to their supervisors or the local United States Army Family Advocacy Program (\"FAP\") officer as they were required to under the DoD regulations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 94, 95, 106, 113, 231.) Instead, \"[s]oon after\" Adam's disclosure, Defendant Coleman allegedly told Nevarez about it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97). Nevarez then returned to his classroom, told Adam about his conversation with Coleman, and proceeded to sexually abuse Adam by \"strok[ing] Adam's penis and anus underneath his clothing\" while Adam sat on Nevarez's lap. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 98-102.) Defendant McBroom allegedly assigned Nevarez to Pope Elementary classrooms on at least seventeen days in the two months following Adam's disclosure, including to Adam's and other Minor Plaintiffs' classrooms, where Nevarez allegedly abused them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 110.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On November 8, 2011, Wyatt resisted attending school and told his mother that Nevarez was inappropriately touching him and other students. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 118-19.) Wyatt's mother informed her husband, who reported Wyatt's disclosure to the Fort Bragg Military Police that same day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 120.) Wyatt's parents met with Defendants McBroom and Coleman shortly thereafter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 123.) Coleman denied that Nevarez had sexually abused students or that he would do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 124-25.) McBroom informed Wyatt's parents that Defendants followed protocol after becoming aware of Nevarez's sexual abuse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 126.) McBroom offered no assistance in providing Wyatt with counseling or treatment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 128.) Plaintiffs allege that neither Coleman nor McBroom reported Wyatt's disclosure in accordance with DoD regulations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 129.) On or around November 8, 2011, Defendants \"removed Nevarez from the classroom,\" but did not remove him from the base. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 121.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On January 6, 2012, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants received another report of child abuse by Nevarez, (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 143), yet, allege no other details about this report except that Defendants failed to adequately respond to it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 143-44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In early 2012, Danny told his mother that Nevarez made Danny sit on his lap while in class and would \"rub [Danny's] back, butt, and thighs, and put his hands inside Danny's pants.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 147-48.) While doing so, Danny \"would feel something hard poking from Nevarez's pants.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 149.) Danny's mother reported Danny's disclosure to a Criminal Investigation Command agent, who was apparently working with the FBI to investigate Nevarez at the time. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 134, 150, 155.) The agent allegedly told Danny's mother to keep the sexual abuse allegations quiet, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 156), and Danny's mother threatened to go to the media. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 157.) Plaintiffs allege that Defendants retaliated against Danny's family for this threat by transferring Danny's father to a \"low-level\" and \"menial desk job far away from Fort Bragg.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 258-60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On February 21, 2012, Plaintiffs Ann and Ellen Doe met with Defendant McBroom to seek information on Defendants' supposed investigation of Nevarez (it is unclear whether Plaintiffs refer here to the criminal investigation or a separate internal investigation). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 158-59.) McBroom allegedly told them it was the first she had heard of any sexual abuse allegations against Nevarez, yet Plaintiffs also allege that McBroom declined to comment further due to an ongoing investigation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 162-63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On February 23, 2012, Adam's father informed his commanding officer of Nevarez's abuse, and he referred Adam's father to a social worker at Womack Army Medical Center. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 165.) Plaintiffs Ann and Ellen Doe then met with that social worker and disclosed Nevarez's abuse of their sons. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 166.) The social worker allegedly \"blamed the victims\" for the abuse and accused Adam's mother of having a \"vendetta against Coleman.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 167-68.) The social worker nonetheless said that she would investigate the matter but did not provide any treatment information, which Plaintiffs allege she was legally obligated to do. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 169-70.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In early March 2012, Defendants held a meeting for the parents of those children allegedly abused by Nevarez, which Adam's and Wyatt's parents attended. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 172.) The unidentified government representatives at the meeting asserted that they first learned of Nevarez's abuse from Wyatt's mother in November 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 174.) Adam's mother told the representatives that she had reported Adam's abuse in October 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On March 13, 2012, Defendants sent a letter to parents regarding Nevarez's abuse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 177-78.) The letter stated that school officials stopped calling Nevarez to substitute \"[i]immediately upon notification of the initial allegation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 177-78.) Plaintiffs allege that Defendants in fact waited \"almost\n   a month [until November 2011] after the initial report [in October 2011] before dismissing Nevarez and another four months [until March 2012] before barring him from the base.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 179). That delay, Plaintiffs continue, \"enabled Nevarez to continue to abuse children ... on the base,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 180), and \"undermined the investigation and the requirement to provide prompt and comprehensive assessment and treatment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 181.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Prior to a March 16, 2012 town hall meeting at Pope Elementary, Defendants allegedly \"notified Robby's parents of Nevarez's sexual crimes against their son.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 197.) Plaintiffs allege that Defendants assigned Nevarez to work with Robby after they were notified of Nevarez's abuse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs allege that Nevarez took advantage of his position as Robby's parapro to \"continuously and repeatedly stroke and rub Robby's penis, back, thighs, legs, and other parts of his body.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 194.) Plaintiffs do not specifically allege when Nevarez abused Robby.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendants Sicinski and Marsh attended the March 16, 2012 town hall meeting at Pope Elementary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 184.) Sicinski \"admitted that a November 8, 2011 report on Nevarez's sexual abuse of children sat on his desk for three months without being read.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 186.) Parents were told that they should contact Womack Army Medical Center's Office of Social Work if they were concerned that their child might have been sexually abused. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 188.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In or after mid-March 2012, one of Danny's classmates informed his mother that he \"had witnessed the sexual abuse of Danny and other students.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 203.) Plaintiffs allege that \"[s]everal children interviewed during [an] investigation stated that they observed Nevarez either following or pulling boys into the school bathroom.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 206.) Plaintiffs allege that Defendants McBroom and Coleman knew that other teachers allowed Nevarez's conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 207.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On March 23, 2012, Defendants notified parents at all Fort Bragg schools where Nevarez had previously taught that there was an ongoing investigation into allegations of sexual abuse by \"an unnamed substitute teacher.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 208.) Defendant Sicinski signed the letter, which contained commitments regarding treatment, care, and counseling for victims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 209.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On March 28, 2012, Defendants conducted an After Action Review (\"AAR\") of their handling of the allegations against Nevarez, the findings of which were documented in a May 3, 2012 memorandum (the \"AAR Memo\") prepared by Defendant Sicinski. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 211-12.) The AAR Memo detailed Defendants' numerous shortcomings, many in violation of DoD regulations. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 215-16, 218, 222.) The AAR Memo identified a \"reporting breakdown\" on November 8, 2011 as \"the primary cause of the installations' [sic] failure.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 219 (quoting the AAR Memo at 2).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On May 18, 2012, Defendants held a meeting for the sixteen families affected by Nevarez's actions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. (Doc. 39) \u00b6\u00b6 224, 229.) At that meeting, Defendant Sicinski, who left his post at Fort Bragg shortly thereafter, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 234-35), \"acknowledged the widespread sexual abuse of children and regretted that the abuse occurred.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 229.) The Defendants also allegedly acknowledged several of their shortcomings in preventing the sexual abuse, including insufficient monitoring of teachers and insufficient training on sexual abuse reporting and identification. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 230.)

In Claim I, Plaintiffs allege that the Government breached its alleged duty to protect from, investigate, and remediate Nevarez's sexual abuse given a reasonably foreseeable risk. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 298-04.) In Claims II-IV, Plaintiffs allege common law negligence against the Government for failure to protect, report, investigate, and provide treatment under three theories: a voluntarily assumed duty (Claim II), a special duty (Claim III), and a duty arising out of a special relationship (Claim IV). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 305-32.) In Claim V, Plaintiffs allege negligence per se and, in Claim VI, Plaintiffs bring a premises liability claim.

Compl. (Doc. 39) \u00b6 352.) Plaintiffs further allege that the Individual Defendants failed to conduct a \"proper and complete\" background check by not obtaining clearance from Puerto Rico and that Defendant Marsh admitted that Defendants would not have hired Nevarez if they had obtained a background check from Puerto Rico. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 353-55.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the Government hired Nevarez after an FBI background investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 354.) And Plaintiffs do not allege that the Government had knowledge of an incident of child abuse in Puerto Rico. Defendant Marsh's alleged admission, in May 2012, that Nevarez's conduct in Puerto Rico would have dissuaded Defendants from hiring Nevarez, without more, is of no weight in determining what Defendants knew before Nevarez's abuse of Minor Plaintiffs and of little probative value to this court in trying to determine whether prior criminal activity was akin to that alleged here in location, type, and amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that a thorough background check \"likely would have revealed\" a 2006 allegation against Nevarez from Hoke County High School in North Carolina. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46-48.) But that conclusory allegation is unsupported by the Complaint itself, as the FBI conducted a background check, and Defendants received a \"domestic\" background check, just not clearance from Puerto Rico. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50, 354.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Investigation Report also describes inappropriate conduct by Nevarez at Fort Bragg's Irwin Elementary in January or February 2011. The allegations that Nevarez hugged students, targeted kids with disabilities, stared at girls' behinds, and spoke face-to-face with students, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52), simply do not plausibly suggest knowledge of a specific threat or contribute to a consideration of prior criminal activity or future child abuse. The allegations, without more, are not reflective of criminal behavior. Plaintiffs rely on these allegations from the Investigation Report to allege that Defendants \"knew about Nevarez's sexual abuse ... as early as January or February 2011.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 221). This court does not find such an inference plausible. The Investigation Report also allegedly contains a statement from an unidentified Fort Bragg student that Nevarez pulled kids into bathrooms, \"touch[ed] their wieners, and s[et] them on his lap.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.) Plaintiffs allege that the student reported Nevarez's abuse to two unidentified people at an unalleged time. Plaintiffs then allege, upon information and belief, that the two unidentified persons were the unidentified student's teacher and principal, who both failed to report the matter. This student's disclosure to the two individuals could have occurred as a result of the investigation itself, making it of minimal value to a foreseeability inquiry. The court simply cannot infer one way or the other. Plaintiffs also rely on the Investigation Report to allege that Nevarez sexually molested two other Pope Elementary students in September 2011. Plaintiffs do not allege when these incidents were reported, and they too could have been reported for the first time during the criminal investigation. While these allegations are troubling, the court hesitates to rely on them to impute knowledge to Defendants of Nevarez's potentially criminal activity at the relevant time. What the Government knew after the Investigation Report in late 2011 or early 2012 is not as relevant as what it knew in 2010 through mid-2011. Understanding that Plaintiffs have limited access to relevant sources of information at this stage, including only a redacted copy of the Investigation Report, the court nevertheless declines to find that Nevarez's abuse was foreseeable based on non-criminal activity or conclusory allegations of prior criminal activity without more.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Nemet Chevrolet, Ltd. v.

The social worker's suspicion that Danny's behavior stemmed from Danny's\n   father's deployment to Afghanistan, and Principal Grim's suspicion that Danny was having general behavioral issues typical of children his age, were both reasonable.

(Doc. 41) at 29.) At this motion to dismiss stage, this court is not convinced. Plaintiffs allege that, on October 11, 2011, Adam told Defendant Coleman that \"Nevarez was touching him and making him sit on Nevarez's lap and that he did not want to attend school anymore because he was scared that Nevarez would be there and touch him again.\" (Am. Compl. (Doc. 39) \u00b6 81.) Adam's stated fear about Nevarez to Coleman, which she allegedly disclosed to McBroom and Nevarez, plausibly establishes the Government's knowledge of a specific threat against Adam at this time. The weight and credibility to be assigned Adam's report cannot be fully assessed at this time. However, at the very least, Adam's report of uninvited touching and related conduct, coupled with Adam's alleged psychological discomfort with that contact, give rise to a plausible concern with Nevarez's physical contact with a student. Reporting the information directly to\n   the accused teacher plausibly suggests that Defendants ignored a clear statement of potential child abuse and further ignored the potential for some type of retaliation, which Plaintiffs allege occurred. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 98-102.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The court also finds that Plaintiffs plausibly allege foreseeability through Adam's disclosure under the three-factor prior criminal activity framework from\n   <em>\n    Connelly\n   </em>\n   , applied by the Fourth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Durden\n   </em>\n   .

The full scope of the activity, the potential notice, and whether it was sufficient to place Defendants on notice will have to be addressed at a later stage of the proceedings. Further, as Plaintiffs reiterated at oral argument, the Complaint alleges that Adam's mother used the term sexual abuse in her discussion with Coleman and that Coleman responded that Defendants take allegations of sexual abuse seriously. (Am. Compl. (Doc. 39) \u00b6\u00b6 85, 88.)

But it is less clear that the reporting obligations were not followed after Wyatt's disclosure. Plaintiffs allege that a November 8, 2011 report was prepared and provided to Defendant Sicinski and it appears that, after the disclosure by Wyatt's father to the Fort Bragg Military\n   Police on November 8, 2011, a criminal investigation was opened shortly thereafter.

Rather, the existence of the copious regulations as evidence of Congress's intent is the pertinent fact. As with \"any inquiry respecting the ... intent of Congress ...
