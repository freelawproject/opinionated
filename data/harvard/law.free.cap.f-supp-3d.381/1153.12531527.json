They contend that comments pertinent to the merits of those regulation were inappropriately deferred to the ANPRM, even though they were inextricably intertwined with the question of the whether the Valuation Rule should have been repealed in first instance. Federal Defendants counter that the Proposed Repeal did not expressly limit the scope of comments to be considered and that the ONRR fully considered comments presented in response to the Proposed Repeal and ANPRM in its repeal decision. As will be discussed below, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have presented the more compelling argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   To facilitate the repeal of the Valuation Rule, the ONRR published two proposed agency actions simultaneously: the Proposed Repeal and the ANPRM.

First, in the event the Valuation Rule were repealed, whether new rulemaking would be warranted.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2016%2C325\">\n    82 Fed.

Nevertheless, the ANPRM confirms that the focus of the comments to be submitted in response to the Proposed Repeal was limited to whether to repeal the Valuation Rule and restore the pre- Valuation Rule regulations.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2016%2C325\">\n    82 Fed.

In contrast, as to comments germane to the merits of the Valuation Rule and the pre-Valuation Rule regulations, the Proposed Repeal unequivocally stated that they are to be presented and considered in connection\n   <em>\n    with the\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ANPRM.\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2016%2C323\">\n    82 Fed.

The alleged problems identified in the Proposed Repeal raised \"relevant and significant issues\" which, in turn, obligated the ONRR to consider and address comments concerning the substance and merits of both the Valuation Rule and pre-Valuation Rule regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.

Yet, because of the ONRR's artificial segregation of the comments between the Proposed Repeal and ANPRM, the ONRR failed to provide a meaningful opportunity to comment substantively on Proposed Repeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3646752\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/755/#p770\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   For their part, Federal Defendants do not directly address whether the ONRR impermissibly deferred the comment process to the ANPRM.

Opp'n at 23 (citing AR 008957-60, AR 008961-62, AR 008973-81, AR 009011-12). But whether or not the ONRR considered all comments received is separate and distinct from whether the ONRR complied with the notice and comment requirement in the first instance. In any event, the record documents cited by Federal Defendants only show that ONRR staff summarized the thirty-three comments received in response to the ANPRM,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 8961-62, 8973-81; there is no indication that the ONRR responded to or otherwise considered them in deciding to repeal the Valuation Rule.

The Valuation Rule was promulgated following an extensive period of consideration. After issuing two advanced notices of rulemaking in 2011, the ONRR embarked on a five-year rulemaking process that included public workshops and extensive outreach to the industry, government and public. In January 2015, the ONRR published a draft Valuation Rule followed by a 60-day comment period, which was extended to 120 days at the request of coal and oil and gas companies and their trade associations. AR 6381. During the public comment period, the ONRR received more than 1,000 pages of written comments, from over 300 commenters and 190,000 petition signatories.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2043%2C338\">\n    81 Fed.

Federal Defendants do not dispute this, but counter that the Proposed Repeal generated a larger public response (2,342 commenters) than the notice of the draft Valuation Rule (300 commenters). But these numbers do not tell the entire story. The 2,342 Proposed Repeal commenters generated around 1,000 comments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   The 300 commenters responding to the Proposed Valuation Rule generated over 1,000 pages of comments.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2043%2C338\">\n    81 Fed.

The ONRR did not solicit or receive substantive comments regarding either the Valuation Rule or pre-Valuation Rule regulations nor did it fully consider the comments received in repealing the Valuation Rule.

They also request an opportunity to submit further briefing on these issues. With regard to the first point, the Court finds that the ONRR committed a number of serious violations of the APA and that its repeal of the Valuation Rule was effectuated in a wholly improper manner. As discussed more fully above, the ONRR violated clearly established Supreme Court precedent requiring an agency to provide a reasoned explanation for disregarding and contradicting facts and circumstances underlying the adoption of the rules that it now seeks to repeal. In addition, the ONRR failed to comport with the APA's notice and comment requirement, thereby\n   denying the public a meaningful opportunity to participate in the regulatory process. The Court finds these violations to be serious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The Court also is unpersuaded by Federal Defendants claim that vacating the Final Repeal will be unduly disruptive. The only disruption identified is \"that lessees and the ONRR would need [time] to convert their accounting systems.\" Fed. Defs.' Mot. at 25. Setting aside the lack of any facts in the record to support that assertion, Federal Defendants overlook that any significant change in the rules governing royalty calculations inevitably will result in a period of adjustment for interested parties. As for further briefing, the Court finds it unnecessary. Federal Defendants have had ample opportunity to prepare their briefs in this action. As such, any arguments regarding whether vacatur is warranted should have been included in their motion papers. Moreover, further briefing will result in further delay. The Valuation Rule was originally scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2017, but, due to the ONRR's improper attempt to postpone the rule and subsequent repeal, none of its royalty valuation provisions were implemented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The Court finds that both declaratory relief and vacatur are appropriate remedies based on the ONRR's violations of the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   For the reasons stated above,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   1.
