Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs are suing Ford, Bosch GmbH, and Bosch LLC for allegedly selling vehicles that were not sold to consumers as advertised. (Doc # 1) According to Plaintiffs, Ford made several claims to consumers regarding its Ford F-250 and F-350 \"Super Duty\" vehicles that were untrue, including that its: (1) 6.7-liter Power Stroke Diesel is the \"Cleanest Super Diesel Ever\"; (2) proven technology and innovative strategies were used to meet the latest federal emissions standards; (3) vehicles reduced nitrogen oxide (\"NOx\") by 80% over previous models; and (4) vehicles were \"best-in-class\" with respect to fuel economy and that they were the most tested Power Stroke diesel engines ever. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) Plaintiffs contend that scientifically valid emissions testing revealed that Ford's Super Duty vehicles emit levels of NOx that are many times higher than: (1) its gasoline counterparts; (2) what a reasonable consumer would expect; (3) what Ford had advertised; (4) the Environmental Protection Agency's (\"EPA\") maximum standards; and (5) the levels set for the vehicles to obtain a certificate of compliance, which allows them to be sold in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs state in their Complaint that exposure to the pollutants from NOx has been linked with \"serious respiratory illnesses and premature death due to respiratory-related or cardiovascular-related effects.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs' claims are based on the fact that they believe that \"Ford's top selling Super Duty vehicles often emit far more pollution on the road than in the emissions-certification testing environment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) Plaintiffs argue that Ford's vehicles employ \"defeat devices\" to turn down emissions controls when the vehicles sense that they are not in the certification test cycle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Plaintiffs, Ford benefits by using defeat devices because they allow Ford to reverse the traditional order of the exhaust treatment components and put the selective catalytic reduction in front of the diesel particulate filter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.) Plaintiffs state that in modern vehicles with electronic engine controls, defeat devices are almost always activated by illegal software in each vehicle's engine control module. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs contend that these defeat devices give Ford the ability to obtain and market higher power and fuel efficiency from its engines while still passing cold-start emissions certifications tests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that Ford's representations are \"deceptive and false\" and should cause Ford to be held legally responsible for selling their vehicles while omitting information that would be material to a reasonable consumer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.) It is Plaintiffs' contention that Ford had a duty\n   to disclose that in real-world driving conditions, Ford's vehicles could \"only achieve high fuel economy, power, and durability by reducing emission controls in order to spew NOx into the air.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.) Plaintiffs further contend that Ford was responsible for disclosing to consumers that their vehicles may be \"clean\" diesels in certain circumstances, but are \"dirty\" diesels under common driving conditions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs bring their present lawsuit forward against the named Defendants because they believe that they are all responsible for the harms associated with Ford's alleged misrepresentations. While these are Ford's vehicles, Plaintiffs name Bosch GmbH and Bosch LLC as defendants because Plaintiffs allege that they were active and knowing participants in Ford's scheme. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19.) Plaintiffs claim that Bosch GmbH and Bosch LLC developed, manufactured, and tested electronic diesel controls that allowed Ford to implement the defeat devices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs bring this action individually, but also on behalf of all other current and former owners or lessees of the vehicles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.) Plaintiffs are seeking damages, injunctive relief, and equitable relief for Defendants' alleged misconduct related to the design, manufacture, marketing, sale, and leasing of the vehicles.

Whether Plaintiffs Have Sufficiently Demonstrated That They Will be Prejudiced if the Four Actions are Consolidated\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendants request that the Ruston, Goodroad, and Badagliacco Actions be consolidated with the Gamboa Action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 42. (Doc # 39; Doc # 46) The Court finds that Defendants have demonstrated that it is necessary to consolidate these four actions. First, Defendants have adequately satisfied their requirement of demonstrating that the four actions share common questions of law and fact. In the four actions, the Gamboa, Ruston, Goodroad, and Badagliacco Plaintiffs allege that Ford was dishonest with regard to the claims that were made about its vehicles that are equipped with 6.7-liter Power Stroke diesel engines. All of the plaintiffs similarly contend that because of these alleged misrepresentations, Ford violated RICO and various consumer protection state statutes. All of the plaintiffs argue that they have been harmed by Ford in the same manner, and request the same relief. Commonality of law and facts exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court has a legitimate interest in judicial economy here that is not outweighed by potential prejudice. In Plaintiffs' Response, their only substantial argument raised demonstrating prejudice is insufficient. Plaintiffs argue that they would be unfairly prejudiced by consolidation because it would unfairly give Defendants the opportunity to revise their previously submitted motions to dismiss, which they would then in theory offer this Court in response to a consolidated complaint. (Doc # 44, Pg ID 1876-1877) Due to this \"unfairness,\" Plaintiffs request that this Court only consider consolidating these actions after ruling on the Defendants' pending motions to dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1877.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court does not consider Defendants' ability to potentially revise their previous motions prejudicial enough to warrant denying Defendants' Motions to Consolidate Cases. If Defendants were to alter their motions to dismiss, Plaintiffs will still be afforded with the chance to adequately respond to any such filings. Plaintiffs have not shown prejudice that would result from the consolidation. For the sake of efficiency, time, and resources, in this instance, it is in the interest of judicial economy to consolidate the four actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(g)(3) provides that \"[t]he court may designate interim counsel to act on behalf of the putative class before determining whether to certify the action as a class action.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(3). \"[D]esignation of interim counsel clarifies responsibility for protecting the interests of the class during precertification activities, such as making and responding to motions, conducting any necessary discovery, moving for class certification, and negotiating settlement.\" Manual for Complex Litigation (Fourth) \u00a7 21.11. Designation of interim counsel is particularly appropriate when a number of lawyers have filed related \"copycat\" actions.\n   <em>\n    Tolmasoff v. Gen.

Mich. June 30, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Courts have determined that the considerations set out in Rule 23(g)(1), which govern the appointment of post-certification class counsel, are equally applicable to a decision on whom to designate as interim class counsel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203548219\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Air Cargo Shipping Servs. Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3968230\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/240/56/#p57\">\n    240 F.R.D. 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 57 (E.D.N.Y. 2006) ). In\n   deciding whether to designate Plaintiff's counsel as interim class counsel, courts consider: (1) the work counsel has done in identifying or investigating potential claims in the action; (2) counsel's experience in handling class actions, other complex litigation, and the types of claims asserted in the action; (3) counsel's knowledge of the applicable law; and (4) the resources that counsel will commit to representing the class. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(A). The Court will also consider whether Plaintiff's counsel will \"fairly and adequately represent the interests of the [putative] class.\" Fed. R. Civ.

Whether it is Appropriate to Designate Interim Class Counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiffs request that the Court appoint E. Powell Miller (\"Miller\") of the Miller Law Firm and Steve Berman (\"Berman\") of the Hagens Berman Law Firm as interim co-lead class counsel, and an interim executive committee consisting of Miller, Berman, Christopher A. Seeger of the Seeger Weiss Law Firm, and James Cecchi of the Carella Byrne Law Firm to assist them in this case. (Doc # 27, Pg ID 1161) Plaintiffs state that appointment of class counsel is appropriate at this time in order to define the roles and responsibilities of the different law firms presently involved with this case and that are representing the individual plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs have sufficiently demonstrated that each aforementioned attorney has spent a significant amount of time and energy identifying and investigating potential claims in the Gamboa Action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1162-1163.) In Plaintiffs' Motion, they thoroughly explain in detail that each aforementioned attorney has extensive experience handling class actions and complex litigation, including automobile defect cases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Additionally, Plaintiffs believe that having four law firms lead this litigation will ensure that there are sufficient resources available to handle this high stakes action. (Doc # 27, Pg ID 1163)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendants' only argument in response to Plaintiffs' Motion is that Plaintiffs' request is premature because \"there are only two lawsuits in this Court,\" and therefore, there is no need to establish interim class counsel nor an interim executive committee. (Doc # 31, Pg ID 1539-1540) This argument fails however because at this point in the case, there are now four similar lawsuits before this Court. Defendants have not demonstrated that there is any reason to deny Plaintiffs' request to appoint both interim class counsel and an interim executive committee to assist with the complexities involved in this case.

Ford argues that Plaintiffs' state law claims fall under this CAA provision because they are filled with conclusions pertaining to Ford's vehicles' emission levels. Ford acknowledges that courts have held that plaintiffs' claims are not preempted by the CAA if plaintiffs do not attempt to enforce a numerical standard.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Duramax Diesel Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524098\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/1037/#p1058\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d 1037\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1058-59 (E.D.

Plaintiffs claim that they are not seeking to enforce any numerical emissions levels, and state that their fraud-on-the-consumer claims only seek to redress Ford's deception.

Ford has not attempted to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Counts I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Duramax\n   </em>\n   from this present case. Instead, Ford argues that both the\n   <em>\n    Counts I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Duramax\n   </em>\n   courts reached decisions that were inconsistent with the CAA. The Court agrees that Plaintiffs' state law claims pertain to Ford's alleged fraudulent claims and not emissions standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Ford also argues that Plaintiffs' state law claims should be dismissed because they are premised on the fact that Ford's vehicles allegedly contain illegal \"defeat devices.\" In Ford's Motion, it mentions that in\n   <em>\n    Counts I\n   </em>\n   , the Court held that when plaintiffs sue defendants for manufacturing a vehicle that emits an excessive amount of NOx or particulate emissions in violation of EPA regulations, or claim that vehicles are not equipped with properly functioning and federally required emission-control technology, their claims are preempted by the CAA. Ford goes on to recognize that in\n   <em>\n    Counts I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Duramax\n   </em>\n   , the Court found that plaintiffs' claims were not preempted because they did not attempt to define the term \"defeat device\" using the EPA definition, and therefore, they did not technically allege the existence of a defeat device. Ford argues that those holdings do not apply in the present case. Ford claims that Plaintiffs defined \"defeat device\" using the exact wording of federal law, and do not make generalized claims like plaintiffs did in\n   <em>\n    Counts I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Duramax\n   </em>\n   . Ford further claims that Plaintiffs \"cannot simultaneously base their claims on these federal predicates, and then disclaim them in favor of some theoretical parallel state standard in an attempt to evade preemption.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that their claims do not require proof that Ford used a \"defeat device\" as defined by federal law, and state that they are not seeking to replace existing EPA certification tests. Plaintiffs contend that their claims are analogous to the plaintiffs' claims from\n   <em>\n    Counts I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Duramax\n   </em>\n   because they are similarly using the term \"defeat device\" as \"shorthand to describe Ford's bait and switch by touting its intentionally defective technology.\" Furthermore, Plaintiffs have stated that in order to prove their fraud claims, they are not required to demonstrate directly or indirectly that Ford committed fraud on the EPA by using a defeat device. Plaintiffs believe that they can alternatively prove their fraud claims by reference to what a reasonable consumer would have expected of the \"clean\" vehicles without proof of Ford's regulatory noncompliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Court agrees that Plaintiffs' claims are not contingent on their ability to prove that Ford used defeat devices in its vehicles. Although Ford correctly asserts that this present case is dissimilar from\n   <em>\n    Counts I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Duramax\n   </em>\n   because Plaintiffs define \"defeat device\" using the exact statutory language that Congress has used in its definition,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ford fails to point out that even if Plaintiffs were no longer able to refer to Ford's alleged use of defeat devices, Plaintiffs could still succeed with their fraud claims. The true issue with regard to Plaintiffs' fraud claims is whether or not Ford materially deceived (under the various state laws) its consumers. The Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently stated a claim for fraud, under state laws, without relying on Ford's alleged use of defeat devices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Implied Preemption\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In addition to express preemption, Ford claims that Plaintiffs' state law claims are impliedly preempted. As explained previously, there are two types of\n   implied preemption. The first, field preemption, occurs where federal regulations are so expansive that Congress has left no room for supplemental state regulation. Defendants do not advance a field preemption argument. Field preemption is inapplicable in this case because the CAA includes a \"savings clause\" wherein Congress expressly confirms that states retain the ability to regulate \"the use, operation, or movement\" of motor vehicles. \u00a7 7543(d).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Geier v.

Plaintiffs also rebut Ford's reliance argument by arguing that reliance is not an element for many of their state law claims, where, as here, the omission or misrepresentation is a material part of an extensive campaign. Plaintiffs claim that they sufficiently demonstrated that they bought Ford's vehicles on the reasonable but mistaken belief, due to Ford's omission and concealment of material facts, that each vehicle \"was a 'clean diesel' and/or a 'low emission diesel,' complied with U.S. emissions standards, was EPA-certified, and would retain all of its promised fuel economy and performance throughout its useful life.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Plaintiffs' state law claims have satisfied Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). Plaintiffs have stated: (1) precisely what was omitted-material facts regarding the vehicles' engines; (2) who should have made a representation-Ford; (3) the content of the alleged omission and the manner in which the omission was misleading-the content being that the vehicles had clean diesel engines and low emissions diesel engines, and the manner being that\n   those claims were false; and (4) what [defendant] obtained as a consequence of the alleged fraud-increased profits.

Further, Ford does not specifically assert in its advertisement that this claim was based on testing, and does not compare their vehicles' engines to any identifiable competitor's product.

Ford alludes to the fact that the information that it allegedly omitted was not material because a reasonable consumer would not have behaved differently had the omitted information been disclosed. Additionally, Ford argues that even if it did withhold material information from\n   consumers, this material information only relates to EPA regulations, and would be preempted. In\n   <em>\n    Duramax\n   </em>\n   , the Court rejected an argument similar to Ford's, but Ford attempts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Duramax\n   </em>\n   from this case. Ford argues that in\n   <em>\n    Duramax\n   </em>\n   , GM's advertisements did not expressly reference EPA regulations, but here, Ford explicitly references regulatory requirements in connection with its cars' emissions. Further, Ford states that even if Ford's misrepresentations and omissions were material, Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that Ford had exclusive knowledge of these facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Plaintiffs argue in response that their allegations are not limited to statements concerning federal regulations. Plaintiffs also claim that if Ford had disclosed any relevant information to consumers regarding the presence of defeat devices or unlawful emissions levels to authorized Ford dealerships or to the media, that information would have been passed on to consumers, and Plaintiffs would have behaved differently. Plaintiffs also argue that Ford's lack of exclusive knowledge argument is without merit because even if it were properly raised, which Plaintiffs do not believe is the case, Ford did have \"exclusive knowledge\" of the defeat devices due to their status as the manufacturer of the vehicles involved in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Court agrees that based on the court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Counts v.

Since Ford's alleged fraudulent omissions are material (because these plaintiffs would have behaved differently) and not all connected to EPA regulations (and therefore not preempted by federal law), Ford's argument with regard to materiality fails at this time. Furthermore, Ford's argument pertaining to it lacking exclusive knowledge of defeat devices also fails.

Mail and Wire Fraud\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Ford argues that this Court should dismiss Plaintiffs' RICO claim for failure to sufficiently plead predicate acts of mail or wire fraud for three reasons. First, Ford claims that Plaintiffs' claim is predicated on a preempted fraud-on the-regulators theory. According to Ford, because Plaintiffs allege that Ford and Bosch Defendants formed an enterprise for the express purpose of fraudulently obtaining certificates of conformity (\"COC\") from the EPA in order to sell vehicles, this constitutes an attempt to privately enforce the CAA, and is preempted and within\n   exclusive province of the EPA. Second, Ford asserts that Plaintiffs' claim that are predicated on advertisements to consumers is non-actionable because: \"(i) Plaintiffs have failed to identify with any specificity which statements are at issue; (ii) the few supposed misrepresentations they do identify are puffery; and (iii) Plaintiffs have failed to allege that the alleged affirmative misrepresentations and or omissions were material.\" Finally, Ford claims that Plaintiffs have not alleged multiple instances of mail and wire fraud that are plead with factual specificity as mandated by Rule 9(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Plaintiffs respond by arguing that Ford's assertions regarding their failure to plead predicate acts of mail or wire fraud are unfounded. First, Plaintiffs state that their RICO claim is not predicated on a preempted fraud-on-the-regulators theory because plaintiffs allege they were defrauded. Plaintiffs argue that even though they allege that Ford intended to deceive regulators and made fraudulent mail and wire communications to regulators, neither of those allegations are essential to their RICO claim. Plaintiffs said that those allegations are merely collateral matters. Second, Plaintiffs argue that they do offer their allegations about Ford's concealment with specificity in their Complaint. Plaintiffs specifically point to paragraphs 92 through 110 of their Complaint to find specific allegations. For those reasons, Plaintiffs contend that their allegations are sufficient under Rule 9(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   To state a claim based on mail or wire fraud, the Plaintiffs must allege the following three elements: \"(1) devising or intending to devise a scheme to defraud (or to perform specified fraudulent acts); (2) involving a use of the mails; and (3) for the purpose of executing the scheme or attempting to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Ford claims that any type of causal link between Ford's alleged \"fraud-on-the-regulator\" conduct and Plaintiffs' claimed injuries is indirect and attenuated. Ford argues that the court in\n   <em>\n    Duramax\n   </em>\n   incorrectly ruled that the plaintiffs did not fail to plead proximate causation because alleged intervening acts were carried out by co-conspirators, and not third parties. Ford argues that this conclusion reached in\n   <em>\n    Duramax\n   </em>\n   was wrong because the Court overlooked the EPA's acceptance of allegedly fraudulent COC's, which Ford believes was an intervening factor by a third party that broke the casual link between the violations and the injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Plaintiffs respond by contending that the court was not incorrect in\n   <em>\n    Duramax\n   </em>\n   . Plaintiffs assert that there is no case law that demonstrates that if a manufacturer defrauds the EPA and the public, it may escape liability as a matter of law by claiming that the EPA's approval of the fraudulent COC breaks the chain of proximate causation. Plaintiffs argue that if the EPA knew that the Defendants' submissions were false, that might constitute an intervening cause. However, Plaintiffs are arguing that the EPA did not know about Defendants' fraud; therefore, their approval of the fraudulent COCs did not constitute an intervening cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The Supreme Court has \"held that a plaintiff's right to sue ... required a showing that the defendant's violation not only was a 'but for' cause of his injury, but was the proximate cause as well.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <em>\n    Holmes v.

Plaintiffs allege that but for Ford's alleged fraudulent omissions, they would not have purchased Ford's vehicles. This connection is not too distant or indirect. There is also no support for Ford's argument that the EPA's approval of the fraudulent conduct broke the chain of causation. As Plaintiffs argue, the EPA did not know about any alleged omissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    e. Whether Bosch LLC Proximately Caused Plaintiffs' Injuries\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Bosch LLC claims that Plaintiffs fail to allege that they were injured \"by reason of\" a predicate offense committed by Bosch LLC. Bosch LLC argues that Plaintiffs do not sufficiently allege that its actions were a substantial cause of their injuries. Bosch asserts that even though Plaintiffs allege that Bosch LLC produced the Electronic Diesel Control Unit 17 and sold it to Ford, there were additional factors that substantially caused Plaintiffs' alleged injuries, including, but not limited to: (1) the alleged premium that Ford charged for the vehicles; (2) Ford's advertising campaign related to the vehicles; (3) fluctuations in consumer demand for vehicles like Plaintiffs' and other market forces; and (4) potential future modifications to the vehicles. Bosch LLC also argues that Plaintiffs do not allege a direct link between their claimed injuries and Bosch LLC's purported conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that they adequately allege that Bosch LLC's conduct was a substantial factor in causing their purported injuries. Plaintiffs argue that they would not have overpaid for Ford's vehicles if they did not contain the defeat devices that Bosch LLC designed and helped implement as part of Defendants' unlawful scheme. Plaintiffs argue that the \"direct link\" between their injuries and Bosch LLC's conduct is that Bosch entities participated not just in the development of the defeat devices, but also in the scheme to prevent U.S. regulators from uncovering the device's true functionality. Plaintiffs further argue that without Bosch LLC's knowing participation, the scheme would not have existed at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Based on the above standards that courts have implemented to analyze proximate causation under RICO, Plaintiffs have sufficiently demonstrated that there was a direct link between the injuries that they allege they suffered and Bosch LLC's\n   conduct. But for Bosch LLC working with Ford to make the defeat devices, Plaintiffs would not have overpaid for the vehicles. Further, as courts have noted, Bosch LLC's assertion about proximate causation is best resolved at the summary judgment stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

Those states being: (1) Arizona; (2) California; (3) Illinois; (4) Pennsylvania; and (5) Texas. Ford asserts that this Court should determine that the named Plaintiffs lack standing to assert claims in all of the states where they do not reside or claim to have suffered an injury. Ford acknowledges that federal courts have deferred this question of standing until the class certification stage, but argues that some courts are beginning to address this question sooner in the litigation process in order to refrain from subjecting defendants to the expense and burden of nationwide discovery without first securing plaintiffs who clearly have standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   In response, Plaintiffs argue that courts have been very clear about not resolving questions regarding the standing of plaintiffs until the class certifications stage. Plaintiffs point to several cases to demonstrate this \"growing consensus\" among federal courts. Further, Plaintiff argues that the main case that Ford relies on in making its argument is an outlier and runs afoul of many other cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   \"Threshold individual standing is a prerequisite for all actions, including class actions.\"\n   <em>\n    Fallick v.

Article III Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Bosch LLC makes a separate argument in its Motion with regard to Plaintiffs' Article III standing. Bosch LLC argues that Plaintiffs lack Article III standing for three reasons. First, Bosch LLC argues that Plaintiffs seek redress based on hypothetical future events, namely injuries that may occur \"when and if\" Ford recalls its vehicles and degrades the Ford clean diesel engine performance and fuel efficiency in order to make its vehicles complaint with EPA standards. According to Bosch LLC, Plaintiffs' harms are not \"actual\" or \"imminent\" in accordance with Article III. Second, Bosch LLC relies on\n   <em>\n    Bledsoe v. FCA US LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524939\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/307/646/\">\n    307 F. Supp. 3d 646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Mich. 2018), a recent decision in which the Court held that in the context of Fiat-Chrysler vehicles, the plaintiffs' claims to Article III standing were disregarded for being conclusory, or upon implausible inferences because the plaintiffs injuries were based on their expert's testing of a single vehicle that purportedly showed higher NOx emissions than the federal standards allow. Bosch LLC claims that Plaintiffs' claims are similar since they also failed to put forth any description of the purported defeat device or when and under what circumstances it is triggered in the truck they tested. Third, Bosch LLC argues that Plaintiffs' overpayment theory cannot be traced to Bosch LLC because there is no evidence that Bosch LLC advertised directly to consumers or had any control over the price of Ford's vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Plaintiffs argue in response that they sufficiently alleged that they suffered economic injuries at the time they purchased their vehicles as a result of overpaying for them due to Defendants' wrongful conduct. Plaintiffs further argue that in nearly identical circumstances, courts have rejected Bosch LLC's argument that such allegations are conjectural. Further, Plaintiffs claim that Bosch LLC misreads the court's standing rule in\n   <em>\n    Bledsoe\n   </em>\n   . Plaintiffs claim that in\n   <em>\n    Bledsoe\n   </em>\n   , the court held that plaintiffs lacked standing for failure to allege the injury-in-fact prong of the standing analysis because they solely relied on test results for a single vehicle and extrapolations from those results. Plaintiffs argue that here, they assert reasonable, plausible grounds for why their testing indicates that defeat devices were used in Ford's vehicles, and falls within the category of diesel emissions fraud cases that the court in\n   <em>\n    Bledsoe\n   </em>\n   distinguished. Plaintiffs also argue that courts have repeatedly rejected Bosch LLC's argument that the lack of a direct connection between itself and plaintiffs who are purchasers of the vehicles in question precludes Article III standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Federal courts have a duty to confirm subject matter jurisdiction in every case pending before them.\n   <em>\n    Valinski v.

Accepting Plaintiffs' allegations as true, they paid a premium for a \"clean diesel\" vehicle, which actually polluted at levels dramatically higher than a reasonable consumer would expect. In other words, they paid for a product that did not operate in the way they believed it did.
