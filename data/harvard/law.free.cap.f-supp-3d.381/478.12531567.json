The named Defendants - Paul, Rosanne, Adam, and Laura McGeehan (collectively, \"Defendants\") -- have counterclaimed for the disputed insurance proceeds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Defendants\n   claim entitlement to stacked underinsured motorist (\"UIM\") benefits on behalf of Adam and Laura McGeehan, who were involved in a serious accident while traveling in a vehicle that was covered by one of the policies in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Presently pending before the Court is First Liberty's motion for summary judgment and Defendants' cross-motion for partial summary judgment. For the reasons set forth below, Defendants' motion will be denied and First Liberty's motion will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 30, 2013, Adam McGeehan (\"Adam\") and his wife Laura (\"Laura\") were traveling in a Chevy Trailblazer, when they were struck by a vehicle operated by William Schick (\"Schick\"), resulting in injuries to both Adam and Laura. PCSF \u00b6\u00b6 1, 6; DCSF \u00b6 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Schick's insurance carrier paid the liability limits of his policy for bodily injury. PCSF \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the time of the accident, the subject Trailblazer was covered by a four-vehicle policy (No. AO628812439610) issued by First Liberty to Paul and Rosanne McGeehan (hereafter, the \"Four Vehicle Policy\"). PCSF \u00b6\u00b6 3, 6; DCSF \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4. Adam, the biological son of Paul and Rosanne McGeehan, was listed as a driver on this Policy. PCSF \u00b6\u00b6 7-8; DCSF \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Four Vehicle Policy includes a stacking endorsement that provides for the bodily injury limit of $ 300,000 to be stacked for each of the four vehicles listed on that policy. PCSF \u00b6\u00b6 9-10; DCSF \u00b6 5. First Liberty has paid $ 300,000 in underinsured motorist (\"UIM\") benefits to Adam and Laura under the Four Vehicle Policy, but has rejected their claim for stacked UIM coverage, which totals $ 900,000. PCSF \u00b6\u00b6 10-11; DCSF \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the time of the accident, Paul McGeehan also held an insurance policy (No. AO628812439650), issued by First Liberty, on a Lincoln Navigator (the \"Lincoln Navigator Policy\"). PCSF \u00b6\u00b6 12-14. The Lincoln Navigator Policy provides UIM coverage with a liability limit of $ 300,000 per accident. It also contains an endorsement that allows stacking of UIM benefits. PCSF \u00b6\u00b6 16-17; DCSF \u00b6 7. First Liberty rejected Adam and Laura's claim under this policy as well. DCSF \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties agree that Adam and Laura are entitled to stack UIM coverages only if they are \"family members\" of the named insured, as defined in the policies. DCSF \u00b6 11. Both the Four-Vehicle Policy and the Lincoln Navigator Policy define \"family member\" to mean:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   a person related to you [i.e., the insured] by blood, marriage or adoption who is a resident of your household. This includes a ward or foster child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   PCSF \u00b6 22; DCSF \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Although it is undisputed that that Adam and Laura are related to the named insureds by blood and by marriage, First Liberty maintains that the term \"family member\" also includes a residency requirement. According to First Liberty, Adam and Laura were not \"residents\" of Paul and Rosanne McGeehan's household at the time of the accident and, therefore, they do not qualify for the stacked UIM coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants dispute First Liberty's position on two fronts. First, they argue that the \"residency\" requirement applies only to family members who are related to the insured through adoption; second, they argue that, even if \"residency\" is a requirement of the policy, they satisfy that prerequisite. Having reviewed the entirety of the summary judgment record, the Court finds these issues to be adequately joined and ripe for resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment shall be granted if the \"movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

The Court must first determine whether Adam and Laura were required to be \"residents\" of Paul and Rosanne McGeehan's household as a condition of coverage.

Do the Policies in Question Impose a Residency Requirement on all Categories of \"Family Members?\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The specific dispute in this case pivots on the definition of \"family member\" as set\n   forth in the subject policies. Under both policies:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \"Family member\" means a person related to [the insured] by blood, marriage or adoption who is a resident of [the insured's] household. This includes a ward or foster child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   PCSF \u00b6 22; DCSF \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   First Liberty interprets this definition to mean that a \"family member\" must be both (a) a person who is related to the insured by blood, marriage or adoption,\n   <strong>\n    and\n   </strong>\n   (b) a resident of the insured's household. Thus, First Liberty's theory is that all classes of family members identified in the policy's definition must be residents of the policyholder's household.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendants, on the other hand, argue that the definition of \"family member\" is patently ambiguous because it is susceptible to at least two different constructions. As an alternative to First Liberty's proffered interpretation, Defendants maintain that the definition can be read to mean that \"blood\" relatives and those related by \"marriage\" automatically qualify as \"family members,\" while those related by\n   <em>\n    adoption\n   </em>\n   are covered only if they\n   <em>\n    are also residents\n   </em>\n   of the household. Both sides agree that, if the definition is read in this manner, then Adam and Laura are \"family members\" under the subject policies, and thereby entitled to stacked UIM coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendants argue that their proposed interpretation comports with the \"last antecedent rule,\" which holds that \"a limiting clause or phrase ... should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows.\"\n   <em>\n    Lockhart v.

Since 2011, Adam and Laura have shared an apartment together in Virginia, where they both work as teachers. ECF No. 56-3 at 6; ECF No. 56-4 at 12-13. Adam and Laura were married in August 3, 2013, less than four months prior to the date of the accident. ECF No. 56-3 at 4. After getting married in Erie and honeymooning in Hawaii, they returned to their jobs in Virginia. ECF No. 56-4 at 18, 66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   While Adam was teaching in Virginia, he enrolled in a Ph.D. program at George Mason University. DAMF \u00b6 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Adam had completed a form to apply for in-state tuition, as of the time of the accident, he was being charged out-of-state tuition, which his father paid. DAMF \u00b6 16; ECF No. 56-4 at 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Throughout the course of 2013, Adam and Laura returned to Erie approximately 10 to 15 times. DAMF \u00b6 1. During the summer, when his school district was out of session, Adam would travel to Erie after his classes at George Mason University had ended for the week. DAMF \u00b6 3. Laura remained in Erie during the summer of 2013. DAMF \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Prior to getting married, Adam stayed with his parents when in Erie, and Laura stayed with her parents. ECF No. 56-3 at 8; ECF No. 56-4 at 61-62, 64-66. After they got married, Adam and Laura would stay together, either at Adam's parents' house or at Laura's parents' house, when they travelled to Erie. ECF No. 56-3 at 8-13;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   ECF No. 56-4 at 28. Adam did not carry a key to his parents' house, but he had access to a key on the premises. ECF No. 56-4 at 74-75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Adam and Laura were staying at the McGeehans' house, located on Downhill Drive, during the weekend of the accident, and they were returning to that location at the time their vehicle was struck. DAMF \u00b6 5. Adam testified that he and Laura had returned to the Erie area on three occasions after getting married: Labor Day weekend, Columbus Day weekend, and Thanksgiving weekend, when the accident occurred.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%203664301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Adam could not recall whether he and Laura had stayed at her parents' home during any of these visits.

His discharge summary from the hospital lists his Virginia address as his home address. ECF No. 56-4 at 53-54. In 2014, Adam received physical therapy in Erie. ECF No. 56-4 at 54-55. At that time, Laura had returned to work in Virginia.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%203664301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Since returning to Virginia following his accident, Adam has received medical care in Virginia. ECF No. 56-4 at 69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As of the time of the accident, Adam kept clothes and personal belongings at Downhill Drive and maintained the same bedroom from his youth. DAMF \u00b6 7. That bedroom was used solely for Adam and Laura, to the exclusion of others. DAMF \u00b6 8. Laura kept only a few items at Downhill Drive, such as a toothbrush, pajamas, and possibly a couple t-shirts. ECF No. 56-3 at 13. She would pack a suitcase or bag when traveling from Virginia to Erie, and she also kept some items at her parents' house in Erie. ECF no. 56-3 at 13. When spending time at Downhill Drive in 2013, Adam regularly contributed to the purchase of food and other items. DAMF \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Adam received some mail at Downhill Drive, including bank statements, investment records, credit card statements, and college alumni mailings. DAMF \u00b6 9. In addition, his birth certificate and passport were kept at the Downhill Drive residence. Id. \u00b6 10. Adam also testified, however, that he viewed financial and credit card statements on-line and paid his credit card bill on-line. ECF No. 56-4 at 33, 38-39, 49-50, 74-75. Adam received some mail, including cards and wedding invitations, at his Virginia address. ECF No. 56-4 at 73-74. Laura received her mail in Virginia and did not receive any mail at Downhill Drive. ECF No. 56-3 at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Adam and Laura have a joint account at a federal credit union in Virginia. ECF No. 56-3 at 21; ECF No. 56-4 at 49. Adam receives direct deposits of his paychecks into this account. ECF No. 56-4 at 51. Although Adam also has a PNC account, he withdraws money from that account in Virginia. ECF No. 56-4 at 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Adam's permanent address, on file with his employer-school district, is listed as Downhill Drive. DAMF \u00b6 11. His W-2 form lists his Arlington, Virginia address as his home address, while Laura's W-2 form lists the home of her parents as her address. ECF No. 56-6. Adam and Laura used an Erie-based accountant to prepare their tax return. DAMF \u00b6 12. Their joint tax return lists their Arlington, Virginia address as their home address. ECF No. 56-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   At the time of the accident, Adam possessed a Virginia driver's license and was registered to vote in Virginia. DAMF \u00b6 17. His primary vehicle was the Chevy Trailblazer, which had a Pennsylvania license\n   plate and was registered to Paul McGeehan. ECF No. 56-4 at 20-21. Laura obtained a Virginia driver's license shortly after getting married and registered her vehicle in Virginia. ECF No. 56-3 at 7. Laura was registered to vote in Pennsylvania in 2013. DAMF \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Viewing all of the foregoing facts in the light most favorable to the Defendants, the Court concludes, as a matter of law, that Adam and Laura were not \"residents\" of Paul and Rosanne McGeehan's household at the time of the accident. As of November 2013, Adam and Laura had been living and working in Virginia for approximately two years; consequently, their apartment in that Commonwealth is where they maintained their regular physical presence, took meals, slept, received mail, and kept their possessions. Although the case for residency is stronger for Adam than for Laura, even Adam's contacts with his parents' home nevertheless fail to satisfy the \"minimum measure of permanency or habitual repetition\" necessary for establishing that he was a resident there.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Quincy Mut.

Pa. 1996) (\"Courts confronted with insurance policies that distinguish the residents of an insured's household have ... construed such contracts to differentiate those family members who actually live in the same household as the insured.\") (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). While Adam apparently made a number of trips to the Downhill Drive residence in the months leading to his wedding, there is insufficient evidence in the record to support an inference that he and Laura established residency there following their marriage. At most, the record demonstrates that, in the months after their wedding, the couple returned to Erie for visits over long holiday weekends, staying either with Adam's parents or with Laura's. Their established residency, however, was in Virginia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kaylor,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%2011272836\">\n    2013 WL 11272836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (\"[W]hen a person actually lives in one location, and sporadically visits, or keeps certain personal items at another location, it is the location where he lives that is his residence.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Although the events giving rise to this litigation are undeniably tragic, the Court is bound to apply the unambiguous terms of the insurance contracts in accordance with the governing legal principles discussed herein. For the reasons discussed, the Court concludes, somewhat reluctantly, that the Defendants are not entitled to the benefit of stacked UIM coverage because Adam and Laura were not residents of Paul and Rosanne McGeehan's household at the time of the accident in question.
