The parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the issue of whether CSX has the authority to charge B &amp; J Group demurrage fees associated with the storage of private railroad cars on railroad property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   B &amp; J Group does not dispute the accuracy of the charges, only whether CSX can impose them. For the reasons explained below, the Court will grant CSX's motion and deny that of B &amp; J Group.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A court will award summary judgment on a claim or part of a claim where there is \"no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   A fact is \"material\" if resolving the dispute over the fact \"might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing [substantive] law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   A dispute is \"genuine\" if \"the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In evaluating a summary judgment motion, a court \"must view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party,\" and make every reasonable inference in that party's favor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, a court may not weigh the evidence or make credibility determinations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, the party opposing summary judgment must support each essential element of the opposition with concrete evidence in the record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"If the evidence is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   This requirement upholds the \"underlying purpose\n   of summary judgment [which] is to avoid a pointless trial in cases where it is unnecessary and would only cause delay and expense.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, if, after making all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party, the court determines that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact, summary judgment is appropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The rule is no different where there are cross-motions for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   As stated by the Third Circuit, \"[c]ross-motions are no more than a claim by each side that it alone is entitled to summary judgment, and the making of such inherently contradictory claims does not constitute an agreement that if one is rejected the other is necessarily justified or that the losing party waives judicial consideration and determination whether genuine issues of material fact exist.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

As to the former, \"[d]emurrage shall be assessed by the serving rail carrier, i.e., the rail carrier providing rail cars to a shipper at an origin point or delivering them to a receiver at an end-point or intermediate destination.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the latter, \"[a]ny person receiving rail cars from a rail carrier for loading or unloading who detains the cars beyond the period of free time set forth in the governing demurrage tariff may be held liable for demurrage if the carrier has provided that person with actual notice of the demurrage tariff providing for such liability prior to the placement of the rail cars.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The carrier and its customers \"may enter into contracts pertaining to demurrage, but in the absence of such contracts, demurrage will be governed by the demurrage tariff of the serving carrier.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   B &amp; J Group operates within the Morrisville Yard, a private rail facility owned by U.S. Steel Corporation.

CSX maintains that it has obtained the right to assess demurrage on tracks owned or operated by Conrail. The Court agrees with CSX.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 1998, the Surface Transportation Board approved the acquisition of Conrail by CSX and Norfolk Southern Railway Company (\"Norfolk\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   In pertinent part, the decision stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Shared Assets Areas [\"SAAs\"] and Operating Agreements. Both [CSX and Norfolk] will be permitted to serve shipper facilities located within the three SAAs (the North Jersey SAA, the South Jersey/Philadelphia SAA, and the Detroit SAA), which will be owned, operated, and maintained by Conrail for the exclusive benefit of [CSX and Norfolk]. [CSX and Norfolk] will enter into an SAA Operating Agreement with [Conrail] in connection with each of the SAAs, and [Conrail] will grant to [CSX and Norfolk] the right to operate their respective trains, with their own crews and equipment and at their own expense, over any tracks included in the SAAs. [CSX and Norfolk] will each have exclusive and independent authority to establish all rates, charges, service terms, routes, and divisions, and to collect all freight revenues, relating to freight traffic transported for its account within the SAAs.

Tariff 8100, as in effect at the relevant time, provided that fees \"are applied to Private Cars waiting on a railroad's tracks; usually for leading, unloading or Shipment Instructions,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that it applied \"to all transportation services provided by [CSX] and all railcars while on our network.

B &amp; J Group argues that this language in Tariff 8100 does not apply to Conrail, because on January 1, 2019, after the events relevant to this litigation, CSX revised the tariff to provide that it applies \"to all transportation services provided by [CSX] and all railcars while on our network and the tracks of Conrail while under a [CSX] waybill.\" Def.'s App. CSTX Changes [Doc. No. 45-2]. However, even if the amended language were interpreted to mean that Conrail was not previously included in Tariff 8100, Tariff 4049, with its language including CSX's affiliates, still applies to the shipments of B &amp; J Group.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"32\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Pl.'s Ex.
