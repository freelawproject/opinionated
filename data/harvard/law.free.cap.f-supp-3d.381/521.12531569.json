Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   According to the Second Amended Complaint (ECF No. 85):\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   While driving on St. Charles Parkway in White Plains, Charles County, Maryland on the afternoon of March 1, 2015, Dorsey suffered a grand mal seizure that caused him to lose control of his vehicle, which came to a stop on the center median of the Parkway. ECF No. 85 (\"Second Amended Complaint\") at \u00b6\u00b6 47-48. A bystander placed a call to 911 and reported that Dorsey, still in his vehicle, appeared to be\n   \" 'having some type of seizure[ ]' \" and that he was \" 'jumping all over the place' \" and \" 'shaking and moving his arms and everything.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 49. When paramedics arrived shortly thereafter, Dorsey was still inside his vehicle, \"flailing\" and \"kicking his legs uncontrollably.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51. Paramedics attempted to smash the windows of Dorsey's vehicle to administer treatment but eventually were able to unlock the vehicle's doors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52. Dorsey then fell out of his vehicle on to the ground and continued seizing uncontrollably.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 53, 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At that point, Corporal Sokoloff, a deputy in the Charles County Sheriff's Office, arrived on the scene.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56. Sokoloff ordered Dorsey to place his hands behind his back, but Dorsey did not respond to Sokoloff's instruction and continued to spasm uncontrollably.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 57-59. Dorsey then appeared to regain some semblance of control, rolling on to his hands and knees and attempting to stand up.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 60. But as Dorsey attempted to stand, Sokoloff deployed his Taser, firing a projectile electric cartridge into Dorsey.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 62. On receiving the initial electric shock, Dorsey fell to the ground and became entangled in the Taser wires.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63. Sokoloff then, he claims, unintentionally discharged a second Taser cartridge, with only one probe from the second cartridge connecting with Dorsey's body.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65. Sokoloff then delivered at least five more electric shocks to Dorsey's body while continuing to command him to cease flailing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After administering the electric shocks, Sokoloff placed Dorsey in handcuffs by sitting on him and using his legs to prevent him from standing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 69. Other deputies from the Charles County Sheriff's Office arrived, and one placed leg shackles on Dorsey.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 70. At that point, paramedics on the scene noticed that Dorsey had stopped breathing and determined that he had gone into cardiac arrest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 71. Dorsey was taken to the hospital for further medical care, but never regained consciousness.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 74. On November 29, 2015, while still in the hospital, Dorsey died.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Coffey's Motions to Dismiss And/Or Bifurcate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Coffey filed a Motion to Dismiss and/or to Bifurcate Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint on July 12, 2018 (ECF No. 71), and, after Plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint, Coffey refiled the Motion on August 20, 2018 (ECF No. 91). The two Motions are functionally equivalent in that they both adopt and incorporate the same arguments that the other Defendants made in their Motions to Dismiss and/or Bifurcate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 71-1 at 1 (\"Defendant Coffey adopts and incorporates by reference the motions to dismiss and/or bifurcate, and supporting memoranda, filed on behalf of the Board of Charles County Commissioners (ECF 45 and 57), Michael Sokoloff (ECF 46 and 58), and Michael McGuigan and Sheriff Troy Berry (ECF 37 and 62).\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 16, 2018, the Court held a hearing on the Motions to Dismiss and/or Bifurcate filed by all Defendants other than Coffey but declined to hear argument on Coffey's Motion because it was filed too close in time to the hearing date and therefore was not ripe for review. For the reasons stated on the record during the hearing, the Court denied the Motions to Dismiss of all other Defendants and granted all Motions to Bifurcate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 75, 87. Specifically, the Court bifurcated the federal and state unlawful pattern and practice claims in Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint (i.e., Counts VII and VIII) and stayed them pending resolution of the claims against the individuals in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 75. In their Second Amended Complaint (ECF No. 85), Plaintiffs have retained the bifurcated unlawful pattern and practice claims from the First Amended Complaint, merely renumbering them as Counts 7 and 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Because Coffey has done no more than adopt the arguments made by the other Defendants in their Motions to Dismiss, which the Court has already denied, the Court incorporates by reference the reasons for denial it stated on the record at the hearing held on July 16, 2018, and will therefore\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   Coffey's Motions to Dismiss (ECF Nos. 71, 91) for the same reasons. It will\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   Coffey's Motions to Bifurcate Counts 7 and 8 in Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint (ECF Nos. 71, 91) and stay any decision with respect to them pending resolution of the claims against the individuals in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Berry's Motion to Disqualify Counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Sheriff Berry asks the Court to disqualify Plaintiffs' counsel Timothy Maloney, Matthew Bryant, and their law firm Joseph, Greenwood &amp; Laake, P.A (\"JGL\") based on an alleged conflict of interest, detailed as follows. In 2012, Maloney, Bryant, and JGL represented Berry in an action against one of his co-Defendants in the present case, former Sheriff Coffey. In that action, Berry alleged that while he served as Commander of the Office of Professional Responsibility in the Charles County Sheriff's Office, Coffey obstructed investigations and disciplinary proceedings affecting officers who were Coffey's political allies, and in retaliation for Berry conducting those investigations, Coffey demoted Berry. Berry alleges that the present case is substantially related to the 2012 action, and because there is a substantial risk that Plaintiffs' counsel had access to confidential information about Berry from the previous case, that could materially advance the Plaintiffs' interests vis-\u00e0-vis Berry in the present case, there is a conflict of interest that should disqualify Plaintiffs' counsel. Messrs. Maloney and Bryant and JGL sharply disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Motions for disqualification of counsel are disfavored and are \"permitted only where the conflict is such as clearly to call into question the fair and efficient administration of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Gross v.

Md. 2004) (citing Maryland Rule 19-301.7) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, a party moving for disqualification based on an attorney's alleged conflict of interest derived from representation in a prior matter must demonstrate (1) the existence of a previous attorney-client relationship between the challenged lawyer or law firm and the objecting former client, and (2) that the matter at issue in the present representation is \"the same or substantially related\" to the matter at issue in the previous representation.\n   <em>\n    Victors v.

Accordingly, their disqualification depends on whether the present case and the 2012 matter involving Sheriff Berry are \"substantially related.\" Since the present case and the 2012 matter do not involve the same \"transaction or legal dispute,\" they may still be deemed \"substantially related,\" hence disqualifying, if there is a \"sufficient similarity of issue\" between the two matters and if there is a \"substantial risk\" that confidential information counsel obtained from Berry in the 2012 matter would \"materially advance\" Plaintiffs' case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Although, as movant, Berry admits that the issues in the 2012 matter \"are obviously not identical to the issues in\n   <em>\n    Dorsey v. Sokoloff\n   </em>\n   ,\" ECF No. 80-1 at 9, i.e., the present case, he argues that the two matters are \"substantially related\" because they both involve questions of how internal investigations of Sheriff's deputies are conducted. Berry claims that confidential information he provided Plaintiffs' counsel in 2012 about the operations of the Office of Professional Responsibility could be used against him and the other Defendants in the present case to demonstrate how he had allegedly failed to discipline and supervise Sokoloff.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11422899\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/225/608/#p611\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   While it does appear that both the 2012 matter and the present case touch on issues related to Berry's supervisory role over internal investigations and discipline in the Charles County Sheriff's Office, the Court finds this factual nexus insufficient to suggest that the two matters are substantially related such that disqualification is necessary. Merely because a current and prior representation share\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   relevant facts does not suffice for disqualification; a greater degree of similarity of the underlying causes of action is necessary.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buckley v.

Admittedly, while Berry was not an organizational client, his argument for disqualifying Plaintiffs' counsel suggests that he may have disclosed confidential information about organizational investigative and disciplinary procedures employed by the Sheriff's Office of Professional Responsibility. ECF No. 80-1 at 9. But, as indicated, such knowledge is \"insufficient for disqualification\" of the attorney in a subsequent representation against the former client.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Perlberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197360\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/819/449/#p455\">\n    819 F.Supp.2d at 455-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (denying insurance company's motion to disqualify a former outside counsel, who had previously represented the company's insureds in lead-paint and automobile tort actions, when that attorney represented an insured in a duty to defend action against the insurance company, after the company refused to defend the insured against an underlying lead-paint tort suit).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   To be sure, Plaintiffs' counsel have identified three documents from its 2012 representation of Berry that involved \"Tasers and/or Sokoloff,\" two of which show that, after being demoted from Commander of the Office of Professional Responsibility at the end of 2010, Berry was one of Sokoloff's supervising officers and reviewed an instance where, in September 2012, Sokoloff had discharged his Taser and was subsequently accused of excessive force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 97-2, 97-3. But even if this information is presumed to be confidential based on the former attorney-client relationship between Berry and Plaintiffs' counsel in 2012, Berry must still demonstrate that \"the confidential information which is assumed to have been shared in the previous representation could be used to the detriment of the former client in the current proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Nichols Agency\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3666183\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/537/774/#p779\">\n    537 F.Supp.2d at 779-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He has not done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Berry's liability in this case, if any, must be predicated on his liability in a supervisory capacity. To establish a claim of supervisory liability against Berry, Plaintiffs would have to show (1) that Berry had actual or constructive knowledge that Sokoloff was engaged in conduct that posed \"a pervasive and unreasonable risk\" of constitutional injury to citizens like Dorsey; (2) that Berry's response to that knowledge was so inadequate as to show \"deliberate indifference to or tacit authorization of the alleged offensive practices;\" and (3) that there was an \"affirmative causal link\" between Berry's inaction and the particular constitutional injury suffered by Dorsey.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shaw v.

The documents from the 2012 representation state only that Sokoloff discharged his Taser after a confrontation with a suspect and that Berry requested that the Office of Professional Responsibility review the incident. ECF Nos. 97-2, 97-3. One document also includes a handwritten note from an unknown author requesting Berry's signature on the incident report involving Sokoloff, as well as authorizing Berry to investigate further \"if need be.\" ECF No. 97-3. While these documents demonstrate that Berry had supervisory responsibilities over Sokoloff and was aware that Sokoloff had previously discharged a Taser in the course of his responsibilities as a deputy, they do not in any sense show that Sokoloff's Taser use constituted a \"pervasive and unreasonable risk\" of constitutional injury, let alone that Berry was deliberately indifferent to any allegedly unconstitutional\n   practices. In sum, the Court finds no \"substantial risk\" that the presumed confidential information contained in these documents from the 2012 representation would \"materially advance\" Plaintiffs' claims against Berry or the other Defendants in the present suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maryland Rule 19-301.9, cmt. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Since the 2012 matter and present case are not substantially related, and there is no substantial risk that previously-obtained confidential information would materially advance Plaintiffs' claims, Berry's Motion to Disqualify Counsel will be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

While on his way to respond to the erratic driving incident involving Dorsey, Sokoloff alleges that the Sheriff's Office dispatcher informed him that emergency medical services personnel had found a loaded firearm inside Dorsey's vehicle. ECF No. 88-11 (\"Sokoloff Affidavit\") at \u00b6\u00b6 4-5. But before Sokoloff arrived at the scene, the dispatcher also informed him that the weapon had been secured, which emergency personnel confirmed to Sokoloff upon his arrival.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5. Sokoloff alleges that emergency personnel told him that they did not know if there were other weapons in Dorsey's car,\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , but, regardless, once on the scene, Sokoloff did not search the vehicle for additional firearms. Indeed, there is no indication that any one remained in Dorsey's vehicle. As Sokoloff moved closer to Dorsey, Dorsey did reach out while spasming and grab the legs of a firefighter who was on the scene.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7; ECF No. 88-8 (\"Tyrell Affidavit\") at \u00b6 5. But before Sokoloff reached Dorsey's position, the firefighter was able to free himself from Dorsey's grip. Sokoloff Affidavit at \u00b6 7; Tyrell Affidavit at \u00b6 5. Sokoloff stated that \"[b]ased on what [he] had just seen and been told, including the uncertainty about other weapons,\" he concluded that Dorsey represented enough of a safety threat to require detention. Sokoloff Affidavit at \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   At that point, however, it cannot be said that Dorsey posed an immediate threat to Sokoloff or others. While emergency personnel had found a firearm in Dorsey's car, they told Sokoloff they had secured the weapon in an ambulance, beyond Dorsey's immediate reach. Sokoloff Affidavit at \u00b6 5. And while Dorsey had grabbed a firefighter, that firefighter had managed to free himself before the full volley of Tasers began. There is no indication that Dorsey was in contact with any other emergency personnel or sheriff's\n   deputies at the time Sokoloff deployed his Taser. To be sure, the fact that one weapon may have been found in Dorsey's car, although secured by law enforcement personnel, might suggest the possibility that a second was available to him. Yet, with Dorsey writhing on the ground, the failure to attempt to verify whether there was a second weapon makes the multiple Taser shocks more problematic. For a threat to the safety of others to be immediate, greater certainty of the potential for the subject of a seizure to cause harm is required, since \"[f]orce is reasonable only when exercised in proportion to the threat posed.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cyrus v. Town of Mukwonago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3794591\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/624/856/#p863\">\n    624 F.3d 856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 863 (7th Cir. 2010) (holding that the unverified possibility that a suspect had placed a weapon nearby was insufficient to rise to the level of an immediate threat justifying an officer's use of a Taser, when the suspect was unarmed, lying face down on the ground with his hands underneath him, and had already been Tased twice). Here, a jury could reasonably conclude that any threat posed by Dorsey was not immediate. The Court recognizes that it should not \"undercut the necessary element of judgment inherent in a constable's attempts to control a volatile chain of events.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown v. Gilmore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9398412\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/278/362/#p369\">\n    278 F.3d 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 369 (4th Cir. 2002). But while Dorsey may have posed enough of a threat to justify arresting him after finding a loaded firearm in his car, subsequent \"[p]ainful, injurious, serious inflictions of force, like the use of a Taser, do not become reasonable simply because officers have authorization to arrest a subject who is unrestrained.\"\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060327\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/810/892/#p898\">\n    810 F.3d at 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Sokoloff claims that, as he approached Dorsey, he called out to paramedics on the scene \"to ask what the problem with the driver was,\" and that the paramedics responded that \"they weren't sure because they hadn't been able to examine [Dorsey].\" Sokoloff Affidavit at \u00b6 6. Even so, the Charles County Sheriff's Office incident reports reference statements given by the paramedic in charge at the scene, who stated that \"he believed Dorsey was still having a seizure\" before Sokoloff deployed his Taser, and by another paramedic who stated that he arrived on the scene as part of \"an EMS crew who responded to St. Charles Parkway for the person in a vehicle having a seizure.\" ECF No. 88-9 at 12, 15. Since some emergency personnel clearly stated their belief that Dorsey was having a medical event before and after Sokoloff arrived on the scene, Sokoloff's assertion that paramedics were uncertain as to what was causing Dorsey's condition is at best questionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   But even if the paramedics at the scene did not inform Sokoloff that there was a possibility Dorsey was suffering from a seizure, and even if Sokoloff suspected that Dorsey was suffering from a drug overdose that might have increased the likelihood he would threaten emergency personnel or resist arrest, Sokoloff is not entitled to qualified immunity. A jury could reasonably conclude that Sokoloff's failure to inquire further as to the opinions as to of the emergency personnel about Dorsey's medical condition before deploying his Taser constituted an unreasonable and excessive use of force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Casey v. City of Federal Heights\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3327851\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/509/1278/#p1285\">\n    509 F.3d 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1285-86 (10th Cir. 2007) (holding that officer who had fired a Taser at a suspect \"almost immediately upon arrival\" at the scene of an incident, such that \"she could not have known what was going on\" was not entitled to qualified immunity because a jury could have reasonably determined her use of force to be excessive).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Applying the third\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factor to the qualified immunity analysis also permits the conclusion that Sokoloff's use of\n   force was excessive. As a result of his seizure, Dorsey could not actively resist or attempt to evade arrest because, it would be hard to miss, he had lost voluntary control of his body movements. Again, emergency personnel at the scene described Dorsey as writhing and flailing uncontrollably, as well as struggling to stand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sokoloff Affidavit at \u00b6 5; ECF No. 88-6 (\"Quinn Affidavit\") at \u00b6\u00b6 7-8, ECF No. 88-7 (\"Williams Affidavit\") at \u00b6 7.

Moreover, the fact that Dorsey continued to writhe on the ground after receiving six electrical shocks strongly suggests that he did not pose an immediate threat nor was he intentionally resisting arrest such that a Taser was necessary to subdue him.

ECF No. 105-1 at 1-2. In denying the State's Motion to Dismiss, the Court noted that \"there is some issue of the duality of the agency of Defendant Sokoloff,\" and the question of whether he was working as an agent of the State or of Charles County at the time he deployed\n   his Taser on Dorsey should be \"the subject of a fact inquiry.\" ECF No. 87 at 39:15-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Maryland has established that tort judgments against a county sheriff or a deputy sheriff may be payable by either the State or the relevant County, depending on whether the sheriff or deputy sheriff was acting as a state or county employee at the time of the allegedly tortious conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20State%20Fin.%20%26%20Proc.%20%C2%A7%209-108\">\n    Md.

The State also argues that the incident reports prepared by the Charles County Sheriff's Office show that Sokoloff and the other deputies who arrived on the scene of Dorsey's car accident were \"responding to 911 calls and a request from EMS for law enforcement assistance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20State%20Fin.%20%26%20Proc.%20%C2%A7%209-108\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 3 (citing ECF No. 88-9).
