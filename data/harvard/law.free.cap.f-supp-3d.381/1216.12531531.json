Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court repeats the relevant facts from the Court's January 16, 2019 Order dismissing Defendant's indictment. Defendant is citizen of Mexico who is also known under the aliases Juan Jose Rodrigo-Lara and Carlos Arturo Linares Rojas. On August 21, 1997, Defendant came into Immigration and Naturalization Services (\"INS\") custody from King County Sheriff's Department. ECF No. 38-1 (\"Norris Decl.\") at 2. On August 21, 1997, Defendant was served a Notice to Appear that alleged that Defendant was removable for his unlawful presence in the United States and for a Washington first degree theft conviction ( RCW 9a.56.030(1)(a) ), which the Notice to Appear alleged was a crime involving moral turpitude.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD, Exh. A (\"Notice to Appear\") at 1. The Notice to Appear provided no specific date or time for Defendant's removal hearing, but instead stated only:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   YOU ARE ORDERED to appear before an immigration judge of the United States Department of Justice at: Seattle, Washington on a date to be calendared by the EOIR Office. Notice will be mailed to the address provided by the respondent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [O]n __________ at __________ to show why you should not be removed from the United States based on the charge(s) set forth above.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Under the two blank lines, the words \"(Date)\" and \"(Time)\" were written in small lettering to indicate what information should be included on those two blank lines.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In support of its opposition to Defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment, the government attached the declaration of Deportation Officer Courtney Norris.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Norris Decl. Officer Norris does not claim to have personal knowledge of Defendant's case, but rather says only that he \"reviewed the Alien file of Juan Jose RODRIGO-Lara a.k.a. Jorge Arturo Rojas-Osorio.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Officer Norris asserts that on September 2, 1997, before the removal hearing was commenced, the Defendant was returned to the custody of King County Sheriff's Department to answer a warrant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   There is a factual dispute between the parties as to what happened next. According to Deportation Officer Courtney Norris, on April 21, 2005, after serving a seven-year sentence for the first degree theft conviction, Defendant was returned to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") custody.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant takes issue with Officer Norris's assertion that Defendant served a seven-year sentence for the first degree theft conviction because the sentence imposed was only 90 days, not seven years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 41 (\"MTD Reply\") at 11. Indeed, the Judgment of the Washington Superior Court specifically shows that the sentence imposed was 90 days, not seven years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Norris Decl., Exh. A at 7 (\"Judgment and Sentence of the Washington Superior Court\") (showing that the sentence imposed was 90 days).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On April 29, 2005, ICE notified the Executive Office of Immigration Review (\"EOIR\") in Seattle that Defendant was in ICE custody. Norris Decl. at 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Norris Decl., Exh. A at 5 (\"Notice to EOIR: Alien Address\"). The EOIR court clerk and the ICE docket officer then set\n   the date of Defendant's removal hearing. Norris Decl. at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   According to Officer Norris, \"[a] second notice with the exact date, place and time of [Defendant's] hearing\n   <em>\n    would have\n   </em>\n   been communicated to [Defendant] through\" what is called a kite,\" or a \"messaging system between persons incarcerated and detained docket case managers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3 (emphasis added). Officer Norris elaborates on how a kite works in his declaration: \"[t]he kite is typically a piece of 8 x 11 paper that includes a space for the inmate's name, alien number, housing location and question or concern. Generally, inmates ask about hearing dates, property or anticipate removal dates. Kites are communicated in the language that the inmate can understand.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. However, Officer Norris does not assert that Defendant actually received a kite. Moreover, Defendant asserts in his declaration that \"[a]fter serving my sentence and being immediately placed in the custody of immigration, I never received information about when and where my removal hearing would take place.\" ECF No. 42 (\"Rojas-Osorio Decl.\") \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Regardless, Defendant's removal hearing ultimately took place on May 9, 2005 via a video conference. The parties provided a CD containing the audio from Defendant's removal hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32 (\"MTD\"), Exh. B (\"Removal Hearing\"). The audio indicates that IJ Edward R. Kandler presided from Seattle, Washington, while Defendant was in the Northwest Detention Center located in Tacoma, Washington.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant appeared without an attorney and was assisted by a Spanish translator.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Judge Kandler first advised Defendant that he had a right to a lawyer and asked Defendant if Defendant would like to proceed without a lawyer or if Defendant would like a continuance to obtain a lawyer.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant responded that he would like to continue without a lawyer.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In his motion to dismiss the indictment, Defendant asserted, inter alia, that Judge Kandler did not meaningfully advise Defendant of his right to seek voluntary departure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 18-19. The conversation as to the availability of voluntary departure during the removal proceeding occurred as follows. After finding Defendant removable and designating Mexico as the country for removal, Judge Kandler asked counsel for the government whether there was any bar to voluntary departure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Removal Hearing. Government counsel responded that Defendant had a 1997 theft conviction.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Judge Kandler noted that the theft conviction was an adverse factor but added that \"it happened over five years ago.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Government counsel then added that Defendant had a 1998 first degree robbery conviction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Judge Kandler declined to grant voluntary departure based on the two prior convictions.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Judge Kandler made no further statements regarding voluntary departure.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On May 9, 2005, Judge Kandler ordered Defendant removed from the United States.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   MTD, Exh. C (\"Removal Order\"). Defendant was advised that he had a right to appeal the decision, which Defendant agreed to waive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Removal Hearing. On May 10, 2005, Defendant was removed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD, Exh. D (\"Warrant of Removal\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At some point, the Defendant returned to the United States. On October 13, 2006, a Notice of Intent/Decision to Reinstate Prior Order was issued ordering Defendant's removal based on the prior 2005 Removal Order. MTD, Exh. E (\"2006 Reinstatement\"). On January 31, 2011, a Notice of Intent/Decision to Reinstate Prior Order was issued, again based on the same 2005 Removal Order. MTD, Exh. F (\"2011\n   Reinstatement\"). The parties do not explain or cite to any materials that explain what happened in the intervening five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Second, Defendant argued that the IJ violated Defendant's due process rights when the IJ failed to advise Defendant of Defendant's eligibility for pre-hearing or post-hearing voluntary departure or give Defendant the opportunity to present countervailing equities in favor of such relief.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court's January 16, 2019 Order granted Defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment based on Defendant's first argument regarding\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , and therefore did not consider Defendant's second argument regarding voluntary departure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1/16/19 Order.

The Ninth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Karingithi\n   </em>\n   explained that because the regulations define when jurisdiction vests, the regulatory definition for \"Notice to Appear\" also necessarily governs when a Notice to Appear is sufficient for jurisdictional purposes.\n   <em>\n    Karingithi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n    913 F.3d at 1160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the Ninth Circuit explained that pursuant to the regulations, a Notice to Appear need not include removal hearing date and time information to vest jurisdiction with the IJ.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Second, the Ninth Circuit found Pereira inapplicable to the issue regarding an IJ's jurisdiction in removal proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n    at 1160-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Ninth Circuit explained that\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   was limited to the narrow context of the stop-time rule.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, the Ninth Circuit was particularly persuaded by the fact that the stop-time rule at issue in Pereira\n   <em>\n    concerned\n   </em>\n   the stop-time statute ( 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(1) ) that specifically cross-referenced\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), the statute defining a \"Notice to Appear.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   By contrast, the regulation regarding an IJ's jurisdiction in removal proceedings does not cross-reference\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), the statute defining a \"Notice to Appear.\" As the Ninth Circuit stated, \"[t]here is no 'glue' to bind \u00a7 1229(a) and the jurisdictional regulations [at issue here]: the regulations do not reference \u00a7 1229(a), which itself makes no mention of the IJ's jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Therefore, applying the Ninth Circuit's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Karingithi\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds that in the instant case, Defendant's Notice to Appear that lacked removal hearing date and time information was still sufficient to vest the IJ with jurisdiction over Defendant's removal proceedings. Thus, Defendant's collateral attack on this ground fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Further, the Court notes that the instant Defendant had actual notice of his removal hearing because he was in ICE custody and was brought to and present during his video conference removal hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Karingithi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n    913 F.3d at 1159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We also note that the petitioner, Serah Njoki Karingithi, had actual notice of the hearings.\"). Such actual notice defeats Defendant's arguments regarding due process and prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Farhoud v. I.N.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"302214\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/122/794/#p796\">\n    122 F.3d 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 796 (9th Cir. 1997) (\"Due process is satisfied if service is conducted in a manner 'reasonably calculated' to ensure that notice reaches the alien.\");\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Opp'n at 3-16. Defendant also suggests that the Court should stay his case pending resolution of the petition for rehearing en banc in\n   <em>\n    Karingithi\n   </em>\n   and any subsequent petition for certiorari.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17. Although the Ninth Circuit panel may ultimately prove incorrect in its determination, \"once a federal circuit court issues a decision, the district courts within that circuit are bound to follow it and have no authority to await a ruling by the Supreme Court before applying the circuit court's decision as binding authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Yong v.

Thus, the Court declines Defendant's invitation to second guess the Ninth Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Karingithi\n   </em>\n   decision and DENIES Defendant's request to stay his case pending the petition for rehearing en banc in\n   <em>\n    Karingithi\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Accordingly, the Court GRANTS in part\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the government's motion to reconsider. In particular, the Court finds that the Court's January 16, 2019 Order that granted Defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment on the basis that the IJ did not have jurisdiction over Defendant's 2005 removal proceeding was incorrectly decided in light of the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Karingithi\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, the Court VACATES the January 16, 2019 Order and the Judgment, and REOPENS the case. However, the Court's January 16, 2019 Order did not consider the second argument in Defendant's motion to dismiss. The Court turns to that issue now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

MTD at 17-23; MTD Reply at 12-15. As an initial matter, the government argues that the Court should not consider Defendant's pre-hearing and post-hearing voluntary departure arguments because Defendant's motion to withdraw guilty plea only discussed the\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   argument and did not contain any voluntary departure argument. Mot. for Reconsid. at 4. However, the government has cited no authority, nor has the Court independently found any authority, holding that the Court cannot consider Defendant's voluntary departure arguments in the motion to dismiss. Therefore, the Court considers Defendant's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Second, Defendant effectively concedes that Defendant was not eligible for\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   -hearing voluntary departure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD Reply at 13. Therefore, the Court does not consider the post-hearing voluntary departure issue further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   However, as discussed below, the Court agrees with Defendant that the IJ failed to advise Defendant of his eligibility for\n   <em>\n    pre\n   </em>\n   -hearing voluntary departure and failed to provide Defendant the opportunity to present\n   countervailing equities in favor of such relief. On this ground, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment, and DENIES the government's motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Below, the Court first discusses the due process violation then, whether Defendant was prejudiced.

However, the Notice to Appear identified the 1997 Washington state first degree theft conviction as a crime of moral turpitude and not as an aggravated felony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice to Appear. The Notice to Appear did not allege any aggravated felony conviction and did not allege that Defendant's removal was based upon an aggravated felony conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20811\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, based on the face of the Notice to Appear, Defendant was not statutorily barred from pre-hearing voluntary departure relief and so he should have\n   been advised of the availability of that relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Moreover, Defendant's 1997 Washington state first degree theft conviction does not constitute an aggravated felony. The government incorrectly contends, based on the declaration of Officer Norris, that Defendant's theft conviction resulted in a seven-year sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Norris Decl. at 2. However, Officer Norris does not claim to have personal knowledge of Defendant's case, and says only that he \"reviewed the Alien file of Juan Jose RODRIGO-Lara a.k.a. Jorge Arturo Rojas-Osorio.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Moreover, Officer Norris does not attach any document showing that Defendant's theft conviction resulted in a seven-year sentence. Instead, the Judgment of the Washington Superior Court that is attached to Officer Norris's declaration specifically shows that the sentence imposed on Defendant was 90 days, not seven years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Judgment and Sentence of the Washington Superior Court. A Washington state first degree theft conviction that resulted in a 90-day sentence is not an aggravated felony because it falls outside the aggravated felony definition requiring a sentence of at least one year for a crime of violence or a theft offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(F), (G) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alberto-Gonzalez v.

As an initial matter, Defendant's Notice to Appear did not mention the 1998 Washington state first degree robbery conviction, and the government's opposition to the instant motion to dismiss did not allege that Defendant's 1998 Washington state first degree robbery conviction constituted an aggravated felony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice to Appear; Opp'n.

In\n   <em>\n    Ortiz-Lopez\n   </em>\n   , for instance, the Ninth Circuit explained that Defendant was exempt from the exhaustion and judicial review requirements when the IJ failed to meaningfully advise Defendant of his right to seek pre-hearing voluntary departure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1204. Specifically, the Ninth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Ortiz-Lopez\n   </em>\n   explained that \"[w]aiver of appeal must be considered and intelligent, and '[w]e do not consider an alien's waiver of his right to appeal his deportation order to be considered and intelligent when the record contains an inference that the petitioner is eligible for relief from deportation, but the [IJ] fails to advise the alien of this possibility and give him the opportunity to develop the issue.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1204 n.2 (citing\n   <em>\n    Ubaldo-Figueroa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9275388\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/364/1042/#p1048\">\n    364 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1049 ). In that case, the Ninth Circuit further explained that \"Ortiz-Lopez would have been deprived of the right to judicial review, because 'an alien who is not made aware that he has a right to seek relief necessarily has no meaningful opportunity to appeal the fact that he was not advised of that right.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9275388\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/364/1042/#p1048\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Arrieta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11238368,11238342\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/224/1076/\">\n    224 F.3d at 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding a deprivation of judicial review where an alien was not informed of the right to seek relief from deportation)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In the instant case, because the IJ failed to meaningfully advise Defendant of his right to pre-hearing voluntary departure relief, Defendant's appeal waiver was similarly not considered and intelligent, and therefore, is excused.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez-Arroyo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=467%20Fed.%20Appx.%20746\">\n    467 Fed.Appx. at 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding in case where Defendant was not meaningfully advised of right to seek pre-hearing voluntary departure and never had opportunity to apply for voluntary departure or to present evidence of the countervailing equities favoring that relief, that defendant \"was deprived of due process during the 2005 deportation hearing and his waiver of his right to appeal was not 'considered and intelligent' \");\n   <em>\n    Lopez-Menera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3770410\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/542/1025/\">\n    542 F.Supp.2d at 1027-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A waiver is not \"considered and intelligent\" when \" 'the record contains an inference that the petitioner is eligible for relief from deportation,' \" but the IJ fails to \" 'advise the alien of this possibility and give him the opportunity to develop the issue.' \");\n   <em>\n    Basulto-Pulido\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=219%20Fed.%20Appx.%20717\">\n    219 Fed.Appx. at 719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Accordingly, because the IJ's failure to inform Defendant of his eligibility for pre-hearing voluntary departure and failure to give Defendant a genuine opportunity to present his countervailing equities violated Defendant's due process rights, and because this violation caused Defendant prejudice, the underlying order of removal cannot constitute an element of Defendant's \u00a7 1326 offense.
