Hale, Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs Kruti Desai, Melanie Fink, Belinda Gale Parkerson, Jeremy Parkerson, Daniel Popp, and Carolyn Vincent alleged that their former employer, Charter Communications, LLC, falsely accused them of theft after their employment was terminated. (Docket No. 7) Following a weeklong trial, a jury agreed, finding Charter liable for defamation per se. (D.N. 168) Charter has moved for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial. (D.N. 183) In the alternative, it seeks reduction of the damage award. For the reasons explained below, the Court will reduce the punitive damages and deny Charter's motion in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court previously summarized the facts of this case as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs worked at Charter's call center in Louisville, Kentucky, in various capacities. Each was given a Hewlett-Packard (HP) computer printer by Linda Showalter, an administrative assistant at Charter. Plaintiffs maintain that they believed Showalter's distribution of printers was authorized by management. Charter, however, considered Plaintiffs' acceptance of the printers to be a violation of its policy against removing company property without authorization, and it terminated most of the employees involved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Approximately one month after Plaintiffs were fired, Charter Human Resources Manager Rodger Simms gave a PowerPoint presentation during a Charter\n   leadership conference. On a slide with the heading \"Leadership and Judgment,\" Simms referred to \" 'Operation ...' Green-light, Buzz-kill, Printer-gate.\" He encouraged employees to \"[a]ct with Integrity and Character.\" The notes for Simms's oral presentation accompanying the slide state: \"Let's get the elephant in the room out in the open, how many of you have heard of ... Operation codes for things that weren't right! All examples of poor judgment. Not bad people, people we know and love but they made the wrong choices.\" Simms emphasized the importance of \"integrity,\" \"character,\" and having \"the courage to do the right thing.\" He also warned that \"[k]nowing something isn't right and allowing it to continue is the same as you doing it!\" \"Green-light\" referred to an incident in which a Charter employee used a company credit card for personal benefit and was terminated as a result. \"Buzz-kill\" involved the sale of illegal drugs on Charter property by Charter employees; those employees were also terminated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs sued Charter for defamation on the ground that \"Charter made false statements alleging misconduct on the part of the Plaintiffs relating to the ... distribution of Hewlett-Packard ink jet printers, including but not limited to the [PowerPoint] presentation.\" They contend that the use of the term \"Printer-gate,\" particularly in conjunction with references to employee theft and drug-dealing, implied that their actions were criminal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (D.N. 129, PageID # 2710-11 (internal citations and footnote omitted))\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The case was tried solely on a theory of defamation per se. At the close of Plaintiffs' case, Charter moved for judgment as a matter of law, arguing that \"Printer-gate\" could not constitute defamation per se because it had no \"objectively understood definition\" (D.N. 148-1, PageID # 3243) and was not defamatory on its face (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 3243-45); that Plaintiffs had no proof of damages to support a claim of defamation per quod (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 3245-47); and that any inference arising from \"Printer-gate\" was true because the term referred to \"an incident involving the unauthorized removal of company printers from Charter's premises.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 3248;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 3247) The Court denied that motion and later granted Plaintiffs' motion for judgment as a matter of law on Charter's truth defense, concluding that there was insufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that Plaintiffs' actions constituted criminal theft. (D.N. 175, PageID # 4091-92) The jury ultimately found Charter liable, awarding each plaintiff $ 350,000 in compensatory damages and $ 1 million in punitive damages. (D.N. 168) The Court entered judgment for Plaintiffs in accordance with the jury's verdict (D.N. 179), and Charter timely sought relief under Rules 50 and 59 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (D.N. 183)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Charter renews its Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law on the issue of whether the term \"Printer-gate\" can constitute defamation per se. (D.N. 183-1, PageID # 4372-86;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D.N. 148) It further argues that it is entitled to a new trial on the grounds that it should have been allowed to present the defenses of truth and qualified privilege; that James Eversole's testimony was admitted in error; and that the jury was required to find malice by clear and convincing evidence in order to award punitive damages.

Charter has not demonstrated that either remedy is warranted here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Defamation Per Se\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As it has on numerous prior occasions, Charter argues that the term \"Printer-gate\" cannot constitute defamation per se. Charter first asserts that there was no evidence to support a finding that Simms's presentation imputed criminal conduct to Plaintiffs. (D.N. 183-1, PageID # 4372-76) It further contends that the Court, not the jury, should have determined whether defamation per se occurred. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 4376-86) Neither argument is persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   According to Charter, \"on the evidence presented at trial, no reasonable jury could have concluded that the use of the term 'Printer-gate' suggested that the Plaintiffs had engaged in theft.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 4372) But that was not the issue before the jury; the Court had already found, as a matter of law, that the term was \"capable of bearing a defamatory meaning.\" (D.N. 129, PageID # 2717 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Yancey v. Hamilton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10015784,10015611\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/786/854/\">\n    786 S.W.2d 854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 858-59 (Ky. 1989) );\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10015784,10015611\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/786/854/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 2718 (\"Construing the[ ] facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, Simms's reference to 'Printer-gate' imputed criminal conduct-theft-to Plaintiffs.\")) The jury was tasked with deciding whether the \"Printer-gate\" reference \"was reasonably understood by persons who heard it as accusing the plaintiffs of criminal theft.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (D.N. 167, PageID # 3519)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Charter observes that \"multiple witnesses who attended the presentation testified that they did not understand the term to suggest anything criminal at all.\" (D.N. 183-1, PageID # 4373) It cites the\n   testimony of current Charter employees Mike Barnard, Sandi Streicher, and Theo Carney defining \"Printer-gate\" as they understood it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Charter acknowledges, however, that two witnesses who attended the meeting-Samantha Little and James Eversole-testified that they understood the term to imply that Plaintiffs had stolen from the company. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 4373-74) Contrary to Charter's representation, Little did not merely \"testif[y] vaguely that the term 'insinuates that some type of illegal activity had been performed' \" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 4374); she also testified that she interpreted it as referring to theft.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (D.N. 172, PageID # 3661-62) And Eversole, in addition to his statement that the presentation \"kind of compar[ed] [Plaintiffs] to gambling and murder\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 3677), stated that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   the message that was given during the summit didn't really filter into the conversations that were afterward. Those particular conversations were like, oh, well,\n   <em>\n    that was the time that we fired a bunch of people because they stole equipment.\n   </em>\n   Like don't do it, like don't take anything from the company.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 3677-78 (emphasis added)) Thus, both Little and Eversole provided testimony supporting the jury's verdict.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Charter next asserts that Little's testimony cannot support the verdict because \"the vague inference of illegal activity that Little drew from the presentation depended entirely on coupling \"Printer-gate\" with the two other incidents mentioned in the same presentation (Green-light and Buzz-kill)\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   upon knowledge of what those incidents involved.\" (D.N. 183-1, PageID # 4374) According to Charter, \"Kentucky courts long ago decided that merely mentioning an incident involving the plaintiff in the same context as incidents involving illegal conduct cannot be treated as implying that [the] plaintiff engaged in some illegality.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The single case it cites in support of this contention,\n   <em>\n    Boyd v. Hutton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4569895\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ky/196/512/\">\n    196 Ky. 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=244%20S.W.%20880\">\n    244 S.W. 880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1922), made no such proclamation and involved starkly different facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff alleged that he was defamed by a 1920 newspaper report, clearly offensive by today's standards, that read: \"Last Thursday night there were lots of fireworks in Harrodsburg. Jim Boyd, colored, claimed that someone shot him through an open window while he was reading, or lacing his shoes. The shots covered nearly all of his entire body.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=244%20S.W.%20880\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=244%20S.W.%20880\">\n    at 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The report appeared under the same headline-\"Shootings in Town\"-as reports that another person had \"shot at a\n   chicken thief the same night\" and a third person \"shot at a prowler on his premises.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=244%20S.W.%20880\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Boyd argued that \"the reporting of the three news items in one article was intended to connect him with one of the other two shootings, and did in fact impute to him conduct of a disgraceful or degrading nature.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=244%20S.W.%20880\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In a four-paragraph opinion affirming the directed verdict in favor of the defendant, the court found Boyd's \"construction of the article ... to be wholly fanciful, for it certainly is not warranted by any fair interpretation of the publication itself.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=244%20S.W.%20880\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court finds Charter's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   curious in light of the case's historical context; given this context, and the opinion's limited analysis, it has little precedential value. In any event, the facts are clearly distinguishable from those at issue here. Simms's presentation explicitly linked \"Printer-gate\" to the drug and embezzlement incidents, describing them as \"[a]ll examples of poor judgment\" in which the individuals involved \"made the wrong choices.\" (D.N. 90-3, PageID # 1984) Moreover, as discussed above, there was testimony that some Charter employees who attended the presentation construed the \"Printer-gate\" reference as imputing criminal conduct to Plaintiffs; in\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   , there was apparently no testimony beyond the plaintiff's own.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=244%20S.W.%20880\">\n    244 S.W. at 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In short,\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   does not preclude consideration of the context in which the \"Printer-gate\" reference was made-indeed, even Charter has acknowledged that allegedly defamatory words \"\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be evaluated in context.\" (D.N. 94, PageID # 2187)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs and drawing all reasonable inferences in their favor, the Court concludes that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Definition of Defamation Per Se\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Charter's overarching argument is that the \"Printer-gate\" reference in Simms's presentation cannot constitute defamation per se because it requires consideration of extrinsic circumstances. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.N. 183-1, PageID # 4373-86) The definition of defamation per se has been a point of contention throughout this case, despite the Kentucky Supreme Court and Court of Appeals' numerous declarations that a statement falsely imputing crime-particularly theft-constitutes defamation per se.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stringer v.

(D.N. 183-1, PageID # 4386) Those elements, as set out in the criminal pattern instruction, are (1) that Plaintiffs took property that belonged to Charter; (2) that in so doing, they knew the property was not their own and were not acting under a claim of right to it; and (3) that in taking the property, Plaintiffs intended to deprive Charter of it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1 Cetrulo, Kentucky Instructions to Juries \u00a7 6.19 (2018); Ky.

(D.N. 173, PageID # 4064-66) In fact, Charter's company representative, Mike Barnard, testified unequivocally that Plaintiffs \"did not have the intent to steal\" and did not steal from Charter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 4001) Each of the plaintiffs testified that there was nothing surreptitious about their taking of the printers; some testified that they didn't even need or want the printers but accepted them at Showalter's repeated urging. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.N. 155, PageID # 3323; D.N. 156, PageID # 3351; D.N. 171, PageID # 3628, 3636; D.N. 172, PageID # 3739, 3743, 3791, 3807-09, 3843) All testified that they believed Showalter's distribution of the printers was authorized by management. (D.N. 155, PageID # 3322, 3327; D.N. 156, PageID # 3362; D.N. 171, PageID # 3630, 3638; D.N. 172, PageID # 3738-39, 3748, 3796-97, 3802-04, 3820, 3836-37)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Charter nevertheless argues that \"there was ... ample evidence from which the jury could have concluded that the Plaintiffs knew that they did not have legitimate permission to take company property, and that they did so anyway.\" (D.N. 183-1, PageID # 4387) In support, it first points to various Charter policies and Plaintiffs' acknowledgment that they failed to independently seek authorization from a manager before accepting the printers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 4387-88) According to Charter, \"Plaintiffs' decisions\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to follow known procedures provides evidence that Plaintiffs knew they did not have authorization to take company property and it could give rise to a reasonable inference that Plaintiffs did not ask for authorization because they knew they would not like the answer they would get.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 4388) Such an inference is not reasonable, however, in light of the overwhelming evidence-including from Charter's own representative-that Plaintiffs lacked criminal intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Charter next asserts that Showalter lacked either actual or apparent authority to distribute the printers because \"[n]one of the Plaintiffs testified that a manager at Charter suggested to them that Ms. Showalter had authority to give away the printers.\" (D.N. 183-1, PageID\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   # 4388) Whether the evidence establishes apparent authority as a matter of Kentucky agency law is of little relevance, however. It is now undisputed that Showalter was not authorized to distribute the printers. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D.N. 172, PageID # 3800) The fact that she may have lacked legal authority says nothing about Plaintiffs' state of mind, i.e., whether Plaintiffs \"knew the [printers] w[ere] not their own\" and thus intended to steal them. 1 Cetrulo, Kentucky Instructions to Juries \u00a7 6.19. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.N. 183-1, PageID # 4387 (acknowledging dispute as to \"whether Plaintiffs knew that the printers were not legitimately being transferred to their ownership\")) Meanwhile, Plaintiffs' testimony that they believed Showalter was authorized to give them the printers fits neatly into Kentucky's \"claim of right\" defense to theft, which applies if the defendant \"had the permission, or believed he had the permission, of [the victim] or some other person authorized to give permission to take the property.\" 1 Cetrulo, Kentucky Instructions to Juries \u00a7 11.35;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 514.020(1)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Charter's final assertion, that \"there was evidence that Plaintiffs knew their conduct was improper, because they\n   <em>\n    lied\n   </em>\n   about how they got the printers to make their actions appear legitimate,\" likewise barely warrants discussion. (D.N. 183-1, PageID # 4388) As evidence of Plaintiffs' purported dishonesty, Charter cites an exhibit attached to each plaintiff's interrogatory answers that characterized the printers as having been \"apparently passed out as part of an incentive program with the knowledge of management.\" (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , D.N. 89-14, PageID # 3143) Plaintiffs did not, as Charter implies, admit to \"fabricati[ng]\" that statement (D.N. 183-1, PageID # 4389); rather, they merely acknowledged that they did not receive the printers through an incentive program. A generic exhibit attached to discovery responses, drafted by counsel as part of litigation and with the qualifier \"apparently,\" hardly constitutes the sort of \"evidence that one has attempted to cover up a crime\" that would serve as \"circumstantial proof of one's consciousness of guilt.\" (D.N. 183-1, PageID # 4388 n.19 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Collins v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   , No. 2008-SC-000107-MR,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%202471839\">\n    2010 WL 2471839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (Ky. June 17, 2010) )) Charter further misrepresents the record when it claims, citing the testimony of Kruti Desai and Gale Parkerson, that \"Plaintiffs admitted that management had not actually been informed of the printer-distribution scheme\" (D.N. 183-1, PageID # 4389): Desai acknowledged that she\n   <em>\n    now\n   </em>\n   knows that managers were not aware that she had taken printers (D.N. 172, PageID # 3776), while Gale Parkerson agreed that Charter ultimately determined that Showalter lacked authority to distribute the printers (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 3800).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In sum, there was insufficient evidence for the jury to reasonably find that Plaintiffs intended to steal the printers, and the Court thus did not err in granting judgment as a matter of law on the issue of truth. Charter is not entitled to a new trial on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Qualified Privilege\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Charter next argues that it should have been permitted to assert the defense of qualified privilege. (D.N. 183-1, PageID # 4389-98) Charter sought leave to amend its answer to assert qualified privilege after the deadline for amendment of pleadings had passed. (D.N. 48) Magistrate Judge Dave Whalin denied the motion (D.N. 59), and the Court overruled Charter's objection to that ruling. (D.N. 81) In its post-trial motion, Charter argues for the first time that amendment was not required, and it again challenges the denial of its request to amend. (D.N. 183-1, PageID # 4389-95)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Necessity of Amendment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Charter characterized qualified privilege as an affirmative defense in its motion for leave to amend. (D.N. 48, PageID # 333 (seeking \"leave to amend its Answer to assert an additional affirmative defense\")) Nothing in that motion or the supporting memorandum indicated uncertainty as to whether amendment was necessary in order to assert the privilege. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%202471839\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; D.N. 48-1) Indeed, Charter pursued untimely amendment with remarkable determination, renewing the motion before its objection to the magistrate judge's ruling on the first motion had been resolved and again during trial. (D.N. 61; D.N. 149) Now, however, Charter contends that amendment was unnecessary because Plaintiffs were on notice all along that Charter intended to rely on this defense and would not have been prejudiced by its addition. Charter further suggests that Plaintiffs bore the burden of proving the absence of privilege regardless of Charter's pleading. (D.N. 183-1, PageID # 4390)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

The Court rejects Charter's suggestion that qualified privilege is not an affirmative defense under Kentucky law. While Charter appears to be correct that \"no Kentucky case has ever definitively held that qualified privilege must be affirmatively pled\" (D.N. 183-1, PageID # 4393), the existing caselaw strongly indicates that qualified privilege is an affirmative defense. For example, in the case primarily relied on by Charter, the Kentucky Court of Appeals acknowledged that the plaintiff's argument \"that privilege is an affirmative defense which ... must be pled or lost\" would have been meritorious had the facts of the case not warranted an exception to that rule.\n   <em>\n    Columbia Sussex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9961730\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/627/270/#p274\">\n    627 S.W.2d at 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   As evidence that Plaintiffs bore the burden of proving that no privilege existed, Charter also points to\n   <em>\n    Toler\n   </em>\n   and other Kentucky cases in which the court listed \"unprivileged publication\" as an element of defamation. (D.N. 183-1, PageID # 4390) Those elements come from the Restatement.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Toler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6875004\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/458/276/#p285\">\n    458 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   282 n.9 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 558 ).

Nevertheless, it maintains that \"Plaintiffs plainly were on notice that Charter intended to pursue\" a qualified-privilege defense because of correspondence they received from Charter's counsel in the summer of 2015.

(D.N. 183-1, PageID # 4394) (\"Plaintiffs failed to identify\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   specific discovery that they were not able to pursue.... [The magistrate judge] did not point to a\n   <em>\n    single\n   </em>\n   example of discovery that Plaintiffs had not pursued.... The Court concluded that there was prejudice solely on the basis that Plaintiffs '\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have reasonably assumed that [Charter] had decided not to pursue this defense.' \" (final alteration in original) (quoting D.N. 81, PageID # 1429);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D.N. 188, PageID # 4555-56) The Court thus concludes that Charter waived the defense of qualified privilege by failing to assert it in a responsive pleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Denial of Amendment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The deadline for amendment of pleadings, as agreed by the parties, was July 24, 2015. (D.N. 22, PageID # 129) Because Charter did not seek leave to amend its answer until nearly five months after that deadline, it was first required to show \"good cause\" to amend the scheduling order under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leary v.

Thus, despite Charter's attempts to place the burden on Plaintiffs to show that they were not prejudiced by its delay in seeking amendment, its failure to provide any excuse for the delay is largely dispositive: ultimately, \"prejudice to [the nonmoving party] is merely a consideration that informs whether [the movant] has satisfied the 'good cause' requirement of the\n   <em>\n    Leary\n   </em>\n   standard.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Korn v.

Privilege-or rather, the absence thereof-was not an essential element of Plaintiffs' case,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Part II.C.1.a; they thus were not otherwise obligated to pursue discovery on that topic. The fact that evidence relevant to existing claims and defenses may also have been relevant to qualified privilege does not mean that Plaintiffs had all the discovery they wanted or needed to rebut a privilege defense. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.N. 186, PageID # 4490) Furthermore, Charter disclosed a list of 67 potential witnesses-Charter employees who attended the leadership conference-just days before it sought leave to amend and only a few weeks before the discovery deadline. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.N. 53, PageID # 383; D.N. 186, PageID # 4490-91) As the Court noted in a previous decision, \"[P]laintiffs understandably view this as a strategic move connected to the last-minute attempt to assert qualified privilege and designed to give Charter an unfair advantage\" (D.N. 81, PageID # 1429), either by delaying the trial or by preventing Plaintiffs from deposing those witnesses altogether. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.N. 186, PageID # 4490-91) Because Charter's belated amendment, if allowed, would likely have required extension of the discovery deadline for additional, costly discovery so that Plaintiffs could attempt to rebut the qualified-privilege defense, the prejudice consideration also disfavors amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Newburgh/Six Mile\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4127815\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/483/85/#p94\">\n    483 F.

An inexplicable oversight or strategic error on Charter's part, however, does not justify altering the litigation schedule\n   or depriving Plaintiffs of necessary discovery in disregard of Sixth Circuit law and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Given Charter's failure to assert qualified privilege in its answer, a timely amended answer, or a motion to dismiss, it is reasonable to conclude that omission of the defense earlier in the case was intentional. Yet Charter now essentially asks the Court to allow it the benefit of hindsight-to benefit both from asserting the defense, and from not asserting it. Charter is not entitled to a new trial on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

The loss of reputation in\n   <em>\n    Boris\n   </em>\n   arose out of insurance claims\n   falsely attributed to the plaintiff on a claims-history report prepared by the defendant, and the only evidence the Court could identify to support business-reputation damages was the plaintiff's testimony that two insurance companies \"turned her down when she requested insurance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9343374\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/249/851/#p860\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9343374\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/249/851/#p860\">\n    at 861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is a significant difference between being assigned an inaccurate insurance-claim history on a credit report and being implicitly labeled a thief in front of dozens of former colleagues.

There was no evidence that anyone other than the recipient ever saw or heard about it. And even if it had been publicized, the reference to \"Printer-gate\" during Simms's presentation could have been construed as confirmation that the company considered Plaintiffs to have stolen the printers. Because the compensatory-damages award is supported by the evidence, that portion of the jury's verdict will not be set aside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

This is the doctrine which distinguishes between words (such as, \"You are a thief\") which convey a defamatory meaning on their face, and, on the other hand, words of veiled detraction whose offense is apparent only when the context and circumstances are revealed. The former are sometimes said to be defamatory \"per se\" or slanderous \"per se\" or libelous \"per se,\" whereas the latter, to be properly pleaded, must have an accompanying \"innuendo\" or explanation. Clearly this requirement has no relationship to the other rule, that certain slanders are and others are not actionable without a showing of special damage, but the use of the phrase \"per se\" in both connections has produced confusion, and we find many American courts adopting the practice of requiring, in cases where the defamation, whether slander or libel, must be explained by an \"innuendo\" to reveal its defamatory meaning, that special damages be also pleaded. This is foreign to the common-law tradition, and adds an additional complexity to a subject already overburdened with rules....\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    Charles T.
