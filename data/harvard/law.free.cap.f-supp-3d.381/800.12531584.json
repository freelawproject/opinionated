Cox, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Terrance Kellom was shot and killed when a United States Marshal Detroit\n   Fugitive Apprehension Team was attempting to arrest him at a house in Detroit, Michigan on April 27, 2015. Thereafter, his Estate and his relatives filed this action, asserting multiple claims against several Defendants. A number of claims have since been dismissed. Following the close of discovery, Defendants filed summary judgment motions as to the remaining claims. The parties have fully briefed the issues and the Court heard oral argument on May 2, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As explained below, the Court shall GRANT the City of Detroit Defendants' summary judgment motion to the extent the Court rules that: 1) Defendants Eaton and Fitzgerald are entitled to qualified immunity as to the\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   excessive force claims asserted against them in Count I; 2) the\n   <em>\n    Steagald\n   </em>\n   claims in Count VII are only cognizable as\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims, not \u00a7 1983 claims, because the officers were acting under federal and not state law, and they only remain as to the officers in their individual capacities; 3) Defendants Eaton and Fitzgerald (and Quinn) are entitled to qualified immunity as to the\n   <em>\n    Steagald\n   </em>\n   claims asserted in Count VII; and 4) the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   liability count, Count VIII, fails as a matter of law because there is no basis for imposing municipal liability in this action that has no viable \u00a7 1983 claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In addition, the Court shall GRANT the summary judgment motion filed by the United States because the Court concludes that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the Estate's Federal Tort Claims Act claims in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Finally, the Court shall GRANT IN PART AND DENY IN PART the summary judgment motion filed by Defendant Quinn. The Court grants the motion to the extent that the Court rules that Defendant Quinn is entitled to qualified immunity as to the\n   <em>\n    Steagald\n   </em>\n   claims asserted by Kevin and Teria Kellom. The motion is DENIED as to the Estate's excessive force claim, asserted under\n   <em>\n    Bivens,\n   </em>\n   in Count I. As to that claim, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendant Quinn committed a constitutional violation by virtue of having used excessive force. That claim shall proceed to a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 6, 2017, Plaintiff Nelda Kellom, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Terrance Kellom, Deceased (\"the Estate\"), filed this action. The Estate's original complaint named the following Defendants: 1) Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agent Mitchell Quinn; 2) Detroit Police Officer Darell Fitzgerald; and 3) Detroit Police Officer Treva Eaton. Plaintiff's original complaint included the following four counts: 1) \"\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   Claim\" (Count I); 2) \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - Excessive Force and/or Unlawful Use of Deadly Force\" (Count II); 3) \" \u00a7 1983 Conspiracy by Defendants\" (Count III); and 4) \"Wrongful Death [under] Michigan Wrongful Death Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20600.2922\">\n    Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 600.2922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   ,\" (Count IV).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 16, 2018, Plaintiff's Counsel filed a motion seeking leave to file an amended complaint. Thereafter, Defendants filed responses indicating that, while they do not concede that the claims asserted against them are valid and that they may file motions challenging the claims asserted against them, they do not oppose the motion to amend. Thus, on May 3, 2018, the Court issued an order granting leave to file a First Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 4, 2018, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint which added named parties and claims. In addition to the Estate, seven of the Decedent's family members asserted claims in Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint. Those \"Non-Estate\n   Plaintiffs\" included: 1) the Decedent's mother in her individual capacity (Nelda Kellom); 2) the Decedent's father, Kevin Kellom; 3) the Decedent's two adult sisters (Teria Kellom and Lawanda Kellom) and his adult brother (Terrell Kellom); and 4) the Decedent's two minor children, joined in the lawsuit through their mother and personal representative, Janay Williams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The First Amended Complaint included the following eight counts: 1) a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   excessive force claim (Count I); 2) a \u00a7 1983 excessive force claim (Count II); 3) a \u00a7 1985 conspiracy claim (Count III); 4) a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   conspiracy claim (Count IV); 5) a wrong death claim under Michigan law (Count V); 6) a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress under Michigan law (Count VI); 7) a\n   <em>\n    Steagald\n   </em>\n   claim (Count VII); and 8) a \u00a7 1983\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   liability claim (Count VIII).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties later agreed that the United States would be substituted for Defendants Eaton and Fitzgerald at to Counts V and VI. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In May of 2018, Defendants filed motions to dismiss. In an Opinion and Order issued on August 29, 2018, this Court: 1) dismissed Count VII against the United States because the United States has not waived sovereign immunity as to alleged violations of the Constitution; 2) dismissed Counts V and VI without prejudice, as to the \"Non-Estate Plaintiffs\" because they failed to exhaust administrative remedies prior to filing Federal Tort Claims Act claims against the United States; 3) dismissed Count IV (the\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   Conspiracy claim) because that claim is not cognizable as to the Estate, as the First Amended Complaint expressly alleges that the conspiracy began\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the Decedent's death; 4) dismissed all \"Non-Estate Plaintiffs\" from all remaining counts, except Count VII, because they lack standing to assert those claims, because unlike the Estate they cannot assert a claim based on a violation of the Decedent's constitutional rights; 5) dismissed Counts II and VIII as to Eaton and Fitzgerald as Plaintiffs agreed that should be done; 6) dismissed Count III for failure to identify a racial or other class-based invidious or discriminatory animus underlying the alleged conspirators actions; 7) dismissed any claims asserted against Chief Craig in his individual capacity because the First Amended Complaint includes no allegations as to his personal involvement, and because Plaintiffs' Counsel stated during oral argument that no claims are brought against Craig in his individual capacity; and 8) dismissed Count VIII (the municipal liability claim) against officers Eaton and Fitzgerald because, as Plaintiffs' Counsel agreed during oral argument, there is no basis for a municipal liability claim against them. (ECF No. 52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following the close of discovery, Defendants filed summary judgment motions as to the remaining claims in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As to the City of Detroit Defendants, there are three counts that remain as to them: 1) the\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   excessive force claim (Count I), asserted against Defendants Eaton and Fitzgerald; 2) the\n   <em>\n    Steagald\n   </em>\n   claims asserted by Kevin and Teria Kellom against Defendants Eaton and Fitzgerald (Count VII); and the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   liability count, asserted against Chief Craig and the City of Detroit (Count VIII). The pending motion seeks summary judgment as to all of those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As to the United States, the following claims remain against it in this action: 1) the Estate's Wrongful Death claim under Michigan law (in place of Quinn, Eaton, and Fitzgerald); and 2) the Estate's Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress claim under Michigan law (in place of Quinn, Eaton, and Fitzgerald). The United\n   States seeks summary judgment in its favor as to both counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Finally, as to Defendant Quinn, the following claims remain against him: 1) the\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   excessive force claim asserted in Count I; and 2) Kevin and Teria Kellom's\n   <em>\n    Steagald\n   </em>\n   claims in Count VII. Quinn filed his own summary judgment motion, seeking summary judgment in his favor as to both claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After the motions were fully\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   briefed by the parties, the Court heard oral argument on all three of the summary judgment motions on May 2, 2019.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The following material facts are gleaned from the evidence submitted by the parties,\n   <em>\n    viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs\n   </em>\n   , the non-moving party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On April 27, 2015, the United States Marshals Service's Detroit Fugitive Apprehension Team (\"DFAT\"), including Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agent Mitchell Quinn (\"Quinn\"), and City of Detroit Police Officers Darell Fitzgerald (\"Fitzgerald\") and Treva Eaton (\"Eaton\") was conducting an investigation as to the whereabouts of Terrance Kellom. (Defs.' &amp; Pls.' Stmts. at \u00b6 6). \"Terrance Kellom was wanted on an arrest warrant for armed robbery and for a weapons offense.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On the date of the incident, Terrance Kellom was 20 years old and weighed 145 pounds. (Autopsy Report, Ex. B to Pls.' Br.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Officers on the DFAT conducted an investigation, in order to locate Terrance Kellom. Fitzgerald's Report of Investigation indicates that on April 27, 2015, he and other officers first went to the Terry Street address in Detroit, Michigan that was listed on Terrance Kellom's driver's license. (ECF No. 79-12). There, they spoke with a woman who stated that she was a new tenant at that address, and that she had never seen or heard of Terrance Kellom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Then, based on contacts that Terrance Kellom had while at a correctional facility, the officers learned the name and address of Terrance's girlfriend, Janay Williams, who lived on Princeton Street in Detroit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). While Fitzgerald was en route to that address, another team member, Brian Behrend, advised that there was a black male fitting the description of Terrance Kellom walking out the front door at the Princeton Street address, with an unknown black female who was sweeping glass from around a green Impala. Once officers arrived there, they spoke with Janay Williams and Adrienne Williams. Adrienne told the officers that Terrance Kellom had broken the window to her vehicle and that Terrance might be staying with his father on Evergreen. Janay made statements confirming that she was Terrance's girlfriend, and told the officers that when Terrance left he was angry and told her he was going to burn her house down. Janay, who the officers spoke with separately, told them that Terrance was staying with his father on Evergreen. Janay added that Terrance drove a four door Ford Taurus with a green sticker in the rear window. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Eaton then established surveillance at the home on Evergreen and advised the\n   team that Terrance Kellom was seen entering and exiting the house and that his car was parked in the driveway. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendant Eaton continued surveilling the house on Evergreen, and saw Terrance Kellom enter the house again and remain inside. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Eaton Dep. at 36-37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The decision was made to approach the house in an attempt to make contact with Terrance Kellom. (Behrend Decl. at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The officers had an arrest warrant for Terrance Kellom but did not have a search warrant for the home on Evergreen Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Eaton testified that she believed that Terrance Kellom lived at the house on Evergreen and, therefore, the officers could enter the house because they had an arrest warrant for Terrance, who was inside the house:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Q. So for all intents and purposes when you went to the Evergreen address, you thought that Mr. Kellom lived at that address?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Q. So if you're armed with an arrest warrant and you believe that Mr. Kellom lived at that address, did you believe that you don't need a search warrant?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   MR.

Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Q. - is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Is there any reason why you didn't just sit there and wait until the judge or magistrate entered a search warrant?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   MR.

Kevin heard a pop, pop, pop, as shots were fired. Kevin saw the shots strike Terrance, and saw his body jerk. Terrance backed up as he was shot. Terrance fell to his knees. More shots were fired after that. Kevin stated that Terrance did not have anything in his hands when he was shot and that his hands were upwards and open. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27-28 &amp; 37). After the shooting, Kevin heard a female officer say out loud, \"Why did he shoot?

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31). Kevin told his son to \"lay it on down\" (ie., go with the officers). His son shrugged his shoulders and said \"but dad,\" when Kevin suddenly heard the \"pop, pop, pop\" of shots ring out. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33). Kevin testified that Terrance was in the hallway and Kevin was still in the dining room when the shooting occurred.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Kevin testified that the hammer photographed at the scene had not been in the house and he does not know how it got in the house.

They claim that Quinn descended the stairs, hoping to catch Terrance where he would land on the first floor. (Defs.' Br. at 9). Quinn testified that Terrance came out of the back, left bedroom, that had a blanket draped where a door would normally be, holding a hammer and approaching him aggressively. Quinn ordered Terrance to drop the hammer but he did not comply. Quinn testified he shot Terrance once or twice, to protect himself and fellow officers, hoping that Terrance would stop coming towards him. Quinn testified that Terrance kept advancing towards him, making him question whether he was hitting him with his shots because he did not stop.

While the Court ordinarily accepts the facts alleged by the nonmovant as true, Kevin's self-serving claim that he did not consent is not entitled to such deference in light of his inconsistent statement made at the time of the shooting, and thus the Court should dismiss Count VII against Quinn.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bruederle\n   </em>\n   , 687 F.3d at 779 ) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Chappell\n   </em>\n   , 585 F.3d at 906 ) (\"The court is not obliged to, and indeed should not, rely on the nonmovant's version of the facts where it is 'so utterly discredited by the record' as to be rendered a 'visible fiction.' \").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-342\">\n   (Quinn's Br. at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-343\">\n   As Plaintiffs' response brief notes, Quinn has selectively quoted portions of Kevin Kellom's statement, such that it does not\n   show the full context of his testimony as to the entry by the officers. Notably, in his statement, Kevin Kellom stated that the officers who came to his door told him to \"open the motherfucking door or I'm going to tear it down,\" and that after he asked if they had a search warrant, the officers directed him to \"Open your door, sir\" and he then opened the door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-344\">\n   Kevin Kellom's deposition testimony was consistent in that he testified he did not give consent for the officers to enter the house and that he asked if they had a search warrant. He testified that the officers never asked him for consent to enter and that he did not tell them they could enter the home. It is somewhat inconsistent in that, in his statement, Kevin Kellom said that he opened the door when directed to do so and in his deposition, three years later, he testified that one of the officers \"snatched\" the door open.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-345\">\n   Nevertheless, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the Court concludes that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Kevin Kellom consented to the officers entering his home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-346\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

It is undisputed that Officer Eaton conducted surveillance at the Evergreen House prior to the search on April 27, 2015 and personally observed Terrance Kellom enter the house and remain inside. Thus, all of the officers on the DFAT had a reasonable basis for believing that Terrance Kellom could be found inside the house at the time of entry on April 27, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-373\">\n   Accordingly, the Court agrees with Defendants that Kevin and Teria Kellom cannot establish that a constitutional violation occurred.

Eaton and Fitzgerald assert that, regardless of the outcome of the excessive force claim against Quinn, they are entitled to qualified immunity because they are only liable for their own conduct and the undisputed evidence reflects that they had no opportunity to intervene to prevent the shooting. As such, they assert they committed no constitutional violation and are therefore entitled to qualified immunity as to Count I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-378\">\n   The Court agrees that Eaton and Fitzgerald are entitled to qualified immunity as to the excessive force claims asserted against them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-379\">\n   \"Liability for excessive force requires a showing that the defendant either (1) actively participated in the use of excessive force, (2) supervised the officer who used excessive force, or (3) owed the victim a duty of protection against the use of excessive force.\"\n   <em>\n    Pennington\n   </em>\n   , 644 F.

Thus, the Estate's response brief does not direct the Court to any evidence that could establish a constitutional violation by Eaton or Fitzgerald for having failed to prevent any excessive force used by Quinn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-385\">\n   At the hearing, the Estate's Counsel failed to direct the Court to evidence that could establish that either Eaton or Fitzgerald had reason to know that Defendant Quinn was going to shoot or that either officer had the opportunity or means to prevent the shooting. Rather, counsel suggested that Eaton and Fitzgerald could have waited for a search warrant before entering the house. Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of establishing that Defendants Eaton and Fitzgerald are not entitled to qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-386\">\n   Moreover, Defendants, have directed the Court to evidence that supports their position on this issue. Kevin Kellom testified that the events \"happened so quick,\" and unfolded in a matter of seconds. (Kevin Kellom Dep. at 57; Kevin Kellom Interview at 54-55). Kevin Kellom also testified that the officer who shot his son did so without any kind of warning that he was about to do so:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-387\">\n   Q. Before the officer shot did he say anything or give any warning?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-388\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-389\">\n   Q. As far as you can tell he just walked into the house and shot?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-390\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-391\">\n   (Kevin Kellom Dep. at 45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-392\">\n   Kevin Kellom also testified that Quinn shot his son while Terrance Kellom was in the downstairs hallway. It is undisputed that \"[a]t all times during the DFAT presence inside the home, Officer Fitzgerald remained in the living room, monitoring Teria and Kevin Kellom. (ECF No. 104 at PageID.2626; ECF No. 107 at PageID2747).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-393\">\n   Eaton testified that she was on the front porch when she heard the shots and then saw Terrance Kellom in the downstairs hallway as he was shot and fell to his knees. (Eaton Dep. at 50-52). She testified that there was just a slight pause between the initial shot and the remaining shots. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55). Eaton did not come back in the house until after the shots had ended. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-394\">\n   Thus, neither Fitzgerald nor Eaton were even in the same room as Quinn and Terrance Kellom just before or at the time of the shooting. Thus, the Court shall grant summary judgment in favor of Eaton and Fitzgerald as to the Estate's excessive force claims against them because they are entitled to qualified immunity as to those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-395\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendant Quinn\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-396\">\n   As to the excessive force claim asserted against him, Quinn's motion asks the Court to grant summary judgment in his favor because he did not use excessive force when he defended himself from the attack of a dangerous fugitive. In making this argument, Quinn asserts that: 1) the evidence establishes that he reasonably\n   acted in self defense; 2) the case law supports granting summary judgment as to Quinn; 3) the deposition testimony of Kevin Kellom and Teria Kellom should be discredited because of their inconsistencies, implausibility, and lack of corroborating evidence; and 4) courts have granted summary judgment to\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   and \u00a7 1983 defendants in similar scenarios where the plaintiff's testimony was discredited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-397\">\n   The only way this Court could grant summary judgment in favor of Defendant Quinn on this claim is if this Court discredits the testimony of Kevin Kellom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-398\">\n   Again, the parties have divergent versions of the facts. The officers have testified that Terrance was located hiding in the second floor attic crawl space and refused to come out peacefully, shouting things like \"shoot me, bitch,\" \"I have a gun,\" and \"You're gonna have to kill me.\" Defendant Quinn contends that Terrance had a hammer and was tearing a hole through the attic floor, so that he could escape from the attic crawl space by going through that hole and dropping down onto the main floor. Quinn's motion asserts that Quinn descended the stairs, hoping to catch Terrance where he would land on the first floor. (Defs.' Br. at 9). Quinn testified that Terrance came out of the back, left bedroom, that had a blanket draped where a door would normally be, holding a hammer and approaching him aggressively. Quinn ordered Terrance to drop the hammer but he did not comply. Quinn testified he shot Terrance once or twice, to protect himself and fellow officers, hoping that Terrance would stop coming towards him. Quinn testified that Terrance kept advancing towards him, making him question whether he was hitting him with his shots because he did not stop. (Quinn Dep. at 111-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-399\">\n   Quinn's motion contends that \"[a]ll of the physical evidence in this case corroborates the account of Quinn and his fellow DFAT officers. For example, the pictures show (1) the damage to the attic ductwork, attic floor, and closet ceiling; (2) the blanket on the floor near the back left bedroom; and (3) the hammer near where Terrance fell to the floor - all of which bolster Quinn's version of the events.\" (Defs.' Br. at 10-11). The motion further states that: 1) there is a video, during an interview with Kevin Kellom, that shows a hole in the floor large enough for a man to go through (ie., the \"Charlie LeDuff Video\"); 2) that forensic testing show fibers on Terrance's clothes matched fibers from the drywall and insulation at the house; and 3) the autopsy noted Terrance had abrasions on his body that would be consistent with him dropping down through the ceiling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-400\">\n   Quinn's motion contends that the deposition testimony of Kevin Kellom (and Teria Kellom) should be entirely discredited because of their inconsistencies, implausibility, and lack of corroborating evidence. (Defs.' Br. at 14). He asserts that the \"Court should not rely on Kevin and Teria Kellom's version of the shooting because they have no evidence other than their testimony, and that testimony is implausible on its face and is utterly discredited by the record, including by their own previous statements.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-401\">\n   In so asserting, Defendants direct the Court to\n   <em>\n    Bruederle v. Louisville Metro Gov't\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5866111\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/687/771/#p779\">\n    687 F.3d 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 779 (6th Cir. 2012) and\n   <em>\n    Chappell v.

App'x 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 538 (6th Cir. 2016) (explaining that while the court is generally required to adopt the plaintiff's version of the facts, that is not so when the plaintiff's version is \"blatantly contradicted by the record,\" and noting that \"exception most commonly applies where the record contains a videotape depicting the disputed facts and contradicting one party's version of events.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-402\">\n   This Court does not believe this is one of those rare cases where the testimony of the plaintiff is so utterly contradictory, or so discredited by the record evidence, that the Court can simply discredit it for purposes of summary judgment. This is not a case where there is video evidence of the events, that expressly discredits the plaintiff's version of events. There is no video evidence of the shooting, or of any events that occurred inside the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-403\">\n   While there are some inconsistencies and differences between Kevin Kellom's statement given on the day of the event, and his deposition taken three years later, that is not that unusual, especially given the time gap. Moreover, his basic version of the key facts remains fairly consistent: once the officers and Terrance were downstairs in the hallway, Terrance was cussing at the officers but was not resisting. At the time he was shot by Quinn, Terrance had his hands upwards and open and he was not holding anything, including a hammer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-404\">\n   In addition, the versions of events are not so contradictory as to be totally discredited by the physical evidence. It appears that one of two things happened on the day of the shooting: 1) Terrance broke a hole in the attic crawl space and came through the floor to the downstairs bedroom, and then entered the hallway; or 2) Terrance came down the stairs with officers, and then entered the hallway. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Diagram of House, Defs.' Ex. 10). Regardless of how Terrance got downstairs, the key facts are what occurred while Terrance was in the hallway on the main floor, right before he was shot. If Terrance was not resisting, and had his hands up and open, and had no weapon, then a reasonable jury could find that Quinn used excessive force. Terrance could have come through the floor, leaving fibers on his clothes and abrasions on his body, and yet entered the hallway without a hammer, and had his hands upwards and open at the time he was shot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-405\">\n   For this Court to simply discredit all of Kevin Kellom's testimony would be for the Court to improperly make a credibility determination at the summary judgment stage. This is especially so in light of other evidence, such as Fitzgerald's deposition testimony, that when construed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, could support Kevin Kellom's testimony that Terrance was not wielding a hammer at the time he was shot. Defendant Quinn is not entitled to qualified immunity as to the Estate's excessive force claim against him. That claim shall proceed to a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-406\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

In the summary judgment motion filed by the United States, it challenges both of those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-413\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction Challenge To The Estate's FTCA Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-414\">\n   The Government asserts that the Estate's FTCA claims must be dismissed because the Estate did not exhaust its administrative remedies and this Court therefore lacks subject matter jurisdiction. The Government notes that the way the issue was briefed by the parties, at the motion-to-dismiss phase, the issue presented was whether the Estate's original complaint asserted FTCA claims against the United States. (Def.'s Br. at 2). The Government's motion asserts that \"by framing the issue in this manner, defendant United States inadvertently mischaracterized the jurisdictional issue\" and, in this motion, seeks to clarify and re-assert its jurisdictional argument. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-415\">\n   In response, Plaintiffs' brief complains that the Government is raising an issue that the Court has already considered. Plaintiffs assert that it is improper for the Government to raise this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-416\">\n   As the Government's reply brief notes, however, this is a challenge to the Court's\n   <em>\n    subject matter jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   . A challenge to subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time and can never be waived.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Herr v.

As such, the Court will consider this challenge to this Court's subject-matter jurisdiction over the FTCA claims in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-417\">\n   The way this issue unfolded at the motion-to-dismiss phase, the Court considered whether the Estate's original complaint asserted FTCA claim or named the United States as a Defendant:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-418\">\n   This Court agrees that if the original complaint filed by the Estate asserted a FTCA claim against the United States, then it would have been premature because it was filed on April 6, 2017, before the Estate had even filed its administrative claim. If such a premature complaint had been filed by the Estate, then the Estate would have to file a new lawsuit after the denial of its administrative complaint, not an amended complaint in this action. In addition, if that were the case, because the Estate's administrative denial occurred on February 1, 2018, a new lawsuit would have had to have been filed by the Estate by August 1, 2018. Accordingly, if the Estate's original complaint asserted a FTCA claim against the United States, the Court would have to dismiss this action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and, because August 1, 2018 has now passed, the Estate's wrongful death claim would be time-barred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-419\">\n   That brings us what appears to be the real issue - whether the Estate's original complaint asserted FTCA claims against the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-420\">\n   (ECF No. 52 at PageID.560). This Court then stated that while it was not aware of any Sixth Circuit cases directly on point as to this issue, a published Ninth Circuit case,\n   <em>\n    Valadez-Lopez v.

As such, this Court declined to dismiss the Estate's FTCA claims at the motion-to-dismiss phase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-421\">\n   The Government's current motion contends the inquiry before the Court is \"whether the Estate had exhausted its administrative remedies before the Attorney General first certified under the Westfall Act that the employee was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the alleged negligence.\" (Govt.'s Br. at 2). As explained below, the Government has now set forth a cogent argument, supported by on-point references to Sixth Circuit and Supreme Court authority, that the Estate failed to exhaust administrative remedies and, therefore, this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the FTCA claims asserted against the United States. The Government's current motion makes two critical points that change the outcome here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-422\">\n   Before getting to those two critical points, an overview of the relevant concepts is provided here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-423\">\n   Under the FTCA, lawsuits against governmental employees acting in their official capacities are treated as suits against the United States.\n   <em>\n    Kentucky v.

In\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth Circuit stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-429\">\n   [Plaintiff's] second amended complaint\n   <em>\n    included allegations of torts committed by governmental employees acting in their official capacities. [Plaintiff's] claims are cognizable, if at all, under the FTCA.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the district court properly applied FTCA law to its decisions regarding those claims. In particular, the district court found [Plaintiff] had not conformed to the administrative exhaustion requirement of the FTCA, under which he should have filed a claim with the appropriate federal agency and waited for the claim to be denied before filing suit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-430\">\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

App'x 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 458 (6th Cir. 2001) (emphasis added). The United States asserts that \"[a]s a result, the holding in\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   indicates that the Sixth Circuit considers any tort claim against a federal employee alleged to have occurred while the employee was on duty and performing his or her job duties to be an FTCA claim for purposes of administrative exhaustion, whether or not the plaintiff labeled it as such. Because this precedent conflicts with the Ninth Circuit's assumptions in\n   <em>\n    Valdez-Lopez\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Valadez-Lopez\n   </em>\n   ], this Court should follow\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   and not\n   <em>\n    Valdez-Lopez\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Valadez-Lopez\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   \" (Def.'s.

That complaint did not name the United States as a Defendant and did not reference the Federal Tort Claims Act. But it identified Defendant Quinn as a \"federal law enforcement agent employed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a federal agency organized and existing under the laws of the United States\" and expressly alleged that Quinn acted \"within the course and scope of his employment, and under color of federal law.\" (ECF No. 1 at PageID.4). The original complaint included a wrongful death claim against Quinn under Michigan law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-432\">\n   As such, the Estate's claim against Quinn in the original complaint was one under the FTCA, even though Plaintiffs' Counsel did not label it as such. It is undisputed that the Estate did not file an administrative claim prior to filing this action. Accordingly, the Estate's counsel filed this FTCA action prematurely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-433\">\n   <strong>\n    2.
