The plaintiffs are recreational and conservancy organizations whose members use and enjoy the Shenandoah River. They bring this action under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) to challenge EPA's approval of Virginia's 2016 impaired waters list, which did not identify any segments of the Shenandoah River as impaired for recreational use despite numerous complaints from the public of excessive algal growth. Before the Court are the plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment, Dkt. 43, defendant EPA's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment, Dkt. 47, and defendant-intervenor Virginia Association of Municipal Wastewater Agencies, Inc.'s (VAMWA's) Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment, Dkt. 45. For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant EPA's and VAMWA's motions and deny the plaintiffs' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Br. at 26-27, 33-34. But this challenge attacks a straw man. The plaintiffs assume that EPA used the \"complex\" and \"subjective\" nature of Virginia's narrative standard as an excuse not to apply it. But EPA did apply Virginia's narrative standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EPA0023105 (\"Virginia's record is clear that it evaluated the relevant information submitted in light of the water quality criterion language[.]\"); EPA0055922-23 (DEQ classified seven assessment units as Category 3C \"in light of the nature of the applicable water quality standard\"). It simply concluded that certain aspects of that standard required DEQ to collect more information before identifying any segments of the Shenandoah River as impaired under it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EPA0055923.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   As EPA explained, Virginia's narrative standard includes a subjective component that relies on the perceptions and experiences of individual river users.

The plaintiffs provided ample evidence that some users found the nature and extent of algae cover unsightly and odorous. But it was not evident to DEQ or EPA that these testimonials represented the views of river users as a whole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EPA0023104 (because the narrative water-quality criteria \"includes a subjective component based on the perception of river users,\" it is \"challenging to identify impairments in a manner that is consistently repeatable\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   As EPA explained in more detail when approving Virginia's 2012 list, \"EPA generally agrees that the views of users of a waterbody may be considered in determining whether the aesthetic enjoyment of the waterbody has been so impaired as to interfere with a designated recreational use.\" EPA0003782-83. But \"[d]ifferent individuals ... may have different tolerance levels for the presence of excess algal growth when engaged in recreational activities,\" and \"different individuals may consider different amounts of algae as interfering with their use and enjoyment of the River or as presenting a nuisance.\" EPA0003783. Because individuals might disagree about the appropriate level of algae, and how algae impacts their experience and uses of the river, it was reasonable for DEQ and EPA to capture a more complete picture of river users' impressions before identifying certain segments of the Shenandoah River as impaired.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EPA0003783 (explaining that over 370,000 people live near or use the Shenandoah River and expressing uncertainty over whether the 80 testimonials submitted by Shenandoah Riverkeeper in 2012 represented the views of river users as a whole).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Two basic facts about algae made it particularly important for DEQ and EPA to obtain a complete and accurate measure of river users' experiences before identifying segments of the Shenandoah as impaired. First, the presence of some algae is natural in a healthy river.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EPA0023264. Second, algal blooms come and go, making it difficult to assess the nature and extent of algal growth over time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EPA0058480 (\"The lengths of time that any problem algae growths exist and the locations where they are found are extremely hard to predict, because of changes in stream flow, temperature, sunlight, and any number of other factors can cause accumulations to form and be dispersed.\"); Pls.' Br. at 28 (\"[V]ariability is inherent in the issue\" of algal growth because \"algae are living species and the Shenandoah River is a living and varied environment.\"); Pls.' Br. at 33 (\"[A]lgae blooms are not uniform or stationary over a single growing season[.]\"). Because some amount of algae is healthy, and even excessive blooms might dissipate or shift over time, it was reasonable for EPA to defer to DEQ's decision to collect more information before identifying segments of the Shenandoah as impaired based on potentially unrepresentative anecdotal reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The Variability and Limitations of Available Algae Data\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The plaintiffs next attack EPA's reliance on the limitations of available algae data. But this argument, too, is unpersuasive. As already discussed, EPA reasonably deferred to DEQ's decision \"to not use\" the plaintiffs' data to make an impairment determination.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   III.B. And,\n   as discussed, algae is healthy in certain quantities and inherently variable, making it critical to obtain a complete and accurate picture of the scope and duration of algal growth before making conclusive impairment determinations.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   III.C.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The plaintiffs submitted extensive comments to Virginia's draft 2016 report, but DEQ and EPA acted reasonably in deciding that those comments were insufficient to support an impairment determination. For many assessment units, DEQ received few complaints, many of which were anecdotal and lacking in specificity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EPA0022594 (map of citizen comments showing large stretches with few complaints);\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , EPA0048181 (lacking specific spatial and temporal information); EPA0048249 (same); EPA0048259 (same). And it was not clear to DEQ whether each citizen commenter could distinguish between algae and other aquatic plants, or between harmful and safe kinds of algae.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EPA0023264-65. Further, many of the photographs submitted were of limited use because \"it is difficult to distinguish in aerial photographs\" between \"potentially impairing algal growth\" and \"beneficial submerged aquatic vegetation.\" EPA0020532 (discussing aerial photographs submitted in connection with Virginia's 2012 list). In addition, this data had to be weighed against the results of DEQ's own monitoring efforts, which revealed \"little to no algae throughout the 2016 growing season\" in many segments of the Shenandoah and only \"ephemeral\" algae \"dependent on multiple variables\" in the remaining segments. EPA0058720.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Despite these limitations, DEQ found the plaintiffs' data useful for classifying certain assessment units as Category 3C.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EPA0023104, EPA0058720. For these units, Shenandoah Riverkeeper \"submitted multiple types of information (photos, complaints and algal bottom cover data) in a manner that also provided spatial and temporal information.\" EPA0023104. While this more comprehensive data was still \"not of sufficient quality for use in the State's determinations for whether a water should be in Category 5,\" it justified prioritizing certain segments of the Shenandoah for follow-up monitoring \"so that additional data and information of sufficient quality c[ould] be collected to determine if th[ose] waters are impaired.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Given the variable nature of algal growth and the limitations of the citizen data submitted to DEQ, EPA acted reasonably in \"defer[ring] to [Virginia's] judgement [sic] that additional data and information collection [wa]s necessary before it c[ould] resolve the attainment status\" of the Shenandoah River \"in light of the specific language of Virginia's narrative criterion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The plaintiffs' arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. They argue that Virginia's water quality standards do not impose any \"uniformity\" requirement, that DEQ has not adopted any data protocols for the kinds of evidence the plaintiffs submitted, and that variability is inherent in algal growth and cannot be used against them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Br. at 28. But these arguments miss the mark. First, neither DEQ nor EPA has ever claimed that Virginia's narrative standard itself imposes a uniformity requirement. They have merely insisted that determinations under that standard be made carefully using reliable and scientifically valid data. Second, EPA made clear that its approval did not rest on the plaintiffs' failure to comply with DEQ protocols and that DEQ could not use the absence of quality-assurance protocols for photographic or testimonial data as a basis for excluding such data. EPA0023105-06. Finally, variability may be inherent in algal growth, but that does not make it irrelevant, and the plaintiffs do\n   not explain how DEQ should address it, short of designating the entire Shenandoah River as impaired based on individual instances of algal blooms at certain times and in certain places.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Br. at 1-2, 28-29. EPA and DEQ reasonably rejected this broad measure in favor of determining impairment on a segment-by-segment basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Virginia's Plans to Develop a Numerical Impairment Threshold for Algae\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Lastly, the plaintiffs argue that EPA was wrong to rely on Virginia's commitments to develop numerical thresholds for assessing algae-related impairment in the future. These commitments, however, played only a limited role in EPA's analysis. To be sure, EPA \"acknowledge[d] the efforts\" of DEQ \"towards meeting\" Virginia's \"algae-related commitments\" and noted its expectation that DEQ would \"finalize\" its \"algae field methodology\" and numerical \"impairment threshold\" in the near future. EPA0055924. But these observations did not serve as the basis for EPA's approval. Rather, EPA's approval rested on its finding that DEQ's \"decision to collect additional data before making attainment decisions ... regarding the impacts of algae on recreational use\" was \"reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That DEQ had taken concrete steps toward developing collection and monitoring methodology may have provided further confirmation that DEQ's need for additional information was genuine, but EPA did not rely on those steps, or their success, when it concluded that the plaintiffs' data was insufficient to make an impairment determination in 2014,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   EPA0023104, or when it concluded in 2016 that the additional photos submitted by the plaintiffs did not change that result,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   EPA0055923-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Once EPA's approval is understood not to rely DEQ's future plans, or their success, the plaintiffs' remaining arguments largely fall away. Even so, the Court will briefly address them.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs argue that it was disingenuine for EPA to rely on DEQ's plans because DEQ had downgraded its \"commitments\" to \"goals\" and was already behind schedule in attaining them. Pls.' Br. at 29. But the Court cannot conclude that DEQ's delay and modified expectations revealed that its purported need to collect more information was pretextual. Courts must presume that public officials act in good faith when discharging their official duties, absent clear evidence to the contrary.\n   <em>\n    People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals v. United States Dep't of Agric. &amp; Animal &amp; Plant Health Inspection Serv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520401\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/918/151/#p157\">\n    918 F.3d 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 157-58 (D.C. Cir. 2019). And, at this stage, there is insufficient evidence in the record to establish that DEQ's commitments were made in bad faith or as a pretext for avoiding its statutory and regulatory obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs raise a series of substantive challenges to the methodology DEQ had developed and described in its Draft 2018 Guidance, available at the time of EPA's approval.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Br. at 31-33. But EPA does not approve states' water quality assessment methodologies; it approves only the impaired waters lists that result from those methodologies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EPA0053987. Thus, it was reasonable for EPA to wait until the methodologies had been applied before considering their utility. That is particularly true considering that, when EPA issued its approval, DEQ was still in the process of receiving and weighing comments to its proposed methodology and might well have refined its approach based on input from the plaintiffs and others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EPA0055924.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <em>\n    Finally\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs accuse Virginia of developing an impairment threshold \"as a means to avoid applying the state's existing water quality standards\" altogether. Pls.' Reply at 8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14. The record reveals otherwise. EPA made clear that it accepted DEQ's decision to gather additional information so that DEQ could determine \"the attainment status of [the Shenandoah River]\n   <em>\n    in light of the specific language of Virginia's narrative criterion.\n   </em>\n   \" EPA0023104 (emphasis added). It never suggested that DEQ could replace that language with a standard of its own choosing. Indeed, far from evading applicable regulations, DEQ's data-collection and methodological-development efforts flow directly from EPA regulations and guidance. EPA regulations provide that a \"State's water monitoring program shall include collection and analysis of physical, chemical and biological data and quality assurance and control programs to assure scientifically valid data.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20130.4\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 130.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). And EPA has long approved of states using numeric thresholds \"as quantitative 'translations' of their narrative criteria.\" EPA0016994. Such \"translations\" are not an illegitimate effort to evade or replace narrative criteria but rather a means of effectively applying and \"implementing\" them.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20130.4\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20122.44\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(vi) (outlining methods for translating narrative water-quality criteria into numeric permit conditions).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In short, because EPA's approval did not rely on the success or specifics of Virginia's ongoing efforts or sanction a scheme by DEQ to circumvent Virginia's narrative water quality criteria, its approval was neither arbitrary and capricious nor contrary to the CWA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   At bottom, the plaintiffs accuse DEQ and EPA of the old politician's tactic: answer the question you wish you were asked, not the one you actually were.
