In lieu of appealing his convictions or sentence, Quintanilla has filed a Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct his Sentence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Doc. No. 1), asserting that his attorney was ineffective for failing to move to suppress evidence obtained during an allegedly illegal search of his property. The Government opposes that Motion (Doc. No. 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In pleading guilty to the charges against him, Quintanilla admitted to the following facts as set forth in his plea agreement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Between on or about November 4, 2016 and on or about August 5, 2017, in the Middle District of Tennessee and elsewhere, Homero Quintanilla Navarro, an alien previously deported and removed from the United States subsequent to a conviction for the commission of a felony, entered and was found in the United States without the required prior and express consent of the Secretary of Homeland Security for reapplication by the defendant for admission into the United States, in violation of Title 8, United States Code, Sections 1326(a) and (b)(1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 5, 2017, the DEA, using a confidential informant (the \"Cl\"), conducted a series of controlled calls with Quintanilla Navarro. Quintanilla Navarro told the CI that he was ready to meet, and that he had \"10 or 11\" for him. Quintanilla Navarro told the Cl to meet him at the Cracker Barrel restaurant located at Charlotte Pike near Interstate 40, and said he would be there in 45 minutes. The CI responded that he would need an hour.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Prior to the CI's arrival at the Cracker Barrel, Agents established multiple surveillance positions in and around the area of the Cracker Barrel. The CI parked his vehicle in the Cracker Barrel parking lot. At approximately 11:00 a.m., Agents observed a silver Toyota Camry pull in and circle the Cracker Barrel parking lot. Over the monitoring device, investigators heard the CI confirm that the Camry was Quintanilla Navarro's car. The CI called Quintanilla Navarro and told him where he was parked. Agents observed the silver Camry pull into a parking spot two spots away from the CI's car. Quintanilla Navarro got out of the Camry carrying two red bags. Quintanilla Navarro then got in the front passenger seat of the CI's car. At this time, Agents took Quintanilla Navarro into custody. He had the two red bags at his feet on the floorboard. Located inside the two bags were 10 compressed bricks of cocaine, and each contained in a clear, vacuum-sealed food saver bag. In total, the cocaine weighed 9.929 kilograms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Following his arrest, Agents provided Quintanilla Navarro with his Miranda rights in English, which he waived. Quintanilla Navarro speaks some English. In English, he told Agents that he received the 10 kilograms of cocaine from a Mexican source of supply, who he refused to identify, four days prior to his arrest. He also said that he had been sent two kilograms of cocaine several weeks prior by the same source of supply, which he had sold to a different cocaine customer in Nashville.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Quintanilla Navarro is not a United States citizen, and has been deported six times, the last time on November 4, 2016. Prior to his deportations, he was voluntarily returned to Mexico ten times between 2004 and 2008. Prior to his most recent reentry, he did not obtain consent of the Attorney General of the United States or the Secretary of Homeland Security for reapplication by the defendant for admission into the United\n   States. Prior to November 4, 2016, he was convicted in federal court of a violation of Title 8, U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), a felony punishable by more than one year imprisonment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (Doc.

In fact, in moving to vacate, Quintanilla relies upon essentially those same facts that were also set forth in the Criminal Complaint for his arrest. (Doc. No. 6-1 \u00b6 16-20). Nevertheless, he argues that (1) \"[p]robable cause does not exist merely because an individual arrives at a location with bags\"; (2) \"[u]nverified information from an unqualified confidential source is simply not able to establish probable cause\"; and (3) \"[a]ssuming arguendo that officers had reasonable suspicion to detain or probable cause to arrest Quintanilla, agents did not have probable cause to open and search the bags with him without a warrant.\" (Sox.

No. 6 at 6). This argument, however, misconstrues the nature of the claim. Quintanilla's claim is that counsel was ineffective and, as a practical matter, the Sixth Circuit \"generally do[es] not review ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal because 'a finding of prejudice is a prerequisite to a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel ... and appellate courts are not equipped to resolve factual issues.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Supreme Court has held that the exclusionary rule under the Fourth Amendment is a \"judicially created remedy rather than a personal constitutional right,\" with its focus being \"to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Kimmelman v.

At the time of his arrest, agents had a wealth of knowledge that would have led any reasonably prudent officer to believe Quintanilla was in the process of committing a drug offense when he showed up at the Cracker Barrel. The events leading up to Quintanilla's arrest are detailed in the Criminal Complaint that was filed as of record in this case and obviously available to defense counsel. It shows: (1) federal drug agents met with a confidential source working for the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department on July 1, 2016 in an effort to learn about multi-kilogram cocaine traffickers in Davidson County; (2) the confidential source was keen to provide such information because he had been arrested the day before while possessing 2\u00bd kilograms of cocaine and $ 12,619 in cash; (3) at the meeting, the confidential source informed agents that he began purchasing multiple kilograms of cocaine from a Hispanic male who he knew only as \"H\" beginning in January or February 2015; (4) \"H\" had wrecked a yellow Hummer on Saundersville Road in March of 2015 that resulted in criminal charges and H's imprisonment; (5) the agents learned that the driver of the Hummer was Quintanilla; (6) the confidential source identified Quintanilla from his booking photograph; (7) when Quintanilla went to jail, the confidential source was provided a different supplier; (8) upon release from imprisonment, Quintanilla went to the confidential source's home on August 3, 2016, and told him he was ready to start selling cocaine again; (9) on August 4, 2016, the confidential source met with Quintanilla where he was shown two-kilogram bricks of cocaine so that he would know Quintanilla was serious; (10) Quintanilla called the confidential source later and told him the price per kilo was $ 34,000; (11) on August 5, 2016, while being recorded by federal agents, Quintanilla told the confidential source that he had \"10 or 11 for him\"; and (12) the meeting in the Cracker Barrel parking lot where Quintanilla was arrested occurred less than an hour later. This is more than sufficient to establish probable cause that Quintanilla was engaged in a drug sale.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
