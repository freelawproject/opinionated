(\"MGI\"), Match Group, LLC (\"MGL\"), and Vimeo, Inc. (\"Vimeo\"). The first amended complaint alleged that the named defendants infringed six patents owned by British Telecom: U.S. Patent Nos. 6,240,450 (\"the '450 patent\"), 6,397,040 (\"the '040 patent\"), 6,578,079 (\"the '079 patent\"), 7,243,105 (\"the '105 patent\"), 7,974,200 (\"the '200 patent\"), and 9,177,297 (\"the '297 patent\").

The invention employs an inference engine that infers and outputs updates to a user profile according to a first set of rules and event statistics.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12183473\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/201/465/#p468\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at col. 4, ll. 35-60.

Illustrative claim 10 is a method claim, which provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A method of updating a user profile, the user profile being suitable for use in providing customized services to a respective user, the method comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (i) storing a first set of rules;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (ii) generating a set of personalized rule weightings according to a second set of rules and with reference to a set of user preference data;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (iii) receiving event statistics relating to a user's activity; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (iv) applying an inference engine to infer and output at least one update to a profile for the user according to said first set of rules weighted according to said generated set of personalized rule weightings, using said received event statistics.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The first amended complaint states that MGL, together with IAC and MGI, \"directly infringed, actively induced the infringement of, and/or contributorily infringed the ... '105 patent by providing infringing products/services under the name of 'Daily Matches' for Match.com,\" an on-line dating service. Dkt. No. 17, at 43;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 32, at 8. Accompanying the first amended complaint is an infringement chart that includes factual allegations discussing how \"Daily Matches\" practices each element of claim 10 of the '105 patent. Dkt. No. 17, Ex. J;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DermaFocus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12183473\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/201/465/#p468\">\n    201 F.Supp.3d at 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The first amended complaint and accompanying infringement chart present a plausible theory of infringement. British Telecom specifically describes how MGL's product meets each limitation in claim 10, using photographs of the product and quoting language from Match.com's website.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Disc Disease\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516650\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/1256/#p1260\">\n    888 F.3d at 1260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding Plaintiff's complaint sufficient because it \"specifically identified the three accused products-by name and by attaching photos of the product packaging as exhibits-and alleged that the accused products meet 'each and every element of at least one claim.' \"). For example, the infringement charts allege that: \"[a] first set of rules is based on information in the user's profile\"; \"Match.com generates personalized weightings for the users according to a second set of rules and with reference to a set of user preference data\"; \"Match.com receives event statistics relating to the user's activity when the user rates other users\"; and \"Match.com updates the criteria it uses for matching a particular user (in the user's profile) with other users based on the [user's preference and activity].\" Dkt. No. 17, Ex. J. These allegations are sufficient to satisfy the pleading requirements set forth in the\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   line of cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   MGL argues that the first amended complaint \"contains nothing showing that two sets of rules are present in the accused Match.com service ... [and] merely shows that the Match.com service utilizes an algorithm that learns user preferences from user ratings of proposed matches.\" Dkt. No. 25, at 7. However, MGL's argument is based on a more rigorous pleading standard than the law imposes. That is especially clear in light of the fact that, as appears to be the case here, MGL's \"Daily Match\" algorithm is not in the public domain. MGL fails to demonstrate how British Telecom could have determined whether, for example, MGL's product contains \"IF/THEN\" rule statements that \"are the hallmarks of the '105 Patent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 34, at 3 (British Telecom's claim charts \"provide no basis to infer that the Match.com service employs any of the '105 Patent's hallmark claim elements: multiple rule sets ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   MGL also argues that \"British Telecom equates the claims' rules with Match.com's preference data.\" Dkt. No. 25, at 9. According to MGL, that is inappropriate, because \"as a matter of plain English and common sense, user 'preferences' are not 'rules.' \" That argument misconstrues British Telecom's infringement contentions. The infringement contentions clearly differentiate between rules and preferences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 17, Ex. J, at 17 (\"first set of rules is\n   <em>\n    based on\n   </em>\n   ... user preferences\" (emphasis added) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18 (\"Match.com generates personalized weightings for the users according to\n   <em>\n    a second set of rules\n   </em>\n   and with reference to\n   <em>\n    a set of user preference data\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Implicit in MGL's argument regarding rules and preferences is a second argument-that in order to fall within the claims of the '105 patent, rules cannot be based on or set by user preferences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 25, at 9. However, that argument is directed to an issue of claim construction that is not suitable for resolution at the motion-to-dismiss stage of this case. Therefore, MGL's motion to dismiss with respect to the '105 patent, is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The '200 Patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The '200 patent is entitled \"Transmitting and Receiving Real-Time Data.\" The patent is directed to \"a method of providing a streaming video service to a [video viewer] across [the Internet] whilst reducing the start-up delay usually associated with preparing a buffer of data.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '200 patent, col. 1, ll. 14-17. At the time of the invention, commercial streaming technologies constructed \"a large buffer (5-30 seconds) before starting to playback video material.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at col. 1, ll. 36-38. To reduce start-up delays, the patent contemplates first transmitting lower quality data from a video streamer to a video viewer.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at col. 2, ll. 31-37;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at col. 5, ll. 11-15. The lower quality data can be transmitted at a faster rate than the video viewer consumes the data, such that the excess data builds a buffer at the video viewer while permitting immediate data consumption.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at col. 5, ll. 19-26. When the build-up of excess data reaches a predetermined level at the buffer, a command is sent to the video streamer, which switches the transmission of data from low quality data to high quality data.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at col. 5, ll. 27-42. In addition to reducing start-up delays, the buffer enables user-friendly video streaming despite variations in network conditions, \"which might otherwise have a detrimental effect on the overall perceived quality of the media.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at col. 4, ll. 58-62; col. 6, ll. 15-17. Illustrative claim 4 is a method claim, which provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A method of operating a communication apparatus comprising a data sender, a data presentation device having a store, and a network connecting said\n   data sender and said data presentation device, said method comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   operating said data sender to transmit a first plurality of first-encoding-rate data packets encoded at a first encoding rate to said data presentation device, wherein said first plurality of first-encoding-rate data packets are transmitted at a first transmission rate which is higher than said first encoding rate of said first-encoding-rate data packets;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   operating said data presentation device to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   receive said first plurality of first encoding rate data packets into said store;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   read out said received first-encoding-rate data packets from said store at a data rate equal to said first encoding rate of said first-encoding-rate data packets for decoding so as to present to a user at a first level of quality, wherein the removing of said first-encoding-rate data packets from said store is initiated when said first-encoding-rate data packets first arrive at said store;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   on said store being filled with data packets to a predetermined level, sending an indication to said data sender that said predetermined level has been reached;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   operating said data sender, on receipt of said indication from said data presentation device, to transmit a second plurality of second-encoding-rate data packets encoded at a second encoding rate to said data presentation device, wherein said second plurality of second-encoding-rate data packets are transmitted at a second transmission rate which is higher than said first transmission rate; and wherein said second encoding rate is higher than said first encoding rate;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   operating said data presentation device to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   receive said second plurality of second-encoding-rate data packets into said store;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   read out said second-encoding-rate data packets from said store at a data rate equal to said second encoding rate of said second-encoding-rate data packets for decoding, so as to present to said user at a second level of quality, wherein said second level of quality is higher than said first level of quality.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The first amended complaint alleges that IAC and Vimeo have \"directly infringed, actively induced the infringement of, and/or contributorily infringed the [ ] '200 patent by the adaptive streaming product/service provided in at least the Vimeo and Vimeo Live products/services.\" Dkt. No. 17, at 48. The infringement chart accompanying the first amended complaint includes factual allegations discussing how Vimeo's adaptive streaming product/service practices every element of claim 4 of the '200 patent. Dkt. No. 17, Ex. K.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Vimeo argues that, according to British Telecom's own infringement chart, not all of the elements of claim 4 are met by Vimeo's system, and that the complaint therefore does not plausibly allege infringement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 23, at 7; Dkt. No. 30, at 4. In particular, Vimeo focuses on the following claim element: \"on said store being filled with data packets to a predetermined level, sending an indication to said data sender that said predetermined level has been reached.\" '200 patent, claim 4. Vimeo states that the industry standard protocol by which its streaming system operates does not \"send an indication\" to a data sender that a predetermined buffer level at the client device (i.e., said predetermined\n   level) has been reached. Dkt. No. 23, at 7. Rather, once the buffer at the client device is filled to a predetermined level, the client device makes a \"GET request.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. The \"GET request\" selects the next segment of data from the data sender to be downloaded to the client device.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Vimeo, this selection process excludes sending any type of buffer level indication to the data sender.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 (\"[C]lient devices select among different coded representations of video, called 'segments,' without transmitting any such indication.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8 (\"This is a selection operation, not a transmission operation\" (emphasis in original) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (\"These GET requests are identical to each other in form and function\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   British Telecom argues that the infringement chart shows that a \"GET request\" based on buffer level is equivalent to \"an indication.\" Dkt. No. 28, at 9. It characterizes Vimeo's arguments as \"fact issues and claim construction issues.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to British Telecom, these issues include: \"(i) the construction of the term 'an indication,' (ii) whether a 'GET request' is 'an indication' as properly construed, and (iii) the factual circumstances under which a presentation device transmits a 'GET request' for a high-quality video stream.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In its reply brief, Vimeo argues that \"GET requests\" cannot be \"indications\" because \"Vimeo's servers [do not] respond to a GET request as required by the claims by providing a video stream at a higher quality.\" Dkt.

Instead, according to Vimeo, \"a Vimeo server responds to a GET request only by providing the requested segment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Reading the first amended complaint and the attached infringement chart in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the Court finds it plausible that a \"GET request\" meets the \"indication\" limitation, and that granting a motion to dismiss based on the defendant's argument regarding that limitation would be improper. It is unclear why, at least at the current stage of the case, a \"GET request\" does not (at least implicitly) indicate to the data sender, when the sender selects a data segment, that a predetermined buffer level has been reached. It is also unclear how Vimeo's argument in its reply brief regarding video stream quality justifies dismissal. Vimeo fails to articulate how \"Vimeo's servers [do not] respond to a GET request as required by the claims by providing a video stream at a higher quality\" if a \"GET request\" selects a data segment that provides a video stream at a higher quality than the previous segment. Vimeo's motion to dismiss, with respect to the '200 patent, is therefore denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In\n   <em>\n    BASCOM\n   </em>\n   , the Federal Circuit concluded that claims directed to a \"content filtering system for filtering content retrieved from an Internet computer network\" were abstract, but were nonetheless patent-eligible because they embodied an \"inventive concept\" under step 2 of the two-step test set forth in\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   The Federal Circuit held that while \"the limitations of the claims, taken individually, recite generic computer, network and Internet components,\" the claims \"recite a specific, discrete implementation of the abstract idea of filtering content.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924463\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/1341/#p1349\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924463\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/1341/#p1349\">\n    at 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, as noted, the data visualization software tool disclosed in the '450 patent does not represent inventive programming, and no inventive data monitoring tool is recited in the claims. The '450 patent acknowledges that the \"[d]ata visualisation techniques [disclosed in the specification were] known and clearly useful.\" '450 patent, col. 1, ll. 22-23. To visualize data at the time of the patent, \"data [was] generally stored locally\" and \"each set of data [was] approached with the user writing software to produce a different visualisation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924463\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/1341/#p1349\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at col. 1, ll. 40-43. The patent merely envisions the use of known visualization software in a user-friendly, pre-written format (i.e., applets). Yet, making well-known visualization software available on applets was also not inventive. In the \"Telephone Traffic Data Visualization\" example set forth in the '450 specification, the patentees explained that \"[a] geometry package has been developed which can be used as a platform for other visualisation applets that require the user to be able to manipulate a graphical object on the screen.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924463\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/1341/#p1349\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at col. 6, ll. 13-16.

Rather, the claims are functional in nature. Claim 1 states that the data visualization software must allow for \"selecting and controlling presentation of the data.\" Additional claims add that the tool must be,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , downloadable onto a browser, outputted or copied to a user station, able to query a database, and stored in a computer system.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '450 patent, claims 6, 15.

In effect, the node centralizes the data retrieval process. Illustrative claim 21 states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   A method of operating a communications network to provide a network-based information service, the method comprising the following steps:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   step a-storing customer identities, respective customer-associated lists of identities of information items, hereinafter referred to as items, for which the respective associated customer has access rights, and identities of item-associated information sources from which the respective items can be retrieved;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   step b-receiving at the network a message requesting access to the information service and comprising at least a customer identity;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   step c-reading the contents of the received message;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   step d-retrieving from storage the list of information item identities\n   associated with the received customer identity;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   if no item identity is received in step b,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   step e1-sending said list to the customer; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   step e2-reading an item identity from a further message received from the customer;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   or, on the other hand, if an item identity is received in step b,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   step f-ascertaining whether or not that received item identity is in said list; and for such item identity received in step b, if it is ascertained in step f that said received item identity is in said list, or, alternatively, for the item identity received in step e2, as the case may be,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   step g-ascertaining the identity of the information source associated with that received item identity;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   step h-retrieving the requested item from that information source; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   step i-sending at least the first page of the retrieved item to the customer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   That lengthy set of limitations can be summarized, without distortion or loss of specificity, as follows: A method entailing storing a customer's identity and the list of items as to which that customer has access rights and, when the customer requests one of the items for which the customer has access rights, obtaining that item from the source and sending it to the customer. If the message does not contain a request for access to an item, the customer will be sent a list of all the items to which he has access rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Vimeo argues that the '079 patent is drawn to the abstract idea of accessing restricted information based on identity. Dkt. No. 23, at 15. British Telecom challenges that characterization, arguing that the '079 patent claims \"are directed to specific solutions to specific problems in content distribution systems.\" Dkt. No. 28, at 17. According to British Telecom, the claimed arrangement of features \"improves the function and operation of a content distribution system by reducing the frequency and multiplicity of login credentials that a user must enter to access content from multiple content sources.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The Court agrees with Vimeo that the '079 patent is drawn to an abstract idea. Maintaining a centralized clearinghouse for information obtained from multiple sources and distributed to multiple customers can reduce the burden on customers who otherwise would have to make multiple separate requests to multiple information sources. But the concept of such a clearinghouse for information fits squarely within the category of \"fundamental economic and conventional business practices,\"\n   <em>\n    Enfish\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4282681\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/1327/#p1334\">\n    822 F.3d at 1335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that the Federal Circuit has repeatedly held to be abstract ideas. Non-computer-based analogues to such an information clearinghouse can be found in various fields. Many examples come to mind, such as a television service that allows a customer access to all of the television stations for which the customer has paid the subscription fee; a lending library that allows customers to have access to different categories of books or other materials obtained from a variety of sources depending on the customer's preferences and eligibility to receive materials from those sources; a china and silverware replacement service that allows customers who sign up for the service to obtain replacements for missing or broken items without having to search each of a large number of potential providers; or a college record-keeping system that provides different degrees of access to a student's records depending on whether the record requester is the student, an\n   administrator, a professor, or a healthcare professional affiliated with the college.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   The Federal Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Smartflash LLC v. Apple LLC\n   </em>\n   , 680 F. Appx. 977 (Fed. Cir. 2017), is closely analogous to this case. There, the court invalidated three patents related to a data carrier for storing and paying for data, and to computer systems for providing access to data to be stored. The claimed data carriers received and validated payments from users and then retrieved and provided data to the users.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 978-79. The court found that the asserted claims \"invoke computers merely as tools to execute fundamental economic practices, in particular retrieving and providing data subject to payment validation and \"access/use rule[s]\" specifying conditions for accessing and using the retrieved data.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 982. As such, the court concluded, \"the asserted claims are directed to the abstract idea of conditioning and controlling access to data based on payment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 982-83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Notably, the claims of the '079 patent contain no limitations regarding how that abstract idea is implemented. Because the claims recite no algorithm or other mechanism for effecting the task, they read on any implementation of the abstract idea, thus preempting any method of achieving the same end. As such, the claims are directed to the abstract idea\n   <em>\n    simpliciter\n   </em>\n   , and thus do not satisfy the first step in the two-step analysis of patent eligibility under\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    . See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Symantec\n   </em>\n   , 838 F.3d at 1316 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Internet Patents\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4274492\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/790/1343/#p1346\">\n    790 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1347 ) (\"[W]hen a claim directed to an abstract idea 'contains no restriction on how the result is accomplished ... [and] [t]he mechanism ... is not described, although this is stated to be the essential innovation,' then the claim is not patent-eligible.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   In response, British Telecom makes two points. First, British Telecom notes that \"this District previously recognized the advantages of this feature in its claim construction order in a prior lawsuit.\" Dkt. No. 28, at 18. That, however, is a mischaracterization of the claim construction order to which British Telecom refers. The order, in a prior case, merely states that \"[t]he '079 patent relates generally to providing users with information originating from multiple services through a single portal with a single password.\" Dkt. No. 29, Ex. C, at 9. That summary of the '079 patent falls far short of the endorsement of the patent's advantages that British Telecom claims it to be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Second, British Telecom states that \"[t]he Patent Office acknowledged that this arrangement of elements was a patentable improvement over prior art.\" Dkt. No. 28, at 18. But, as bears repeating once again, \"[t]he 'novelty' of any element or steps in a process, or even of the process itself, is of no relevance in determining whether the subject matter of a claim falls within the \u00a7 101 categories.\"\n   <em>\n    Diehr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183273\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/175/#p188\">\n    450 U.S. at 188-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183273\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/175/#p188\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   As for the inventive concept step, Vimeo argues that \"[t]he '079 [p]atent's claims recite no feature that confers an inventive idea upon them.\" Dkt. No. 23, at 18. According to Vimeo, the claim terms \"refer to general components of an information system\" and nothing suggests that the \"network, storage, or information sources [recited in the claim language] are in any way novel or unique.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183273\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/175/#p188\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   British Telecom disagrees and argues that the patent claims \"recite a non-conventional combination and arrangement of claimed functions\" including storing customer-associated lists at a node that identifies content that a user has the right to access, and then sending the list to the customer. Dkt. No. 28, at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   First, as noted by Vimeo, British Telecom \"does not dispute that the claims rely on conventional, routine telecommunications\n   features to perform the claimed operations.\" Dkt. No. 30, at 8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 28, at 19-20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 17, at 37. Therefore, as in\n   <em>\n    Electric Power Group\n   </em>\n   , the claims here \"merely call for performance of the claimed information collection, analysis, and display functions 'on a set of generic computer components' and display devices.\"\n   <em>\n    Elec. Power Grp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1353\">\n    830 F.3d at 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Second, the Court discerns no inventive concept in the combination and arrangement of the claimed features. Claim 21 recites the following steps: storing customer identities, including lists of identities of information items for which the customer has access rights; receiving a request for access to this information from a customer identity; retrieving the list of information associated with the customer identity; checking whether the requested information is included in the list; and if so, retrieving and sending the requested information to the customer. The Federal Circuit has found steps such as these, controlling access to resources, to be conventional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prism Techs.\n   </em>\n   , 696 F. Appx. at 1017 (\"T-Mobile argues that the asserted claims recite ineligible subject matter because they: (1) are directed to the abstract idea of controlling access to resources; and (2) are non-inventive because they recite generic computer hardware running generic computer software that performs the abstract functions routine to the process of restricting access.

The Other Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The defendants' briefing is mainly focused on the illustrative claims of each patent cited in British Telecom's complaint and the accompanying infringement chart.

Nothing in this decision should be viewed as casting doubt on the propriety of those cases.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   In this case, British Telecom has failed to highlight any features of the illustrative claims that raise a factual dispute. As discussed above, all features, individually and in combination, have been recognized by the Federal Circuit and previous district courts as generic and conventional. Accordingly, the Court believes it is appropriate to decide the section 101 issue now and spare the parties the burdens that would be incurred in delaying the disposition of the section 101 issue until later in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Vimeo and MGL's motions to dismiss, Dkt. Nos. 22 and 24, with respect to the '105 patent and the '200 patent, are denied. The Court finds that British Telecom has pleaded facts that make infringement plausible under both the '105 patent and the '200 patent. Vimeo and MGL's motions to dismiss, with respect to the '040 patent, the '297 patent, the '450 patent, and the '079 patent, are granted. The Court finds that the '040 patent, the '297 patent, the '450 patent, and the '079 patent are invalid as directed to patent-ineligible abstract ideas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    Vimeo and MGL both interpreted the first amended complaint as accusing each of the defendants of infringing all six patents. British Telecom clarified that \"Counts II [the '040 patent ], IV [the '105 patent ], and VI [the '297 patent ] do not allege infringement by Vimeo\" and that \"Counts I [the '450 patent ], III [the '079 patent ], and V [the '200 patent ] do not allege infringement by MGL.\" Dkt. No. 28, at 1; Dkt. No. 32, at 1. Therefore, Vimeo's motion to dismiss with respect to the '040 patent, the '105 patent, and the '297 patent, and MGL's motion to dismiss with respect to the '450 patent, the '079 patent, and the '200 patent, are denied as moot.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    British Telecom has yet to identify the particular patent claims it intends to assert against the defendants. However, the infringement chart attached to the amended complaint identifies certain claims as illustrative of the defendants' alleged infringement.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 17-1, Exhs. G-L. The Court focuses on those claims in this order.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    Vimeo's real-world analogue, Charles Minard's 1861 graph representing the losses suffered in Napoleon's Russian campaign, exemplifies the universality of such processes.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-170\">\n    The descriptions of the data visualization software in the claim language closely follow the conventional functionality of the software, as depicted in the flow charts set forth in Figures 2 and 6 of the '450 patent.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-171\">\n    In its brief, British Telecom argues that the patent discloses a \"nonconventional and inventive arrangement\" that enables \"a non-technical user ... to control the manner of presentation so that the data is presented in a graphic and understandable way.\" Dkt. No. 28, at 3 (quoting '450 patent, col. 2, ll. 15-18). While the specification touts that feature, it is not found in any of the claims, and even the reference in the specification is not accompanied by any explanation of how the invention allows the user to control the manner of presentation, other than by storing the data in a central database and downloading a data visualization tool upon request by a user.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
