Because the outcome of the Motions pending before the Court turn on the allegations in the Underlying Litigation, the Court will first introduce that litigation. After discussing the procedural history in this Court, the Court will evaluate the contract provisions upon which the Waste Management Plaintiffs base their claims of a duty to defend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Underlying Litigation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On October 18, 2011, Arthur Robinson suffered injuries from an accident at the\n   King George Landfill (the \"Landfill\") in Virginia. At the time, Robinson worked for (the now defunct) TAC Transport, LLC (\"TAC Transport\") as a commercial garbage truck driver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On the day of the accident, Robinson drove a TAC Transport trailer to the Landfill to dispose of garbage. The Landfill provided equipment to commercial drivers, including a \"tipper device\" in order to raise, tip, and lower trailers to unload garbage. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 13, ECF No. 6; Am. Compl. Ex. A \"Underlying Litig. Compl.\" \u00b6 11, ECF No. 6-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The plaintiff in the underlying case alleges that, while Robinson waited in line to dump the contents of his trailer, the tipper malfunctioned when operating with the trailer ahead of Robinson, driven by Earl Kennedy. Robinson claims that nearby Landfill employees should have assisted Kennedy, but they did not. Instead, Kennedy-also a TAC Transport employee-asked for Robinson's help to manually close the rear door of Kennedy's trailer. Robinson obliged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   To assist in trying to free the lodged rear door, Robinson climbed onto the Landfill's tipping platform. Once on the platform, Robinson assisted Kennedy and two other unidentified people in \"us[ing] a wooden 2x4 to apply pressure to the door in an attempt to lift it.\" (Mem. Supp. Pls. Mot. Summ. J. \u00b6 11, ECF No. 72.) Robinson testified during the Underlying Litigation that \"Kennedy gave Robinson 'the okay that it was okay to go ahead and' \" assist in trying to free the door. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting Mem. Supp. Pls. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. A \"Robinson Depo.\" 150-54, ECF No. 72-1).) Robinson also testified that \"[t]hen just when the door came free, I slipped and went off-went off the back.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting Robinson Depo. 165).) Robinson fell backward off the Landfill's tipper, landing on the ground fifteen to twenty feet below, and sustaining serious injuries. Although Robinson described his fall off the Landfill's tipper as due to a slip, he testified that he had \"no idea\" what he slipped on. (Robinson Dep. 167-68.) He noted that he \"didn't see any problems with the tipper\" on the day of his fall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   168.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On October 4, 2013, Robinson filed the complaint in the King George County Circuit Court, alleging one count of negligence each against Waste Management, Inc., Waste Management of Virginia, Inc., King George Landfill, Inc., and King George Landfill Properties, LLC,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   as entities that \"owned, operated, managed and/or w[ere] responsible for the Landfill.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 17; Underlying Litig. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-7, 23-46.) In the Underlying Litigation, Robinson contends that the Waste Management Plaintiffs' negligent actions caused him to fall from the Landfill's tipper, which resulted in his injuries. Robinson seeks $ 10,000,000 in damages jointly and severally from those four entities. Robinson did not include any claim against TAC Transport in the Underlying Litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In this case, the WM Plaintiffs seek representation from the Insurance Company Defendants for the Waste Management Plaintiffs' defense in the Underlying Litigation. They assert three contractual bases for the duty to defend, the first of which is a service agreement, while the other two are insurance contracts. First, the Waste Management Plaintiffs cite a transportation service agreement between TAC Transport and Waste Management of Maryland, Inc. (the \"Transportation Agreement\"). The Waste Management Plaintiffs claim the Transportation Agreement would obligate TAC Transport, as Robinson's employer, to defend them in the Underlying Litigation because TAC Transport's negligence caused Robinson's injuries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, the WM Plaintiffs contend that the duty to defend arises under a Commercial General Liability Policy (the \"CGL\" Policy) between TAC Transport and Great Divide. Finally, the Waste Management Plaintiffs contend a duty to defend arises under a Business Auto Policy (the \"BA Policy\") between TAC Transport and Great Divide.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Section III below, the Court will discuss seriatim the Waste Management Plaintiffs' arguments for seeking defense costs under the Transportation Agreement, the CGL Policy, and the BA Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History Before This Court\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Waste Management Plaintiffs filed their Complaint in this Court asserting six claims against the Insurance Company Defendants and Arthur Robinson.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1.) While these six claims pertain to three insurance contracts,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   only two of the insurance contracts are relevant to the Court's analysis of the current cross-motions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 14, 2017, the Waste Management Plaintiffs filed their Amended Complaint asserting the same six claims against the Insurance Company Defendants and Robinson. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl., ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   No. 6.) On March 13, 2017, after an extension of time, the Insurance Company Defendants filed an answer and counterclaim. (ECF No. 15.) With the Court's permission, on April 13, 2017, the Insurance Company Defendants filed their Corrected Answer to the Amended Complaint and Counterclaim. (ECF No. 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On April 18, 2017, the Court referred several motions\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   to the Honorable David J. Novak, United States Magistrate Judge, for Report and Recommendation, including the Waste Management Plaintiffs' Motion to Dismiss Counterclaims, (ECF No. 20). (ECF No. 27.) On April 21, 2017, the Court also referred the Insurance Company Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Underlying Claimant Parties for Lack of Standing, (ECF No. 28), and Motion to Drop the Waste Management Subsidiaries as Parties Hereto or Declare Them to be Nominal or Otherwise Unnecessary Parties, (ECF No. 29), to the Magistrate Judge for Report and Recommendation. (ECF No. 34.) Additionally, on May 1, 2017, the Court referred the Insurance Company Defendants' Motion to Strike, (ECF No. 37), to the Magistrate Judge for consideration and incorporation into his Report and Recommendation. (ECF No. 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On June 30, 2017, the Magistrate Judge filed his Report and Recommendation (the \"R&amp;R\"). (ECF No. 50.) In the R&amp;R, Magistrate Judge Novak recommended that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs' Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 20) be DENIED as to Counterclaim Counts I-A, II-A, III and V-A, and GRANTED as to Counterclaim Counts I-B, II-B, IV and V-B, that Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Underlying Claimant Parties (ECF No. 28) be DENIED as MOOT, that Defendants' Motion to Drop (ECF No. 29) be DENIED, and that Defendants' Motion to Strike (ECF No. 37) be GRANTED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (R&amp;R 17, ECF No. 50.) The Magistrate Judge notified the parties that they had 14 days to file an objection to the R&amp;R.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On July 14, 2017, the Insurance Company Defendants filed objections, citing numerous issues with the R&amp;R. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 52.) On October 3, 2017, the Court overruled the Insurance Company Defendants' objections and adopted the findings and recommendations in the R&amp;R. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oct. 3, 2017 Order, ECF No. 54.) In that same October 3, 2017 Order, the Court instructed the Insurance Company Defendants to file an Amended Answer and Counterclaim that complied with the R&amp;R's findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On October 9, 2017, the Insurance Company Defendants filed their Amended Answer. (ECF No. 55.) In their Amended Answer, the Insurance Company Defendants assert that the insurance contracts do not create a duty to defend or to indemnify. In their Counterclaim, the Insurance Company Defendants also seek a declaration that no duty to defend or indemnify exists under the CGL Policy, the BA Policy, or the Excess Policy. On October 16, 2017, the Waste Management Plaintiffs filed an Answer to the Insurance Company Defendants' Counterclaim. (ECF No. 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On December 1, 2017, the Court held an initial pretrial conference with all parties. In the Initial Pretrial Order, issued on December 5, 2017, the Court ordered that all dispositive motions be filed no later than May 3, 2018, and responses to those motions be filed no later than 20 days after\n   the dispositive motion was filed. (Dec. 5, 2017 Order 5, ECF No. 61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On May 1, 2018, the Court entered an Order clarifying the scope of briefing for summary judgment and granting the parties additional time, until May 7, 2018, to file their summary judgment motions. (ECF No. 68.) The Insurance Company Defendants and the Waste Management Plaintiffs filed their Motions for Summary Judgment.

Supp. Defs. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. B \"CGL Policy\" 7, ECF No. 70-2.)

Rather they seek coverage under the CGL Policy as additional insureds. The \"Additional Insured-Designated Person or Organization\" endorsement TAC Transport executed as part of its CGL Policy with Great\n   Divide identified as additional insureds \"[t]hose entities with whom the named insured has executed a written contract.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CGL Policy 32.) The endorsement explained that the CGL Policy provided coverage to the additional insureds\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   only with respect to liability for 'bodily injury'... caused, in whole or in part, by your\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   acts or omissions or the acts or omissions of those acting on your behalf: ... in the performance of your ongoing operations; or ... in connection with your premises owned by or rented to you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Because TAC Transport executed the Transportation Agreement, which likely qualifies as \"a written contract\" under the CGL Policy, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1995319\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/337/98/#p107\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ), with Waste Management of Maryland, Inc., the Waste Management Plaintiffs claim that they constitute additional insureds under the CGL Policy. But they do not. The Waste Management Plaintiffs cannot prevail on this argument because Robinson does not seek to hold the WM Plaintiffs liable for\n   <em>\n    TAC Transport's\n   </em>\n   \"acts or omissions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Because Robinson Does Not Seek to Hold the Waste Management Plaintiffs Liable for\n     <em>\n      TAC Transport's\n     </em>\n     Acts or Omissions, No Duty to Defend Exists Under the CGL Policy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In order for a duty to defend to arise under the CGL Policy, the Waste Management Plaintiffs must satisfy the contractual definition of \"additional insureds.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Despite the fact that the Transportation Agreement may meet part of that definition, the facts here do not satisfy the definition fully. Waste Management of Maryland, Inc. (and, for that reason, all of the WM Plaintiffs) do not constitute additional insureds under the CGL Policy. Utilizing the same two-pronged approach employed with the Transportation Agreement, the Court finds that the plain language of the CGL Policy does not confer a duty to defend the Waste Management Plaintiffs. This is so for the same reason the Transportation Agreement falters: Robinson did not, and likely cannot, assert a negligence claim against\n   <em>\n    TAC Transport\n   </em>\n   , which is a necessary basis to give rise to a duty to defend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   First, the Court looks to \"the coverage and ... the defenses under the terms and requirements of the insurance policy[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Capital City\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4230807\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/788/375/#p379\">\n    788 F.3d at 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins.

The policy identifies three categories of insured parties: (1) \"You\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   for any covered 'auto;' \" (2) \"Anyone else while using with your permission a covered 'auto' you own, hire, or borrow\" with certain, inapplicable exceptions; and, (3) \"[a]nyone liable for the conduct of an 'insured' described above\n   <em>\n    but only to the extent of that liability.\n   </em>\n   \" (BA Policy 8-9 (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   If the Waste Management Plaintiffs could meet the third definition of insureds, the Waste Management Plaintiffs\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   qualify as an insured under the BA Policy. The Waste Management Plaintiffs do not otherwise constitute insureds under the BA Policy. To see if the Waste Management Plaintiffs qualify as an insured party under the phrase \"[a]nyone liable for the conduct of an 'insured' described above\n   <em>\n    but only to the extent of that liability\n   </em>\n   ,\" the Court must determine the scope of coverage that this definition creates under the BA Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Several courts have addressed the meaning of the phrase \"only to the extent of that liability.\" These cases find coverage only when a claim of vicarious liability has been brought against an entity that is not a named insured. For instance, the Superior Court of Massachusetts in interpreting this same provision found that \"for [a company] to benefit from the refuge of this provision, the individual for whom [the company] is allegedly held vicariously liable must be insured under the policy and must have affirmatively acted creating potential liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Domino's Pizza, Inc. v.

Cal. April 5, 2011). When interpreting a similarly worded provision,\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois found that it \"is plainly a vicarious liability provision and nothing more: It insures all those who may be vicariously liable for acts or omission of the named insured.\"\n   <em>\n    Vulcan Materials Co. v.

Ill. 1989). Based on these persuasive interpretations and the plain language of the provision, the Court concludes that for the BA Policy to provide coverage to the Waste Management Plaintiffs under this provision, the Underlying Litigation must seek to hold the Waste Management Plaintiffs vicariously liable for the conduct of one of the Named Insureds under the policy, specifically\n   <em>\n    TAC Transport.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   This brings the Court to the requisite second inquiry: whether \"the allegations in the tort action potentially bring the tort claim within the policy's coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Capital City\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4230807\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/788/375/#p379\">\n    788 F.3d at 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

App'x at 235-36. In the Underlying Litigation, Robinson seeks to hold the Waste Management Plaintiffs liable for only their own allegedly negligent acts. The alleged breach of duties giving rise to Robinson's injuries do not depend upon any action taken by\n   <em>\n    TAC Transport\n   </em>\n   and no claim exists that any of the entities named would be held vicariously liable for TAC Transport's own negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   For reasons analogous to those with respect to the other two contracts, no duty to defend exists under the BA Policy. Even presuming that the Waste Management Plaintiffs could be deemed an insured entity under the third definition of the BA policy, the duty to defend could only arise when the entity will be held vicariously liable for the acts of another protected entity, here TAC Transport.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vulcan Materials Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4045785\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/723/1263/#p1264\">\n    723 F.Supp. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1264-65 ;\n   <em>\n    GBTI, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201332165\">\n    2011 WL 1332165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *7 ;\n   <em>\n    Domino's Pizza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"192244\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-l-rptr/12/392/\">\n    12 Mass.

Robinson did not allege that the Waste Management Plaintiffs could be held vicariously liable for the acts\n   of TAC Transport. Furthermore, because Robinson accepted a workers' compensation settlement from TAC Transport, it appears unlikely under Virginia law that he could bring a negligence claim against TAC Transport.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   VA CODE ANN. \u00a7 65.2-307 (establishing the exclusivity of workers' compensation relief).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Because the Waste Management Plaintiffs likely could not be held vicariously liable for TAC Transport's negligence, no duty to defend exists under the BA Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     IV.
