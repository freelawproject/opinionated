(Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 1-4.) Plaintiffs, who assert both FLSA and New York Labor Law (\"NYLL\") claims, allege that Defendants failed to pay them minimum wage, overtime pay and spread-of-hours pay throughout their employment. (5/28/19 Faillace Ltr. at 1.) Defendants denied the material allegations of the Complaint (Answer, ECF No. 13, \u00b6\u00b6 108-25 ), and asserted as defenses that \"[o]ne or more Plaintiffs was a manager and/or supervisor and not an employee and thus not eligible for overtime,\" and that \"[o]ne or more of the Plaintiffs was not employed by any of the Defendants named herein.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 126-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs Sanchez and Galarza reached a settlement in principle with Defendants in mid-April 2017. (5/25/17 Santos Ltr., ECF No. 19.) At an initial pretrial conference in this case held before District Judge Alison J.

(\"Faillace Firm\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   advised the Court that Plaintiffs Sanchez and Galarza no longer wished to continue the case and that Santos anticipated filing settlement papers over the coming week.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Billing Records at 1-3 (\"discussed case with MS\"; \"discussed case with PH\").) The Court excludes these entries from its fee award.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anthony v. Franklin First Fin., Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3779180\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/844/504/#p509\">\n    844 F. Supp. 2d 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 509 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (finding time billed for internal meetings between attorneys assigned to case to be excessive).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   More significantly, Faillace acted improperly in not permitting two of his three clients, Sanchez and Galarza, to settle at the mediation that was held in April 2018. Rule 1.2(a) of the New York Rules of Professional Conduct provides: \"A lawyer shall abide by a client's decision whether to settle a matter.\" N.Y. Rules Prof'l Conduct R. 1.2(a). The Court will not include as part of the fee award the 2.4 hours billed by Faillace for the mediation. Moreover, if Sanchez and Galarza had been permitted to settle, then many of the hours billed from May 2018 up to and including the January 2019 settlement conference would not have been necessary. I am reducing the hours spent by Hershan during that period by two-thirds (representing a share of time attributable to Sanchez and Galarza).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally, the Court will not include as part of the fee award the 1.25 hours billed by Hershan in meeting with Faillace and Luna on January 30, 2019, after the case already had settled. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Billing Records at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In view of all the foregoing, I find that the following number of hours billed by the Faillace Firm lawyers to be reasonable: Faillace, 10.7 hours; Santos, 11.1 hours; and Hershan, 4.6 hours. Multiplying the\n   reasonable hourly rates set forth above for these attorneys, yields an attorney fee award in the amount of $ 7,420.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The reimbursable costs set forth on the billing records are $ 703.50. Therefore, I award Plaintiffs' counsel $ 8,123.50 in attorneys' fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   For all the foregoing reasons, I approve the settlement in this case and award Plaintiffs' counsel $ 8,123.50 in attorneys' fees and costs.
