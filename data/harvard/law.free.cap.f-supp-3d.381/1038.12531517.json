ROSE, JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before the Court is a motion by Defendant City of Davenport, Iowa (the \"City\"), to dismiss the Complaint of pro se Plaintiff Jesse Hammes. [ECF No. 5]. The motion is fully submitted and ready for decision. Neither party has requested oral argument on the motion, and the Court finds the issues can be resolved without it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LR 7(c). For the reasons stated herein, Defendant's motion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff is a resident of the City whose home is located on a parcel of land that abuts Pheasant Creek. His claims arise from erosion damage to his property caused by excessive stormwater runoff from commercial properties in the Pheasant Creek watershed. According to Plaintiff,\n   the City has been negligent \"for ignoring the recommendations of [its consulting engineers], it's [sic] own ordinances and federal laws when approving site plans, granting permits and allowing variances without adequate water detention or retention\" for commercial developments on Elmore Avenue in the City \"and surrounding parcels in the Pheasant Creek watershed.\" [ECF No. 1 at 5]. Through these failures, the City has \"allow[ed] discharge of everyday water and storm water [sic] at a higher volume and rate of flow than was naturally occurring prior to [the commercial] developments.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that this increase in stormwater has caused \"massive erosion to Pheasant Creek,\" and the property on which he resides, \"in the form of land loss, deterioration of the natural running creek with steepening of the creek bed, creek bank failure, and approximately 250 trees ripped from the banks, causing obstruction to the creek flow.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff argues that the City is negligent for ignoring complaints from Plaintiff and owners of adjoining properties about ongoing property damage, and it continues to issue permits for new commercial developments \"without adequate retention or detention, compounding the effects of what they knew was already happening.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In addition to voicing his complaints to the City, Plaintiff alleges that he has made \"numerous complaints\" via telephone and the internet to both the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") and the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (\"IDNR\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 11 at 1]. Plaintiff does not specify the content of his complaints, but he claims neither agency responded to them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff has not pursued claims against the City in state court.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff commenced this action on November 2, 2018. In his Complaint, he invokes the Court's jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which vests federal district courts with original jurisdiction over \"all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\" Plaintiff alleges that his claims arise under the Clean Water Act (\"CWA\" or \"the Act\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201251\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and involve inverse condemnation and subservient land rights. [ECF No. 1 at 3]. On December 10, 2018, Defendant moved to dismiss this action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II. LEGAL STANDARD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Rule 12(b)(1) allows a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. These motions come in two types-facial attacks and factual attacks-and courts must distinguish between them.\n   <em>\n    Branson Label, Inc. v. City of Branson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277319\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/910/#p914\">\n    793 F.3d 910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 914 (8th Cir. 2015). When the moving party mounts a facial attack to the Court's jurisdiction, \"the court merely [needs] to look and see if plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a basis of subject matter jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277319\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/910/#p914\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (alteration in original) (citation omitted). \"Accordingly, 'the court restricts itself to the face of the pleadings and the non-moving party receives the same protection as it would defending against a motion brought under Rule 12(b)(6).' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277319\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/910/#p914\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted). \"[I]n a factual attack, 'the existence of subject matter jurisdiction [is challenged] in fact, irrespective of the pleadings, and matters outside the pleadings, such as testimony and affidavits, are considered.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277319\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/910/#p914\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277319\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/910/#p914\">\n    at 914-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration in original) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant asserts that its challenge to the Court's jurisdiction is a facial attack, and, indeed, the City does not rely on facts outside of the Complaint when arguing in favor of its motion. The Court will therefore treat the motion as a facial attack and\n   limit its review to matters stated in the Complaint (construed liberally as consistent with Plaintiff's status as a pro se litigant).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   III. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant argues that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this case due to Plaintiff's failure to comply with certain conditions precedent to pursuing his claims. Specifically, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to give the required pre-action notice regarding his claim under the CWA, and has failed to exhaust state remedies as to his inverse condemnation claim. Defendant then argues that, without jurisdiction over a federal claim, the Court cannot hear Plaintiff's remaining state-law claims. The Court will address each of these issues in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    A. Notice under the CWA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The CWA allows \"any citizen [to] commence a civil action on his own behalf\" to enforce the requirements of the Act or its regulations.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201365\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). No litigation may commence, however, \"prior to sixty days after the plaintiff has given notice of the alleged violation (i) to the Administrator [of the EPA], (ii) to the State in which the alleged violation occurs, and (iii) to any alleged violator\" of the rule at issue.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201365\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1365(b)(1)(A).

However, his Complaint states that he raised his concerns with the City, and his briefing indicates that he also notified the EPA and IDNR of his concerns via numerous emails and telephone calls.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF Nos. 1 at 5; 11 at 1]. Nevertheless, even if the Court assumes Plaintiff's communications with the City and agencies cumulatively incorporated all the information appearing in his Complaint, this notice, such as it is, must \"be given in such a manner as the Administrator [of the EPA] shall prescribe by regulation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201365\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). At a minimum, Plaintiff was required to send notice to the appropriate persons and in the manner set out in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20135.2\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 135.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff's failure to do so was more than a mere technicality. It is not clear from Plaintiff's pleading and brief how his complaints to the EPA differed from the numerous other complaints the EPA receives. Thus, his communications with the EPA could not reasonably be interpreted as putting the agency on notice of his intent to sue. Absent such notice, the agency could not have had the requisite opportunity to determine whether it wanted to intercede or was content to let Plaintiff pursue the matter on his own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Accordingly, the Court agrees with Defendant that Plaintiff's claim under the CWA must be dismissed due to Plaintiff's failure to give pre-suit notice as required under \u00a7 1365 and EPA regulations. Accordingly, Plaintiff's CWA claim is DISMISSED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    B. Inverse Condemnation Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant also argues that Plaintiff's inverse condemnation claim fails because Plaintiff did not exhaust his state-law remedies before bringing the claim in federal court. \"Inverse condemnation is ' \"a generic description applicable to all actions in which a property owner, in the\n   absence of a formal condemnation proceeding, seeks to recover from a governmental entity for the appropriation of his property interest.\" ' \"\n   <em>\n    Kingsway Cathedral v.

It is not clear how Plaintiff's subservient land rights claim differs from his inverse condemnation claim. To the extent he argues that the City has interfered with those rights without just compensation, then that claim is essentially a duplicate of his inverse condemnation claim and fails for the reasons stated above. However, if that claim seeks to impose liability on the City for tortious acts that interfere with his \"subservient land rights,\" then that claim, like his negligence claim, is a tort arising under state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"When a district court does not have subject-matter jurisdiction over federal claims, it cannot exercise supplemental jurisdiction over any state claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Mains v.

The Court construes this request as a motion to amend his Complaint, followed by a motion to stay these proceedings. The Court finds this course of action is inappropriate where the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. Without such jurisdiction, the Court lacks the authority to grant this or any relief in relation to Plaintiff's CWA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In the context of his inverse condemnation claim, Plaintiff also asks the Court to \"redirect[ ] [this case] to State court rather than being outright dismissed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613024,12612952,12612919,12612920,12612921,12612922,12627128,12613023\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/199/121/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   There is no legal basis for the Court to transfer this matter to the Iowa court system.

CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, [ECF No. 5] is GRANTED. Plaintiff's claims are dismissed for want of subject matter jurisdiction. All outstanding motions are DENIED as moot. The Clerk of Court is directed to enter judgment in favor of Defendant and close this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    The facts are derived from Plaintiff's Complaint and brief in response to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss. For the purposes of Defendant's motion, the Court assumes as true the facts in the Complaint.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Brown v.

Additionally, because Plaintiff appears pro se, the Court gives the Complaint a \"liberal construction.\"\n    <em>\n     Solomon v.
