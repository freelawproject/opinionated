The Murder\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In July, 2006, Taylor was indicted by a grand jury for first degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Commonwealth presented credible evidence at trial that Taylor had strangled the victim, Dominique Samuels (\"Samuels\" or \"the victim\"), and burned her body in a public park days later. Samuels resided in a multi-bedroom apartment with Martin McCray (\"McCray\"), McCray's brother, McCray's female cousin and a male friend of McCray. Taylor is McCray's cousin and throughout the trial Taylor maintained that McCray had actually committed the murder. In the alternative, he claimed that the Medical Examiner implied that there was evidence that no murder had been committed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On the night in question, April 27 into the early hours of April 28, 2006, Taylor and McCray were in McCray's room, drinking alcohol and playing video games. Around 10:00 P.M., McCray left his apartment to spend the night at his girlfriend's home. Taylor remained in McCray's room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A number of witnesses recalled hearing screaming that night coming from the victim's apartment. The landlord's daughter\n   testified that she heard two men laughing and dragging something after an altercation. McCray's cousin heard what she initially assumed was a sexual encounter but later believed it to be a woman in distress and then a loud boom. Despite those noises, no one residing inside the building notified law enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The following morning, Taylor went to the apartment of McCray's girlfriend to see McCray. McCray claimed that Taylor confessed to killing Samuels at that time and showed McCray scratches on his hands and neck inflicted by Samuels. During the next few days, McCray and Taylor spoke on the phone several times. McCray alleged that Taylor sought access to a vehicle to dispose of Samuels's body. McCray also claimed that Taylor told him that he intended to burn Samuels's fingertips because his skin was underneath her fingernails. McCray testified that at 5:30 A.M. on Sunday, April 30, 2006, Taylor called him to tell him \"it's done\". Samuels's body was discovered in Franklin Park 30 minutes later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A search of McCray's room thereafter revealed two distinct bloodstains: one containing the DNA of the victim and one containing the DNA of Taylor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. State Court Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During the trial, a juror notified the court that some of the other jurors may have been sleeping during some of the testimony. The judge offered to speak with individual jurors or with the group as a whole. Defense counsel indicated that addressing the group was sufficient and the judge then instructed the jurors to remain alert throughout the testimony. That issue was not raised again during the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The prosecutor asserted in his closing argument that the alternate theory of the defense that McCray committed the murder was not credible, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   if you don't believe Martin McCray because you think he killed Dominique Samuels, I suggest to you, ladies and gentlemen, that you will have violated the oath that you took as jurors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   He added that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   to call [the defense's theory] a rumor, to call that speculation, to call that innuendo is to give that statement too much credit ... [and it] is a bald-face-lie.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The prosecutor also suggested that only Taylor knew where he was when certain incriminating phone calls were placed. Specifically, he stated that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [N]ot one witness put the defendant at Martha Laing's house, not one, not any of the witnesses [defense counsel] called. Marie Anderson doesn't say that. Martha Laing doesn't say that. And you know who else doesn't say that? The defendant doesn't say that. In his statement to the police on May 3, before any of these cell phone records came to light, what would the defendant say about his whereabouts in the early morning of April 30? He was asked a direct question: Where were you? And how did he answer? I was at home at Richfield Street. I stayed there all night. No mention of going to Norwood.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   He also stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [Defense counsel] says I can't tell you that that means that he was in Franklin Park. I'm not saying he was in Franklin Park. I have no idea where he was when he made those calls. Nobody does except for the defendant. But the cell phone records prove something: he wasn't in Norwood. He was not in Norwood as [defense counsel] claimed he would be.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Also during closing argument, the prosecutor referenced the presence of Taylor's DNA and the corresponding forensic testimony and stated \"[i]t doesn't get any better than that\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defense counsel objected immediately after the prosecutor's \"jury's oath\" comment and several other times throughout the closing argument. In response to those objections, and the court's perception that the \"jury's oath\" comment was \"troubling\", the judge gave a specific curative instruction to the jury with respect to that comment both during closing arguments and at the final jury charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Taylor was convicted of murder in the second degree in July, 2008, following an eight-week jury trial. Taylor filed a notice of appeal shortly thereafter and then filed a motion for a new trial in April, 2011. Those motions were subsequently consolidated and were denied in February, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In petitioner's consolidated appeal, he argued to the Massachusetts Appeals Court (\"the MAC\") that 1) his right to a speedy trial was violated, 2) the prosecutor's closing argument was improper and 3) the jury instructions were inadequate because they failed to instruct on the relevance of intoxication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (\"the SJC\") affirmed Taylor's conviction in 2014. Petitioner filed a second motion for a new trial in September, 2015, asserting for the first time that the trial court erred in failing to conduct\n   <em>\n    voir\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    dire\n   </em>\n   of the sleeping jurors and that his initial appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise that issue on his first appeal. The MAC found that the jury misconduct claim had been waived but nevertheless reviewed the trial judge's ruling, found that there was no error and affirmed the denial of Taylor's motion for a new trial. The SJC denied further review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Federal Court Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Taylor filed this petition for habeas corpus in August, 2017, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He claims that 1) he was denied effective assistance of counsel when his trial attorney failed to address adequately the issue of sleeping jurors and when his appellate counsel failed to raise that issue on appeal and 2) the prosecutor's closing argument contained improper and prejudicial comments attacking defense counsel and the defense's theory of the case, commenting on petitioner's failure to testify and expressing his personal opinion as to the strength of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Habeas Petition Under \u00a7 2254\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Moreover, the trial court instructed the jury that it was the arbiter of fact and that it should disregard the attorneys' opinions as to the weight of the evidence. Finally, the overwhelming strength of the evidence of guilt negates any prejudice from that comment.
