Black's Law Dictionary offers three definitions of 'violent': (1) \"[o]f, relating to, or characterized by strong physical force;\" (2) \"[r]esulting from extreme or intense force;\" and (3) \"[v]ehemently or passionately threatening.\"\n   <em>\n    Violent\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014).

Plaintiffs' reliance on the fact that the 13 Charities were controlled by Hamas founders, without more, is insufficient to prove that Defendant's activities were violent or endangered human life. Indeed, Plaintiffs offer no evidence, and their experts do not opine, that the 13 Charities participated in, planned, trained the perpetrators of, requested that someone carry out, or were the cause of the attacks giving rise to Plaintiffs' claims. Plaintiffs identify no transfers from Interpal to the 13 Charities as payments meant to involve a violent act or an act dangerous to human life. Similarly, the fact that Interpal and the Union of Good were designated as SDGTs alone is insufficient to satisfy the violent act or act dangerous to human life prong of \u00a7 2331(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that Defendant's banking services to Interpal and the 13 Charities contributed to terrorism merely because those organizations engage in terroristic\n   activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , Opp. at 8-9. Plaintiffs' assertions address Defendant's indirect contribution, through banking services, to terrorist activities without establishing any nexus between the banking services and the terrorist activities. Plaintiffs offer no evidence that Defendant's banking services directly involved strong physical force, or intense force, or vehement or passionate threats. Plaintiffs also do not offer evidence sufficient to create a factual dispute as to whether Defendant's banking services directly involved peril or hazard or were likely to cause serious bodily harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Thus, Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to the violent acts and acts dangerous to human life prong of \u00a7 2331(1) is granted because Plaintiffs fail to present evidence sufficient to create a jury question as to whether Defendant's activities involved violent acts or acts dangerous to human life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

However, Judge Sifton dismissed Plaintiffs' common law aiding and abetting claims, but did not, and could not address Plaintiffs' statutory aiding and abetting claims under JASTA as the statute did not exist at the time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Owens v.

If anything, JASTA's passage confirms that Congress knows how to provide for aiding and abetting liability explicitly and that the version of \u00a7 2333 in effect [previously] did not provide for that liability.\"). Defendant contends that Judge Sifton relied on the same legal framework for dismissing Plaintiffs' common law aiding and abetting claims as required for dismissing JASTA claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , Reply at 8 (citing\n   <em>\n    Weiss I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8452464\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/453/609/\">\n    453 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   621-22 ). Specifically, Defendant contends that Judge Sifton evaluated Plaintiffs' aiding and abetting claim by relying on aiding and abetting precedent set forth in\n   <em>\n    In re Terrorist Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001\n   </em>\n   , which considered the\n   <em>\n    Halberstam\n   </em>\n   elements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , Reply at 8-9, 9, n.9 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Terrorist Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9169417\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/349/765/#p798\">\n    349 F.Supp.2d 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 798-800 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) ). While Judge Sifton did reference\n   <em>\n    In re Terrorist Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001\n   </em>\n   , it is unclear from\n   <em>\n    Weiss I\n   </em>\n   whether he applied the\n   <em>\n    Halberstam\n   </em>\n   factors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Weiss I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8452464\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/453/609/\">\n    453 F.Supp.2d at 621-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Second Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Linde\n   </em>\n   made clear that the\n   <em>\n    Halberstam\n   </em>\n   elements of civil aiding and abetting liability and factors relevant to the substantial assistance element provide the proper legal framework for evaluating a JASTA aiding and abetting claim.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515951\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/314/\">\n    882 F.3d at 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because it is unclear whether Judge Sifton applied that framework, the Court does not consider the decision in\n   <em>\n    Weiss I\n   </em>\n   as a bar to Plaintiffs amending their complaint.

As a general matter, a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is the benchmark for determining whether amendment is futile.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Lucente v.

Here, amendment would be futile because Plaintiffs' proposed JASTA claim fails as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that Defendant had the requisite knowledge required by JASTA. As explained in\n   <em>\n    Linde\n   </em>\n   , \"[a]iding an abetting requires the secondary actor to be 'aware' that, by assisting\n   the principal, it is itself assuming a 'role' in terrorist activities.\"\n   <em>\n    Linde\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515951\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/314/\">\n    882 F.3d at 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Halberstam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1858707,3642414\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/705/472/\">\n    705 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   477 ). Thus, JASTA requires Plaintiffs to show that, \"in providing [financial] services, [Defendant] was 'generally aware' that it was thereby playing a 'role' in [the terrorist organization's] violent or life-endangering activities,\" which \"requires more than the provision of material support to a designated terrorist organization.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1858707,3642414\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/705/472/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Halberstam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1858707,3642414\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/705/472/\">\n    705 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   477 ).

However, as discussed in detail above, Plaintiffs present no evidence that creates a jury question as to whether Defendant generally was aware that it played a role in any of Hamas's or even Interpal's or the Union of Good's violent or life-endangering activities.
