(\"ROI\"), Empire Stock Transfer, Inc. (\"Empire\" or \"defendant\"). Plaintiff had contracted to provide marketing and public relations services to ROI in exchange for 500,000 shares of its stock, to be delivered by Empire. Plaintiff sues the transfer agent, alleging claims for conversion, unjust enrichment, imposition of a constructive trust, conspiracy, and aiding and abetting. Empire moves to dismiss the complaint.

In consideration for his services, plaintiff alleges that he was to receive 500,000 shares of ROI stock, restricted for one year but \"fully earned and vested as of May 1, 2015\" and \"eligible to become unrestricted shares during May of 2015.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-9, 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Although plaintiff alleges that he performed under the contract, ROI never delivered the share certificates.

Plaintiff allegedly contacted Price but learned from him that ROI had directed Price to return plaintiff's stock certificates to ROI.

The core of plaintiff's complaint is that defendant failed to deliver to him securities certificates without a restrictive legend (\"clear certificates\"), preventing him from selling the shares. While the alleged mailing of plaintiff's securities certificates to another and their subsequent cancellation\n   constitute misfeasance, the failure to deliver clear certificates-the crux of plaintiff's claim-constitutes nonfeasance and relies on plaintiff's statutory entitlement to the legend's removal. Plaintiff's claim is governed by statute. Such a claim may ultimately be plausible, and Empire's argument that plaintiff an entitlement to the shares, because of plaintiff's dispute with ROI, is inconsistent with defendant's own account statements, which confirm that plaintiff was issued shares of ROI and entitled to certificates, and with defendant's explanation that those certificates were in fact mailed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   I conclude that Plaintiff's conversion claim, as alleged, is thus incomplete and insufficient as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The complaint does not allege, and defendant does not show, that defendant refused to deliver plaintiff's stock certificates earlier than November 7, 2015. Rather, the complaint alleges only that defendant converted shares by cancelling them in the middle of November 2015, making plaintiff's claims timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiffs Remaining Claims Are Dismissed\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiff's remaining claims for unjust enrichment, a constructive trust, and aiding and abetting, and conspiracy are duplicative of his other claims and properly dismissed. \"The basic elements of an unjust enrichment claim in New York require proof that (1) defendant was enriched, (2) at plaintiff's expense, and (3) equity and good conscience militate against permitting defendant to retain what plaintiff is seeking to recover.\"\n   <em>\n    Briarpatch Ltd., L.P v.

May 12, 2017) (\"Where, as here, however, the 'matter is controlled by contract' and the claim for unjust enrichment seeks the same relief as is sought for breach of contract, the unjust enrichment claim is properly dismissed as duplicative.\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Marshall v.

Here, plaintiff's entitlement to unrestricted ROI shares rests on his contract with ROI, and defendant's duties as ROI's transfer agent, which hare defined by statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Similarly, a constructive trust constitutes a remedy rather than a separate theory of liability, and, deriving from plaintiff's duplicative unjust enrichment theory, is also properly dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re First Cent.

Dec. 8, 2000). A conspiracy claim cannot confer further damages beyond the underlying tort, and, with a single defendant in this action, there is no basis for joint liability, and the claim is properly dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2000%20WL%201808977\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    D.
