Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This dispute concerns alleged fraud with regard to thousands of medical claims submitted to State Farm in connection with treatment rendered by defendants to patients who had motor vehicle insurance through State Farm. The Providers and Clinics provide chiropractic and rehabilitative medical services at the Clinics. Slade maintains a website that \"advertises the services provided by the Clinics and provides prospective patients with phone numbers they can call to make appointments at any of Slade's locations.\" ECF 1, \u00b6 51\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Pursuant to Maryland's personal injury protection law (the \"PIP\" law), Md. Code (2017 Repl. Vol., 2018 Supp.), \u00a7 19-505(a)(1)-(3) of the Insurance Article (\"Ins.\"), a motor vehicle liability insurer must provide coverage for the medical expenses of persons involved in motor vehicle accidents. Ins. \u00a7 19-505(a)(1)-(3) provides, in part: \"[E]ach insurer that issues, sells, or delivers a motor vehicle liability insurance policy in the State shall provide coverage for [ ] medical, hospital, and disability benefits\" to the named insured, any family member residing in the insured's household, any individual injured while using the insured motor vehicle with the permission of the named insurer, any individual injured while in the insured motor vehicle, or any individual injured in an accident involving the insured motor vehicle while a pedestrian or operating an animal-operated vehicle or a bicycle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 1, \u00b6 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The PIP benefits cover at least $ 2,500 of \"all reasonable and necessary [medical] expenses that arise from a motor vehicle accident and that are incurred within 3 years after the accident[.]\" Ins. \u00a7 19-505(b)(2)(i) ; ECF 1, \u00b6 60. Notably, these benefits are \"payable without regard to ... the fault or nonfault of the named insured or the recipient of benefits in causing or contributing to the motor vehicle accident[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206514797\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19-507(a)(1); ECF 1, \u00b6 61. Such benefits are often referred to as \"no fault\" benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Insurers, such as State Farm, must \"make all payments of [these] benefits [to covered individuals, such as accident victims] ... periodically as claims for the benefits arise and within 30 days after the insurer receives satisfactory proof of claim.\" Ins. \u00a7 19-508(a); ECF 1, \u00b6 62. If an insurer fails to make timely payment, it must pay the claimant \"simple interest\" on the overdue payments \"at the rate of 1.5%\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   per month.\" Ins. \u00a7 19-508(c); Code of Maryland Regulations 31.15.07.06.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   State Farm alleges that the defendants are engaged in a fraudulent medical billing scheme. According to plaintiff, from at least April 2010 through the suit's commencement on December 14, 2017, the Clinics and Providers have provided treatment and submitted medical bills that \"exploit patients' insurance benefits rather than address the patients' true unique needs.\" ECF 1, \u00b6\u00b6 7, 17. In particular, State Farm asserts that the medical bills and supporting documentation are \"the product of a fraudulent, predetermined treatment protocol (the 'protocol') provided by the Clinics and Providers to accident victims.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. According to State Farm, the Protocol is intended to,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (a) enable the Defendants to fully exploit and collect the patients' No-Fault Benefits, which were typically $ 2,500; (b) not refer the patients to any other health care provider for any other reason, including diagnostic testing (e.g., x-rays, MRIs), physical therapy, or consultations by physicians such as orthopedists or neurologists, to avoid potentially having to share the patients' No-Fault Benefits; and (c) keep the total medical expenses to less than $ 6,000 to \"fly under the radar\" of, and encourage settlements by, the insurance companies to which claims for payment are made and thereby incentivize the patients' lawyers (\"PI Attorneys\") to refer more clients to the Defendants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Further, State Farm alleges that the Protocol involves several steps: (1) an initial examination that is intended not to diagnose patients properly and design a treatment plant, but to report \"substantially similar findings to justify a predetermined course of treatment;\" (2) a treatment plan consisting of \"substantially the same three or more modalities, plus chiropractic manipulations, provided to almost every patient on almost every visit, regardless of the unique circumstances and needs of each patient, to support at least four separate charges for each visit;\" (3) patient discharge from treatment when the defendants' charges total $ 6,000 or less, regardless of the patient's condition; and (4) submission of documentation to State Farm representing that the examinations and treatments were medically necessary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Protocol also \"involves the absence of patient referrals for consultations with any other medical professionals ... who have expertise in diagnosing and treating injuries that the patients might actually have, or to any other providers for diagnostic testing ..., which might be necessary to diagnose and arrive at an appropriate treatment plan for injuries that patients might actually have.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. In State Farm's view, such referrals would be in the best interest of some patients, but against the financial interest of defendants, \"because any such referrals would likely deplete or exhaust the No-Fault Benefits available to the Defendants if those benefits are also owed to other providers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   According to the Complaint, each of the participants (the Owners, the Clinics, Slade, and the Providers) \"had a critical role in the scheme, with each needing the others to successfully carry out and profit from the scheme.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. State Farm claims that the Owners \"through their overlapping ownership interests and control of Slade and the Clinics, were able to design, direct, and oversee the implementation of the Predetermined Treatment Protocol at the Clinics.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Slade \"recruited and funneled to the respective Clinics patients who were the lifeblood of and essential to the economic success of the scheme by advertising the Clinics' services,\n   obtaining information from prospective patients online and through a toll-free number, and arranging appointments for the prospective patients at the respective Clinics.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And, the Providers \"were necessary to the success of the scheme because the laypersons who owned Slade and the Clinics could not prescribe and provide any of the goods and professional services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In other words, the Providers rendered the treatment that was the subject of the fraudulent bills submitted to State Farm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   State Farm also asserts that the Clinics and Providers treated patients who were in staged accidents and therefore not actually injured.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 191. The Complaint alleges staged accidents occurring on five separate dates between November 13, 2011 and March 24, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 191-227. After each staged accident, at least some of the purported accident victims sought care from the Clinics and Providers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 196-99, 211-214, 221, 224-27. State Farm alleges that even though these individuals \"could not have been injured because they were not in actual accidents,\" they \"received the same Predetermined Treatment Protocol as the other patients at the Clinics.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 191.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As noted, defendants have lodged counterclaims against State Farm for defamation (ECF 65, \u00b6\u00b6 25-32); tortious interference with prospective business advantage and economic and business relationships (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-41); and civil conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42-46. They allege,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that State Farm has falsely \"notified third parties expressly and by innuendo of its dishonesty and fraud claims about the Medical Clinics, their owners, and the Treatment Providers who provide medical services to injured accident victims at the Medical Clinics.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Further, they maintain that State Farm has sued them as part of \"a nationwide scheme targeting medical providers treating lower income, minority and immigrant accident victim patients who live in urban areas[.]\" ECF 65, \u00b6 1. State Farm, they claim, creates these \"manufactured and knowingly false accusations of fraud\" to eliminate medical providers, like the Clinics and Providers, \"as sources of available treatment for urban lower income, minority, and immigrant accident victims, and to dramatically drive down medical and bodily injury payments in auto accident claims submitted to State Farm across the county.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   According to the Amended Counterclaim, State Farm has \"proclaimed that it will not pay any future claims for medical treatment\" provided by the Clinics.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. And, it has allegedly told accident victims and third parties that it is denying the medical treatment claims because (1) \"State Farm has filed a lawsuit against\" the Clinics and Providers,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15, and (2) the Clinics, Providers, and Owners \"have [engaged] and are engaging in fraud and dishonesty.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. The counterclaimants allege that the insurer is \"publishing\" these claims \"for the purpose of deterring injured accident victims from obtaining medical treatment at the Medical Clinics.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, State Farm has allegedly told accident victims and their attorneys that it is rejecting \"medical treatment expense claims if the medical expenses relate to medical treatment provided\" by the Providers or Clinics.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. Further, defendants assert that State Farm has acted with \"malice and intent to injure\" them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The counterclaimants do not clearly state in their Amended Counterclaim whether these statements were made orally or in writing. But, they refer to \"oral statements\" in their opposition to the State Farm Motion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF 77 at 15, 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Therefore, I shall assume that the statements referenced above were made orally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In addition, the counter-plaintiffs assert that State Farm has sent claim denial letters to various persons alerting them to the ongoing litigation, \"so that current and future patients and their and other lawyers will know the details of State Farm's defamatory ... statements ... and will not obtain treatment at and/or refer patients to the Medical Clinics in the future.\" ECF 65, \u00b6 23. They also submitted as an exhibit a copy of a claim letter denial. ECF 69-3 at 2-3. In relevant part, the letter states,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2: \"At this time, State Farm ... is denying payment of these bill(s) because the matters giving rise to the charges are at issue in a pending civil lawsuit between East Side Medical Center and State Farm.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Additional facts are included in the Discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

ECF 44-1 at 9;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robinson v. State Farm\n   </em>\n   , Circuit Court of Baltimore City, No. 24-C-12-003732 MT; ECF 1-33 (Deposition of Dr. Kozachuk). Defendants observe that State Farm's attorney asked Dr. Kozachuk several questions indicating that State Farm already believed the Clinics were engaged in a fraudulent protocol. ECF 55-1 at 12. Moreover, they maintain that Dr. Kozachuk's testimony should have alerted State Farm that the Clinics were allegedly engaged in fraudulent practices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   State Farm counters that the Court should accept the allegations in the Complaint (ECF 1, \u00b6 12) that plaintiff did not discover the Protocol \"until sometime after the Fall of 2016,\" after State Farm was \"able to begin to identify the fraudulent patterns described herein in the bills and supporting documentation across more than 4,000 patients.\" ECF 68 at 19. Further, in its view, \"[e]ach bill and its supporting documentation, when viewed in isolation, does not reveal its fraudulent nature.\" ECF 1, \u00b6 12; ECF 68 at 19. Additionally, State Farm asserts that this issue turns on disputed facts and is therefore not properly resolved in connection with a motion to dismiss. ECF 68 at 21-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   According to the Complaint, \"Walter Kozachuk, a medical doctor who treated patients at Mondawmin, among other Clinics, testified in a December 2012 deposition that 'Slade,' an entity named as a defendant in this action, did not permit patients to be referred for outside services, even when it was in the best interests of the patients.\" ECF 1, \u00b6 5. Dr. Kozachuk treated patients at Mondawmin, Eastside, and possibly other Clinics. ECF 1, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 158. The Complaint later alleges that he \"testified he 'wanted to order more complex studies, MRIs, EMG,' but 'Slade' thought it was too costly.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 179 (quoting ECF 1-33 at 7-8, pp. 60-64). Dr. Kozachuk was concerned that Slade refused to order tests he believed were necessary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 179. He \"explained that the refusal to order\n   such tests 'wasn't in the best interest of the patients.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting ECF 1-33 at 9, pp. 66-67).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Dr. Kozachuk was so concerned that he \" 'talk[ed] to the owners [of Slade] a few times,' as well as to the office managers about the fact that he had ordered tests and later found out they were not done.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting ECF 1-33 at 9 p. 68) (second alteration in original). According to Dr. Kozachuk, Slade personnel told him that he could not order certain tests for patients. ECF 1-33 at 8 pp. 61-64. Slade management told Dr. Kozachuk, \" 'The tests were too expensive for the case[.]' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9 p. 65. Dr. Kozachuk told State Farm's attorneys that when he \" 'ran into that road block, [he] left.' \" ECF 1, \u00b6 179 (quoting ECF 1-33 at 9, pp. 67) (alteration in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Complaint also highlights Dr. Kozachuk's testimony that \" 'a lot of times [he] felt that the patient needed more therapy [when] they were discharged', which was 'disconcerting.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing ECF 1-33 at 12, p. 128). Thus, defendants argue that Dr. Kozachuk put State Farm on inquiry notice as to central elements of the alleged protocol. Because the no-fault benefits typically cover $ 2,500 in medical expenses for each accident victim, the defendants allegedly sought to capture as much of these benefits as possible for themselves by refusing to refer patients to other providers, consistent with Dr. Kozachuk's concerns. ECF 1, \u00b6 3. In other words, referring accident victims to providers outside of the Clinics would deplete the amount of no fault benefits available for defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Even if plaintiff possessed \"facts sufficient to cause a reasonable person to investigate further,\" the parties dispute whether \"a diligent investigation would have revealed that the plaintiffs were victims of ... the alleged tort.\"\n   <em>\n    Dual Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1314304\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/383/151/\">\n    383 Md. at 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1314304\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/383/151/\">\n    857 A.2d at 1095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation omitted). State Farm alleges that it \"did not discover and should not have reasonably discovered\" the fraudulent billing \"until sometime after the Fall of 2016,\" after it was \"able to begin to identify the fraudulent patterns described herein in the bills and supporting documentation across more than 4,000 patients.\" ECF 1, \u00b6 12. It contends that \"[e]ach bill and its supporting documentation, when viewed in isolation, does not reveal its fraudulent nature.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. Rather, the fraud emerges \"[o]nly when the bills and supporting documentation across all claims at issue are viewed together as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   State Farm does not explain why it needed 4,000 claims to attempt an investigation. According to the Clinics, Owners, and Slade, plaintiff's exhibits (ECF 1-2 to ECF 1-7) \"detail the 1,605 claims\" State Farm had received from the Clinic defendants between April 1, 2010 and December 6, 2012. ECF 71 at 11 n. 2;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State Farm v. Carefree Land Chiropractic, LLC\n   </em>\n   , CCB-18-1279, ECF 50, at 1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206514797\">\n    2018 WL 6514797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Md. Dec. 11, 2018) (footnote omitted) (emphasis added) (plaintiff alleging a similar protocol \"for chiropractic services and treatments provided to\n   <em>\n    550 patients\n   </em>\n   pursuant to various personal injury claims submitted by the patients.\"). But, whether State Farm needed to review as many as 4000 claims is not dispositive of the issue. A court \"must accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint\" and must \"draw all reasonable inferences [from those facts] in favor of the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   , 637 F.3d at 440.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   It appears that Dr. Kozachuk's deposition was taken in a case where the defendants here were not even parties. Indeed, the Court does was not briefed on the nature of the case and the deposition's relationship to it. Therefore, the Court has no reason to believe that a deposition in an apparently unrelated case should place State Farm on inquiry notice. Further, the deposition does not, on its face, establish the bar of limitations as to the issues and defendants in this case. Dr. Kozachuk's testimony as to Slade and the practices at Mondawmin cannot be used to impute fraud to 21 other defendants, or a fraud scheme of the magnitude alleged here. Indeed, his testimony suggests that the Providers may have been unaware of the Protocol. During the deposition, Dr. Kozachuk was confused when State Farm's counsel referred to a \"protocol,\" and he testified that he was \"not aware\" of a protocol. ECF 1-33 at 6, pp. 51-52. Further, even as to Slade and Mondawmin, Dr. Kozachuk's testimony does not, on its own, establish inquiry notice as to the fraud scheme alleged in the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In sum, on the face of the Complaint the facts and allegations do not lead to the conclusion, as a matter of fact or law, that State Farm's deposition of one doctor, who worked with a limited number of people, apparently at limited locations, put State Farm on inquiry notice as to an alleged massive fraud scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Unjust Enrichment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   As noted, State Farm has sued for unjust enrichment. The Complaint alleges that State Farm conferred a benefit on the defendants, including the Providers, by paying their medical treatment claims.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF 1, \u00b6\u00b6 239, 253, 267. State Farm also alleges that the defendants accepted payments for providing fraudulent medical services.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Providers move to dismiss, claiming that they derived no benefit from the alleged enterprise and therefore they were not unjustly enriched.

Specifically, in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , State Farm seeks judgment to stop paying claims for the counter-plaintiffs' medical services.

First, the suit serves to advance a compelling government interest: the detection and prevention of fraud. Rooting out fraud benefits not only State Farm and its policyholders, but also patients in general, who might otherwise receive unnecessary, deficient, or even dangerous medical services from fraudulent medical providers. Indeed, the State has asserted its interest in the pursuit of fraud, requiring insurers to implement fraud detection measures and cooperate with the prosecution of insurance fraud cases.

State Farm made the allegedly defamatory statements in the context of providing accident victims and their attorneys with a justification for its denial of their medical expense claims.

In the letter, State Farm promises to \"defend, indemnify, and hold ... harmless\" the accident victims for\n   legal actions brought against them by a Clinic for collection of the denied medical treatment claims.

For the same reasons, the defamation claim also must fail as to State Farm's oral statements that it has denied medical expense payments because of the lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   As to the remaining oral statements, the Amended Counterclaim fails to allege enough facts to establish a plausible claim of defamation.

But, the counterclaimants fail to name a single State Farm employee, accident victim, or attorney. Nor do they state whether the oral statements were made in-person or remotely.
