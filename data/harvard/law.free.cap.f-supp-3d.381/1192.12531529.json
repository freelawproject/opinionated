Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This case arises from the fatal shooting of Plaintiff Tony Nunez's son, Anthony Nunez (\"Nunez\") by SJPD Officers Santos and Vizzusi on July 4, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the days leading up to July 4, 2016, 18-year-old Nunez was sad and said he wanted to die. ECF No. 66-1 (\"Chow Decl\"), Ex. A (\"Cervantes Dep.\") at 38:8-40:15; ECF No. 69-17 (\"Buelna Decl.\"), Ex. 10 (\"Coroner's Report\"). On July 4, 2016, sometime before 4:51 p.m., Nunez shot himself in the head at his home, located at 994 Feller Avenue in San Jose, California.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Coroner's Report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 4, 2016, Juan Cervantes, Nunez's cousin, found Nunez lying face down in bed, holding a gun, and bleeding from the self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Cervantes Dep. at 56:16-57:25. Cervantes turned Nunez around and took the gun away from him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61:22-25, 62:1-63:10. Nunez asked for the gun back.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When Cervantes declined, Nunez asked Cervantes to shoot him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Cervantes then called the police.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   63:18-65:8. While Cervantes was on the phone, Cervantes walked down to the corner of Feller and\n   Story.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   While Cervantes was on the phone, Nunez followed him all the way to the corner, and asked again for the gun.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The two then went back into the house.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Cervantes testified that he put the gun in the backyard.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66:25-67:3. When the police arrived, Cervantes went outside to meet the police and told the police that Nunez was in the house and needed help.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80:5-82:9. Cervantes testified that the police searched Cervantes and then took him to a vehicle. Cervantes testified: \"[w]hen they placed me inside the car, a little while after, I heard two shots. After that, they did like a handshake or a like a [high] five, like celebrating or something, like it was a good shot.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the subsections that follow, the Court reviews the incident from the perspective of each officer and witness as well as the security camera footage and cell phone videos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Sergeant Thomas Boyle\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Sergeant Thomas Boyle (\"Sgt. Boyle\") responded to 994 Feller Avenue after learning that a relative of a suicidal person called in and reported that his family member had shot himself in the head. Buelna Decl., Ex. 1 (\"Boyle Dep.\") at 26:22-28:25. Sgt. Boyle heard several units responding and asked dispatch for more details on his way over.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28:5-29:22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On the way there, Sgt. Boyle \"made the decision to have the reporting party [ (Cervantes) ] take the gun and throw it in the backyard.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29:23-25, 31:1. When Sgt. Boyle arrived at 994 Feller Avenue, Cervantes had already left the house and was in custody of the officers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30:11-25. Lieutenant Paul Joseph (\"Lt. Joseph\") later testified at his deposition that he heard Sgt. Boyle's instruction for the gun to be placed in the backyard, and that \"[i]t's not a direction I would have given myself.\" Buelna Decl., Ex. 2 (\"Joseph Dep.\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   at 30:23-32:25. Sgt. Boyle testified that he would expect his officers to communicate to him over the radio if Nunez pointed the gun at anyone. Boyle Dep. at 50:11-51:8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Officer Rubens Dalaison\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Officer Rubens Dalaison (\"Officer Dalaison\"), an officer with crisis intervention team training, was one of the SJPD officers who responded to the call for service at the Feller Avenue address on July 4, 2016. Chow Decl., Ex. B (\"Dalaison Dep.\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   at 22:3-24:24, 27:17-22, 32:15- 25. As Officer Dalaison drove towards the Feller Avenue address, the dispatcher informed him that Nunez was suicidal, had a weapon, and had possibly shot himself, and that other officers were setting up a containment perimeter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32:1-33:21, 37:20-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   When Officer Dalaison arrived at the scene, Officer Dalaison stationed himself across the street from the Feller Avenue house near a tan Chevrolet Suburban.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44:7-22. Officer Dalaison first saw Nunez appear at the threshold of the front door of the house holding a gun as a contact team of officers was approaching, so Officer Dalaison called out \"[s]top, man with a gun,\" and the team retreated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49:23-52:25, 55:20-56:20. The contact team stopped and retreated to the corner of Story and Feller while Officer Dalaison\n   tried to get Nunez's attention.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50:9-23. Officer Dalaison noticed Nunez's head was bleeding and concluded that he had shot himself.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57:1-16. Officer Dalaison also noticed that Nunez was sluggish, like he had got his \"bell rung\" and suffered a concussion to the head.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Nunez stayed in the threshold of the door for approximately seven to ten minutes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60:2-23. During that time, Officer Dalaison observed Nunez raise the gun to his head about four times and Officer Dalaison pleaded to Nunez not to shoot himself.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59:20-62:9. Officer Dalaison asked Nunez to put the gun down and come out to get medical attention.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64:13-17, 66:23-67:16. Nunez did not come out and instead went back inside the house for a couple of minutes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62:11-15, 63:24-64:3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   While Nunez was inside the house, Officer Dalaison moved to where two other officers, Officer Vizzusi and Officer Aneez Raghavan (\"Officer Raghavan\"), had positioned themselves further away from the residence near a blue pickup truck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 69:14-71:9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Nunez next reappeared in the doorway and stepped out onto the porch.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 73:4-19. Officer Dalaison testified at his deposition that Nunez's demeanor at that point seemed to be more \"crisp,\" \"sturdy,\" and \"intentional.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Officer Dalaison yelled out to Nunez to \"[p]ut the gun down,\" and at the time same, Officer Dalaison testified that Officer Dalaison \"turned around to move [him]self back to where Vizzusi was at.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 73:12-75:15. Officer Dalaison testified that the last thing he saw as he turned was that Nunez was moving forward with the gun in his right hand at or above the waistline, with his arm bent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75:2-7. As he relocated, Officer Dalaison heard two, almost simultaneous shots.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 73:23-74:7, 77:6-25, 78:11-80:4. Officer Dalaison testified that he did not see Nunez twirling the gun in his finger.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78:23-24. Officer Dalaison did not include facts about Nunez's demeanor or the position of the gun in Nunez's hand, with the exception that the gun was in Nunez's right hand, in the police report that he wrote on July 4, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Buelna Decl., Ex. 16 (\"Dalaison Police Rpt.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Officer Anthony Vizzusi\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On July 4, 2016, SJPD Defendant Officer Vizzusi and his partner, Officer Raghavan, responded to a dispatch indicating there was a suicidal subject with a gun at 994 Feller Avenue. Chow Decl., Ex. F (\"Vizzusi Dep.\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   at 27:6-28:16. Officer Vizzusi also learned from the dispatch that Nunez had shot himself in the head, that someone was trying to separate a firearm from Nunez, and that someone had requested that someone throw a firearm in the backyard.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29:18-25. Officer Vizzusi and Officer Raghavan approached the Feller Avenue house driving south on Feller after hearing Officer Dalaison's radio call stating that Nunez had come out of the front door holding a firearm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30:1-34:20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The officers arrived and parked their car three to five houses down from 994 Feller Avenue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34:1, 37:23-38:7. As Officer Vizzusi exited the patrol car, Officer Vizzusi saw Nunez on the front porch holding a handgun in his hand at his side.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41:1-42:18. Officer Vizzusi also saw Officer Dalaison, who was holding his service weapon at his side and trying to talk Nunez into dropping the gun.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42:13-43:13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Officer Vizzusi testified that Nunez appeared to be \"not all there,\" and that he \"[d]idnt appear to respond to anything from-like Officer Dalaison was saying.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 70:21-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant Officer Vizzusi took position behind a 1960s Chevy pickup that was located somewhere to the left of Nunez's residence, and placed his rifle on top of the hood. Officer Vizzusi watched Nunez, who remained in front of the house holding the handgun, through the three-power magnifier on his rifle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:4-9, 21:22-25, 52:25-53:1, 60:1-65:25, 66:21-67:2, 83:24-84:4, 6:12-14. Officer Vizzusi testified that his concern increased because Nunez refused to drop the gun.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78:12-79:3. Officer Vizzusi testified that at the time Nunez was first out on the porch, Officer Vizzusi did not see Nunez raise the gun up from his side.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64:1-12. Officer Vizzusi testified at his deposition that he \"never saw Mr. Nunez raise the gun to his own head\" and that \"[p]rior to him coming back out, I did not see him raise a gun to any officers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66:8-15. Officer Vizzusi then observed Nunez walk inside the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Officer Vizzusi testified that he then saw Nunez come back outside a second time and that Nunez \"end[ed] up raising the firearm-twirling the firearm and then raising it\" to about the level of his sternum.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64:1-12, 91:2-92:12. Officer Vizzusi explained: \"it appeared that he was twirling the gun in front of him, and at one point he stop[ped] and he started to lift his gun-you know, lift his hand higher than where he was twirling it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92:22-25. \"At the point that-just about the point when he stopped twirling the gun and he started to lift the gun in our direction, I fired.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 93:7-9. Officer Vizzusi testified that \"[a]t the time I fired, I feared for my own safety, the officers that were on scene, and any other persons that may have been in that area.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 94:5-7. Just prior, but almost simultaneously to pulling the trigger of his rifle, Officer Vizzusi heard another gunshot.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 93:22-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Officer Michael Santos\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant Officer Santos fired the other shot that Officer Vizzusi had heard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On July 4, 2016, Defendant Officer Santos also responded to the scene pursuant to a priority dispatch describing a possibly suicidal man with a gun. Chow Decl., Ex. G (\"Santos Dep.\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   at 31:10-14. Officer Santos parked his car on Story Road, just west of Feller Avenue and met with the officers on the scene to discuss the details of the case, the perimeter, and what the next course of action would be.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33:18-34:15, 35:9-25. Officer Santos learned there was a person with a gun inside the residence with the reporting party, who was a relative in contact with a dispatcher.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35:9-25. Officer Santos then gathered his rifle, which was equipped with a three-power magnifier, and ballistic vest, and set up by a tree in a yard on the northwest corner of the Story Road and Feller Avenue intersection where he could see the front of the house through the magnifier on his rifle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23:2-14, 36:1-39:10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   At some point Officer Santos learned that Cervantes had the gun and was advised to throw the gun into the backyard.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43:8-10. Cervantes then ran out of the house, yelling at the officers to \"go help him\" and that Nunez was \"hurt\" and \"bleeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43:16-48:9. The officers took Cervantes into custody.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Sgt. Boyle then directed Officer Santos and approximately four other officers to form a contact team to approach the 994 Feller Avenue house.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52:16-56:23. Officer Santos was the cover rifle officer with the team.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57:14-15. Prior to approaching the house, Officer Santos learned that Nunez was suicidal and had shot himself in the head.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55:13-56:9. As Officer Santos approached the house with the contact team, he heard other officers say \"[h]e's at the door. He's got a gun.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56:19-24. Defendant Officer Santos and the other officers then retreated back to their positions at the corner of Story and Feller.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57:9-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Officer Santos then relocated to the porch of a house across the street from Nunez's residence to get a better angle to cover the other officers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58:9-25, 60:18-61:13. At this point, Officer Santos was positioned to the right of Nunez's residence, effectively opposite from Officer Vizzusi, who was located to the left of Nunez's residence. From his new position, Officer Santos observed Nunez through his magnifier and his naked eye.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66:21-25. Officer Santos saw Nunez come out of the house, scan the area while holding a gun in his right hand, and then go back into the house.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61:22-66:16. Officer Santos testified that during this time he observed Nunez raise the gun up a couple of times, but that he never saw Nunez raise the gun to his head.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Officer Santos also testified that Nunez raised the gun towards the general direction of the officers once.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65:15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Officer Santos then observed Nunez come back out of the house a second time and \"immediately engage[ ] the officers to the northwest.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 72:16-73:6. Officer Santos observed that Nunez was twirling the gun in his right hand at \"a 90-degree angle, straight out.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 73:5-74:25. Officer Santos observed Nunez twirl the gun approximately three times and then \"stop[ ] and very deliberately point[ ]\" the gun in the direction of the officers to the northwest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 74:1-75:25. Officer Santos then fired at Nunez.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76:1-14. Officer Santos did not hear gunfire prior to pulling his own trigger.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Officer Santos testified at his deposition that he estimated that the time from when Nunez walked out of the house the second time to the time that Officer Santos fired was less than 10 seconds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 73:19-74:7. Officer Santos testified at his deposition that he does not remember if he shot Nunez in the chest or the back.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76:19-77:24. Officer Santos was positioned to the right of Nunez's residence, effectively opposite from Officer Vizzusi, who was located to the left of Nunez's residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   After the shooting, Officer Santos was sequestered and did not speak with Officer Vizzusi or Officer Dalaison before giving a statement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80:20-81:13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Officer Aneez Raghavan\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On July 4, 2016, after arriving at the scene, Officer Vizzusi's partner, Officer Raghavan, learned from Officer Dalaison that there was someone inside the house that had shot themselves in the head and that their cousin had come out of the house. Buelna Decl., Ex. 7 (\"Raghavan Dep.\") at 30:18-31:22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Officer Raghavan testified at his deposition that when he first saw Nunez step out onto the porch, he did not see anything in Nunez's hands.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36:20-37:4. Specifically, Officer Raghavan was asked \"And do you recall if he had anything in his hands?\" to which Officer Raghavan responded \"Nothing.\" Officer Raghavan was also asked \"He didn't have anything in his hands?\" to which Officer Raghavan responded \"Initially, no.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   During that time, Officer Raghavan kept his weapon at a \"low ready\" so that he would be able to\n   react in an \"appropriate and quick manner.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40:3-41:19. Officer Raghavan then observed Nunez go back into the house, and Officer Raghavan called Officer Dalaison over to where Officer Raghavan and Officer Vizzusi were positioned down the street to the left of Nunez's residence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41:20-43:9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Officer Raghavan then observed Nunez reappear on the porch for a second time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45:5-7. Officer Raghavan saw Nunez reach into his side waistband, pull out a gun, and twirl it forward and back.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45:8-47:2. Officer Raghavan then saw Nunez grab the handle of the gun and point it in the direction of the officers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57:5-9. Officer Raghavan testified that he was about to fire when he heard two shots.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Neighbor Charles Thomas\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Neighbor Charles Thomas (\"Thomas\") lives in a house, which is across the street from Nunez's residence. Buelna Decl., Ex. 6 (\"Thomas Dep.\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   at 14:4-25. Thomas was at home talking on the phone with a neighbor, who was in Mexico, when the incident occurred, and Thomas saw Nunez get shot from his kitchen window.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44:11-13, 102:10-104:10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Thomas testified that on the day of the incident, he observed a man appear in the doorway of the 994 Feller Avenue house, look both ways, and then disappear inside the home.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38:1-43:19. Thomas does not know the man's name and did not identify the man as Nunez during Thomas's deposition. Nonetheless, for simplicity in this Order, the Court will refer to the man as Nunez when discussing Thomas's testimony. Thomas testified at his deposition that he did not see anything in Nunez's hands at that time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41:17-24.
