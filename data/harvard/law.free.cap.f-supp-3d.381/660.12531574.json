For the reasons set forth below, the Court affirms the sentence imposed by the Magistrate Judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Shawn Barber (\"Barber\") was charged in June 2017 with simple possession of marijuana and cocaine, which are Class A Misdemeanors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1. After being fully advised of her right to being tried and sentenced by a district judge, Barber signed a form waiving those rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 3. On that form, Barber,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , (1) \"[w]aive[d] [her] right to trial, judgment and sentencing by a United States district judge\"; (2) \"[c]onsent[ed] to being tried, judged, and sentenced by a United States magistrate judge\"; and (3) \"[w]aiv[ed] [her] right to trial by jury before either a United States district judge or a United States magistrate judge.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Government also had to \"consent[ ] to Defendant being sentenced by a United States magistrate judge.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following this waiver, Barber pled guilty to both misdemeanors before Magistrate Judge Roderick Young. ECF No. 2. The parties agreed to pre-judgment probation under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203607\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   whereby Barber was placed on probation for one year with various conditions, including periodic drug testing. ECF No. 5. In other words, no judgment would be entered if Barber complied with the conditions of her probation for one year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   However, Barber did violate her probation. She tested positive for marijuana on several occasions in 2017. ECF No. 7. As a result, her probation was modified to require her to participate in a drug treatment program. ECF No. 6. She was referred to such a program, and failed to report for drug testing on several occasions. ECF No. 7. She also had failed other drug tests.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203607\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Thereafter, the Probation Officer filed a petition for revocation of Barber's probation, and a revocation hearing was held before Magistrate Judge Young on May 7, 2018. ECF Nos. 7, 12. Barber pled guilty to violating her probation and judgment on the initial cocaine and marijuana possession offenses was entered. ECF No. 13. Barber was sentenced to 18 months' probation, with conditions of mental health evaluation, substance abuse treatment and testing, and attendance at 90 Narcotics Anonymous (\"N.A.\") meetings in 90 days. ECF No. 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 1, 2019, the Probation Officer filed a second petition alleging that Barber had once again violated the conditions\n   of her probation.

Barber's mother testified that: (1) Barber had transportation difficulties because her driver's license had been revoked; (2) Barber's Probation Officer had told her (the mother) to wait on paying the special assessment; (3) Barber struggled with mental health issues; (4) Barber lived in a crime-ridden area; and (5) Barber had made efforts at working (which were complicated by her lack of a driver's license).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203607\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   At the end of the hearing, Magistrate Judge Young remanded Barber to custody pending her final hearing a few days later.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203607\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203607\">\n    at 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the February 22 hearing, Barber pled guilty to the remaining three violations of the conditions of her probation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Feb. 22 Hr'g Tr. at 10 (ECF No. 27).

Barber argued that various factors explained her probation violations: that it was difficult to attend 90 N.A. meetings in 90 days because her driver's license had been revoked; that her obligations to her children made complying with the 90-meeting condition difficult; that she was also required to have a job; and that she has struggled with mental health issues.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203607\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203607\">\n    at 13-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Second, she argues that the Court should reverse the Magistrate Judge's sentence of three months' imprisonment, either under\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review or under the deferential standard of review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

That is so, says Barber, because: (1) sentencing on a Class A misdemeanor (as here) is at the \"core of the judicial power\"; (2) an Article III judge must make the \"ultimate determination\" of the exercise of this power\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   ; and (3) the statute governing appeals of magistrate judge sentences mandates that the District Court perform a review that is more deferential than\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review. ECF No. 30 at 3-10. Although Barber consented to sentencing before the Magistrate Judge, she argues that she waived only the right to have the proceedings conducted by a district judge, but did not waive\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the ultimate sentence imposed by the Magistrate Judge.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203742\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203742\">\n    at 9-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Government argues that the review provisions are constitutional; that Barber's arguments rest on a \"flawed premise that Article III compels a particular standard of review\" in this context; and that Barber consented to being sentenced by the Magistrate Judge and cannot now do an \"end-run\" around that consent.

Barber argues that the sentence cannot stand because the Magistrate Judge committed procedural error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 30 at 15-18. That is so, Barber argues, because the Magistrate Judge failed to respond to two non-frivolous mitigation arguments.

The parties and Magistrate Judge Young quite clearly perceived that the Guidelines did not require incarceration. Nothing in the record suggests otherwise, and it is frivolous to advance that notion as a ground for mitigation. Nor can it be seriously said that \"transportation difficulties\" are a non-frivolous ground for attending the requisite number of therapy sessions. Acceptance of that notion would afford many, if not most, defendants an excuse from compliance with that fairly routine requirement. And, somehow, most defendants, even those in rural areas of this district, do not raise the excuse offered here. Instead, they find ways to comply. At least, where, as here, that excuse is tendered with no material evidentiary support, it cannot rightfully be considered a non-frivolous mitigation position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   But, even if these two notions are regarded as non-frivolous, there is no procedural defect in Barber's sentence. Reviewing the transcript of the February 22 revocation hearing (ECF No. 27), it appears that Barber raised, quite briefly, the issue of her license suspension and resulting inability to drive.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. She also raised the fact that the Guidelines allow for home confinement for her offense.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23. The sentencing transcript discloses that, during the presentation of the defendant's position, the Magistrate Judge was fully aware of all mitigation arguments. Magistrate Judge Young stated that he had reviewed the petition, the advisory guidelines, and listened to arguments of counsel where Barber's mitigation was discussed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25. He then listed the \u00a7 3553 factors but did not expressly make a finding on each one.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   24-25. He then imposed the sentence as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   After considering the foregoing, I find that it is -- the only appropriate sentence is to revoke the defendant's term of probation, and to sentence her to a term of three months of imprisonment. And I'm sentencing her to the low end of the guidelines due to her anxiety, her depression, her anorexia and some other mitigating factors that her attorney has raised in his argument by the evidence that he's put forward.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203607\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203607\">\n    at 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While Magistrate Judge Young did not expressly mention Barber's suspension of the driver's license or that he could sentence Barber to home confinement, a review of the record discloses that he was mindful of those arguments when sentencing Barber to the lowest Guideline sentence when her record would have warranted a much greater sentence. Magistrate Judge Young also mentioned several other mitigating facts, like her depression and anorexia. In any event, to reverse a revocation sentence, the Magistrate Judge must have imposed a \"plainly unreasonable\" sentence, and this low-end Guidelines sentence certainly does not fit into that category.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 206.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In sum, the Magistrate Judge's sentence is procedurally reasonable, and accordingly, is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    (2)\n    <em>\n     The Sentence Is Affirmed Under De Novo Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Even assuming that the Court is required to engage in a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the sentence (which it is not), the sentence would be affirmed.

The Government, on the other hand, argues that the Magistrate Judge's three-month sentence is appropriate under\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review because of Barber's repeated probation violations, her resistance of help from the probation office, her breach of the Court's trust, and the fact that non-imprisonment sentences have not worked for Barber.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 37 at 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Considering the factors in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), a three-month sentence, which is the low-end Guidelines sentence, is a most lenient one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In assessing the nature and circumstances of the offense at issue in the revocation proceeding, it is appropriate to note that, on her original conviction for relatively minor drug offenses, Barber was initially sentenced to a deferred-judgment sentence (which would have allowed her to have no judgment of conviction entered had she met the conditions of her probation for one year). Barber responded by continuously violating the terms of her probation, including by failing numerous drug tests and failing to show up at drug testing. Magistrate Judge Young gave Barber further leniency before revoking her probation and sentencing her to prison. But, Barber breached the Court's leniency and trust. She, indeed, made a farce of the leniency and trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   It is true that Barber's history and characteristics reflect that she has struggled with mental health and possible anorexia, which she asserts is the reason that she smokes marijuana. For a time, she was living in public housing in a dangerous area with her two sons. Her driver's license was suspended as a result of this case, which, she says, made it hard for her to get to substance abuse treatment and her N.A. meetings. Barber appears to have a loving family and her parents have offered to take her in whenever she needs. While those facts could be mitigating to some degree, it is more important that Barber has been given significant opportunities to get help and yet continues to violate the terms of probation. When leniency and trust do not work, incarceration is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   When assessing the types of punishment available, the Guidelines call for a 3-9-month term of imprisonment because this is a Grade C probation violation. It is true, as Barber points out, that the minimum term of imprisonment could be served by a term of home confinement. USSG \u00a7 7B1.3(c) (1). However, that is not required; and, given Barber's lack of compliance with the terms of her probation, a prison term is appropriate. And, frankly, a term of at least nine months would be warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Finally, a three-month prison term promotes deterrence and protects the public from Barber's lawless behavior. Barber has been given many chances to get help and to avoid prison. Those opportunities, however, have gone unanswered. And,\n   Barber continues to use marijuana. And, all of that is in breach of the trust imposed by the lenient sentence and other leniency accorded Barber. On this record, and in the face of the many breaches of the Court's trust, it is understandable that a sentence of three months' imprisonment be imposed. A greater term of imprisonment could be justified, but Magistrate Judge Young took a measured approach. Accordingly, even if the Court were to review the sentence\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , the Magistrate Judge's sentence would be affirmed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the sentence of the Magistrate Judge is affirmed.
