As reflected by the memoranda and argument submitted by the parties, the issues now before the court are whether the Commissioner's final decision is supported by substantial evidence, or whether there is \"good cause\" to necessitate remanding the case to the Commissioner for further consideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The plaintiff, Anthony Ferguson, was born on August 23, 1983. He graduated from high school and eventually earned a degree from the University of Phoenix. (Tr. 33). Mr. Ferguson has previously worked as military infantry leader, human resource assistant, cashier, general laborer, and security guard. (Tr. 23). He last worked on a regular and sustained basis in 2013. (Tr. 38, 308). On November 7, 2013, Mr. Ferguson filed an application for a period of disability and disability benefits. In filing his current claim, plaintiff alleged that he became disabled for all forms of substantial gainful employment on July 1, 2013, due to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), right shoulder pain, lower back pain, knee pain, depression, and anxiety. (Tr. 285, 301). Mr. Ferguson now maintains that he has remained disabled to the present time. The record reveals that plaintiff met the insured status requirements of the Act at all relevant times covered by the final decision of the Commissioner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20416\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i) and 423(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Ferguson's application was denied upon initial consideration and reconsideration. He then requested and received a\n   <em>\n    de\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    novo\n   </em>\n   hearing and review before an Administrative Law Judge. In an opinion dated August 2, 2017, the Law Judge also determined, after applying the five-step sequential evaluation process, that Mr. Ferguson is not disabled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1520\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Law Judge found that plaintiff suffers from several severe impairments, including PTSD, generalized anxiety disorder, right\n   shoulder impingement syndrome, and carpal tunnel syndrome, but that these impairments do not, either individually or in combination, meet or medically equal the requirements of a listed impairment. (Tr. 15-16). The Law Judge then assessed Mr. Ferguson's residual functional capacity (RFC) as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   After careful consideration of the entire record, the undersigned finds that the claimant has the residual functional capacity to perform light work as defined in 20 C.F.R. [\u00a7] 404.1567(b) except he can only frequently balance, stoop, crouch, kneel, or climb, occasionally crawl, and never climb on ladders, ropes, or scaffolds. He can occasionally reach overhead with his right upper extremity, occasionally push or pull with his bilateral upper extremities, frequently finger and feel for fine manipulation bilaterally, and frequently handle and grasp for gross manipulation bilaterally. Additionally, the claimant must avoid concentration [sic] exposure to temperature extremes of cold and heat, wetness, humidity, vibrations, excessive loud noise such as jackhammer noise, and hazards including moving machinery and unprotected heights. He can perform simple routine tasks, but no complex tasks, in a low stress work environment defined as occasional decision-making and occasional changes in the work setting. Furthermore, the claimant can have occasional interaction with supervisors and coworkers, but not in team type setting work, and no interaction with the public.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (Tr. 18). Given such a residual functional capacity, and after considering testimony from a vocational expert, the Law Judge determined that Mr. Ferguson is unable to perform any of his past relevant work. (Tr. 23). However, the Law Judge found that plaintiff retains the capacity to perform other work roles existing in significant number in the national economy. In particular, the Law Judge accepted the vocational expert's testimony that an individual with the same limitations as Mr. Ferguson can work as a \"Bakery worker on a conveyor line, DOT code 524.687-022,\" or as a \"Surveillance system monitor, DOT code 379.367-010.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Tr. 24). Accordingly, the Law Judge concluded that Mr. Ferguson is not disabled, and that he is not entitled to a period of disability or disability insurance benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1520\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). The Law Judge's opinion was adopted as the final decision of the Commissioner by the Social Security Administration's Appeals Council. Having exhausted all available administrative remedies, Mr. Ferguson has now appealed to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   While plaintiff may be disabled for certain forms of employment, the crucial factual determination is whether plaintiff is disabled for all forms of substantial gainful employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20423\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2). There are four elements of proof which must be considered in making such an analysis. These elements are summarized as follows: (1) objective medical facts and clinical findings; (2) the opinions and conclusions of treating physicians; (3) subjective evidence of physical manifestations of impairments, as described through a claimant's\n   testimony; and (4) the claimant's education, vocational history, residual skills, and age.\n   <em>\n    Vitek v.

After reviewing the record and considering the parties' arguments, the court finds \"good cause\" to remand the case to the Commissioner for further development and consideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When, as in this case, the Law Judge determines that a claimant's RFC prevents the claimant from performing his past relevant work, the Law Judge reaches step five of the sequential evaluation process.\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

Dec. 27, 2013) (collecting cases). Along similar lines, the Fourth Circuit has held that a limitation to \"short and simple instructions\" apparently conflicts with jobs that require a GED reasoning level of three.\n   <em>\n    Keller v.

App'x 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 197 (4th Cir. 2018). In reaching this conclusion, the Fourth Circuit found it appropriate to consider out-of-circuit precedent addressing a \"simple tasks limitation,\" including the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Zavalin\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=754%20F.%20App%27x%20193\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 197 &amp; n.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In accordance with the foregoing decisions, the court agrees with Mr. Ferguson that an apparent conflict exists between the DOT and the vocational expert's testimony that an individual with plaintiff's RFC can perform the job of surveillance system monitor. As other courts have observed, \"[a] limitation to performing simple tasks appears inconsistent with the requirements of Reasoning Level 3 that the individual be able to [d]eal with problems involving\n   <em>\n    several\n   </em>\n   concrete variables and to carry out instructions in diagrammatic form.\"\n   <em>\n    Eddie v.

Aug. 24, 2017) (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted\n   ). The Law Judge did not address this inconsistency in her opinion or ask the vocational expert to explain why an individual who is limited to performing simple, routine tasks in a low stress environment can nevertheless meet the demands of level-three reasoning. The court concludes that the Law Judge erred in failing to reconcile this apparent conflict and that remand is required.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Mullis v. Colvin\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:11-cv-00022,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202257188\">\n    2014 WL 2257188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *1 (M.D.N.C.
