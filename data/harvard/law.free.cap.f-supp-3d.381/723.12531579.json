The plaintiff is the master of the claim, so he may confine his arguments to those arising under state law even if federal claims are available.

The trial was paused so the parties could provide supplemental briefing and argue this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In an earlier Order, the District Judge presiding over this case determined that jurisdiction was proper under the Class Action Fairness Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 37. When an intervening U.S. Supreme Court decision revealed that conclusion to be incorrect and rendered CAFA unavailing as a source of jurisdiction,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mississippi ex rel.

He reasoned as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Mississippi's complaint challenges EMI's [Entergy Mississippi's] failure to use its discretion to purchase the allegedly cheaper energy from third-party suppliers. Specifically, Mississippi accuses EMI and the other EOCs of failing to \"make a purchase of electricity from a non-affiliate for its/their 'own account.' Entergy Agreement, Sec. 402. Despite this ability to do so, EMI deliberately decided not to pursue less expensive non-affiliate supplies of electricity, and, instead, merely accepted transfers ... of the expensive ESX electricity.\" Mississippi's Complaint at 38.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Mississippi's challenge, then, requires an analysis of the Entergy Agreement. The Entergy Agreement is a FERC tariff, which applies with the force of federal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carter v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2066744\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/365/486/#p496\">\n    365 F.2d 486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 496 (5th Cir. 1966). In essence, Mississippi is suing EMI for its failure to vindicate its federal power to initiate the process of buying energy from a third-party supplier. Mississippi's cause of action, therefore, derives from federal law; this court simply cannot adjudicate Mississippi's claim without determining the precise nature of the discretion vested in EMI by federal law. Whether EMI had the discretion to purchase energy from third-party suppliers-and failed to do so-within the meaning of the federal tariff is an essential element of Mississippi's claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Docket No. 68 at 11-12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the\n   <em>\n    Jenkins\n   </em>\n   federal court action, however, Judge Kent arrived at the opposite\n   conclusion. He found no federal question jurisdiction on the face of the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   None of the Texas common-law or statutory causes of action cited by Plaintiffs in their Petition require the violation of a federal tariff. Conduct that violates the tariff may also violate the [Texas statute] or other common-law duties, but a violation of the tariff is not an essential element to any of Plaintiffs' claims.... Defendants have tried to escape this result through very skillful briefing of the issues in this Motion, but the fact remains that the federal tariff at issue is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   an\n   <em>\n    essential element\n   </em>\n   to any of Plaintiffs' claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Jenkins v.

Tex. Jan. 29, 2004). Without subject matter jurisdiction, Judge Kent remanded the dispute to state court, where Entergy later prevailed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Entergy argues that Judge Kent's decision is not persuasive because it predates\n   <em>\n    Grable &amp; Sons Metal Products v.

In that case, the Fifth Circuit vacated a multi-million-dollar judgment after finding that \"the presence of a federal issue, however much it may dominate the case, is insufficient to confer federal-question jurisdiction. On the contrary, such jurisdiction is conferred by statute only when the plaintiff is asserting a right created by federal law.\" The appellate court continued,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   We are fully aware of the inefficiency and expense to which these [plaintiffs] are being subjected. They properly chose a state forum. When their suit was\n   removed to federal court, they properly moved for a remand, and they supported their motion with the correct legal arguments. Now, after having won a judgment that would have been worth almost $ 4 million, they are being told that they must start all over again in the state court that they originally and correctly chose. We cannot avoid this result, for the rules of federal jurisdiction, while sometimes technical and counterintuitive, are strict and mandatory.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Carter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1380717\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/618/1093/#p1100\">\n    618 F.2d 1093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1100 (5th Cir. 1980),\n   <em>\n    cert. denied\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6297410\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/949/\">\n    450 U.S. 949\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=101%20S.%20Ct.%201410\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=67%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20378\">\n    67 L.Ed.2d 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981).
