PALLMEYER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Attorneys Michael R. Needle and Merle Royce represented a group of plaintiffs in a RICO action filed in this court and settled in 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amari et al. v. Burgess et al.\n   </em>\n   , No. 07 CV 1425 (N.D. Ill.). Both Needle and Royce are entitled to a share of attorneys' fees earned in that case. Before those funds were paid out, Royce brought this interpleader action against Needle's law firm, Michael R. Needle, P.C. (\"MRNPC\"), and the sixteen\n   <em>\n    Amari\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs, seeking an adjudication concerning the distribution of the settlement funds, now on deposit in the court's registry. While the interpleader action was pending, Needle gave a security interest in his firm's share of settlement funds to Mayer Brown LLP (\"Mayer Brown.\") Thereafter, Needle retained Cozen O'Connor (\"Cozen\") to represent MRNPC in the interpleader action. Cozen has since withdrawn, but now claims its own interest in MRNPC's share of the\n   <em>\n    Amari\n   </em>\n   fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Significantly, MRNPC's share of the fees is insufficient to satisfy both Mayer Brown's and Cozen's interests. The question before this court, therefore, is which of their claims takes priority. In an order dated February 4, 2019, the court determined that it has jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute between Mayer Brown and Cozen, but that neither side had adequately briefed it. (February 2019 Order [1075], 1, 5-6.) The court therefore directed the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing the following questions: (1) What state law applies to this dispute? (2) Does the applicable law require that value be given to the debtor in return for a security interest? (3) At what point does each lien attach? (4) Which is superior, an Article 9 security interest or a valid attorney's lien? (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) Having reviewed the parties' supplemental briefs, the court concludes that Mayer Brown's security interest is superior to Cozen's lien. Mayer Brown's motion to enforce its prior perfected lien [963] is therefore granted, and Cozen's motion for immediate payment of funds from the court's registry [961] is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The court assumes familiarity with the procedural and factual background in this\n   case, which is summarized in the February 2019 Order. To further clarify the issues, the court adds the following details.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 20, 2015, Judge Milton Shadur (to whom this case was originally assigned) ruled on the share of the\n   <em>\n    Amari\n   </em>\n   settlement proceeds recoverable as attorneys' fees. (August 2015 Order [130].) Needle's position was that the attorneys-Needle and Royce-should collectively recover sixty percent of the settlement proceeds; but Judge Shadur sided with Royce on this issue, concluding that the attorneys were collectively entitled to one third of the settlement payout. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2, 11; February 2019 Order 2.) After reassignment, on March 12, 2018, this court allocated the one-third attorneys' share between Royce and MRNPC. (March 2018 Order [874].) Specifically, the court awarded sixty percent of the one-third share to MRNPC and forty percent to Royce, over Needle's objection that he is entitled to more than sixty percent. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Needle has appealed both rulings. (February 2019 Order 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   John Cardullo and Sons (\"Cardullo\") was one of sixteen plaintiffs in the\n   <em>\n    Amari\n   </em>\n   litigation. (July 30, 2018 Affidavit of Michael Needle [971] (\"Needle Aff.\") \u00b6 3.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cardullo and fifteen other\n   <em>\n    Amari\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs were represented by Needle in that litigation. (Needle Aff. \u00b6 3.) Needle no longer represents the other fifteen plaintiffs; his work for them ended after\n   <em>\n    Amari\n   </em>\n   concluded. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Needle does still represent Cardullo for certain purposes (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   MRNPC Second Amended Answer, Affirmative Defenses, and Counterclaims (Revised and Undredacted) (\"MRNPC Second Am. Ans.\") [382] \u00b6 10), but does not and cannot represent Cardullo in the present interpleader action,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   presumably because Needle and Cardullo's interests are now in conflict: Cardullo would benefit from maximizing the plaintiffs' share of the\n   <em>\n    Amari\n   </em>\n   settlement, while Needle would benefit from reducing it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Needle Aff. \u00b6 5 (recognizing that Needle and Cardullo have different interests in \"division of the settlement between plaintiffs and lawyers\").)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the summer of 2015, Needle sought representation for Cardullo and contacted Mayer Brown. (Needle Aff. \u00b6 6.) Needle has not explained why he attempted to find counsel for Cardullo, nor why Cardullo was unable to do so on its own. Needle does assert, however, that after\n   <em>\n    Amari\n   </em>\n   settled, he \"came to suspect that the plaintiffs' Management Committee and [Royce] were attempting to divert large amounts of the settlement fund to themselves to the detriment of MRNPC, Cardullo, and other\n   <em>\n    Amari\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) Needle hoped that this interpleader action \"would uncover what had occurred.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) Needle asserts his belief that \"Cardullo's and MRNPC's interests were aligned because both were victims of the same scheme.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Needle suggests that these factors motivated him to retain Mayer Brown for Cardullo. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"After discussions with Mr. Needle and Cardullo's principal, Pat Cardullo,\" Mayer Brown agreed to appear as local counsel for Cardullo. (Affidavit of Howard J. Roin in Support of Mayer Brown Motion to Enforce its Prior Perfected Lien [963-4] (\"Roin Aff.\") \u00b6 4.) Cardullo made Mayer Brown its principal counsel in September 2016, after Cardullo \"was served with a purported distribution schedule under which it would have received only a miniscule amount of the settlement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Cardullo also authorized Mayer Brown to consult with Mr. Needle concerning the facts and background of the case.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Cardullo, however, \"quickly fell far behind in paying Mayer Brown's bills.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) At that time, Needle \"still believe[d] that Cardullo's and MRNPC's interests largely were aligned,\" and thought that \"it would benefit both Cardullo and MRNPC for Mayer Brown to continue to represent Cardullo.\" (Needle Aff. \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In light of the interests that Mayer Brown purportedly shared with MRNPC,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"MRNPC agreed to give Mayer Brown a lien on MRNPC's share of the underlying settlement fund with respect to Mayer Brown's bills.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In agreeing to this proposal, Mayer Brown \"stressed\" to both Cardullo and MRNPC that Mayer Brown represents Cardullo, not MRNPC. (Roin Aff. \u00b6 8.) Mayer Brown and Needle memorialized their agreement concerning the security interest in a letter dated July 27, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mayer Brown Motion to Enforce its Prior Perfected Lien [963] (\"Mayer Brown Mot.\"), 2 \u00b6 6.) By August 15, 2017, Mayer Brown's unpaid bills for representing Cardullo exceeded $ 700,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In contrast with its zeal in obtaining counsel for Cardullo, MRNPC has for lengthy periods proceeded in this case without independent counsel. Between August 2015 and October 2015, attorneys filed appearances for MRNPC but then quit in quick succession: MRNPC's original attorney withdrew from the case in August 2015; MRNPC obtained a new attorney in September 2015; and the new attorney moved to withdraw less than a month later. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appearance [14]; Motion\n   to Withdraw [124]; Order Granting Motion to Withdraw [148]; Appearance [167]; Motion to Withdraw [192]; Order Granting Motion to Withdraw [203].) Additionally, in October 2015, Judge Shadur denied Needle's motion to appear\n   <em>\n    pro hac vice\n   </em>\n   to represent MRNPC. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order [191]; October 23, 2015 Hearing Tr. [200], 20.) Judge Shadur reasoned that because Needle operates MRNPC as its sole member and president, there is no real distinction between Needle and MRNPC; Needle was going to be a key witness in the case; and allowing Needle to serve as both an attorney and a witness would be inappropriate. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   October 23, 2015 Hearing Tr. 4-5, 12-20 (discussing lawyer-witness rule);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   September 19, 2016 Order [403] (\"September 2016 Order\"), 2 (discussing same).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Dismayed by this ruling, Needle delayed for months in obtaining counsel for MRNPC, delaying the resolution of this case as well. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   September 2016 Order 2, stating that Needle's failure to obtain counsel \"effectively shut[ ] down the ability of the lawsuit to proceed in a realistic manner\".) On May 6, 2016, presumably to keep the litigation from coming to a standstill, Judge Shadur granted Needle leave to appear\n   <em>\n    pro hac vice\n   </em>\n   . (Order [279].) But because Needle engaged in \"obstructionist,\" \"inappropriate[ ]\" conduct, Judge Shadur revoked his\n   <em>\n    pro hac vice\n   </em>\n   status on September 15, 2016. (September 2016 Order 2-3, 6.) Judge Shadur ordered Needle and MRNPC \"to obtain responsible new counsel to represent\" MRNPC by October 17, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) He also struck, without prejudice, MRNPC's second amended answer, affirmative defenses, and counterclaims, and all earlier versions thereof. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) Needle did not meet the deadline. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order [424].) Judge Shadur relented in part, reinstating Needle's\n   <em>\n    pro hac vice\n   </em>\n   status for the limited purpose of \"addressing the questions of law posed\" by MRNPC's answer, affirmative defenses, and counterclaims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) But he prohibited Needle from taking discovery \"before the pleadings issues ha[d] been resolved.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On January 13, 2017, Judge Shadur revoked Needle's\n   <em>\n    pro hac vice\n   </em>\n   status yet again. (Order [481].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As of February 2017, Needle had not yet obtained counsel for MRNPC. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Royce Motion for Dismissal of Counterclaim and for Order of Default and for Default Judgment [517] (\"Royce Default Mot.\") \u00b6\u00b6 1, 48.) On February 14, 2017, Royce filed a motion seeking an order of default and default judgment against MRNPC. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Royce contended, among other things, that he was entitled to an order of default because MRNPC had failed to obtain counsel for nearly eleven months. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.) Royce also sought a default judgment awarding him fifty percent of the one-third attorneys' share of the\n   <em>\n    Amari\n   </em>\n   settlement fund. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 73-74, 101.) Royce asserted that he had maintained contemporaneous time records in\n   <em>\n    Amari\n   </em>\n   that support his claim to fifty percent of the share. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75.) Royce contended that Needle did not maintain contemporaneous time records, and that for this and other reasons, MRNPC is not entitled to the larger share it seeks. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 75, 94.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In August 2017, MRNPC, still facing the threatened default, finally obtained Cozen as its counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cozen, Needle, and MRNPC \"entered into a written retention agreement\" on August 29, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cozen Response in Opposition to Mayer\n   Brown's Motion to Enforce its Prior Perfected Lien and Reply in Further Support of its Motion for Payment of Funds from the Court's Registry [1046] (\"Cozen Opp.\"), 5.) Cozen's compensation, as set forth in the agreement, was contingent on MRNPC's recovery and was to be paid from the fee award to MRNPC. According to Cozen, at the time it entered into the retention agreement, neither Needle nor Mayer Brown had notified Cozen of Mayer Brown's security interest in those same funds. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) Three Cozen attorneys entered their appearances on August 30 and 31, 2017. (Appearances [756, 757, 758].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mayer Brown reports that it first learned of Cozen's intention to represent MRNPC on September 1, 2017. (Mayer Brown Mot. 4 \u00b6 14.) That same day, attorney Howard Roin of Mayer Brown wrote in an e-mail to Cozen, \"we should talk about [Needle's] prior letter to my firm committing that Needle PC would pay my firm's fees and granting my firm a lien for that purpose.\" (September 1, 2017 Mayer Brown E-mail, 10:03 a.m. [963-3].) Mayer Brown also attached a copy of the July 27, 2017 letter to the e-mail message. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cozen responded, in relevant part, \"I will leave it to [Needle] to speak with you regarding your prior discussions pertaining to your firm's fee since they are unrelated to our firm's representation of [Needle] in connection with his fee dispute with Royce.\" (September 1, 2017 Cozen E-mail [963-3].) Mayer Brown countered, \"The fees are directly related because we both seek to be paid from the same source, so I would like to be sure we and Mike Needle have an understanding at the outset.\" (September 1, 2017 Mayer Brown E-mail, 11:18 a.m. [963-3].) Needle was copied on all three e-mails. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   September 1, 2017 E-mails.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Despite this warning (\"we both seek to be paid from the same source\"), Cozen asserts that \"[n]othing in [this] correspondence expressed that Mayer Brown sought to be paid before Cozen received its fee.\" (Cozen Opp. 5-6.) Cozen also contends that in other correspondence on September 1, 2017, \"Needle advised [it] that Mayer Brown did not have a valid lien, and was not seeking to be paid before Cozen received payment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 (citing Elliott R. Feldman Declaration in Support of Cozen Petition to Adjudicate and Enforce Attorney's Lien [910-1] \u00b6 8).) If that correspondence is in the record, the court has not been able to locate it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On September 14, 2017, Mayer Brown filed a UCC financing statement with Pennsylvania's Secretary of the Commonwealth.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Mayer Brown Mot. 8 \u00b6 34.) Cozen states that on October 10, 2017, Needle \"advised [attorneys at Cozen] that Mayer Brown was unwilling to compromise its position concerning its purported priority lien on MRNPC's share of the funds.\" (Cozen Opp. 8.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"As a result, Cozen notified MRNPC\" that it intended to withdraw from representation after thirty days. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Before Cozen moved to withdraw, however, it filed a sur-reply in opposition to Royce's default motion [770]. As a result, the court declined to enter a default order against MRNPC. On October 27, 2017 and November 8, 2017, \"Cozen served Needle, MRNPC, Royce and his attorney with a\n   Notice of Attorney's Lien\" under the Illinois Attorneys Lien Act. (Cozen Opp. 7;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Cozen Statutory Lien Notices [881-3].) Cozen moved to withdraw on November 13, 2017 [795], and the court granted the motion on November 21, 2017 [806].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After Cozen withdrew, Needle retained another attorney, Frank Fusco, to represent MRNPC. At this court's direction, on December 14, 2017, Fusco, on behalf of MRNPC, and counsel for Royce filed simultaneous five-page briefs on the appropriate division of the one-third share of the\n   <em>\n    Amari\n   </em>\n   settlement fund between Royce and MRNPC [833, 834]. As explained above, this court determined that MRNPC should receive sixty percent of the share and Royce should receive forty. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   March 2018 Order 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As of September 2017, the\n   <em>\n    Amari\n   </em>\n   settlement fund was being held in Royce's escrow account at a Northern Trust bank in Chicago, Illinois. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cozen Supplemental Brief in Opposition to Mayer Brown's Motion to Enforce its Prior Perfected Lien and in Further Support of its Motion for Payment of Funds from the Court's Registry [1083] (\"Cozen Supp. Br.\"), 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Royce December 2017 Motion for Leave to Transfer Escrow to Court's Registry [849].) On or around January 3, 2018, Royce transferred the funds into the court's registry. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   January 3, 2018 Order [858].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Mayer Brown now asks this court to find that its interest in MRNPC's share of attorneys' fees has priority over Cozen's interest. Specifically, Mayer Brown argues that its security interest \"attached\" to MRNPC's share of fees, and that Mayer Brown \"perfected\" that interest by filing a financing statement on September 14, 2017, trumping any interest held by Cozen. Cozen disputes that Mayer Brown holds a security interest of any kind. Moreover, Cozen contends that even if Mayer Brown holds a perfected security interest, Cozen's own interest (which Cozen believes to be either a statutory attorney's lien, a charging lien, or an interest based in the common fund doctrine) is superior. These disputes create three distinct questions for the court to decide: (1) whether Mayer Brown has a valid and enforceable security interest, (2) whether Mayer Brown perfected that interest, and (3) whether, in any event, Mayer Brown's interest is trumped by one held by Cozen. The court addresses these questions in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Because the court is sitting in diversity, it applies Illinois choice-of-law rules to determine which state's law must be applied to each of these issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heiman v.

Each state's courts have interpreted Article 9 in differing ways that may be material to the outcome of the attachment issue. Indeed, the parties' dispute suggests they themselves acknowledge that varying interpretations of the UCC may be material to the outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   There is, unfortunately, no provision of the UCC that governs choice of law in these circumstances. Article 9 itself includes a choice-of-law provision, but it expressly governs only disputes based on perfection or priority. Specifically, Part 3 of Article 9, titled \"Perfection and Priority,\" sets out rules for determining which law ought to govern \"perfection, the effect of perfection or nonperfection, and the priority of a security interest in collateral.\" 810 ILL. COMP. STAT. 5/9-301. This statute therefore does not govern the immediate issue: whether an enforceable security interest exists at all.\n   <em>\n    See Peb Report:\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Article 9 Perfection Choice of Law Analysis Where Revised Article 9 Is Not in Effect in All States by July 1, 2001\n   </em>\n   [hereinafter \"Peb Report\"], 56 BUS.

Rules relating to attachment appear in a different section of the UCC; that section, Part 2, \"Effectiveness of Security Agreement; Attachment of Security Interest; Rights of Parties to Security Agreement,\" does not contain its own choice-of-law provision.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   810 ILL.

Nor do the parties' places of business answer the question: Mayer Brown is headquartered in Illinois, whereas MRNPC is headquartered in Pennsylvania. The relevant conduct, however, seems to have taken place substantially in the Northern District of Illinois. This is, after all, where\n   <em>\n    Amari\n   </em>\n   was litigated and settled, creating the fund that Mayer Brown seeks to draw on. It is also where Mayer Brown litigated the case for which it now seeks fees. The court concludes that Mayer Brown and MRNPC's relationship, to the extent it was \"centered\" anywhere, was in the Northern District of Illinois and will therefore apply Illinois substantive law and precedent to the attachment issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

COMP. STAT. 5/9-203(a). With certain exceptions that are inapplicable here, \"a security interest is enforceable against the debtor and third parties with respect to the collateral only if (1) value has been given; (2) the debtor has rights in the collateral or the power to transfer rights in the collateral to a secured party; and (3) one of [four additional conditions] is met ....\" 810 ILL. COMP. STAT. 5/9-203(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The parties' dispute regarding the enforceability of Mayer Brown's security interest concerns only the \"value has been given\" requirement. Cozen recognizes that Illinois law governs the issue of enforceability because \" Section 5/9-203 does not make the type of collateral ... determinative of the applicable state law\" and the court is sitting in diversity in Illinois. (Cozen Supp. Br. 3-4.) According to Cozen, Illinois appellate courts interpret the \"value has been given\" language \"to require that the creditor must give value\n   <em>\n    to the debtor\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 (emphasis added) (citing, among other cases,\n   <em>\n    Metro.

Cozen concludes that as a result, Mayer Brown's security interest is unenforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Mayer Brown responds that Cozen has the law wrong, and that \"neither Illinois nor Pennsylvania law requires that value must be given\n   <em>\n    to the debtor\n   </em>\n   .\" (Mayer Supp. Br. 5.) The words \"to the debtor\" are not present in the relevant UCC provision, Mayer Brown emphasizes, and the case law does not support the proposition that a security interest is unenforceable unless the secured party has given value to the debtor. To the extent the court in\n   <em>\n    Metropolitan Life\n   </em>\n   suggests there is such a requirement, it \"incorrectly paraphrase[s]\" the UCC provision and relies on a case that does the same. (Mayer Brown Reply 5 n.5.) And, Mayer Brown observes, the language is\n   <em>\n    dictum\n   </em>\n   ; the\n   <em>\n    Metropolitan Life\n   </em>\n   case does not discuss whether a security interest is enforceable where the creditor gives value to someone other than the debtor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, Cozen has not cited any\n   case directly holding that a security interest is unenforceable in that circumstance.

Specifically, Article 9 provides that \"Except as otherwise provided in this Section, while a debtor is located in a jurisdiction, the local law of that jurisdiction governs perfection, the effect of perfection or nonperfection, and the priority of a security interest in collateral.\" 810 ILL.

Because the debtor, MRNPC, is located in Pennsylvania, Mayer Brown continues, Pennsylvania law governs the perfection and priority of the security interest. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mayer Brown Mot. 7 \u00b6 28; Mayer Brown Supp. Br. 4 &amp; n.3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Cozen argues that Mayer Brown's security interest is in a \"deposit account,\" which is distinct from other \"collateral\" for purposes of Article 9. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cozen Supp. Br. 5.) The distinction is critical because under Article 9, the location of the deposit account-rather than the location of the debtor-determines the state law applicable to perfection and priority issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   810 ILL. COMP. STAT. 5/9-304(a) (\"The local law of a bank's jurisdiction governs perfection, the effect of perfection or nonperfection, and the priority of a security interest in a deposit account maintained with that bank.\"); 13 PA. CONS. STAT. \u00a7 9304(a) (same). According to Cozen, the settlement fund was in Royce's escrow account at an Illinois bank in September 2017, when Mayer Brown \"attempted to perfect its alleged security interest.\" (Cozen Supp. Br. 5.) Cozen maintains, therefore, that Illinois law governs issues of perfection and priority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In its February 2019 Order, the court noted that UCC provisions regarding \"deposit accounts\"\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   be applicable to the parties' dispute. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   February 2019 Order 6.) The court requested supplemental briefing on this and other issues. Cozen and Mayer Brown have provided very little analysis regarding deposit accounts in their supplemental briefing. Cozen's argument that Mayer Brown has a security interest in a deposit account is limited to the facts recounted in the preceding paragraph. Mayer Brown, for its part, contends only that the UCC defines collateral to include \"proceeds to which a security interest attaches,\" and argues that its \"collateral is in MRNPC's share of the settlement fund, not the court registry itself.\" (Mayer Brown Supp. Br. 4 n.3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The court concludes that Mayer Brown's security interest is in collateral, not a \"deposit account.\" Under Article 9, a \"deposit account\" means \"a demand, time, savings, passbook, nonnegotiable certificates of deposit, uncertificated certificates of deposit, nontransferrable certificates of deposit, or similar account maintained with\n   a bank. The term does not include investment property or accounts evidenced by an instrument.\" 810 ILL. COMP. STAT. 5/9-102(a)(29) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   13 PA. CONS.

This argument has some merit, but it ignores that additional work was required to create the fund that is at issue here: MRNPC's\n   <em>\n    share\n   </em>\n   of the settlement fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Mayer Brown next contends that Cozen did not substantially or primarily produce MRNPC's share, either. Mayer Brown's arguments in this regard have more traction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   First, of course, Cozen contributed nothing to the decision that the\n   <em>\n    Amari\n   </em>\n   attorneys would receive one-third of the settlement fund; Judge Shadur made that determination \"long before Cozen was involved\" in this litigation. (Mayer Brown Supp. Br. 12.) In any case, Judge Shadur's ruling was adverse to MRNPC's position that the attorneys should recover a much larger share of the settlement proceeds. Cozen was retained to litigate the dispute concerning the fee division between MRNPC and Royce, but Mayer Brown argues that Cozen \"had little if anything to do with\" the resolution of that dispute, either. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mayer Brown notes that on November 2, 2017, the court \"ordered MRNPC and Royce to file 5-page briefs concerning the division of the attorney's fees,\" and ultimately \"referred to\" those briefs \"as a basis for its decision\" to split the fees 60/40 between MRNPC and Royce, respectively. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Cozen moved to withdraw from the case on November 13, 2017, and it was MRNPC's new counsel (Fusco) who filed the court-ordered brief on December 14, 2017. Mayer Brown argues that this timeline, together with Cozen's billing records, show that Cozen \"played no role in that brief.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 &amp; n.7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Cozen emphasizes that it discussed the fee division issue in the sur-reply opposing Royce's default motion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cozen Opp. 7.) In moving for default, Royce had argued that the court should split the fees 50/50. Cozen responded that because MRNPC \"contributed substantially more hours than Royce\" to the\n   <em>\n    Amari\n   </em>\n   case, MRNPC should receive a larger share of the fees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Cozen contends that to prepare this argument, it spent \"many hours\" analyzing documents and conferring with Needle \"to gain an understanding of\" his time-recording system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The court recognizes that Cozen worked diligently for MRNPC, and that the representation was a challenging one. Needle's reconstructed time records appear to be the only materials that Cozen attorneys had at their disposal to determine exactly what Needle did to earn his fee in\n   <em>\n    Amari\n   </em>\n   . Cozen made a meaningful effort to analyze the records and present them to the court. In addition, as Cozen emphasizes, it staved off a default judgment against MRNPC by stepping into the case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cozen Supp. Br. 13.) And the court stated earlier that Cozen's services were \"substantially related to [its] determination of the share of [the] funds ultimately awarded to MRNPC.\" (February 2019 Order 8; Cozen Supp. Br. 13 (quoting same)). Having now reviewed Pennsylvania law and the parties' supplemental briefs, however, the court concludes that Cozen's work did not in fact \"substantially or primarily\" produce MRNPC's share of the fund.\n   <em>\n    Recht\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1296702\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/402/599/#p608\">\n    402 Pa. at 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=168%20A.2d%20134\">\n    168 A.2d at 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   First, although Cozen likely saved MRNPC from default, Cozen's efforts in this regard are fairly characterized, in the language of the\n   <em>\n    Recht\n   </em>\n   court, as \"valuable\" work in a separate stage of the proceedings or efforts that \"set in motion a chain of events\" that ultimately produced the 60/40 fee division.\n   <em>\n    Recht\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1296702\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/402/599/#p608\">\n    402 Pa. at 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=168%20A.2d%20134\">\n    168 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   139 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Indep.

Second, in determining that the attorneys' portion of the fund should be split 60/40 between MRNPC and Royce, the court could not credit Needle's reconstructed time records because it concluded they were largely unreliable. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   March 2018 Order 3.) The court recognizes that Cozen engaged in substantial effort on behalf\n   of MRNPC,\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   but it is not clear that the work it performed contributed in any way to Fusco's fee-division brief. Third, as Mayer Brown points out, Royce proposed a 50/50 fee split in his default motion. Cozen, therefore, could have contributed, at most, the additional ten percent of the fees to which MRNPC is now entitled. That amounts to approximately $ 70,000-far less than MRNPC's total share: $ 674,928.75. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mayer Brown Supp. Br. 13.) It is also \"far less than the $ 126,663.66 that Cozen claims it is entitled to be paid.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13 n.10.) Pennsylvania law sets a high bar for proving that attorneys' legal services \"substantially or primarily\" contributed to a fund, and Cozen's legal services, though valuable, do not meet it. Because Cozen cannot satisfy the second\n   <em>\n    Recht\n   </em>\n   factor, it does not have a right to a charging lien.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Recht\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1296702\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/402/599/#p608\">\n    402 Pa. at 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=168%20A.2d%20134\">\n    168 A.2d at 138-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (all factors must be present);\n   <em>\n    Shenango Sys.

(Cozen Supp. Br. 14.) Specifically, the class of beneficiaries (MRNPC, Cozen, and Mayer Brown) are \"sufficiently identifiable\"; \"the benefits can be accurately traced to\" Cozen's efforts; and \"the fee can be 'shifted' with exactitude to those benefitting ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15.)

Cozen can meet that test: Cozen's attorneys invested substantial time and effort in representing MRNPC and successfully defended it against Royce's default motion. Royce had proposed a 50/50 fee split, meaning that if the court had granted the motion, it likely would have divided the fund evenly between Royce and MRNPC. Cozen's work allowed MRNPC to continue pressing its claim that it was entitled to more than fifty percent of the fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The factors generally present in the Pennsylvania common fund decisions are also present here. Mayer Brown does not dispute that the class of beneficiaries is small. And although Mayer Brown contends that \"it is impossible to accurately trace Cozen's contribution\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mayer Brown Supp. Br. 11 n.6), the court disagrees for the reasons just discussed. Finally, in light of the court's determination that Cozen protected or preserved at least the additional ten percent of the fund (which amounts to approximately $ 70,000 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mayer Brown Supp. Br. 13)), \"the fee can be shifted with some exactitude to those benefitting.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Second Pennsylvania\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6469780\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/192/663/#p666\">\n    192 B.R. at 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The court concludes that Cozen has a right to recover fees from MRNPC's share under the common fund doctrine. The analysis, however, does not end here. Rather, the court must determine whether Cozen's right is superior to Mayer Brown's secured interest. Cozen does not expressly\n   argue that its right was first in time (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Cozen Supp. Br. 14-15), and such an argument does not appear to be viable in any event. Indeed, although MRNPC and Needle retained Cozen on August 29, 2017, the question whether Cozen's legal work created or preserved the fund could not be answered until Cozen completed the work. Mayer Brown perfected its security interest before that occurred. The question before the court, then, is whether Mayer Brown's prior perfected interest is superior to Cozen's right to recover fees under the common fund doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The court has found very little case law that addresses this question. (Cozen and Mayer Brown, moreover, have provided virtually no guidance.) In\n   <em>\n    In re Second Pennsylvania\n   </em>\n   , which Cozen cites, the court determined that a law firm could recover fees under the common fund doctrine ahead of a mortgagee whose secured interest was first in time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6469780\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/192/663/#p666\">\n    192 B.R. at 665-66, 670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For numerous reasons, the court concluded that the mortgagee would be unjustly enriched \"at the expense of\" the attorney seeking fees, rather than the mortgagor, if it were allowed to recover first.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6469780\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/192/663/#p666\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6469780\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/192/663/#p666\">\n    at 670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the notion that Mayer Brown would be unjustly enriched at Cozen's expense if allowed to recover first is less obvious; before Cozen became involved in the interpleader action, Mayer Brown sought the security interest to ensure it would be compensated for years of legal work in the same action, as well as for future legal work that Mayer Brown completed. In addition, as the court noted in its February 2019 order, the weight of authority holds that prior perfected security interests are superior to later attorneys' liens. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   February 2019 Order 11-12 (collecting cases applying,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Kentucky, Arkansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Virginia, Florida, and Washington law).) This rule should apply equally to a claim for fees under the common fund doctrine which, in Pennsylvania, is rooted in equitable principles similar to those on which charging liens are based.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Appeal of Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1169605\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/323/124/#p130\">\n    323 Pa. at 130-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=186%20A.%2092\">\n    186 A. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   95 ;\n   <em>\n    Couy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"891723\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/402/468/#p470\">\n    402 Pa.

App'x at 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court applies the rule here and concludes that although Cozen is entitled to recover fees under the common fund doctrine, it can do so only after Mayer Brown has enforced its security interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   This result is somewhat troubling in these circumstances: Mayer Brown is representing Cardullo, but is being paid by MRNPC, which is Cardullo's adversary vis-\u00e0-vis the distribution of the overall settlement fund. Not all of the equities militate in favor of Cozen, however. Cozen's client, Needle, reportedly hid his relationship with Mayer Brown from his own lawyers, but there is documentary evidence that Mayer Brown notified Cozen of its security interest in MRNPC's share on September 1, 2017, just three days after Cozen filed its appearance on behalf of MRNPC. Cozen contends that Mayer Brown did not make clear that it would seek \"to be paid before Cozen received its fee\" (Cozen Opp. 5-6), but it is not clear what else Mayer Brown could have meant: in its September 1, 2017 e-mail, Mayer Brown warned that it and Cozen \"both seek to be paid from the same source ....\" (Mayer Brown September 1, 2017 E-mail, 11:18 a.m.) Even assuming Cozen was initially unaware that Mayer Brown would seek to be paid first, the court would expect that Cozen would promptly seek and obtain clarity. Doing so, the court estimates, should have been accomplished in just a few days. Instead, Cozen spent \"many hours\" working on MRNPC's case and \"pursued resolution with Mayer Brown\" until October 10, 2017. (Cozen Opp. 7-8.) On that date, Cozen argues, it first discovered that \"Mayer Brown was\n   unwilling to compromise,\" and therefore began the process of withdrawing from the case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Cozen's commitment to its client may be admirable, but its failure to take appropriate, timely measures to protect itself from the foreseeable impact of Mayer Brown's security interest has consequences. Additionally, Cozen's argument that the equities weigh in its favor because Mayer Brown has an alternative source of payment-Cardullo-is unpersuasive. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cozen Supp. Br. 15-16.) Namely, Cozen cites no authority for the proposition that Mayer Brown's ability to seek fees from another source is outcome-determinative on the priority of a perfected security interest, of which Mayer Brown promptly notified Cozen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Illinois Rules of Professional Conduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Cozen finally argues that MRNPC's agreement to give Mayer Brown a security interest in its share of the fund violates Illinois Rule of Professional Conduct 5.4(a). (Cozen Opp. 12.) Rule 5.4(a) provides that, with exceptions not applicable here, \"[a] lawyer or law firm shall not share legal fees with a nonlawyer.\" ILL. S. CT. RULES OF PROF.

Comment Two to Rule 5.4(a) cross-references Rule 1.8(f), which provides that a lawyer can accept compensation from a third party \"as long as there is no interference with the lawyer's independence of judgment or with the client-lawyer relationship\"; \"the client gives informed consent\"; and the lawyer protects the client's information as otherwise required by the rules. ILL. S. CT. RULES OF PROF. CONDUCT Rule 1.8(f) ; ILL. S. CT. RULES OF PROF. CONDUCT Rule 5.4(a), cmt. 2. Relatedly, in\n   <em>\n    O'Hara\n   </em>\n   , the Illinois Supreme Court provided examples of the \"harms\" that fee-sharing arrangements between attorneys and non-attorneys can cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5563734\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/127/333/#p343\">\n    127 Ill. 2d at 342-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=537%20N.E.2d%20730\">\n    537 N.E.2d at 734-35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20Ill.%20Dec.%20401\">\n    130 Ill.

But that agreement does not implicate Rule 5.4 concerns. MRNPC earned the relevant fees in the\n   <em>\n    Amari\n   </em>\n   litigation, which \"was over\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   MRNPC\" granted the security interest to Mayer Brown. (Mayer Brown Reply 8.) The agreement, therefore, cannot possibly have impacted MRNPC's \"professional independence of judgment\" in\n   <em>\n    Amari\n   </em>\n   . ILL. S. CT. RULES OF PROF. CONDUCT Rule 5.4(a), cmt. 1. Mayer Brown, for its part, has not agreed to share fees with a non-attorney.

But the court concludes that the security interest is enforceable and takes priority over a subsequent lien, as well as over an interest in the fees under Pennsylvania's common fund doctrine. The court therefore grants Mayer Brown's Motion to Enforce its Prior Perfected Lien [963] and denies Cozen's Motion for Payment of Funds from the Court's Registry [961]. Because there was no previous ruling on this motion, the court continues to believe Mayer Brown's pending appeal as to this issue was premature. This order is, however, now final and appealable.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    According to Cardullo's Counterclaims and Crossclaims in the present action, Needle represented Cardullo in a Pennsylvania state court action before Cardullo joined the\n    <em>\n     Amari\n    </em>\n    litigation as a plaintiff. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Cardullo Counterclaims and Crossclaims [709] \u00b6\u00b6 19-23.) In the state court action, Cardullo sued International Profit Association (\"IPA\"), the same entity that the\n    <em>\n     Amari\n    </em>\n    plaintiffs sued. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 1, 21.) The court dismissed Cardullo's case without prejudice in 2006 due to an Illinois forum selection clause. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 22.) Cardullo contends that \"[i]n 2007, after learning of Cardullo's suit against IPA, including its large damages claim,\" the\n    <em>\n     Amari\n    </em>\n    plaintiffs \"solicited Cardullo to join\" the\n    <em>\n     Amari\n    </em>\n    litigation.

At that time, Cardullo was already represented by Robert Gamburg, an attorney from a different, Pennsylvania-based law firm.

Neither Mayer Brown nor Cozen discusses (or even mentions) how Gamburg came to represent Cardullo and no party has explained what Gamburg's role has been in the case. The fact that Cardullo had other counsel in October 2015 adds to the court's uncertainty about the reasons for Needle's efforts in soliciting Mayer Brown to represent him.

MRNPC was not a plaintiff in\n    <em>\n     Amari\n    </em>\n    , so it does not have any claim to the plaintiffs' portion of the settlement fund. Indeed, what is more obvious than any alignment of interests is the\n    <em>\n     conflict\n    </em>\n    of interest between MRNPC and Cardullo: MRNPC seeks to maximize the attorneys' share of the settlement fund, while Cardullo benefits from a division that maximizes the plaintiffs' share. Mayer Brown does not explain in its briefing how it could, without violating its ethical obligation to Cardullo, provide assistance to MNRPC's challenge to Judge Shadur's thirty-percent ruling. Separately, Mayer Brown has not satisfied the court that any of the work it performed for Cardullo could support MRNPC's appeal of this court's decision to award MRNPC only sixty percent of the attorneys' thirty-percent share.
