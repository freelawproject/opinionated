Gen. Stat. \u00a7 20-24.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), because of Plaintiffs' failure to pay court fines and costs for motor vehicle violations. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief against Defendant Torre Jessup, in his official capacity as Commissioner of the North Carolina Division of Motor Vehicles (\"DMV\"), for enforcing section 20-24.1(a)(2) against them in alleged violation of their equal protection and due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Specifically, Plaintiffs - who have limited financial means - claim that it is unconstitutional for the DMV to revoke their driver's licenses for failure to pay fines and costs without first affirmatively determining that they have the ability to pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the court are the Commissioner's motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) (Doc. 46) and Plaintiffs' motions for class certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) (Doc. 36) and preliminary injunction pursuant to Rule 65 (Doc. 38). For the reasons set forth below, the Commissioner's motion for judgment on the pleadings will be granted in part and denied in part, Plaintiffs' motion for class certification will be granted, and Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Like many states, North Carolina has enacted statutes directing the revocation\n   of driver's licenses for failure to pay fines and costs imposed for traffic violations. The statutory scheme works as follows: North Carolina courts \"must report\" to the DMV the name of a traffic defendant who \"fail[s] to pay a fine, penalty, or costs within 40 days of the date specified in the court's judgment.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2020-24.2\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 20-24.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). Upon receipt of this notice, the DMV \"must revoke\" the traffic defendant's driver's license indefinitely.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2020-24.2\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 20-24.1(a). Revocation is accomplished through the DMV's issuance of a \"[r]evocation order[ ]\" to the traffic defendant that becomes \"effective on the sixtieth day after the order is mailed or personally delivered to the person.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2020-24.2\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Unlike some states, North Carolina provides a procedure by which traffic defendants can avoid or undo license revocation by showing that their failure to pay is no fault of their own.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 20-24.1(b)(4) states that a traffic defendant may \"demonstrate[ ] to the court that his failure to pay the penalty, fine, or costs was not willful and that he is making a good faith effort to pay or that the penalty, fine, or costs should be remitted.\" If the court determines that the traffic defendant has made a sufficient showing, the court notifies the DMV; upon receipt of this notice, the DMV is required to rescind any revocation order (if the order is pending but not yet in effect) or restore the traffic defendant's license (if the revocation order has already gone into effect).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2020-24.2\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 20-24.1(b), (c). Moreover, section 20-24.1(b1) expressly provides an opportunity for traffic defendants to address their ability to pay: \"A defendant must be afforded an opportunity for a trial or a hearing within a reasonable time of the defendant's appearance ... [u]pon motion of [the] defendant.\" The revocation orders the DMV issues to traffic defendants cite to section 20-24.1 but do not mention any of its provisions or otherwise refer to the ability-to-pay exception. (Doc. 35 \u00b6 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Named Plaintiffs Nichelle Yarborough and Sharee Smoot are low-income North Carolinians whose licenses have been suspended by the DMV for failure to pay fines and costs. (Docs. 5, 41.) Named Plaintiffs Seti Johnson and Marie Bonhomme-Dicks are low-income North Carolinians who currently owe fines and costs for traffic violations, and who are in imminent danger of license revocation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docs. 4, 40, 63.) The named Plaintiffs claim that they are unable to pay the fines and costs imposed on them and that neither the state court nor the DMV has inquired into their ability to pay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 35 at 1-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The named Plaintiffs are not alone. In the three-year period prior to the initiation of this lawsuit, about 55,000 traffic defendants received a revocation order but made their payments prior to the revocation\n   date. (Doc. 62.) About 68,000 traffic defendants failed to make their payments by the revocation date, had their licenses revoked, but eventually made the payments sometime thereafter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) About 63,000 traffic defendants never made their payments, and their licenses remain revoked. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 30, 2018, Johnson and Smoot initiated this lawsuit. (Doc. 1.) Plaintiffs claim that the DMV's enforcement of section 20-24.1 violates the Fourteenth Amendment in three ways: (1) by violating their equal protection and substantive due process right not to be penalized for non-payment without the State first determining that they were able to pay and willfully refused; (2) by violating their procedural due process right to a hearing on ability to pay prior to revocation; and (3) by violating their procedural due process right to adequate notice. (Doc. 35 at 32-38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs contemporaneously moved for class certification (Doc. 3) and for preliminary injunction (Doc. 2), but later withdrew them in order to file an amended complaint (Doc. 35) on August 7, 2018, adding Yarborough and Bonhomme-Dicks as Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs then filed second motions for class certification (Doc. 36) and for preliminary injunction (Doc. 38). The Commissioner answered the amended complaint (Doc. 43) and moved for judgment on the pleadings (Doc. 46). On March 13, 2019, the court held a hearing on all outstanding motions, which are ready for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Commissioner's argument to the contrary is based on a misunderstanding of the statutory scheme at issue, as evidenced by his repeated assertion that Plaintiffs are \"asking this Court to prohibit DMV from complying with license revocation orders issued by North Carolina courts.\" (Doc. 47 at 11.) It is simply untrue that North Carolina courts issue \"license revocation orders\" under the statutory scheme at issue here. Instead, state courts \"\n   <em>\n    report\n   </em>\n   to the [DMV] the name of any person charged with a motor vehicle offense\" who fails to pay a traffic violation fine or cost.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2020-24.2\">\n    N.C.

Upon receiving that \"\n   <em>\n    notice\n   </em>\n   from [the] court,\" it is the DMV that issues a \"[r]evocation order[ ],\" which it then \"mail[s] or personally deliver[s] to the person.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2020-24.2\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 20-24.1(a) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The only state court judgment relevant to this process is the underlying imposition of a traffic violation fine or cost, and Plaintiffs expressly do not challenge that judgment. (Doc. 51 at 12.) Plaintiffs' claims do not in any way implicate the soundness of the underlying traffic conviction and pecuniary imposition. A finding by this court that the DMV cannot constitutionally revoke Plaintiffs' driver's licenses for failure to pay a court-ordered fine or cost without first determining their ability to pay would not imply that the state court should not have imposed the fine or cost in the first place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stinnie v.

This argument attacks Plaintiffs' reliance in their opening brief on a September 26, 2017 email from a DMV employee stating that \"[t]he total number of Failure to Pay is 436,050\" (Doc. 6-9), on the basis that the email \"does not explain the time frame of these suspensions, or even if the [number] is referring to individuals\" (Doc. 48 at 7). The Commissioner goes on to criticize Plaintiffs for omitting any evidence concerning how many of these failure-to-pay license revocations involve traffic defendants who \"are low income individuals.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Commissioner's concerns, however, are allayed by his own evidence. On March 13, 2019, the Commissioner filed the affidavit of a North Carolina Department of Transportation employee stating that in the three years prior to the lawsuit's initiation, 62,788 traffic defendants failed to pay their traffic violation fines and costs and have therefore had their driver's licenses revoked.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 62.) This evidence is confined to a relevant timeframe and clearly refers to individual traffic defendants. The Commissioner's protest that Plaintiffs have not supported their \"allegation that the proposed Revoked Class members are low income individuals\" (Doc. 48 at 7) is an attack on a straw man; Plaintiffs have never made such an allegation. Plaintiffs' proposed classes consist of \"all individuals\" whose driver's licenses have been or will be revoked under section 20-24.1(a)(2). Even looking only to the Commissioner's evidence, then, Plaintiffs' proposed Revoked Class consists of at least 62,788 individuals. As to the proposed Future Revocation Class, the court may reasonably infer from the size of the Revoked Class that it too is large.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1 William B.

Once again, the Commissioner misunderstands Plaintiffs' claims. The core injury Plaintiffs assert is the allegedly unconstitutional deprivation of their driver's licenses under section 20-24.1, not the practical effects of this revocation on their personal lives. While Plaintiffs do provide a litany of additional allegations regarding the personal hardships attendant to license revocation in what may be an attempt to underscore the seriousness and sympathetic nature of their claims, these additional allegations are not the constitutional injury Plaintiffs assert.

(Doc. 48 at 11.) As the court pointed out in that context, the constitutional violations Plaintiffs assert are not dependent on whether a given traffic defendant would be able to successfully show inability to pay at an ability-to-pay hearing. It is the alleged lack of notice and a hearing prior to revocation that forms the basis of Plaintiffs' procedural due process claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coe v. Armour Fertilizer Works\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"631831\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/237/413/#p424\">\n    237 U.S. 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 424,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"631831\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/237/413/#p424\">\n    35 S.Ct. 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"631831\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/237/413/#p424\">\n    59 L.Ed. 1027\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1915) (\"To one who protests against the taking of his property without due process of law, it is no answer to say that in his particular case due process of law would have led to the same result because he had no adequate defense upon the merits.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Second, the Commissioner argues that \"the relief sought by Plaintiffs would require an individualized inquiry into [each] driver's eligibility for reinstatement\" (Doc. 48 at 12), the idea being that the driver's licenses of some class members may be revoked on additional bases. Although objections about the contours of any potential relief are more relevant to the Rule 23(b)(2) analysis than to typicality,\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) (parties must show that \"final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole\")\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3) (parties must show that their \"claims or defenses\" are typical of the class), the Commissioner's concern is illusory in any context. As Plaintiffs point out, if the court ultimately finds that the DMV's enforcement of section 20-24.1(a)(2) is and has been unconstitutional, the court can order the DMV to annul all revocations within the class that were entered pursuant to that provision. It would remain for the DMV, not the court, to investigate whether a given license should remain revoked on some other basis or whether the license should be reinstated pending provision of sufficient due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Third, the Commissioner argues that some proposed class members may have received the ability-to-pay hearing that the named Plaintiffs did not. (Doc. 48 at 13.) Although this factual distinction, if it exists, might have created problems for the typicality of an as-applied challenge, Plaintiffs clarify that they \"bring a facial challenge to Sections 20-24.1 and 20-24.2.\" (Doc. 50 at 10.) To the extent that the Commissioner may have understood Plaintiffs' procedural due process claims to be as-applied, Plaintiffs' clarification assuages his typicality concern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Fourth, and finally, the Commissioner argues that the claims of some proposed Revoked Class members will be subject to a statute of limitations defense that the claims of the named Plaintiffs do not typify. (Doc. 48 at 11.) The Commissioner argues - and Plaintiffs do not contest - that the relevant statute of limitations is three years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201-52\">\n    N.C.

As Plaintiffs stress elsewhere, they do not challenge the original imposition of fines or costs for traffic violations; they challenge only the license revocations for a subsequent failure to pay those fines or costs. It does not appear that Bonhomme-Dicks exercised her statutory right to move after the imposition of costs for a section 20-24.1(b1) hearing to show that her subsequent \"failure to pay ... was not willful\" and that she was \"making a good faith effort to pay,\" N.C.
