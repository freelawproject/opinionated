Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff William Valle (\"Valle\") has filed this lawsuit against Defendants Powertech Industrial Co. Ltd. (\"Powertech\") and Jonie Chou (\"Chou\") (collectively, \"Defendants\"). Valle alleges a breach contract against Powertech based on his 2009 agreement with Powertech (Count I). As an alternative to that claim, he alleges a breach of his 2002 agreement with Powertech (Count II) or a breach of the parties' oral agreement (Count III) or seeks recovery\n   in quantum meruit (Count IV). Against Powertech, Valle also alleges a breach of the covenant of the duty of good faith and fair dealing (Count V) and retaliation in violation of Mass. Gen. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148A (Count IX). D. 74. Against both Powertech and Chou, Valles brings a misclassification claim under the Massachusetts Wage Act, Mass. Gen. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148B (Count VI) and a claim for unpaid wages under the Massachusetts Wage Act, Mass. Gen. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 148, 150 (Count VII). As an alternative to his misclassification claim, Valle alleges that Powertech engaged in unfair or deceptive trade practices in violation of Mass. Gen. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 11 (Count VIII). Valle has moved for partial summary judgment on Counts I, V, VI and VII, D. 77, and Defendants have cross-moved for summary judgment on all counts, D. 82. For the reasons stated below, the Court ALLOWS IN PART Valle's motion, D. 77, and DENIES Defendants' motion, D. 82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following facts are undisputed unless indicated otherwise. The case concerns work Valle performed for Powertech from 2002 to 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Parties\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Valle is a salesman based in Massachusetts who formerly worked as a sales representative for Powertech. D. 79 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 22; D. 81 \u00b6 6; D. 94 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 22. Powertech is a Taiwanese company based in New Taipei City, Taiwan. D. 79 \u00b6 2; D. 94 \u00b6 2. The company is a \"power solutions manufacturer\" with a diverse power-related product line that includes surge protectors and uninterruptible power supplies. D. 79 \u00b6 4; D. 94 \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The 2002 Agreement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Valle and Powertech began doing business together in 2002, when Valle approached\n   Powertech and Chou with the opportunity to have Powertech manufacture products for American Power Conversion (\"APC\"). D. 79 \u00b6 30; D. 94 \u00b6 30. On September 25, 2002, Valle and Powertech signed a document titled Representative's Agreement (the \"2002 Agreement\"). D. 81-2. The 2002 Agreement was between Powertech and United Power Products (\"UPP\"), with Valle signing in the name of UPP.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11136261\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/241/103/#p107\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Valle did business under the name UPP from time to time. D. 81 \u00b6 10; D. 79 \u00b6 33; D. 94 \u00b6 33. Powertech did not have dealings with anyone other than Valle in its dealings with UPP. D. 81 \u00b6 10. The 2002 Agreement allocated a five percent commission to UPP on all products sold to APC. D. 81-2 at 1. The 2002 Agreement did not have a fixed duration. Rather, it states: \"[t]his Agreement shall become effective on the date signed by [the] last party hereto to execute the same and shall remain in effect unless Representative shall fail to refuse to continue to provide services hereunder or unless Principal shall cease to sell the Products to [APC].\" D. 81-2 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   While the 2002 Agreement was in effect, Valle brought in other customers, including Para Systems Inc. (\"Para\"). D. 81 \u00b6\u00b6 12-13; D. 94 at 10; D. 79 \u00b6 35; D. 94 \u00b6 35. For Para, Valle and Powertech executed a separate agreement in which Valle would receive a fixed five percent commission unless \"otherwise by the parties' mutual agree[ment] in writ[ing]\" for all sales. D. 81-3. Valle attests that he \"do[es] not believe that [he and Powertech] entered into separate agreements for each other customer ... but [he] know[s] [they] were always able to agree on commission rates for the sales [he] obtained.\" D. 81 \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2008, Powertech asked Valle to modify the 2002 Agreement to lower his commission rate for APC sales from five percent to three and a half percent, and Valle agreed \"as an accommodation to Powertech.\" D. 81 \u00b6 14; D. 79 \u00b6 37; D. 94 \u00b6 37; D. 94 at 11. The parties also agreed to some rates that were lower than three and a half percent for the sale of particular products. D. 81 \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     The 2009 Agreement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    1. Negotiations Over the 2009 Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In September 2009, Powertech informed Valle it wished to enter into one commission agreement applicable to several customers. D. 84-12; D. 79 \u00b6 38; D. 94 \u00b6 38. Valle responded that he wished to keep the existing agreement in place for APC. D. 84-13; D. 79 \u00b6 39; D. 94 \u00b6 39. In response to Valle's input, Powertech agreed to include the following provision in the new agreement: \"Upon termination of this Agreement, Bill [Valle] shall be entitled to payment of commission on all orders placed by American Power Conversion for the products by the accounts for two years, or mutually agreed upon settlement.\" D. 84-14; D. 81-9 at 2;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D. 84-5 at 17. Subsequently, Valle wrote to Powertech \"I think it [may be] a good idea to list all the commissions for the various companies in the agreement. You can list them as an addendum. What do you think?\" D. 84-15. Powertech demurred, responding \"[our] suggestion is don't make the agreement complicate[d]; otherwise we will need to amend the addendum often.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11136261\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/241/103/#p107\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On December 20, 2009 Powertech and Valle signed a new agreement (the \"2009 Agreement\"). D. 81-9; D. 79 \u00b6 42; D. 94 \u00b6 42. The 2009 Agreement states: \"Powertech agrees to provide Bill [Valle] a commission of the parties' mutual agreed percentage in writing for the payment [ ] made by the listed customers (as attachment) and the parties can add other customer[s] to the foregoing list hereafter.\" D. 81-9 at 1. The 2009 Agreement did not\n   specify a commission rate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11136261\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/241/103/#p107\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Rather, the payment section provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The payment means that the listed customers pay Powertech for the orders of the finished products and excludes from any the expense or costs of any parts, components, materials, NRE charges, safety license charges, tooling charges and other similar expenses or costs. For example, in the case the percentage is 5% and the invoices are summed to $ 10,000 (including tooling charges $ 1,000), Bill [Valle] will be given a commission of $ 450. (10,000-1,000)* 5% = 450.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11136261\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/241/103/#p107\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The 2009 Agreement specifies that Powertech would make all payments to William Valle Associates, Inc.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11136261\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/241/103/#p107\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Powertech paid the commissions to William Valle Associates, Inc. D. 84-5 at 32. Valle is the President of William Valle Associates, Inc. D. 84-5 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The 2009 Agreement contains a confidentiality provision that requires Valle to keep all information and documents about Powertech confidential for five years after the termination of the Agreement. D. 81-9 at 1. The 2009 Agreement does not contain a non-competition clause. Finally, the 2009 Agreement states that it \"supersedes all prior agreements and communications between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11136261\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/241/103/#p107\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Valle attests that he understood the 2009 Agreement would not change his relationship with Powertech and that all his existing commission rates would remain in place. D. 81 \u00b6\u00b6 15, 17. At his deposition, however, he testified that he believed the 2009 Agreement replaced the 2002 Agreement in terms of his relationship with Powertech and that he agreed the 2002 Agreement was not in effect after December 2009. D. 84-5 at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    2. Commission Payments Under the 2009 Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   From 2009 to the end of 2016, the parties were able to agree on Valle's commissions, as envisioned in the 2009 Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. 81-9 at 1 (agreeing to provide Valle \"a commission of the parties' mutual[ly] agreed percentage in writing\"). Powertech asserts, and Valle agrees, that after signing the 2009 Agreement, \"the parties subsequently [came] to several agreements concerning the commission rates-[ ] through schedules, emails, and subsequent commission payments.\" D. 83 at 12; D. 89 at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The parties agree on the general mechanisms used to determine and negotiate payments after they signed the 2009 Agreement. Before making commission payments to Valle, Powertech would prepare and send an invoice to Valle identifying the proposed commission amount for each sale. D. 80-1 at 9. Joanna Sun (\"Sun\"), a sales manager at Powertech, maintained a running set of spreadsheets listing commissions for customers and product sales that she used to calculate Valle's commissions. D. 80-1 at 9; D. 80-4; D. 80-5; D. 80-2 at 11; D. 94 at 28-29. Valle testified that he received supporting documentation for the invoices \"occasionally.\" D. 84-5 at 18-19. In at least one instance, Valle requested the details of a proposed commission on an invoice, and Powertech provided a breakdown of the payments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. 81-20. Generally, Valle would sign the invoices and send them back to Powertech. D. 81 \u00b6 25. Valle believed his signature was required to initiate an international wire transfer from Powertech.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11136261\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/241/103/#p107\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Upon receipt of the signed invoice, Powertech would wire payment to Valle in the name of William Valle Associates, Inc. D. 81 \u00b6 26; D. 84-5 at 18-19;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D. 84-24 (reflecting Powertech invoices signed by Valle). In the early years of Valle's relationship\n   with Powertech, Valle would check the invoices for accuracy, but he \"eventually stopped doing this [ ] because [he] assumed that the commission amounts were correct given [his] long-standing relationship with Powertech.\" D. 81 \u00b6 24. Valle attests that he \"did not understand that by signing an Invoice [he] was agreeing that the undisclosed commission rates used to calculate the total commission amounts shown on the Invoice were correct.\" D. 81 \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The parties agree that Powertech \"frequently sought to renegotiate [Valle's] commissions, particularly if Powertech was designing a new product line.\" D. 79 \u00b6 63; D. 94 \u00b6 63. The negotiations proceeded largely without incident before 2016. Powertech would update the spreadsheets with the commission rates as the parties reached new agreements. D. 80-2 at 10. In several instances, Powertech requested to lower Valle's commissions based on their current profits and costs and Valle agreed.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D. 81-10; D. 81-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Various iterations of the payment detail spreadsheets reflect the parties' negotiations. For example, both parties filed the spreadsheet that tracked the parties' negotiations over APC commissions in 2011. D. 81-16; D. 84-20. Next to the 2011 column, if Valle agreed with the proposed rate in the 2011 commission column, Sun wrote \"OK.\" D. 81-16;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D. 89 at 5. If Valle did not approve, he would suggest a different amount, and Sun recorded that amount and either \"OK\" or a counteroffer on the spreadsheet next to Valle's proposal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. 84-20 at 2. During the 2011 negotiations, Powertech and Valle ultimately exchanged approvals for commission rates for APC varying from one to two and a half percent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11136261\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/241/103/#p107\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In 2013, the parties underwent similar negotiations about APC commissions. For some APC products, Powertech did not discuss changes to Valle's commissions with Valle. Sun explained that because there were \"too many APC [products], sometimes it was discussed, sometimes it was not. We [were] not able to discuss the commission by each [product], that is why we offer him commission invoice as final confirmation.\" D. 92-6 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Although parties largely agree on the structure of the commission negotiations from 2009 to 2017, they disagree about Powertech's obligations to pay those rates. According to Valle, the parties understood that the commission rates in effect prior to the 2009 Agreement would stay in effect under the Agreement, unless renegotiated. D. 81 \u00b6 17. As an example, Valle points to his commissions on sales to Powertech's customer Para. For sales to Para, Valle received a five percent commission prior to the execution of the 2009 Agreement and continued to receive that five percent commission after the 2009 Agreement took effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. 92-4. Valle also relies upon two documents entitled \"APC 3.5% Commission Agreement,\" which reflect commissions on APC products to be paid with three and a half percent commissions to Valle both before and after the 2009 Agreement went into effect. D. 92-3; D. 92-5;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D. 92 at 1-2. Powertech disputes Valle's characterization of the parties' agreement, arguing that their refusal to include a schedule of commissions in the 2009 Agreement demonstrates that the parties had not reached an agreement on the commission rates and that the entire 2009 Agreement is therefore invalid for lack of the inclusion of a material term. D. 94 at 12-13. Powertech also disputes that for customers other than Para, Valle was entitled to a fixed rate for all sales. D. 94 at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    3. Termination of the 2009 Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Valle and Powertech did business together uninterrupted from 2002 to 2017. D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   79 \u00b6 44; D. 94 \u00b6 44. Valle alleges that towards the end of the parties' relationship, in 2015, Powertech began \"unilaterally changing Valle's commission rates when Powertech unilaterally determined that its own gross profit on a particular product was too low.\" D. 78 at 9. Valle relies upon a spreadsheet with notations by Powertech showing changes in 2015 and 2016 to earlier commission rates. D. 80-4. Valle argues that because Powertech has not identified a \"writing\" in which Valle agreed to these changes, Powertech owes Valle the commission rates initially listed on the spreadsheets, which he \"largely agree[s] are correct.\" D. 78 at 10. Valle also asserts that the correct rates are contained in the spreadsheets and supplemental correspondence with Powertech filed at D. 81-16, D. 81-19, D. 81-21, D. 81-25, D. 81-26 and D. 81-28.

Valle alleges two sets of breaches under the 2009 Agreement: 1) Powertech's failure to pay him agreed-upon commission rates beginning in 2015 and 2) Powertech's failure to pay him under the two-year tail provision for APC sales after the termination of the 2009 Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   As to the commission payments that Valle alleges were \"unilaterally changed\" in beginning in 2015, the Court concludes that there are disputed issues of material fact that preclude summary judgment at this juncture. A reasonable factfinder could conclude either that Powertech breached the 2009 Agreement by changing Valle's commission rates without his approval or that Valle agreed to those changes by signing the invoices without contesting the amounts for all but two of the invoices. The Court, therefore, denies both parties' motions for summary judgment as to the breach of contract claim for commissions allegedly owed from 2015 until the termination of the 2009 Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As to the two-year tail provision for post-commission sales on APC products, the Court holds that based on the undisputed evidence, Powertech has breached its duty under the contract to make the required payments to Valle. It is undisputed that Powertech has not made any payments to Valle since the termination of the 2009 Agreement since 2017, Powertech and Valle explicitly negotiated over and decided to include the tail provision in the Agreement and Powertech continues to sell products to APC. Although the amount of damages under the tail provision has not been established at this stage, Valle has moved for summary judgment only on the question of liability. Accordingly, the Court allows Valle's motion and holds that Powertech is liable for the two-year tail payments on APC products as a matter of law, with the amount of damages to be determined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Breach of the 2002 Contract (Count II)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Valle asserts a breach of contract claim against Powertech based on the 2002 Agreement between the parties \"in the alternative\" to his breach of contract claim under the 2009 Agreement.

Because the independent contractor test is conjunctive, and Powertech cannot prevail on the second prong, the Court concludes that Valle is entitled to summary judgment with respect to liability on his misclassification claim against Powertech. The Court reaches the same conclusion with respect to the misclassification claim against Chou, who is subject to personal liability by virtue of his position as President of Powertech.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ferrara\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205555066\">\n    2018 WL 5555066\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    G.\n    <em>\n     Unpaid Wages in Violation of the Massachusetts Wage Act, Mass.

Rather, Powertech asserts that it terminated Valle for the reasons stated in the email filed at D. 81-29.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207799635\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In that email, Peng wrote to Valle on August 30, 2016 (approximately six months prior to Valle filing this lawsuit) informing him that Powertech's financial division was questioning the further need for a sales representative, especially given that Powertech's overall \"profits of general products [were] very low.\" D. 81-29 at 1. Valle argues that the temporal connection of only six days between his filing the lawsuit and his termination demonstrate that Powertech's true motive was one of retaliation. Because there are disputed issues of genuine material facts necessary to resolving the issue of retaliation, the Court denies Powertech's motion for summary judgment on this claim and reserves the question for the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mogilevsky v.

The Court DENIES Defendants' motion for summary judgment on Counts II-IV and Count VIII as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Accordingly, the matters going to the jury are as follows. As to Count I: whether there was a breach of contract as to commissions (other than the two-year tail provision, which the Court has found to be a breach as a matter of law); as to Count V: whether the failure to pay commissions was also a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and as to Count IX: the retaliation claim in all respects.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    So Ordered.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    Powertech does not dispute that it still sells products to APC but clarifies that \"Powertech currently sells products to Schneider Electric which markets certain products branded APC.\" D. 94 \u00b6 122.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Powertech , https://www.power-tech.com.tw/en/power_list.php (last visited Mar. 21, 2019).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Powertech does not dispute Peng's description of her job but highlights the \"limitation\" of Peng's understanding of the phrase \"develop new clients\" given the language barrier.
