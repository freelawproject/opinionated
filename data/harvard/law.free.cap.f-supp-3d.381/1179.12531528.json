No. 45\n </docketnumber>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, United States District Court Judge\n   Decedent Pablo Garcia Toribio (\"Garcia\") was shot and killed by an officer of the Santa Rosa Police Department (\"SRPD\") on August 5, 2017. Plaintiffs herein are Pablo Garcia Santos and Margarita Toribio Dominguez, the parents of decedent Pablo Garcia Toribio, as well as decedent's estate. The operative complaint in this matter alleges twelve causes of action against defendants SRPD Officers Vlahandreas, Badger, and McAllister; SRPD Chief of Police Hank Schreeder; and City of Santa Rosa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending before the Court is defendants' motion for summary judgment, which came on regularly for hearing on February 26, 2019. (Dkt. No. 45.) At the hearing on this matter, plaintiffs declared that they were withdrawing their claims against all defendants except Officer Vlahandreas. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Dismissing Claims Against Defendants City of Santa Rosa, Schreeder, Badger, and Mcallister, Dkt. No. 72.) Thus, the remaining claims, against Officer Vlahandreas only, are: wrongful death; negligence based upon wrongful death and failure to intercede; violation of California Civil Code section 52.1 (the Bane Act); and, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. section 1983, violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution based upon excessive force and interference with familial association.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant argues the undisputed material facts demonstrate that he has no liability on any claim. Defendant contends the evidence does not establish that he used objectively unreasonable force in responding to the incident at issue and, as a matter of law, qualified immunity and California statutory immunities would bar the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Having carefully considered the papers submitted, the arguments of the parties at the hearing, the admissible evidence,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the pleadings in this action, and for the reasons set forth below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    ORDERS\n   </strong>\n   that the motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. SUMMARY OF FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Unless otherwise noted, the facts stated below are undisputed. The Court recounts the events in some detail but notes that the interaction between decedent and the officers here unfolded in a matter of about ten minutes from the time they arrived in response to the 911 call to the time Officer Vlahandreas fired his gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At 5:45 a.m. on August 5, 2017, Augustin Salgado Chavez (\"Salgado\") was awakened by his roommate, decedent Garcia, who was in their shared bedroom shouting obscenities, naked, and acting erratically. (Defendants' Statement of Undisputed Facts and evidence cited therein [hereinafter \"Def. Fact\"] 3; Plaintiffs' Additional\n   Facts, Dkt. No. 69, and evidence cited therein [hereinafter \"Pl. Fact\"] 2.) Garcia was wielding a 12-inch long kitchen knife with an 8-inch long blade. Garcia jumped onto Salgado's bed and blocked Salgado from leaving through the bedroom door, screaming, \"You're not getting out, asshole.\" (Def. Facts 3, 4.) Garcia slashed at Salgado with the knife twice. Salgado avoided being cut in his mid-section by arching his body away, but suffered a cut on his right leg, just above the knee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Def. Facts 4, 5.) From Garcia's statements and actions, it appeared to Salgado that Garcia was hallucinating about a chicken running around in the room. (Jackson Decl., Exh. A at 32:3-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Salgado jumped out the bedroom window, circled around the house, knocked on the bedroom window of the home's owner, Ventura Hernandez, telling him that Garcia was acting \"really crazy\" and had cut him with a knife. (Def. Fact 6.) A few minutes later, Hernandez called 911 and told the dispatcher, in Spanish:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-17\">\n   I need for [police] to come fast here, because there is a guy who is acting all crazy here. I don't know if he drinks something or something ... he was in his room. He was taking a nap there. And, also, he has a knife.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Def. Fact 7.) When asked what the man did with the knife, Hernandez replied, \"yes, he did threaten someone.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Salgado then got on the phone line and, speaking through an interpreter and crying, told the 911 operator \"he's my roommate and he was acting crazy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At 5:59:55 a.m., the 911 dispatcher broadcast a \"415\" (fighting/disturbance of the peace) and notified officers of \"a male requesting police quickly\" who \"says there's a subject here acting crazy.\" (Def. Fact 8.) At 6:02:43 a.m., the 911 dispatcher broadcast:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-20\">\n   Units responding to West Steele Lane. Apparently the subject rents a room there. He was sleeping, woke up acting strange, and RP heard somebody saying something about a knife, but the RP has not seen the knife for himself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At approximately 6:00 a.m., Officers Badger and Turner arrived at the home, noticed the front door was wide open, and waited for backup to arrive. (Def. Fact 9.) At approximately 6:06 a.m., Officers Turner and Badger walked to the front door, knocked and announced themselves, and entered through the open front door. (Def. Fact 10.) Hernandez came to the door and spoke to the officers in Spanish, which they were unable to understand. Defendant Officer Vlahandreas, who could speak and understand some Spanish, arrived shortly thereafter and spoke in Spanish to Hernandez. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The three officers walked into the entryway of the home and encountered Salgado, who they observed was still talking to the 911 dispatcher on the telephone, visibly distraught, crying, and bleeding. (Def. Fact 11.) Salgado also spoke to the officers in Spanish. Officer Vlahandreas was not able to understand all that Salgado said, but understood Salgado was indicating he had been cut. The officers observed a bleeding cut on Salgado's leg, although the severity of the cut is disputed by the parties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At 6:07 a.m., Officer Badger radioed dispatch to send a medical unit to treat Salgado. (Def. Fact 12.) Hernandez and Salgado indicated to the officers that the man with\n   the knife was in a bedroom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Officer Badger tried the door to the bedroom, found the door locked, and requested the keys from Hernandez. They unlocked the bedroom door, and Officers Turner and Badger announced themselves as \"Santa Rosa Police,\" while opening it. With their flashlights they peered into the dark bedroom. They observed overturned beds and mattresses, and did not see Garcia initially. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At 6:09 a.m., Officer Badger directed Officer Vlahandreas to remain inside while he and Officer Turner went to the back of the house to see if Garcia might have escaped through the bedroom window to the back yard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officer Vlahandreas remained in the home and spoke more to Hernandez and Salgado in Spanish in the living room down the hallway from the bedroom. Officer Vlahandreas concluded that Salgado had been cut by a knife, which could be charged as assault with a deadly weapon, a felony. (Def. Fact 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Officer Vlahandreas suddenly heard a sound come from the bedroom the officers previously had checked. He went back to the doorway of the bedroom, announced himself \"policia,\" looked inside, and radioed to Officer Turner to return from the backyard. (Def. Fact 14.) Officers Turner and Badger returned, and Officer Turner escorted Salgado outside to receive medical attention for his cut. Officer Badger joined Officer Vlahandreas at the doorway to the bedroom.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Def. Fact 15.)\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Defendant objected to certain evidence and statements of fact submitted by plaintiffs. (Reply, Dkt. No. 70.) The Court rules on those objections as follows: (1) Objection 1 is\n    <strong>\n     Overruled\n    </strong>\n    ; (2) Objections 2, 3, and 4 (to Plaintiffs' Additional Facts 5, 6, and 11) are\n    <strong>\n     Sustained\n    </strong>\n    on the grounds stated; and (3) Objection 5 (to Additional Fact 12) is\n    <strong>\n     Sustained In Part\n    </strong>\n    and the evidence is admissible as to Officer Badger's training only.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Salgado testified: \"he reached for me with a knife. But I moved back. If I had not pushed back, then he would have disemboweled me.... he would have killed me there. He would have cut my intestines.\" (Declaration of Robert Jackson, Exh. A [Deposition of Agustin Salgado Chavez at 22:5-7, 17-18].)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    In addition to Salgado and Hernandez, there were several other people in or nearby the house at the time of these events, including Hernandez's wife in another bedroom in the house, three other men staying in an attached garage, and a woman and two children staying in an outbuilding behind the house. (Def. Fact 2.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    The bedroom was ten feet by ten feet. The hallway outside the bedroom was three feet wide and fifteen and a half feet long. (Def. Fact 1.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    At 6:11 a.m., Officer Vlahandreas discovered Garcia, naked and lying beneath an overturned mattress in the bedroom. Officers Vlahandreas and Badger both announced themselves in Spanish as \"policia\" and ordered Garcia to \"come out now\" from beneath the mattress several times, but Garcia did not comply.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    (Def. Fact 16.) Garcia remained in the room and in his unclothed state.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    At 6:12 a.m., the officers saw that Garcia had a 12-inch kitchen knife in his hand. Officer Badger told Vlahandreas to \"get your Taser out.\" Officer Vlahandreas radioed to dispatch, \"subject has a knife.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) The officers commanded Garcia to drop the knife, \"manos arriba\" (\"hands up,\" in Spanish), \"put the knife on the ground,\" and \"put the knife down and let me see your hands,\" while Vlahandreas pointed the Taser at him. (Def. Fact 20, Declaration of Jeffrey Badger, Exh. I [Body Worn Camera Video (\"Badger BWC\") ] at 6:12.) Garcia did not comply or respond. (Def. Fact 16, 19.) He was silent as the officers gave their orders. (Badger BWC 6:12.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    At 6:13 a.m., Garcia placed the knife on his stomach as he lay with his back on the floor. (Def. Fact 21.) Officer Badger stated \"it's on his stomach\" to Officer Vlahandreas. (Badger BWC 6:13.) The officers continued to repeat in Spanish and English, \"policia,\" \"manos arriba,\" \"let me see your hands,\" \"put the knife down.\" (Def. Fact 21.) Garcia began mumbling and groaning. (Badger BWC at 6:13.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    At 6:14 a.m., the officers continued to command Garcia to put the knife down and \"manos arriba.\" (Def. Fact 21.) Officer Badger stated, \"he's grabbing it.\" (Badger\n    BWC at 6:14.) The officers continued to state \"put the knife down\" and \"manos arriba.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) The officers were inside the doorway of the bedroom as they spoke to him. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Suddenly, Garcia sat up, holding the knife and muttering, and the officers backed away from him and toward the doorway. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Officer Vlahandreas spoke to Garcia in Spanish, \"Se\u00f1or, est\u00e1 bien\" (\"Sir, it's okay.\")\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    Garcia did not put the knife down. Officer Vlahandreas aimed at Garcia and discharged his Taser. (Def. Fact 21, 22.) The officers continued to command Garcia to \"put it down now.\" (Badger BWC at 6:14.) Still, Garcia continued to hold onto the knife. (Def. Fact 23.) The officers backed away from the bedroom doorway into the hallway. Officer Vlahandreas discharged his Taser again, and Officer Badger drew his Taser. (Badger BWC at 6:14.) The Taser strikes appeared to have little effect either time.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    At 6:15 a.m., as the officers continued to command Garcia to put the knife down, Garcia began waving the knife and talking to the officers in English. (Badger BWC at 6:15.)\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    Garcia shifted his hold on the knife in such a way that Officer Badger stated to Officer Vlahandreas, \"he is going to cut his arm.\" (Def. Fact 23.) The officers continued to state \"put the knife down now,\" \"hands up,\" and \"manos arriba.\" (Badger BWC at 6:15.) Officer Vlahandreas suggested the use of pepper spray to Officer Badger, and then leaned in the doorway to deploy pepper spray in the direction of Garcia's face. (Def. Fact 23.) When the officers again commanded Garcia to put the knife down, he stated \"I can't, I got burning.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    )\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    At 6:16 a.m., Officer Badger said \"Se\u00f1or, manos arriba.\" (Badger BWC at 6:16.) Garcia stated what sounded like, \"I told you I don't want kill people.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    [10:32 mark\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    ].) Officer Badger responded, \"then put the knife down now.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Garcia argued with the officers in an incoherent way. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Officers Vlahandreas and Badger stated repeatedly, \"We're here to help you,\" \"put the knife down.\" (Def. Fact 24.) Garcia responded, \"You understand what I am saying, please?\" and \"I don't want help; I wanna ... myself.\" (Def. Fact 24.) During this interchange, the officers remained just outside the bedroom door frame. (Badger BWC at 6:16.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    At 6:17 a.m., Officer Vlahandreas asked Garcia, \"What's going on?\" Garcia responded, \"I say no; that's it,\" and \"this ends now.\" (Def. Fact 25.) Officer Badger again said \"We're here to help you, put the knife down.\" (Badger BWC 6:17 [11:31 mark].) Officer Vlahandreas then said, \"We can't help you if you don't tell us what's going on.\" (Def. Fact 24.) Garcia responded \"go\" and growled, and then \"... kill you,\" to which Officer Vlahandreas responded, \"You don't want to do that sir; we're here to help you.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ; Badger BWC at 6:17 [11:58 mark].) Garcia said, \"clean my eyes please ... clean my eyes ... need fav gramma grams too[\n    <em>\n     sic\n    </em>\n    ] ... please clean my eyes I have to.\" (Badger BWC at 6:17 [12:00-06 mark].) Garcia then quickly rose to a standing position, still holding the knife, and yelled \"clean them.\" (Def. Fact 24; Badger BWC\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    6:17 [12:10 mark].) Garcia jumped over the bed frame and began to rush over objects strewn over the bedroom floor toward the doorway where Officer Vlahandreas and Officer Badger stood. (Def. Fact 26; Badger BWC at 6:17 [12:14 mark].) The officers again yelled \"put the knife down,\" \"put it down.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    [12:16 mark].) Officer Badger fired his Taser at Garcia, and Garcia groaned. (Def. Fact 26; Badger BWC at 6:17 [12:17 mark].)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    At 6:18 a.m., Garcia suddenly ran toward the doorway, knife in hand, toward the officers. (Def. Fact 27; Badger BWC at 6:18 [12:23 mark].) The officers retreated from the doorway, backing in opposite directions down the hallway, shouting for Garcia to drop the knife. (Def. Fact 27.) Garcia scrambled from the bedroom still holding the knife. At the moment he emerged from the bedroom with the knife, Garcia was approximately six to eight feet from Officer Vlahandreas and nine to ten feet from Officer Badger. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def. Fact 28, Pl. Fact 9.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Officer Vlahandreas fired five shots as Garcia dashed across the hallway, knife in hand, into what the officers later learned was a bathroom, and closed the door behind him. (Def. Fact 35.) Officer Vlahandreas did not know if Garcia was hit or to what degree he was incapacitated. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    )\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    About 14 minutes later, after obtaining a shield, Officer Badger entered the bathroom and found Garcia lying prone on the bathroom floor with the knife next to him. (Def. Fact 37.) The officers later determined that Garcia had been hit by one or two rounds in his hip region and one or two in his armpit area, on Garcia's left side, the side facing Officer Vlahandreas as Garcia ran from the bedroom to the bathroom. (Pl. Fact 12; Pl.'s Exh. A, Vlahandreas Depo. at 50.) Garcia died at the scene.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    <strong>\n     II.

Further, Garcia would not comply with the officers' commands for him to drop the knife, both in English and in Spanish-commands he clearly understood based on his responses to the officers' directions. The body-worn camera footage shows that Garcia made statements\n    threatening to \"kill you\" and charged in the officers' direction with the knife. While Garcia's statement that he needed to wash his eyes, and his dash across the hallway toward what was later determined to be a bathroom, might imply that he did not intend to attack the officers, \"[t]he 'reasonableness' of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with 20/20 vision of hindsight.\"\n    <em>\n     Graham,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p394\">\n     490 U.S. at 396\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p394\">\n     109 S.Ct. 1865\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    The events of August 5, 2017, are undeniably tragic. The loss of Garcia's life was\n    a sad consequence of the circumstances confronting the police officers when they responded to the 911 call. Until the higher courts address the Fourth Amendment's requirements when law enforcement engage with persons suffering from a mental disturbance, this Court has grave concerns that officers will believe themselves entitled to pull a trigger too quickly. That said, given the current state of the law, the tragedy here cannot be compounded by holding a police officer liable for damages under circumstances which demonstrate no violation of Constitutional limits on the use of deadly force, much less \"clearly established\" authority that such force would be unreasonable. In light of the foregoing, the motion for summary judgment is\n    <strong>\n     GRANTED\n    </strong>\n    . Judgment shall be entered in favor of defendant.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    This terminates Docket No. 45.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    <strong>\n     IT IS SO ORDERED.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"5\">\n    <p id=\"p-70\">\n     It is undisputed that Garcia spoke and understood Spanish, as well as speaking and understanding some English. (Def. Facts 17, 18.)\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"6\">\n    <p id=\"p-71\">\n     Officer Vlahandreas seems to have said: \"Se\u00f1or, est\u00e1 bien. Estoy aqui para ayudar,\" which in English means, \"Sir, it's okay, I am here to help.\" (Badger BWC at 6:14.)\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"7\">\n    <p id=\"p-72\">\n     Garcia seems to have said: \"I ... tell no more.

(Pl. Fact 11.) The evidence cited by plaintiffs does not support that statement. Moreover, the statement is contradicted by the body camera footage showing that Garcia held the knife pointing outward and in front of him as he charged through the doorway where the officers were standing. (Vlahandreas BWC at 6:18 [0:41 mark].)\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"10\">\n    <p id=\"p-75\">\n     At oral argument, plaintiffs' counsel suggested that Officer Vlahandreas was younger and less experienced than his partner on the scene who did not fire his gun, Officer Badger. In fact, Officer Vlahandreas is about a year older and has served as an officer about a year longer than Officer Badger.
