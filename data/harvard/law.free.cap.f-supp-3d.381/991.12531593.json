Berryhill, Defendants here, enforce a policy by which the amounts of Plaintiffs' Social Security retirement benefits are reduced because they also receive benefits from two Canadian social security plans, the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and the Qu\u00e9bec Pension Plan (QPP). Plaintiffs object to those reductions, which is the gist of this litigation. By crossmotions for summary judgment,\n  <em>\n   see\n  </em>\n  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), the parties respectively seek judgment in their favor based on our determination of a single issue: Are those reductions lawful?\n </attorneys>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We conclude that they are.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The material facts are few and undisputed. The twelve named Plaintiffs are each dual citizens of the United States and Canada. They instituted this action on their own behalf and on behalf of the class of all persons whose Social Security retirement benefits are reduced because of their or their spouses' receipt of CPP/QPP benefits. Dkt. 129 (certifying Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 class). Plaintiffs or their spouses spent part of their working careers in Canada and part in the United States. While working in Canada, they paid social security taxes to Canada and not to the United States; while working in the United States, they paid social security taxes to the United States and not to Canada. (Both parties acknowledge this fact but neither has included it in their fact statements under S.D. Ind. L.R. 56-1(a). We take it from the operative complaint.

In essence, an SSTA (like any other executive agreement) is simply a statute-written by the executive branch like a treaty, but enacted into law by virtue of a procedure involving the whole Congress rather than the Senate alone. These statutes are implemented first by the State Department, which identifies potential contracting states and initiates the negotiation process. SSTAs are negotiated by staff of the Office of International Programs, a division of the SSA. The authorizing statute allows for fast-track enactment: SSTAs automatically become law sixty session days after being submitted by the President to Congress unless objection arises in the House or the Senate in the form of a resolution of disapproval. [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20433\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2).] Thus, SSTAs are automatically approved unless Congress acts to\n   prevent their enactment, which it has never done. Like treaties, SSTAs are [at least] bilateral so they cannot enter in force and therefore become law until all enumerated conditions are satisfied, including ratification by the other contracting state.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Allison Christians,\n   <em>\n    Taxing the Global Worker: Three Spheres of International Social Security Coordination\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20Va.%20Tax%20Rev.%2081\">\n    26 Va.

Plaintiffs' upshot is clear, in any event: a period of coverage in one country counts as a period of coverage in the other; \"covered\" in one country\n    <em>\n     ipso facto\n    </em>\n    means \"covered\" in the other. Pls.' Br. Supp. 6 (\"Because Plaintiffs' benefits are based on earnings for service that constitutes employment or self-employment under Canadian or Qu\u00e9bec law, the Social Security Act also recognizes those services as employment or self-employment,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    covered service.\"), 20 (\"[B]ecause the [Totalization Agreement] designates and recognizes as equivalent to employment paid work in either country, work in Canada as a Canadian resident is not 'non-covered employment' and does not trigger application of the WEP[.]\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    In fact, the Totalization Agreement lays down exactly the opposite rule: \"covered\" in one country\n    <em>\n     ipso facto\n    </em>\n    means \"noncovered\" in the other.

The Totalization Agreement's solution to this choice-of-law problem is classically territorial. It chooses, with exceptions,\n    <em>\n     lex loci operarum\n    </em>\n    , the law of the place of employment: \"Except as otherwise provided in this Article, an employed person who works in the territory of one of the Contracting States shall, in respect of that work, be subject to the laws of only that Contracting State.\" Totalization Agreement, art. V, \u00b6 1. (The same rule obtains in all totalization agreements to which the United States is a party. Christians,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , at 94.) Thus, in general, an employee working in Canada accrues coverage subject to Canada's social security laws; an employee working in the United States accrues coverage subject to the Act.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    As noted, there are exceptions to the general rule of territoriality.

IV, \u00b6 1. Whatever Plaintiffs' construction of this provision may be, it unambiguously does not entitle them to any relief. Article IV says that the United States may not discriminate in the payment of Social Security benefits in favor of its own citizens against Canadians, refugees, stateless persons, or their spouses and dependents living either in the United States or Canada. There is no evidence or even any contention that SSA applies the WEP to Canadians (or refugees or stateless persons or their spouses and dependents) in circumstances where it would not also apply the WEP to Americans. Plaintiffs' argument on this point fails.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    The weakness of Plaintiffs' reasoning is on clear display in the decision of an administrative law judge (ALJ) purporting to adopt it. In a \"Notice of Supplemental\n    Authority,\" Dkt. 131, Plaintiffs have tendered the decision of an ALJ reversing SSA's application of the WEP to the claimant's Social Security retirement benefits. Dkt. 131 Ex. 1. The claimant was represented by Plaintiffs' counsel, Dkt. 131, at 1, who appears to have advanced the same arguments before the ALJ as before us. The ALJ put the case as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n    The claimant was born on February 12, 1950, and worked in Belgium from 1972 through 1992. This was sufficient to become fully eligible for Belgian social security retirement benefits. He emigrated to the United States in 1993 and began working under the retirement provisions of Social Security Act in 1994, and did so through 2016, earning 80 quarters of coverage towards U. S. retirement. The United States and Belgium have entered into a Totalization Agreement. The purpose of the agreement is to provide a retiree who has worked in the two countries with the ability to combine quarters of coverage from the two nations in order to qualify for a pension, where he would not otherwise have been able to do so. The claimant was not working for an American company in Belgium, and his earnings in Belgium were therefore not covered by the Social Security Act. ( 20 CFR 404.1004(a) ). Section 210 of the Social Security Act, ( 42 USC 410 ), provides that (a) employment means any service irrespective of citizenship or residence in the United States, (c) regardless of where or by whom performed.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n    [SSA's] Program Operations Manual System RS 00605.386 provides that WEP will not apply to workers in countries where there is a Totalization Agreement when the claimant is entitled to a regular U. S. benefit as well as a foreign benefit, and not receiving any other pension based on noncovered work. The claimant argues that his work was covered by the Belgian retirement system and as such is covered work. He argues further that the agreement requires reciprocity of treatment, (Article 3 of The Agreement): the claimant testified that a Belgian citizen would not be subject to a WEP if receiving U. S. benefits in Belgium. He was fully qualified for a Belgian pension and fully qualified for a U. S. pension, independently of one another.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n    Section 215(a)(7) of the Act [\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , the WEP] provides for a reduction formula for those qualifying for Social Security and a pension based on noncovered employment. This more commonly applies to U. S. workers under a retirement plan provided by a local county or state government, independent school district, railroad retirement, or other such entity. Its purpose is to eliminate an unintended advantage that Social Security gives to workers with low earnings, or who have not satisfied the ordinarily required quarters of coverage due to age or other agreement allowances with these local authorities. The low wage earners in these cases receive a heavily weighted benefit for wages earned over a short time, compared to those qualifying under the regular system. The equalizing factor is the reduction by the Windfall Elimination Provision. (WEP). The claimant is not seeking to defeat the purpose of the provision, and is not receiving an advantage over other workers. He has fully qualified under both the Belgian and U. S. systems. To apply the provision to him unduly penalizes him for 44 years of covered service.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n    [SSA] argues that the participation of Belgium and the U. S. in the Totalization Agreement is the trigger of the WEP by its very existence, whether or not it applies herein, even though the claimant's quarters of coverage were not totalized. 42 USC section 415(a)(7)(E) states, however, that WEP shall not apply to a totalized benefit because each country pays a portion of the totalized\n    benefit amount. 42 USC section 433(c)(l)(c). It follows that if each country pays the entire amount of two separate programs in their respective countries, the WEP would not apply as well. The claimant's attorney ... notes that each country recognizes the quarters of coverage of the other country under the Agreement. The Windfall Elimination Provision ( Public Law 98-12 ) specifically states that the WEP does not apply to anyone with 30 years of coverage (YOC), as this is a specific exemption. There would be no advantage of weighting benefits after thirty years. The claimant's totalized quarters of coverage would substantially exceed 30 years in this instance. The claimant's employment was not \"noncovered\" service, as it was covered by the national retirement systems in both countries, and not by a private pension provider, as [SSA] has characterized it.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Dkt. 131 Ex. 1, at 6-7 (citation brackets changed to parentheses) (record citations omitted) (\n    <em>\n     sic passim\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    First, the ALJ begs the major premise of the entire argument by asserting, without analysis and without so much as a citation to the operative totalization agreement, that the claimant had \"44 years of covered service.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20410\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20410\">\n     at 7\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Second, benefit reduction based on that part of the claimant's career during which he made no contributions to U.S. Social Security is the opposite of an \"undue[ ] penal[ty],\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20410\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    ; it is the very purpose of the WEP. Third, as will become clearer below, it does not follow that, because a totalized benefit payment is excluded from the WEP, nontotalized benefit payments from pensions for which the worker is independently fully eligible should be excluded from it as well. As our sister court for the District of Kansas has explained,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n    [t]hat argument ignores the different purposes of [the WEP and benefit totalization]. The [purpose of the] totalization provision [\n    <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20433\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 433\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c)(1) ] is to provide a social security benefit to potential beneficiaries who would not otherwise be eligible for benefits because of periods of employment insufficient to qualify under either of two systems.... The windfall elimination provision, on the other hand, is designed to preclude the payment of weighted (90%) benefits to a beneficiary with a relatively short career under social security who receives another pension based on substantial noncovered work. [Claimants who are] eligible for benefits under both systems [are] therefore[ ] not in need of the savings provisions of a totalization agreement. The purpose of the windfall elimination provision is applicable, but the purpose of the totalization provision is not applicable,\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    to claimants like Plaintiffs.\n    <em>\n     Vanlerberghe v.

Precisely because coverage by one country's system precludes coverage by the other's, benefit totalization under such agreements permits otherwise unfairly penalized workers to draw\n    <em>\n     one\n    </em>\n    pension in exchange for\n    <em>\n     one\n    </em>\n    career's worth of social security taxes, though paid to two different sovereigns. And, again, precisely because coverage by one country's system precludes coverage by the other's, the WEP precludes otherwise unfairly advantaged workers from\n    drawing\n    <em>\n     two\n    </em>\n    pensions in exchange for\n    <em>\n     one\n    </em>\n    career's worth of social security taxes.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Plaintiffs' theory of entitlement would stand this entirely sensible system on its head. Plaintiffs would rewrite a provision designed to eliminate windfalls into a windfall guarantee: workers would receive benefits from a sovereign for work that by hypothesis the sovereign did not tax. Plaintiffs would further obviate the entire congressional design behind totalization agreements: if Plaintiffs' position were accepted, no benefit totalization or combination of periods of coverage would ever be required. All periods of coverage under the foreign social security system would translate into periods of coverage under the Act, and no transnational worker would ever fail to independently qualify for benefits under the Act where she would otherwise require totalization to receive benefits at all.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Plaintiffs' service to Canadian or other foreign employers in Canada was not covered employment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20410\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 410\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(A)-(B).
