Still, the DoD representative believed it to \"be a relatively simple matter for the contractor to become compliant\" based on the disclosure letter AR sent to the contracting negotiator. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.) Yet, relator's complaint alleges possible material nondisclosures in this letter, such as AR's failure to report its status on all required controls, its alleged misstatements as to partial compliance with protection measures, and the fact that the company cherrypicked what data it chose to report. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 59-64.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accepting these allegations as true, the government may not have awarded these contracts if it knew the full extent of the company's noncompliance, because how close AR was to full compliance was a factor in the government's decision to enter into some contracts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Second, defendants contend that the government's response to the investigation into AR's representations surrounding its cybersecurity compliance undermines relator's allegations as to materiality. Both the DoD and NASA have continued to contract with AR since the government's investigation into the allegations of this complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Req. for Judicial Notice Exs. S-V (Docket Nos. 52-19, 52-20, 52-21 &amp; 52-22).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Such evidence is not entirely dispositive on a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Campie\n   </em>\n   , 862 F.3d at 906 (cautioning courts not to read too much into \"continued approval\" by the government, albeit in a different context). Instead, the appropriate inquiry is whether AR's alleged misrepresentations were material at the time the government entered into or made payments on the relevant contracts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/#p2001\">\n    136 S. Ct. at 2002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The contracts government agencies entered with AR after relator commenced this litigation are not at issue and possibly relate to a different set of factual circumstances. As discussed previously, relator has sufficiently alleged that AR's misrepresentations as to the extent of its noncompliance with government regulations could have affected the government's decision to enter into and pay on the contracts at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants also argue that the government's decision not to intervene in this case indicates that the alleged misrepresentations were not material. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Dismiss at 3; Reply at 9.) As the Sixth Circuit has observed, in\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   itself, the government chose not to intervene and the Supreme Court did not mention it as a factor relevant to materiality.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Prather v. Brookdale Senior Living Communities, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517274\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/822/#p836\">\n    892 F.3d 822\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 836 (6th Cir. 2018) (citing\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/#p2001\">\n    136 S.

Separately, \"[i]f relators' ability to plead sufficiently the element of materiality were stymied by the government's choice not to intervene, this would undermine the purposes of the Act,\" as the FCA allows relators to proceed even without government intervention.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/#p2001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted). And finally, there is no reason believe that the decision not to intervene is a comment on the merits of this case.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Atkins v. McInteer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5666852\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/470/1350/\">\n    470 F.3d 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1360 n.17 (11th Cir. 2006) (\"In any given case, the government may have a host of reasons for not pursuing a claim.\");\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2004 n.5 (noting that a misrepresentation is material where it goes to the \"essence of the bargain\"). This argument is unavailing at this stage of the proceedings. Relator alleges that all of AR's relevant contracts with the DoD and NASA incorporated each entity's acquisition regulations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 84, 105.) These acquisition regulations require that the defense contractor undertake cybersecurity specific measures before the contractor can handle certain technical information. Here, compliance with these cybersecurity requirements could have affected AR's ability to handle technical information pertaining to missile defense and rocket engine technology. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Req. for Judicial Notice Ex. Z at 1.) Accordingly, misrepresentations as to compliance with these cybersecurity requirements could have influenced the extent to which AR could have performed the work specified by the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Fourth and finally, defendants argue that the government's response to the defense industry's non-compliance with\n   these regulations as a whole weighs against a finding of materiality. When evaluating materiality, courts should \"consider how the [government] has treated similar violations.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Rose v. Stephens Inst.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519226\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/909/1012/#p1020\">\n    909 F.3d 1012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1020 (9th Cir. 2018). Defendants contend that the DoD never expected full technical compliance because it constantly amended its acquisition regulations and promogulated guidances that attempted to ease the burdens on the industry. This observation is not dispositive. Even if the government never expected full technical compliance, relator properly pleads that the extent to which a company was technically complaint still mattered to the government's decision to enter into a contract. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 66-72.) Defendants have not put forth any judicially noticeable evidence that the government paid a company it knew was noncompliant to the same extent as AR was. Therefore, this consideration does not weigh in favor of dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Accordingly, given the above considerations, relator has plausibly pled that defendants' alleged failure to fully disclose its noncompliance was material to the government's decision to enter into and pay on the relevant contracts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Conspiracy under the FCA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Relator's third count alleges that defendants participated in a conspiracy to submit false claims in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203729\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(C). Relator maintains that defendants and their officers conspired together to defraud the United States by knowingly submitting false claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 144.) Section 3729(a)(1)(C) imposes liability on a person who conspires to commit a violation of Section 3729(a)(1)(A) or Section 3729(a)(1)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendants argue that this count fails as a matter of law because relator has failed to identify two distinct entities that conspired. Derived from antitrust law, the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine \"holds that a conspiracy requires an agreement among two or more persons or distinct business entities.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hughes Aircraft Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513205\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/20/974/#p979\">\n    20 F.3d 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 979 (9th Cir. 1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). The doctrine stems from the definition of a conspiracy and the requirement that there be a meeting of the minds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hoefer v.

While the Ninth Circuit has not addressed this issue, several district courts have applied the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine to FCA claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.
