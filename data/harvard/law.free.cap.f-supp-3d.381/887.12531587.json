Plaintiff is suing the City of Troy, the Troy City Council, the City of Troy Planning Commission, and the City of Troy Zoning Board of Appeals along with the eight members of the zoning board of appeals in their official and individual capacities. In its complaint, Plaintiff asserts claims under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (\"RLUIPA\") as well as\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   based on allegations that Defendants placed a substantial burden on Plaintiff's free exercise of religion and violated Plaintiff's constitutional rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending before the Court is Defendants' motion to dismiss. (ECF No. 5.) Defendants seek dismissal of Plaintiff's complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), or alternatively, summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. Plaintiff opposes the motion. On March 12, 2018, the Court held a hearing in connection with the motion. For the reasons set forth below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Adam Community Center is a religious non-profit organization based in the City of Troy, Michigan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff describes its members as individuals and families who reside and work within the City. Plaintiff specifically caters to members of the Islamic faith and currently provides religious and nonreligious classes that are open to all community members in an office building located in the City. However,\n   Plaintiff alleges that it is unable to hold religious worship and holiday services at its current facility, and that there are no Muslim places of worship within the City. As a result, Plaintiff's community members must travel to various places outside of the City to engage in prayer and worship services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that since 2013 it has unsuccessfully attempted to obtain or construct a mosque or Muslim place of worship within the City. In one of these unsuccessful instances, Plaintiff describes being in the process of having a building approved as a community center with a small prayer space inside when a local resident complained to the City about the proposed use of the structure as a mosque. Plaintiff contends that the City delayed approval of its variance application for the property at issue, and ultimately, the property was sold to a different investor. In another instance, Plaintiff alleges that it attempted to purchase an existing church to use as a mosque. Plaintiff claims that after residents of the City found out about the purchase, they assembled a group of Christian investors to purchase the building at a price higher than what Plaintiff could afford.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the City and its officials have repeatedly shown animus or disdain towards Muslims throughout Plaintiff's efforts to obtain a mosque in the City. There are currently 73 approved places of worship within the City, which include Christian churches and Hindu temples. According to Plaintiff, none of the approved places of worship are a mosque or other Muslim religious institution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff claims that in 2017 it presented several different potential properties to the City and sought advice as to which ones could be developed most easily as a place of worship. Plaintiff alleges that the City's planning department did not want to assist in reviewing the properties. Plaintiff further alleges that Paul Evans, a city employee, told Plaintiff it should probably look to neighboring cities such as Rochester, Michigan to find a suitable property for a mosque. According to Plaintiff, this is not the first time City officials indicated it would be better for Plaintiff to look elsewhere for a site to construct a mosque. Plaintiff states that since 2013, City officials have on several occasions indicated that there are no places left in the City to construct a mosque, while simultaneously approving the construction of several new Christian churches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This lawsuit arises out of the City's most recent denial of a variance application submitted by Plaintiff. Plaintiff alleges that in an effort to provide for the religious needs of its members, and all of the Muslims in the City, it decided to purchase an existing commercial property which is the subject of this lawsuit. Plaintiff proposes to use this commercial building as a religious place of worship as well as a community center with a library, gymnasium, and a banquet hall. Plaintiff asserts that it needs to have a building that provides all of the foregoing amenities because there are only a few days of the week during which actual worship will take place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The property purchased\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   by Plaintiff to be utilized as a Mosque and community\n   center is located at 3635 Rochester Road, Troy MI 48085.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The property is flanked on two sides by other commercial properties, is fronted on one side by a major road, and the rear of the property abuts a line of residential properties. The property is fully developed as a commercial building, half of which is currently being used as a restaurant and banquet hall while the other half remains as an empty warehouse. Plaintiff alleges that prior to being utilized as a restaurant and warehouse, the subject property was utilized as a large-scale retail establishment known as DSW Shoe Warehouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The property is located within the general business district and is zoned for use as a general commercial building. According to the City's zoning regulations, places of worship are a use that is permitted as a matter of right within an area zoned for general business. Plaintiff alleges that the building is also permitted for A-3 type use, which Plaintiff claims allows the building to be used for large gatherings or assembly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The property has 126 parking spaces-one more than is required by the commercial zoning regulations for use of the property as a restaurant. The parking lot and usable parking spaces currently reach the property lines on three sides of the property. The fourth property line abuts the City sidewalk and ingress to the parking lot. Plaintiff alleges that there is presently no setback for the parking spaces even though the zoning regulations require a 30 foot setback. The parking spaces thus run the entire length of the property line that abuts the residential district. The only buffer between the commercial property and the residential district is a six-foot brick wall. Plaintiff alleges that most commercial properties and all now existing places of worship along Rochester Road have parking up to the property line that abuts residential districts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Although places of worship are permitted as a right within general business districts, in 2017, the City implemented special additional zoning regulations that apply to the use of a commercial building as a place of worship. Zoning ordinance Section 6.21(E) requires that all sides of a building utilized as a place of worship have a minimum of a fifty foot setback. Section 6.21(F) goes on to forbid parking in the setback areas fronting areas zoned for residential purposes and requires that any such setback area be landscaped. With respect to the property at issue in this lawsuit, Plaintiff claims that it is impossible to comply with the zoning ordinances for religious places of worship because: (1) there is only a ten foot setback in the front of the building that abuts the commercial road; (2) there is only a forty eight foot setback in the back of the building that is closest to the residential property; (3) there is no setback on the north side of the building that abuts another commercial property because that is not required for commercial buildings; and (4) compliance with the limitations on parking within the setback requirement for the rear and side yards of the existing building would eliminate nearly all of the necessary parking spaces that are required under the zoning ordinance for a place of worship that size.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Because Plaintiff allegedly could not comply with the City's zoning regulations, Plaintiff applied for a variance. After receiving initial approval of its variance application\n   by City employee Paul Evans, Plaintiff submitted its application for approval to the City of Troy Zoning Board of Appeals (the \"ZBA\"). The application included the signature of the prior owner of the commercial property in question, which Plaintiff claims was required by the City. In its application, Plaintiff did not seek a variance in order to modify the existing footprint or characteristics of the property. Instead, Plaintiff's application sought a variance from the setback regulations specifically applicable to places of worship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On June 19, 2018, the ZBA held a public hearing on Plaintiff's variance application. Several community members as well as Plaintiff's counsel spoke at the hearing. Ultimately, the ZBA unanimously denied Plaintiff's application. Plaintiff alleges that a number of irregularities occurred at the hearing. Plaintiff claims that the president of the ZBA displayed bias and animus against the mosque during his remarks about Plaintiff's application. Plaintiff claims that the president's comments were directed to the other board members in order to coerce them to deny Plaintiff's application. Plaintiff also claims that a city attorney instructed the ZBA members to ignore RLUIPA's alleged requirement to relax zoning regulations in favor of permitting religious places of worship within the City. And Plaintiff contends that it was improper for the ZBA to not issue findings of fact or identify a compelling government interest as the reason for its denial of Plaintiff's application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following the ZBA's denial of Plaintiff's variance application, on November 8, 2018, Plaintiff initiated this lawsuit. In its complaint, Plaintiff asserts that the denial of the proposed variance violates RLUIPA by placing a substantial burden on Plaintiff's ability to freely exercise its religion. In addition, Plaintiff challenges the City's enhanced zoning regulations for places of worship as unconstitutional. Plaintiff states that the City's zoning ordinance, adopted in 2017, reflects a preference for commercial businesses over religious institutions. Plaintiff states that the zoning ordinance intentionally places unconstitutional and illegal barriers against the development of places of worship since the ordinance puts far fewer restrictions on commercial buildings compared to places of worship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that it has suffered a number of hardships as a result of allegedly not being able to not construct a mosque within the City. For example, Plaintiff states that it has been unable to hire a full time religious leader, hold regular congregational prayers, or provide for the religious, educational, and spiritual needs of its members and the Muslim community in general in the City. Plaintiff claims that by not having a Muslim place of worship within the City, members of Plaintiff's community, as well as other Muslims who live and work within the City, have had their ability to practice their religion substantially burdened because there is not a single place in the City for Muslims to attend the required religious congregational prayers or where they can turn for religious education or guidance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims on several grounds and challenge Plaintiff's assertion of a constitutional or RLUIPA violation. Specifically, Defendants argue that: (1) the Troy City Council, the Troy Planning Commission, the Troy Zoning Board of Appeals (collectively, the \"Entity Defendants\") and the individual Troy ZBA members (collectively the \"Individual Defendants\") should be dismissed because they are not separate legal entities from the City of Troy, lack capacity to be sued, and/or have immunity from suit; (2) each of Plaintiff's claims arising out of allegedly discriminatory conduct prior\n   to November 2014 is barred by the statute of limitations and Plaintiff failed to exhaust its administrative remedies by not appealing the ZBA's decision to the state circuit court; (3) Plaintiff failed to establish its substantial burden claim under RLUIPA; (4) Plaintiff failed to establish its discrimination or unequal treatment claim under RLUIPA; (5) Plaintiff lacks standing because it is not the true owner of the property; (6) the Individual Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity; and (7) Plaintiff's state law claims should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In moving to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) and alternatively for summary judgment under Rule 56, Defendants do not specify which standard of review should apply to each of its arguments for dismissal. Notwithstanding, Plaintiff responds that it has stated viable claims for relief against each of the Defendants, and that issues of fact preclude summary judgment at this early stage of the litigation. Each of Defendants' arguments for dismissal is addressed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Standards of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In support of this position, Defendants state that the Entity Defendants lack capacity to be sued because they were not authorized to be sued as purportedly required by MCL 600.2051(4). Defendants also point to the City of Troy charter which does not expressly grant the Entity Defendants the power to sue or be sued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   MCL 600.2051(4) provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Actions to which this state or any governmental unit, including but not limited to a public, municipal, quasi-municipal, or governmental corporation, unincorporated board, public body, or political subdivision is a party may be brought by or against such party in its own name, or in the official capacity of an officer authorized to sue or be sued in its behalf, except that an officer of the state or any such unit shall be sued in his official capacity for the purpose of enforcing the performance by him of an official duty. Whenever any officer sues or is sued in his official capacity, he may be described as a party by his official title and not by name, subject to the discretion of the court, upon its own motion or that of any party, to require his name to be added.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20600.2051\">\n    Mich.

Without citing to any authority, Defendants contend that the phrase \"authorized to sue or be sued in its behalf\" as used in\n   MCL 600.2051(4) applies to both the list of governmental entities and the individual officers who may sue or be sued in their official capacity. Defendants contend that because the City of Troy's charter does not expressly authorize the Entity Defendants to be sued, they lack capacity to be sued in this lawsuit. But Defendants' position is not supported by the plain language of the statute. The statute authorizes suits against entities such as boards, public bodies, and political subdivisions like the Entity Defendants in this case. The phrase \"authorized to sue or be sued in its behalf\" plainly applies only to officers in their official capacities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendants also argue that the Entity Defendants should be dismissed because the City is the real party in interest.

On November 8, 2018, Plaintiff filed its complaint in this lawsuit. Defendants argue that all conduct allegedly occurring prior to November 8, 2014 should therefore be struck from Plaintiff's complaint. Defendants, however, do not contend that any of Plaintiff's specific counts should be dismissed on the basis of the statute of limitations. Instead, Defendants request that the Court dismiss the factual allegations contained in paragraphs 27-29 and 32 of the complaint as being time barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Paragraphs 27-29 and 32 address Plaintiff's prior alleged unsuccessful attempts to construct a mosque in the City. While the paragraphs allege that no mosque has been approved by the City since 2013, there is no indication from the plain text of the complaint that all of the conduct described in these paragraphs actually occurred before November 8, 2014. Moreover, the conduct in the complaint relating to 2013 does not form the basis of Plaintiff's claims. The factual allegations contained in paragraphs 27-29 and 32 relating to pre-2014 activity, if true, may be relevant to support Plaintiff's RLUIPA claims or in connection with Plaintiff's efforts to prove discriminatory intent or animus by the City and its officials. The allegations, if true, may also be relevant to defending against Plaintiff's claims. Either way, the alleged conduct is not relevant for determining when the statute of limitations began to run on Plaintiff's RLUIPA claims arising out of the ZBA's denial of the variance application or its constitutional challenge to the 2017 zoning ordinance. Plaintiff's claims in this dispute are not barred by the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Exhaustion of administrative remedies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Defendants contend that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiff's claims because Plaintiff failed to exhaust its administrative remedies in appealing the ZBA's decision. Specifically, Defendants state that Plaintiff failed to exhaust its administrative remedies because it did not appeal the ZBA's decision to the circuit court as permitted by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20125.3606\">\n    Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 125.3606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which provides that \"[a]ny party aggrieved by a decision of the zoning board of appeals may appeal to the circuit court for the county in which the property is located.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Defendants' argument on this issue is confusing. Defendants appear to admit that Plaintiff followed all of the procedural steps required by the zoning statute and that a final determination was made by the ZBA. Thus it seems Defendants are contending that Plaintiff was required to\n   appeal the ZBA's decision by filing a lawsuit with the Oakland County circuit court prior to filing a lawsuit in this Court asserting claims for religious discrimination. Defendants, however, fail to identify any authority requiring a party to pursue an appeal of a zoning board decision to the state circuit court prior to pursuing claims for constitutional violations in federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Plaintiff responds that Michigan's statute requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies does not apply to its RLUIPA claims. Plaintiff further argues that it has in fact received a final adjudication by the zoning board of appeals and therefore it is entitled to pursue litigation in this Court or in a state circuit court. Like Defendants, Plaintiff fails to cite any case law in support of its interpretation of Mich. Com. Law Ann. \u00a7 125.3606. Nonetheless, the Court conducted its own research on this issue and agrees with Plaintiff that it has exhausted its administrative remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   With regard to equal protection claims brought concerning zoning questions, the Sixth Circuit has indicated that the issue of ripeness must be considered by the district court since it is jurisdictional.\n   <em>\n    Pearson v.

Analyzing these factors is a fact intensive inquiry that requires a developed record replete with evidence to support each party's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In arguing that Plaintiff has failed to establish a substantial burden here, Defendants cite a number of cases where courts found no substantial burden was created by the denial of a rezoning application. In all but one of these cases, the court's findings were made on a developed record and in summary judgment proceedings, rather than on a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Great Lakes Soc. v.

In their reply brief, Defendants point to the Fourth Circuit's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Andon\n   </em>\n   in which the court affirmed the dismissal of a RLUIPA claim at the motion to dismiss stage.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4089460\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/510/#p515\">\n    813 F.3d at 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Andon\n   </em>\n   , the Fourth Circuit found that the plaintiff failed to plead sufficient factual allegations in the complaint, which if true, amounted to a substantial burden on the exercise of its religious beliefs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4089460\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/510/#p515\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus dismissal for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) was warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Here, Plaintiff's complaint sufficiently states a substantial burden claim. Plaintiff alleges that it cannot conduct prayer services in its current facility, that there are no Muslim places of worship within the City for Plaintiff and its community members to practice their religion, that there are no other properties available in the City that satisfy the City's zoning requirements for places of worship, and that not having a place of worship within the City poses a substantial burden on its ability to engage in religious exercise. Plaintiff also alleges facts, which if true, would support its theory that the City acted with discriminatory intent and treated Plaintiff differently from other faith based organizations. Plaintiff specifically alleges that the zoning laws have not been applied neutrally to it and that commercial businesses and Christian churches are treated more favorably.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Defendants challenge the accuracy of many of these allegations. But the record is far too incomplete for the Court to make a determination as to the merits of Plaintiff's substantial burden claim. That Plaintiff admits it currently provides religious and nonreligious educational classes at its current facility does not automatically mean that it is able to engage in worship or prayer activities at that facility. Similarly, Google's apparent description of Plaintiff's current facility as a mosque, without more, does not mean that Plaintiff's current facility is in fact a mosque. Discovery and actual evidence is needed to address several of the factors relevant to the substantial burden inquiry, such as whether the alleged burdens Plaintiff sustained were actually self-imposed hardships as opposed to being caused by the ZBA's denial of Plaintiff's variance application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In sum, the determination of whether Defendants' actions substantially burdened Plaintiff's religious exercise is too fact intensive to resolve on Defendants' motion to dismiss, and it is too premature to address on a motion for summary judgment given the limited record before the Court. While Plaintiff will ultimately be required to present actual evidence to support the allegations in its complaint, it has sufficiently satisfied its pleading requirements to survive a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    H. Plaintiff stated a discrimination and unequal treatment claim under RLUIPA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The same analysis applies to Plaintiff's discrimination and unequal treatment claim. Defendant repeatedly urges the Court to find that Plaintiff has failed to \"establish\" RLUIPA violations. However, such an argument requires a review of a complete record that is not presently before the Court. Plaintiff sufficiently alleges for the purposes of the Court's analysis under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) that Defendants treat similarly situated comparative uses more favorably than mosques. Whether there is any actual evidence to support Plaintiff's allegations will necessarily impact the evaluation of whether Plaintiff can establish its claims. Defendants' motion to dismiss these claims is denied without prejudice to Defendants'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   reassertion of these same arguments on summary judgment once the record in this case is more developed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Plaintiff's standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiff lacks standing to bring this action because it is not the actual owner of the property in question. In support of this argument, Defendants submit Plaintiff's application for variance which identifies a third party as the owner of the property. Plaintiff responds that it is in fact the owner of the property as alleged in its complaint. Plaintiff submits an agreement for the sale and assignment of the property from the prior owner to Plaintiff to establish Plaintiff's current ownership interest in the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Defendants fail to meet their burden on this issue. As an initial matter, the Court notes that a plaintiff need not possess an ownership interest in the subject property as a necessary element of a RLUIPA claim. All that is required is a legally recognized property interest in the property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Muslim Cmty. Ass'n of Ann Arbor v.

Moreover, here, Plaintiff sufficiently alleges that it is the owner of the property and has an interest in the property such that it is entitled to bring the claims asserted in the complaint. The evidence submitted by Defendants with their motion does not affirmatively demonstrate that Plaintiff is not the owner of the property or that Plaintiff has no legally recognized interest in the property.

The\n    <em>\n     Haverstick\n    </em>\n    court therefore dismissed the plaintiffs' claims against the police department at the outset of its decision. Other courts have followed\n    <em>\n     Haverstick\n    </em>\n    and dismissed \u00a7 1983 claims against police departments finding that the City is the real part in interest.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Boykin v.

Mich. 1997) (noting that a city police department is merely an agency of the city, and therefore is not a proper defendant in a \u00a7 1983 lawsuit). However, these cases do not stand for the proposition that all municipal entities cannot be sued in federal court for violations of RLUIPA or the United States Constitution. Even if Defendants are correct that a police department is not a proper party to a \u00a7 1983 action, this does not mean a city council or zoning board cannot be a party to such claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
