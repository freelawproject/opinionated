Plaintiff Ronda Halvorson brought suit under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\"), alleging decedent's death was caused by employee negligence at the Department of Veterans Affairs (\"VA\") Fort Meade hospital in Sturgis, South Dakota. (Docket 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 31-39). As defendant, the United States moves to dismiss plaintiff's complaint on the grounds it was filed untimely, resulting\n   in a lapse of the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity. (Docket 7). Plaintiff resists the motion. (Docket 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The court referred the pending motion to Magistrate Judge Veronica L. Duffy pursuant to the court's standing order of October 16, 2014, and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) for a report and recommendation (\"R&amp;R\"). (Docket 21). The magistrate judge issued an R&amp;R concluding defendant's motion to dismiss should be granted. (Docket 22). Plaintiff timely objected to the R&amp;R and defendant responded to the objections. (Dockets 23 &amp; 24). Under the Federal Magistrate Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), if a party files written objections to the magistrate judge's proposed findings and recommendations, the district court is required to \"make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court may \"accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate judge.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For the reasons given below, the court overrules plaintiff's objections in part and sustains them in part.

Extender statute objection\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff's first objection argues the two-year limit set by South Dakota's statute of repose was tolled by a separate statute. The magistrate judge concluded this argument failed under controlling South Dakota case law and was contrary to the plain terms of the statute. The court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The issue arises from South Dakota's medical malpractice statute of repose. The statute states \"an action against a [health care professional], whether based upon contract or tort, can be commenced only within two years after the alleged malpractice ... occurred.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   SDCL \u00a7 15-2-14.1. However, the extender statute suspends \"[t]he running of any statute of limitations on a cause of action belonging to a decedent ... for one year[.]\" SDCL \u00a7 29A-3-109. Defendant's alleged negligence occurred on May 19, 2015, but plaintiff did not file this suit until May 10, 2018. Plaintiff's suit is untimely under the statute of repose but would be timely if the repose deadline is subject to the extender statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A South Dakota Supreme Court case squarely resolves this objection. In\n   <em>\n    Pitt-Hart v. Sanford USD Med. Ctr.\n   </em>\n   , the South Dakota Supreme Court unequivocally affirmed that SDCL \u00a7 15-2-14.1 is a statute of repose which \"will not be tolled\n   <em>\n    for any reason\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6807591\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/878/406/#p413\">\n    878 N.W.2d 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 413 (S.D. 2016) (quotation omitted) (emphasis in original). The two-year repose period created by SDCL \u00a7 15-2-14.1 cannot be tolled for any reason under\n   <em>\n    Pitt-Hart\n   </em>\n   , including by operation of the extender statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6807591\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/878/406/#p413\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In any case, as the magistrate judge noted, the extender statute by its plain terms applies only to statutes of limitation, not statutes of repose. SDCL \u00a7 29A-3-109 (\"The running of any\n   <em>\n    statute of limitations\n   </em>\n   ....\") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiff refers the court to her argument in response to defendant's motion to dismiss that the extender statute's use of the term \"statute of limitations\" should be interpreted to include statutes of repose. (Docket 16 at pp. 2-6). She noted the South Dakota Supreme Court used the terms interchangeably on occasion and that \"there is no evidence that the South Dakota Legislature used the term 'statute of limitation' in a technical legal sense and intended the statute to suspend statutes of limitation but not statutes of repose[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   It is true \"[i]nconsistency has persisted in almost all of [the South Dakota Supreme Court's] decisions involving SDCL 15-2-14.1.\"\n   <em>\n    Pitt-Hart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6807591\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/878/406/#p413\">\n    878 N.W.2d at 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This inconsistency motivated the South Dakota Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Pitt-Hart\n   </em>\n   to \"correct the past practice of referring to SDCL 15-2-14.1 as a statute of limitation in contravention of its status as a statute of repose.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6807591\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/878/406/#p413\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6807591\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/878/406/#p413\">\n    at 415-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court will not base its statutory analysis on since-corrected mistakes in past case law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The extender statute on its face applies only to statutes of limitation. SDCL \u00a7 29A-3-109. South Dakota courts\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   adhere to two primary rules of statutory construction. The first rule is that the language expressed in the statute is the paramount consideration. The second rule is that if the words and phrases in the statute have plain meaning and effect, [courts] should simply declare their meaning and not resort to statutory construction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Winslow v. Fall River Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12555348\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/909/713/#p717\">\n    909 N.W.2d 713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 717 (S.D. 2018) (quotation and citation omitted). These rules easily lead the court to conclude the extender statute means what it says and applies only to statutes of limitation. Plaintiff cites no authority permitting the court to infer the South Dakota Legislature secretly intended the extender statute to include statutes of repose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   She does cite a principle of South Dakota statutory construction holding \"[w]ords used in the South Dakota Codified Laws are to be understood in their ordinary sense[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Pitt-Hart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6807591\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/878/406/#p413\">\n    878 N.W.2d at 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting SDCL \u00a7 2-14-1 ). Plaintiff does not explain how the court, understanding the words of the statute in their ordinary sense, is to construe the extender statute's use of the term statute of limitation to refer to statutes of repose. Aside from being composed of different words, the two terms refer to entirely different concepts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6807591\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/878/406/#p413\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6807591\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/878/406/#p413\">\n    at 413-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The \"technical legal sense\" of the term statute of limitations is the same as its ordinary sense in that neither encompass statutes of repose. (Docket 16 at p. 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The extender statute does not toll the statute of repose. Plaintiff's objection is overruled, and the R&amp;R is adopted on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Preemption objection\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiff's second objection concedes the statute of repose would bar her claim but argues the time limitation provisions of the FTCA preempt the statute of repose. (Docket 23 at pp. 4-8). Resolving this objection requires the court to wade into a contested and developing area of FTCA law. After thoroughly surveying the legal landscape on this point, the magistrate judge concluded the South Dakota statute of repose is a substantive state tort law incorporated by the FTCA. (Docket 22 at pp. 18-21, 24-31). The court agrees the statute of repose is a substantive state tort law but concludes it cannot be reconciled with the FTCA's administrative adjudication provisions. The court holds the FTCA preempts the application of the statute of repose to plaintiff's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Conflict of authority\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Given the importance of this issue both to plaintiff and for FTCA plaintiffs in South Dakota more broadly, the court will outline the competing legal theories on FTCA preemption of state statutes of repose. In general, courts finding no preemption have focused on the FTCA's explicit incorporation of state substantive law. Courts taking the opposite view have emphasized the conflict between the FTCA's administrative adjudication requirement and state statutes of repose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has not yet determined whether the FTCA preempts state statutes of repose. One appellate court concurrence found preemption. In\n   <em>\n    Kennedy v.

(Docket 22 at p. 28). It is certainly true that a South Dakota FTCA plaintiff in the abstract can comply with both. The statute of repose sets a two-year deadline and the FTCA's administrative adjudication requirement only subtracts six months from that total. However, the facts of this case show the illusory nature of that possibility. The decedent here was injured by the VA's alleged malpractice on May 19, 2015, and passed away on June 3, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff was appointed administrator of decedent's estate on May 9, 2017, a mere ten days before the two-year period the FTCA allows for claimants to file their administrative claim expired. The repose period likewise expired on May 19, 2017, while plaintiff was just beginning her mandatory administrative adjudication. She could not have maintained her wrongful death FTCA claim and complied with the statute of repose.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   As plaintiff's experience illustrates, applying the statute of\n   repose would convert the FTCA's administrative adjudication provisions into a trap, requiring all but the most diligent wrongful death plaintiffs to undergo adjudication which would inevitably result in the barring of their claims if a settlement was not reached.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For plaintiff, this is a case \"where compliance with both federal and state regulations [was] a physical impossibility,\" but the court acknowledges some plaintiffs may be able to comply with both statutes.\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/#p399\">\n    567 U.S. at 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/#p399\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Importing the statute of repose into this scheme directly upsets Congress' choice to encourage administrative adjudication. Under defendant's theory of the case, plaintiffs are strongly encouraged to cut short the administrative process at the six-month mark in order to avoid the statute of repose. The court cannot endorse a theory which harmonizes the FTCA's incorporation of substantive state tort law and its administrative adjudication requirements by penalizing plaintiffs who take up Congress' invitation to engage in lengthy settlement negotiations at the agency level. Defendant's theory presents a serious obstacle to Congress' encouragement of administrative adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The legislative history of the 1966 FTCA amendment, for those who consider it, confirms the court's statutory interpretation. In the Supreme Court's telling,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   the Department of Justice proposed that Congress amend the FTCA to \"requir[e] all claims to be presented to the appropriate agency for consideration and possible settlement before a court action could be instituted. This procedure would make it possible for the claim first to be considered by the agency whose employee's activity allegedly caused the damage. That agency would have the best information concerning the activity which gave rise to the claim. Since it is the one directly concerned, it can be expected that claims which are found to be meritorious can be settled more quickly without the need for filing suit and possible expensive and time-consuming litigation.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   The Senate Judiciary Committee further noted that \"the improvements contemplated by [the 1966 amendments] would not only benefit private litigants, but would also be beneficial to the courts, the agencies, and the Department of Justice itself.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    McNeil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11989\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/106/\">\n    508 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   112 n.7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11989\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/106/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting S. Rep. No. 89-1327, at 2-3 (1966) ). Adopting defendant's theory would undercut Congress' purpose of encouraging settlement of meritorious claims and avoiding litigation. In fact, it encourages the opposite, incentivizing plaintiffs to rush their cases to federal court at the earliest opportunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Moreover, medical malpractice claims are among the most complex and time-consuming actions in FTCA litigation. The claimant must fully investigate the alleged medical malpractice, must compile years of medical records, and must retain one or more medical experts specializing in the field of medical care at issue. All this must be accomplished by the claimant before or during the FTCA administrative adjudication phase. Likewise, the responding agency must independently develop this information in order to settle or deny the FTCA administrative claim. These realities, well understood by any attorney competent to practice FTCA medical malpractice law, will often extend agency proceedings past the mandatory six months. Under defendant's theory, many medical malpractice cases would lose the benefit of administrative adjudication because plaintiffs would need to cut the agency proceedings short and file in federal court to avoid the repose deadline. The court cannot reconcile these practical consequences of defendant's theory with Congress' choice to encourage administrative adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Supreme Court's oft-expressed presumption against implied preemption of \"the historic police powers of the States\" does not dislodge the court's statutory analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/#p399\">\n    567 U.S. at 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/#p399\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court is considering how to resolve the conflict between Congress' choice to incorporate state tort law and its choice to encourage administrative resolution of tort claims, which are federal matters. When this precise issue is more specifically framed, it is much less clear that the presumption against preemption carries significant weight. Even if the presumption applies with full force, the court holds it is rebutted by the insuperable conflict between South Dakota's statute of repose and the FTCA's administrative adjudication provisions. The presumption cannot lead the court to penalize FTCA plaintiffs for complying with federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In holding the FTCA did not preempt the South Dakota statute of repose, the magistrate judge concluded the FTCA's administrative adjudication provisions were not \"so important to the objective of the statute as a whole that [they] should displace any substantive state statute of repose with which [they] might conflict.\" (Docket 22 at p. 28). The court's statutory analysis does not support this theory. There is no need to elevate the FTCA's private person analogue over its administrative adjudication requirement to resolve a conflict engendered by a state statute of repose. The conflict can be resolved without doing violence to Congress' intent in crafting both parts of the FTCA by preempting the incorporation of the state statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Food &amp; Drug Admin. v.

Here, one key purpose of the FTCA is to require plaintiffs to undergo at least six months of administrative adjudication and encourage them to stick with the administrative process through its conclusion, no matter how long that might take.

Nevertheless, the Court reiterated there its reminder that \"[t]he case for federal pre-emption is particularly weak where Congress has indicated its awareness of the operation of state law in a field of federal interest, and has nonetheless decided to stand by both concepts and to tolerate whatever tension there [is] between them.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581203\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2175/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The court might agree with the magistrate judge's reliance on\n   <em>\n    CTS Corp.\n   </em>\n   if only tension existed between the statute of repose and the FTCA's administrative adjudication provision.

Under defendant's theory, plaintiff's compliance with the FTCA's administrative requirements doomed her case from the outset. While Congress may have intended to tolerate some tension between state substantive tort law and the FTCA, the court cannot conclude Congress intended to allow state law to eviscerate the administrative adjudication provision. The better approach is to give full effect to the administrative adjudication provision by holding it preempts South Dakota's statute of repose to the extent the two conflict.
