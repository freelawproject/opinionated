(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Deed of Trust, Ex. 1 to Airmotive's Mot. Summ. J. (\"MSJ\"), ECF No. 39-1). In 2009, Thomas Jeffress (\"Borrower\") purchased the Property by way of a loan in the amount of $ 189,869.00, secured by a deed of trust (the \"DOT\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Countrywide Bank served as the original lender for the DOT, and Mortgage Electronic Registration System, Inc. (\"MERS\") was the nominal beneficiary on behalf of that bank. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). BANA received the DOT through an assignment on November 15, 2011. (Notice of Assignment, Ex. C to BANA's MSJ, ECF No. 50-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Upon Borrower's failure to stay current on his payment obligations, ACS, on behalf of HOA, initiated foreclosure proceedings by recording a notice of delinquent assessment lien and a subsequent notice of default and election to sell. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Delinquent Assessment Lien, Ex. 2 to Airmotive's MSJ, ECF No. 39-2); (Notice of Default, Ex. 3 to Airmotive's MSJ, ECF No. 39-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 9, 2011, the law firm Miles, Bauer, Bergstrom &amp; Winters LLP (\"Miles Bauer\"), on behalf of BANA, sent a letter to ACS requesting a ledger identifying the amount of HOA's superpriority lien. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Request for Accounting at 6-9, Ex. 1 to Miles Aff., ECF No. 50-7). ACS responded with a letter stating, \"without the action of [BANA's] foreclosure, a 9 month Statement of Account is not valid.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ACS Letter, Ex. 3 to Miles Aff., ECF No. 50-7). ACS's letter also stated that it would provide a Statement of Account if BANA submitted a \"Trustees Deed Upon Sale showing [BANA's] possession of the property and the date that it occurred.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Thereafter, ACS proceeded with foreclosure by recording a notice of foreclosure sale and subsequently foreclosing on the Property. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Trustee's Sale, Ex. 4 to Airmotive's MSJ, ECF No. 39-4). On October 12, 2011, Las Vegas Development Group, LLC recorded a foreclosure deed, stating that it purchased the Property for $ 3,801.00. (Foreclosure Deed, Ex. 5 to Airmotive's MSJ, ECF No. 39-5). Las Vegas Development Group, LLC then conveyed ownership of the Property to Airmotive. (Deed, Ex. 6 to Airmotive's MSJ, ECF No. 39-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   BANA filed its Complaint on February 17, 2016, asserting the following causes of action arising from the foreclosure and sale of the Property: (1) quiet title; (2) breach of NRS 116.1113 ; (3) wrongful foreclosure; and (4) injunctive relief.

(BANA's MSJ 5:28-14:26, ECF No. 50). Specifically, BANA argues that its letter offering to pay the HOA's superpriority lien, coupled with HOA's refusal to provide BANA the superpriority lien amount, rendered HOA's foreclosure incapable of extinguishing\n   BANA's DOT. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Airmotive and HOA, however, move to dismiss each of BANA's claims as untimely. (Airmotive's Mot. Dismiss (\"MTD\") 6:3-9:27, ECF No. 40); (HOA's MSJ 11:12-27, ECF No. 49). Airmotive and HOA also move for summary judgment in their favor on the merits of BANA's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court's discussion below first addresses the applicable limitations periods for BANA's claims.

Therefore, though BANA did not actually send payment, BANA is entitled to summary judgment on the issue of tender because BANA's offer to pay, alongside ACS's rejection, \"operated to cure the default as to that portion of the lien such that the ensuing foreclosure sale did not extinguish the first deed of trust.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p323\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    C.
