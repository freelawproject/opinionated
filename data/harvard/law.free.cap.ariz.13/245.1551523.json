Potter were recited to he the parties of the first part, and Shannon Copper Company the party of the second part. By <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>the terms of the contract, among other matters, the party of the first part agreed to sell the Shannon Copper Company fifty-one per cent of the capital stock of the railroad company, the entire capitalization being $50,000, divided into 500 shares of the par value of $100 each. And the Shannon Copper Company agreed to pay therefor the sum of $10,000 in specified installments, through a specified bank. A further provision of the contract is as follows: \u201cAnd the party of the second part, for and in consideration of the faithful performance of the covenants herein contained by the parties of the first part, hereby agrees to pay an amount equal to ten per cent (10%) per annum from January 1, 1909, on the capital stock of the aforementioned Clifton Northern Railroad Company, i. e., five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per annum, for a period of ten (10) years; such interest to be paid semiannually.\u201d The $10,000 was paid and received by Potter, and the fifty-one per cent of the capital stock of the railroad company delivered to the copper company. The first two semi-annual interest charges were paid into the treasury of the railroad company, instead of to Potter, and were expended in betterments and maintenance of the road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-4\">Potter brought suit against the corporations, alleging among other things: \u201cThat in fact the words \u2018parties of the first part\u2019 are frequently used in said contract where they refer to and mean plaintiff only; that the said contract recites \u2018that the parties of the first part are owners of the majority of the capital stock of the Clifton Northern Railroad Company,\u2019 whereas, in truth, as was well known prior to and at the time of the execution of the said contract to all the parties thereto and was intended by them to be expressed therein, the plaintiff was then the legal owner of all but four shares of the capital stock of the Clifton Northern Railroad Company, to wit, of 496 shares thereof, and was the equitable owner of the remaining four shares thereof, while the Clifton Northern Railroad Company was not the owner, legal or equitable, of any of the capital stock of the said company; that the said contract recites \u2018that the said parties of the first part hereby agree to sell, assign and transfer to the said party of the second part, fifty-one per cent (51%) of the capital stock of the said' Clifton Northern Railroad Company, whereas, in truth, that was the agreement only of the plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>as was then and theretofore well known to all the parties to the said contract\u201d \u2014 and recovered judgment for the amount of the said interest installments so paid into the treasury of the railroad company, this appeal being from such judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b272-5\">M.

The intention of the contracting parties is to control, and this must be deduced from the entire agreement, and from all its provisions considered together. It must be considered as a whole so as to give effect, if possible, to all parts of it. <em>Far West Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Witmer Bros., </em>143 Cal. 306, 77 Pac. 61; <em>Stockton S. &amp; L.

Nave, for Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-8\">Inasmuch as the trial was before the court without a jury, it will be presumed that the court ignored the improper matter if any was admitted, and these improvident rulings do not constitute reversible error. This is true whether the matter is merely immaterial <em>(Abernathy </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>8 Ariz. 173, 71 Pac. 914; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Green, </em>3 Ariz. 207, 73 Pac. 399), or entirely incompetent <em>(California Dev. Co. </em>v. <em>Yuma Val. Co., </em>9 Ariz. 366, 84 Pac. 88; <em>Seaverns </em>v. <em>Costello, </em>8 Ariz. 308, 71 Pac. 930; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marks, </em>5 Ariz. 405, 52 Pac. 773; <em>Boston Co. </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>3 Ariz. 5, 20 Pac. 310). \u201cIf the meaning of a writing by itself is affected with un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>certainty, the intention of the parties may be ascertained by extrinsic evidence.\u201d <em>Ripon College </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>66 Minn. 179, 68 N. W. 837. \u201cWhere the language of a written instrument is ambiguous and uncertain, so that it cannot be clearly ascertained therefrom which of two interpretations was intended by the parties, the circumstances surrounding the execution of such instrument should be received in evidence as an aid to the ascertainment of such intent.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Shields, </em>78 Kan. 305, 96 Pac. 351. \u201cEven a patent ambiguity may be explained by parol. \u2019\u2019 <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>Crossan, </em>7 N.

Ed. 46. \u201cWhere the language of an agreement is contradictory, obscure, or ambiguous, or where its meaning is doubtful, so that the contract is fairly susceptible of two constructions, one of which makes it fair, customary, and such as prudent men would naturally execute, while the other makes it inequitable, unusual, or such as reasonable men would not be likely to enter into, the interpretation which makes it a rational and probable agreement must be preferred to that which makes it an unusual, unfair, or improbable contract.\u201d <em>Pressed Steel Car Co. </em>v. <em>Eastern Ry. Co., </em>121 Fed. 609, 611, 57 C. C. A. 635. \u201cA party who takes an agreement prepared by another, and upon its faith . . . parts with his property, should have a construction given to the instrument favorable to him.\u201d <em>Noonan </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>76 U.

Ed. 757.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b273-4\">DOE, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Adz\">The contract expressly provided that the first payment should be made to a specified bank, and, at the conclusion of the recitals providing for the payment of the several installments to be made before the delivery of the stock, they are expressly required to be made to the same bank, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>yet that portion of the contract providing for the payment of the semi-annual interest installments is silent as to whom they shall be paid, and is, to that extent, ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Assuming the correctness of the finding of the lower court that- at the time of the execution of the contract Potter was the legal owner of most of the stock of the railroad company and the equitable owner of the remainder, the recital in the contract \u201cthat the parties of the first part were the owners of a majority of the stock of the railroad company\u201d is only a partial truth. Although Potter and the railroad company are recited to be \u201cthe parties of the first part,\u201d it by no means follows that their liability or interest is joint. <em>Consolidated Canal Co. </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>5 Ariz. 80, 46 Pac. 74; <em>Berry Harvester Co. </em>v. <em>Wood M. &amp; R. Mach. Co., </em>152 N. Y. 540, 46 N. E. 952; <em>Goldsmith </em>v. <em>Sachs </em>(C. C.), 17 Fed. 728, 8 Saw. 110. In the light of the surrounding circumstances as disclosed by the evidence, we think the interest of the parties of the first part was several rather than joint.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The rule, as stated by Lord Bacon, that parol evidence is inadmissible to explain a patent ambiguity, has generally been thought too broad, and, even where followed, has usually been limited in its application. The rule is, we think, correctly stated as follows: \u2018 \u2018 The true rule with regard to patent ambiguities must be taken to be this: The patent ambiguity which cannot be explained by parol evidence is that which remains uncertain after the court has received evidence of the surrounding circumstances and collateral facts which are of such a nature as to throw light upon the intention of the parties. In other words, and more generally speaking, if the court, after placing itself in the situation in which the parties stood at the time of executing the instrument, and with full understanding of the force and import of the words, cannot definitely ascertain the meaning and intention of the parties from the language of the instrument thus illustrated, it is a case of incurable and hopeless uncertainty, and the instrument is so far inoperative and void; and it cannot be sustained or rendered operative by the introduction of evidence which would necessarily have the effect of adding new terms to the writing. \u2019 \u2019 17 Cyc. 682, and see authorities there cited. There are many cases which entirely ignore the distinction and hold that a patent as well as a latent ambiguity may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>explained by parol evidence. <em>Jenny Lind Co. </em>v. <em>Bower, </em>11 Cal. 199; <em>Ripon College </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>66 Minn. 179, 68 N. W. 837; <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Stringham, </em>1 S. D. 406, 47 N. W. 408; <em>Conservative Realty Co. </em>v. <em>St. L. Brewers\u2019 Assn., </em>133 Mo. App. 261, 113 S. W. 231; <em>Meyers </em>v. <em>Maverick </em>(Tex. Civ. App.), 28 S. W. 716; <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>Crossan, </em>7 N. M. 589, 38 Pac. 247. We think it entirely immaterial whether the ambiguity in the contract under consideration be patent or latent, as by the aid of extrinsic evidence the true intent of the parties can and has been made to clearly appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">It is urged that the evidence does not sustain the findings and judgment of the lower court. While the parties met and agreed upon the terms of the contract, the phraseology in which it was expressed was left to a stenographer in the em-. ploy of the copper company. Under such conditions' Potter is entitled to a favorable construction of the contract. \u201cA party, who takes an agreement prepared by another, and upon its faith incurs obligations or parts with his property, should have a construction given to the instrument favorable to him.\u201d <em>Noonan </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>76 U. S. 394, 19 L. Ed. 757.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">It seems apparent from the evidence that Potter received the money paid through the bank and applied the same to his personal use, and that this must have been known to and expected by the copper company, and this practical construction of the contract by the parties is entitled to great weight as tending to throw light upon the intention of the parties as to who should receive the remaining payments. <em>Powers </em>v. <em>World\u2019s Fair M. Co., </em>10 Ariz. 6, 86 Pac. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">It seems clear that the semi-annual payments were a part, and the principal part, of the consideration for the sale of the railroad stock, and, as all the stock sold to the copper company was the sole property of Potter, we can only conclude that it was- the intention of the parties that such payments should go to the stockholders in proportion to their several holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">No suggestion is made that proper evidence was excluded, and, if any immaterial or incompetent evidence was admitted, it will be presumed in this court, the ease having been tried below before the court without a jury, that the court ignored such improper evidence. <em>Abernathy </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>8 Ariz. 173, 71 Pac. 914; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Green, </em>3 Ariz. 207, 73 Pac. 399; <em>California Development Co. </em>v. <em>Yuma Valley Co., </em>9 Ariz. 366, 84 Pac. 88; <em>Seaverns </em>v. <em>Costello, </em>8 Ariz. 308, 71 Pac. 930; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number><em>United States </em>v. <em>Marks, </em>5 Ariz. 405, 52 Pac. 773; <em>Boston Co. </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>3 Ariz. 5, 20 Pac. 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\">No error appearing in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">KENT, C.
