On March 9, 1973, the district court ordered this suit consolidated with a similar suit filed by Wells against Spring Woods Bank. Wells sought leave to file a second amended petition on March 11, 1974, advancing additional claims against South Main Bank and to join First City National Bank of Houston and its attorneys <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>as defendants. This motion and subsequent motions to reconsider were denied by the district court. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">Appeals may be taken to this court only from final decisions, subject to certain exceptions carefully enunciated in the statutes, court rules, and cases construing them. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291-92 (1970); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54. Denial of leave to amend pleadings is ordinarily not final for purposes of appeal. <em>See, e. g., Horner </em>v. <em>Ferron, </em>362 F.2d 224, 230 (9th Cir. 1966); <em>De-Nubilo v. United States, </em>343 F.2d 455, 456-57 (2d Cir. 1965); <em>cf. Jones v. Diamond, </em>519 F.2d 1090, 1095 (5th Cir. 1975). The right which Wells seeks to assert is neither separable from and collateral to the rights asserted in his suit against South Main Bank nor so independent of the main cause of action as to require immediate appellate treatment. Therefore, the exception to the finality rule enunciated in <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949) is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
