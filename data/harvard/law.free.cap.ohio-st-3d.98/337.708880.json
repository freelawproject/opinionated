(\u201cMoore\u201d), for certain services it provided to some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>of its clients for the audit period January 1, 1994, to December 31, 1996. Moore had understandings, but no written contracts, with these clients that it would become the employer of persons designated by the clients. Moore did not interview or test the persons designated by the clients. The clients determined whom they wanted to work for them and sent those persons to Moore. The persons sent would fill out paperwork to become Moore employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">{\u00b6 2} The persons sent to Moore by its clients were put on Moore\u2019s payroll. Moore paid these employees wages after it received time slips from the clients. Moore paid all taxes and other fees based on the employees\u2019 earnings. Moore did not charge the employees a fee for being on its payroll; rather, Moore\u2019s clients paid Moore a fee for its services.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">{\u00b6 3} The Tax Commissioner assessed a sales tax against Moore for the services described above. Moore filed for a petition for reassessment. After a hearing, the Tax Commissioner denied Moore\u2019s petition. Moore appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d). Following a hearing at which Michael D. Moore, owner of Moore Personnel Services, Inc., testified, the BTA reversed the commissioner. The BTA found that such services did not constitute employment services, because Moore did not provide or supply employees to its customers but instead provided nontaxable payroll and personnel services.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">{\u00b6 4} This cause is now before this court as an appeal of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">{\u00b6 5} The Tax Commissioner contends that the service that Moore performed for its clients is subject to the Ohio sales tax as an \u201cemployment service,\u201d as that term is defined in the Ohio Revised Code. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">{\u00b6 6} The tax in question is levied by R.C. 5739.02, which levies a sales tax \u201con each retail sale made in this state.\u201d The term \u201cretail sale\u201d is defined in R.C. 5739.01(E) as including all \u201csales,\u201d unless specifically excepted. A \u201csale\u201d is defined in R.C. 5739.01(B)(3)(k) as including all transactions for a consideration by which an \u201c[ejmployment service is or is to be provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">{\u00b6 7} The facts in this case relevant to determining whether Moore was performing a taxable employment service are not in dispute. What is in dispute is the ultimate fact inferred from those underlying facts. In discussing whether this court has jurisdiction to review ultimate facts, as distinguished from basic facts, we stated in <em>Ace Steel Baling, Inc. v. Porterfield </em>(1969), 19 Ohio St.2d 137, 142, 48 O.O.2d 169, 249 N.E.2d 892, \u201cThe decision of the [BTA] derived from an inference of an ultimate fact, <em>i.e., </em>a factual conclusion derived from given basic facts. The reasonableness of such an inference is a question appropriate for judicial determination. \u2018What the evidence in a case tends to prove, is a question of law; and when all the facts are admitted which the evidence tends to prove, the effect of such facts raises a question of law only.\u2019 <em>Turner v. Turner </em>(1867), 17 Ohio St. 449, 452 [1867 WL 29]. See also, <em>Southern Pacific Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1953), 41 Cal.2d 354, 362, 260 P.2d 70.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>{\u00b6 8} To determine whether Moore was providing a taxable employment service, the facts must be compared to the definition of \u201cemployment service\u201d in R.C. 5739.01(JJ), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c \u2018Employment service\u2019 means providing or supplying personnel, on a temporary or long-term basis, to perform work or labor under the supervision or control of another, when the personnel so supplied receive their wages, salary, or other compensation from the provider of the service. \u2018Employment service\u2019 does not include:</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c(1) Acting as a contractor or subcontractor, where the personnel performing the work are not under the direct control of the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(2) Medical and health care services.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(3) Supplying personnel to a purchaser pursuant to a contract of at least one year between the service provider and the purchaser that specifies that each employee covered under the contract is assigned to the purchaser on a permanent basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(4) Transactions between members of an affiliated group, as defined in division (B)(3)(e) of this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">{\u00b6 14} To satisfy the definition of \u201cemployment service,\u201d a service must meet three separate requirements: (1) it must provide or supply personnel on a temporary or long-term basis, (2) the personnel must perform work or labor under the supervision or control of another, and (3) the personnel must receive their wages, salary, or other compensation from the provider of the service. Only the first requirement is in dispute in this case. Therefore, the resolution of this case is determined by whether Moore was \u201csupplying or providing\u201d personnel as those words are used in the definition of \u201cemployment service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">{\u00b6 15} The words \u201cproviding\u201d and \u201csupplying\u201d are not defined in the statute. However, when words are not defined in a statute they are to be given their common and ordinary meaning absent a contrary legislative intent. <em>State v. Conyers </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 246, 249, 719 N.E.2d 535. In addition, R.C. 1.42 provides that the terms used in statutes \u201cshall be read in context and construed according to the rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">{\u00b6 16} In <em>Sowers v. Schaeffer </em>(1949), 152 Ohio St. 65, 68, 39 O.O. 383, 87 N.E.2d 257, we stated that \u201c[a]s defined in the Oxford English Dictionary (1933), the word \u2018provide\u2019 means \u2018to supply or furnish for use.\u2019 \u201d In another sales tax case, <em>Key Serv. Corp. v. Zaino </em>(2002), 95 Ohio St.3d 11, 14, 764 N.E.2d 1015, we used Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1993) to define the word \u201cprovide\u201d as \u201cto supply for use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">{\u00b6 17} In <em>Van Dyne Crotty Co. v. Limbach </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 3, 4, 558 N.E.2d 44, also a sales tax case, we stated that \u201c[ajccording to Black\u2019s Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Dictionary (5th Ed.1979) 1291, \u2018supply\u2019 means to \u2018[t]o furnish with what is wanted; * * * the act of furnishing with what is wanted.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">{\u00b6 18} When we insert the definitions set forth above into the definition of \u201cemployment service,\u201d we find that it was Moore that was furnishing personnel for use by its clients and it was Moore that was furnishing its clients with the personnel the clients wanted. There is no question that the personnel were employees of Moore. The personnel cannot be considered as having been furnished to Moore by Moore\u2019s clients because, as we noted in <em>Van Dyne Crotty Co., </em>\u201c[o]ne does not furnish another with * * * articles * * * that belong to that other individual.\u201d Id., 53 Ohio St.3d at 4-5, 558 N.E.2d 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">{\u00b6 19} The fact that Moore\u2019s clients chose whom they wanted Moore to hire is not a factor to be considered in determining whether Moore was providing an \u201cemployment service.\u201d The definition of \u201cemployment service\u201d set forth by the General Assembly makes no distinction as to who initially chooses the personnel that are being provided or supplied. If the General Assembly had intended the definition to turn on who initially chooses the personnel, it would have put that requirement in the definition. We will not add such a requirement. In <em>Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Porterfield </em>(1970), 24 Ohio St.2d 24, 27-28, 53 O.O.2d 13, 263 N.E.2d 249, we stated that \u201c[n]either the Board of Tax Appeals, nor this court, may legislate to add a requirement to a statute enacted by the General Assembly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">{\u00b6 20} The relevant facts are that Moore was providing and supplying personnel on a temporary or long-term basis to perform work for another. The personnel supplied by Moore were Moore\u2019s employees, although they worked under the supervision or control of Moore\u2019s clients. The personnel supplied to Moore\u2019s clients received their compensation from Moore, the \u201cprovider of the service.\u201d Thus, Moore\u2019s services meet the definition of \u201cemployment service\u201d set forth in R.C. 5739.01(JJ).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">{\u00b6 21} Because the BTA ruled that Moore had not been providing an employment service, it did not consider whether Moore\u2019s services were excepted under R.C. 5739.01(JJ)(3). On remand, the BTA is to consider Moore\u2019s status under R.C. 5739.01(JJ)(3), if such review is appropriate under Moore\u2019s notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">{\u00b6 22} For the foregoing reasons, we find the decision of the BTA to be unlawful and unreasonable. We therefore reverse the decision and remand the cause to the BTA for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">Decision reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b448-11\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
