Pontillo, as the District Vice-President of Business, Community, and Economic Development. Pontillo\u2019s duties included providing leadership for the college\u2019s workforce development unit and coordinating services with campus provosts. Pontillo was a member of the Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio (\u201cPERS\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">{\u00b6 2} After experiencing back pain exacerbated after he fell off a treadmill in January 1998, Pontillo had a magnetic resonance imaging scan, which revealed a growth near his spine. In June 1998, Pontillo had the growth removed, and he did not return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-12\">{\u00b6 3} In April 2000, Pontillo applied for disability retirement benefits with PERS. In his application, Pontillo stated that he believed he was incapacitated for his duties because following his surgery, he \u201cwas left with the inability to walk, stand for more than 5-10 minutes, move in/out of automobiles/buses without support fixtures, climb or descend stairs due to physical discomfort and limitations of movement per knee and legs and lower back area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-13\">{\u00b6 4} Pontillo also submitted an April 12, 2000 report of his attending physician, neurosurgeon Kamel F. Muakkassa, M.D. On the printed form provided for the doctor\u2019s report, spaces were included for Pontillo\u2019s subjective and objective symptoms and Dr. Muakkassa\u2019s diagnosis, including test results:</p>\n<p id=\"b608-14\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe subjective and objective symptoms of which said employee complains are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>{\u00b6 6} \u201cDiagnosis: (Please include any test results which enabled you to make this diagnosis, ie: X-rays, MRI readings, etc.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">{\u00b6 7} Dr. Muakkassa recorded Pontillo\u2019s complaints as low-back pain, right-leg and left-thigh weakness, right-foot numbness, and gait difficulty. Dr. Muakkassa diagnosed degenerative lumbar disease at L2-5, lumbar disc disease at L35, and bilateral facet joint hypertrophy at L2-S1, but he did not include or specify any test results that supported his diagnosis. Dr. Muakkassa reported that Pontillo was physically incapacitated for the performance of his duties because his pain limited his ability to walk, sit, or stand for prolonged periods of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">{\u00b6 8} Pontillo subsequently provided PERS with a report completed by his employer. In the report, Sunil Chand, the Executive Vice-President of Academic and Student Affairs at Cuyahoga Community College, specified that Pontillo\u2019s duties as district vice-president required constant mobility, including \u201cregular meetings with internal and especially external leaders; tours of facilities, on-site inspections; meetings at early and late hours; [and] travel locally and nationally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">{\u00b6 9} Pursuant to R.C. 145.35(E), PERS contacted Pontillo to arrange for an independent medical examination. PERS sent the physician a copy of Dr. Muakkassa\u2019s report. On June 5, 2000, Kennard C. Ford, M.D., examined Pontillo on behalf of PERS and diagnosed spinal stenosis and left-knee osteoarthritis. Pontillo advised Dr. Ford that he had retired from Cuyahoga Community College and currently worked as a consultant'for a real estate company. Pontillo further advised Dr. Ford that he could not \u201ctolerate the driving and physical activity, including walking up and down steps that is required at [the college],\u201d but that he was active at a wellness center, exercising both in and out of the water.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">{\u00b6 10} Dr. Ford observed that Pontillo walked into his office \u201cwith no difficulty whatsoever,\u201d that his back incision had \u201chealed perfectly,\u201d that his hip range of motion had \u201cimproved to the point where he is able to lay his hands on the floor with his knees straight,\u201d and that the manual motor strength of his bilateral lower extremities was \u201cat least 4 +/5.\u201d Dr. Ford also found a significant decrease in Pontillo\u2019s range of motion for his left knee and significant bony hypertrophy consistent with osteoarthritis of his left knee.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">{\u00b6 11} Dr. Ford concluded that based upon his physical examination, Pontillo was not physically incapacitated for the performance 4&gt;f his duties and should not be entitled to disability retirement benefits:</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cFrom this man\u2019s executive position, I do not believe there is any type of lifting involved, and at the University, I am confid[e]nt that he would certainly be within ADA accessible buildings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">{\u00b6 13} Two other physicians then reviewed the medical reports and job description and concluded that Pontillo was not permanently disabled for his job. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>These medical consultants recommended that Pontillo\u2019s application for disability retirement benefits be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">{\u00b6 14} On August 16, 2000, appellee, Public Employees Retirement Board, determined that \u201c[b]ased upon all the medical information and recommendations * * * [Pontillo is] not permanently disabled from performing [his] job duties as a District Vice President of Business, Community, and Economic Development.\u201d The board found that \u201c[t]here was not significant objective medical evidence of a disabling condition.\u201d By letter dated August 16, 2000, the board informed Pontillo that it denied his application for disability retirement benefits. The board further notified Pontillo of his right under Ohio Adm.Code 145-11-02 to appeal its decision by submitting additional objective medical evidence within the applicable time requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">{\u00b6 15} On September 7, 2000, Pontillo submitted his notice of intent to appeal the board\u2019s decision by providing objective medical evidence. Pontillo stated that a \u201clicensed physician will provide additional objective medical evidence within [the board\u2019s] specified time lines.\u201d After the time to submit additional objective medical evidence under Ohio Adm.Code 145 \u2014 11\u201402(B)(3)(e) had elapsed, Dr. Muakkassa sent another report concerning Pontillo to PERS by letter dated May 16, 2001. Dr. Muakkassa again concluded that Pontillo was physically disabled from performing his job at the college.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">{\u00b6 16} On June 1, 2001, PERS notified Pontillo that it could not consider Dr. Muakkassa\u2019s May 16, 2001 report because his time to appeal the board\u2019s August 16, 2000 decision had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">{\u00b6 17} On November 21, 2001, Pontillo filed a complaint in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County for a writ of mandamus to compel the board to vacate its decision denying him disability retirement benefits and to award him those benefits. The board filed an answer, and the parties submitted evidence and briefs. Pontillo argued in the alternative that the court of appeals should grant a limited writ of mandamus directing the board to vacate its August 2000 decision and accept additional objective medical evidence to determine Pontillo\u2019s entitlement to disability retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">{\u00b6 18} In May 2002, a court of appeals magistrate issued a decision recommending that Pontillo\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus be denied. Pontillo objected to the magistrate\u2019s decision, and in September 2002, the court of appeals overruled Pontillo\u2019s objections, adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision, and denied the requested writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">{\u00b6 19} This cause is now before the court upon Pontillo\u2019s appeal as of right as well as his motion for oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Oral Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">{\u00b6 20} Pontillo moves for oral argument. We deny the motion. \u201cS.Ct. Prac.R. IX(2) does not require oral argument in this appeal, and the parties\u2019 briefs are sufficient to resolve this case.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Stacy v. Batavia Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn., </em>97 Ohio St.3d 269, 2002-Ohio-6322, 779 N.E.2d 216, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Mandamus: Adequate Remedy</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">{\u00b6 21} Pontillo asserts that the court of appeals erred in denying his requested writ of mandamus. Although he requested in the court of appeals a writ of mandamus to compel the board to vacate its August 2000 decision and award him disability retirement benefits, he now requests only a \u201climited writ of mandamus ordering PERS to vacate its decision denying disability retirement benefits and permit [him] to offer objective medical evidence in support of his application, and to then issue a new decision based upon this objective medical evidence and a reexamination by a competent disinterested physician.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">{\u00b6 22} PERS provides disability coverage to each member who has at least five years of total service. R.C. 145.35(B). The board reviews disability applications and recommendations of its medical examiners and medical consultants and renders final determinations on the applications. Ohio Adm.Code 145-11-01(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">{\u00b6 23} In general, in the absence of an available appeal, mandamus is an appropriate remedy by which claimants can obtain relief from an adverse determination concerning disability retirement benefits or other retirement decisions. See <em>State ex rel. Moss v. Ohio State Hwy. Patrol Retirement Sys., </em>97 Ohio St.3d 198, 2002-Ohio-5806, 777 N.E.2d 259, \u00b6 6; <em>State ex rel. Mallory v. Pub. Emp. Retirement Bd. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 235, 239, 694 N.E.2d 1356; <em>State ex rel. McMaster v. School Emp. Retirement Sys. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 130, 133, 630 N.E.2d 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">{\u00b6 24} Nevertheless, a \u201cwrit of mandamus must not be issued when there is a plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law.\u201d R.C. 2731.05; see, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Chagrin Falls v. Geauga Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>96 Ohio St.3d 400, 2002-Ohio-4906, 775 N.E.2d 512, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">{\u00b6 25} To the extent that he requests a writ of mandamus to compel the board to accept additional objective medical evidence in support of his claim, Pontillo had an adequate remedy at law. Ohio Adm.Code 145-11-02 provides for appeals from a board\u2019s denial of benefits in which the claimant can provide additional objective medical evidence if the evidence is submitted within the specified time period:</p>\n<p id=\"b611-12\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c(B)(1) After the retirement board has either denied an application for, or terminated, a disability benefit, the member shall be notified in writing of such action.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>{\u00b6 27} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c(3) The notice shall include the following information:</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c(b) The member\u2019s right to file a written notice of intent to provide additional objective medical evidence. Such notice of intent must be received by the retirement board no later than thirty days from the date of the notice of denial or termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c(d) Such additional evidence shall be current medical evidence documented by a licensed physician specially trained in the field of medicine covering the illness or injury for which the disability is claimed and such evidence has not been considered previously by the retirement board. <em>Such additional medical evidence shall be presented in writing by the member and shall constitute an appeal of the denial or termination.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c(e) Failure to provide the additional medical evidence within forty-five days of the member\u2019s notice of intent to provide such evidence shall make the retirement board\u2019s action final to such application or benefit unless an extension for submission of such evidence has been requested and granted within the forty-five days. Only one extension, not to exceed forty-five days, may be granted by the retirement board\u2019s staff.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">{\u00b6 34} Although Pontillo filed a notice of intent to provide additional objective medical evidence under Ohio Adm.Code 145-11-02(B)(3)(b), he failed to timely submit additional objective medical evidence. The fact that his appeal is no longer available because he failed to timely pursue it does not render the remedy inadequate. <em>In re Estate of Davis </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 45, 46, 671 N.E.2d 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-12\">Abuse of Discretion</p>\n<p id=\"b612-13\">{\u00b6 35} Furthermore, in challenging by mandamus the board\u2019s denial of benefits, Pontillo had to establish that the board abused its discretion. <em>Mallory, </em>82 Ohio St.3d at 239, 694 N.E.2d 1356; <em>McMaster, </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 133, 630 N.E.2d 701. The board abused its discretion if it acted in an unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable manner. <em>State ex rel. Pipoly v. State Teachers Retirement Sys., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 327, 2002-Ohio-2219, 767 N.E.2d 719, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-14\">{\u00b6 36} Pontillo contends that the board abused its discretion by (1) failing to inform him that significant objective medical evidence of a disabling condition is required to support a claim for disability retirement benefits and (2) selecting a physician who was not competent and disinterested to examine him.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-15\">{\u00b6 37} Pontillo\u2019s contentions lack merit. It is not clear from the board\u2019s August 2000 decision whether it <em>requires </em>every claimant to submit \u201csignificant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>objective medical evidence of a disabling condition\u201d to be entitled to disability retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">{\u00b6 38} Moreover, even if the board has instituted this standard, it did not deceive or mislead Pontillo and other claimants in doing so. The attending physician\u2019s report form asks the doctor to note the \u201csubjective and <em>objective symptoms\u201d </em>of which the claimant complains. (Emphasis added.) And the diagnosis portion of the report requests that the doctor \u201c[p]lease include <em>any test results </em>which enabled [the doctor] to make this diagnosis, ie: X-rays, MRI readings, etc.\u201d Further, Ohio Adm.Code 145-ll-02(B)(3)(b) refers to \u201cadditional <em>objective medical evidence.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Therefore, the board did not abuse its discretion in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">{\u00b6 39} Nor did the board abuse its discretion by ordering Pontillo to be examined by Dr. Ford. The board is authorized to select competent, disinterested physicians to conduct medical examinations of disability retirement claimants:</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cMedical examination of a member who has applied for a disability benefit shall be conducted by a <em>competent disinterested physician </em>or physicians selected by the board to determine whether the member is mentally or physically incapacitated for the performance of duty by a disabling condition either permanent or presumed to be permanent.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 145.35(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">{\u00b6 41} Pontillo claims that Dr. Ford was not a \u201ccompetent disinterested physician\u201d because he did not have a copy of Pontillo\u2019s job description and he did not request additional medical records of Pontillo from Dr. Muakkassa. In construing a statute, we must review the language, \u201creading undefined words and phrases in context and construing them in accordance with the rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Portage Lakes Edn. Assn., OEA/NEA v. State Emp. Relations Bd., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 533, 2002-Ohio-2839, 769 N.E.2d 853, \u00b6 36. The ordinary meaning of \u201ccompetent\u201d is \u201cpossessed of or characterized by marked or sufficient aptitude, skill, strength, or knowledge,\u201d and \u201cdisinterested\u201d means \u201c[f]ree from bias, prejudice, or partiality.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 463; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed.1999) 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">{\u00b6 42} Applying these ordinary definitions here, it is evident that Dr. Ford is disinterested because there is no evidence of bias, prejudice, or partiality on his part. Regarding his competence, nothing in the record establishes that he does not have the requisite physician\u2019s knowledge and skill.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">{\u00b6 43} Nevertheless, Pontillo claims that by not reviewing his job description, Dr. Ford was incompetent. But none of the applicable statutes or rules requires the examining physician to have read the employer\u2019s report, although it might be preferable for a physician to do so. And Dr. Ford\u2019s report indicates that Pontillo described his job duties to him, emphasizing the driving and walking associated with his job. In addition, two other physicians who recommended that Pontillo\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>application be denied had reviewed the employer\u2019s description of Pontillo\u2019s job as well as all of the medical evidence.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b614-8\">John L. Wolfe, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ABU\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, Joseph M. Marotta and Michael R. Gladman, Assistant Attorneys General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">{\u00b6 44} Furthermore, no statute or rule required Dr. Ford or the board to accept Dr. Muakkassa\u2019s report or request additional records that Dr. Muakkassa and Pontillo did not timely provide. Pontillo\u2019s reliance on Ohio Adm.Code 145-11-01(B)(1) to assert otherwise is misplaced. This rule expressly provides that the examining physician selected by the board may rely on his own examination: \u201cConsideration of a member\u2019s application [for disability retirement benefits] shall be limited to the disabling condition(s) listed in the application <em>or disclosed by the examination of the physician(s) selected by the retirement system.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">{\u00b645} Based on the foregoing, Pontillo failed to establish that the board abused its discretion by denying his application for disability retirement benefits. Therefore, the court of appeals correctly denied the writ. We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b614-7\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook, Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Connor, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
