No. 329 (\u201cH.B. 329\u201d) by respondents, who are the Columbiana County Treasurer, the Columbiana County Auditor, and members of the Columbiana County Budget Commission (\u201cCCBC\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">{\u00b6 2} R.C. Chapter 5747 established ULGF and ULGRAF to receive certain state tax revenues, which are transferred to counties for distribution to local subdivisions. <em>E. Liverpool v. Columbiana Cty. Budget Comm. </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 269, 270, 737 N.E.2d 44. Under the applicable statutes, the county budget commission has two options to distribute funds: (1) the statutory method under R.C. 5747.51 and 5747.62 or (2) the alternative method of R.C. 5747.53 and 5747.63. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">{\u00b6 3} In a settlement of an appeal instituted by relator city of East Liverpool, a majority of the Columbiana County political subdivisions, the board of county commissioners, and CCBC adopted and approved an alternate method of apportioning ULGF and ULGRAF for 1990 and thereafter. From 1991 through 1997, CCBC apportioned and the county auditor and treasurer distributed money from ULGF and ULGRAF in Columbiana County according to the 1990 alternate formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">{\u00b6 4} In 1997, however, CCBC voted to apportion ULGF and ULGRAF money according to a distribution method that was not approved by the legislative authority of East Liverpool, the largest city in the county, as required under former R.C. 5747.53 and 5747.63. 1999 Sub.H.B. No. 185, 148 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1201, 1202-1203. East Liverpool appealed the budget commission\u2019s actions, and on appeal, the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d) found the commission\u2019s action unlawful and ordered an allocation and distribution of the funds according to the 1990 alternate formula. We affirmed the BTA\u2019s decision. <em>E. Liverpool, </em>90 Ohio St.3d 269, 737 N.E.2d 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">{\u00b6 5} The General Assembly enacted H.B. 329, effective August 29, 2002, which amended R.C. 5747.53 and 5747.63 to allow ULGF and ULGRAF \u201cunder certain circumstances to be distributed among subdivisions under an alternative apportionment scheme without the approval of the largest municipal corporation in the county.\u201d Title to 2002 Sub.H.B. No. 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>{\u00b6 6} Under R.C. 5747.53(C) and 5747.63(C), in certain counties, the legislative authorities of two or more political subdivisions that together have the majority of the county\u2019s total population may now adopt resolutions eliminating the requirement that the legislative authority of the largest city of that county approve an ULGF or ULGRAF alternative apportionment method for the next year\u2019s distribution of funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">{\u00b6 7} Notwithstanding the deadlines in the amended provisions, H.B. 329 allowed an alternative method of apportionment to be adopted and approved not later than September 2, 2002, and also allowed for distributions of ULGF and ULGRAF money during 2003. Section 3 of 2002 Sub.H.B. No. 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">{\u00b6 8} In August 2002, CCBC implemented the provisions of H.B. 329 for the 2003 distributions of ULGF and ULGRAF. According to respondents, an appeal by East Liverpool from CCBC\u2019s actions is currently pending before the BTA. East Liverpool alleges that the CCBC reduced the city\u2019s general fund revenues by 17 percent, necessitating a severe reduction in services, including those provided by safety personnel, to the city\u2019s taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">{\u00b6 9} Nearly five months after CCBC\u2019s action, relators, East Liverpool and its mayor, auditor, and treasurer in their unofficial capacities, filed this action for a writ of mandamus. Relators ask this court to (1) declare H.B. 329 inapplicable to the apportionment of ULGF and ULGRAF in 2003, (2) declare H.B. 329 unconstitutional, (3) declare the alternate method of apportionment adopted in Columbiana County pursuant to H.B. 329 null and void, and (4) compel respondents to apportion and distribute the 2003 ULGF and ULGRAF in Columbiana County in accordance with the 1990 alternate method of distribution under former R.C. 5747.53 and 5747.63. Relators assert that H.B. 329 is unconstitutional because it deprives taxpayers of the equal protection of the laws, impairs the obligation of contracts, violates prohibitions against retroactive laws, and does not operate uniformly throughout the state. Relators also requested that this matter be disposed of in advance of its normal order on the docket under R.C. 2503.37 because of the fiscal crisis resulting from the reduced ULGF and ULGRAF distributions to East Liverpool for 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">{\u00b6 10} On February 13, 2003, respondents moved to dismiss this mandamus action. On February 24, relators filed a memorandum in opposition to respondents\u2019 dismissal motion. This case is now before the court for its S.Ct.Prac.R. X(5) determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">{\u00b6 11} Under S.Ct.Prac.R. X(5), dismissal of the action is required \u201c \u2018if it appears beyond doubt, after presuming the truth of all material factual allegations and making all reasonable inferences in favor of [relators], that [relators are] not entitled to the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Rasul-Bey v. Onunwor </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 119, 120, 760 N.E.2d 421, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>quoting <em>State ex rel. Crobaugh v. White </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 470, 471, 746 N.E.2d 1120. On the other hand, \u201cif, after construing the material factual allegations of the complaint * * *, it appears that [the] complaint may have merit, an alternative writ should be granted, and a schedule for the presentation of evidence and briefs should be issued.\u201d <em>State ex rel. C.V. Perry &amp; Co. v. Licking Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 442, 444, 764 N.E.2d 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">{\u00b6 12} Applying the foregoing standards to the mandamus claim here, it is evident that dismissal is appropriate for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">{\u00b6 13} First, \u201cif the allegations of a complaint for a writ of mandamus indicate that the real objects sought are a declaratory judgment and a prohibitory injunction, the complaint does not state a cause of action in mandamus and must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Grendell v. Davidson </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 629, 634, 716 N.E.2d 704. In order to divine the true objects of relators\u2019 mandamus action, \u201cwe must examine [their] complaint \u2018to see whether it actually seeks to prevent, rather than to compel, official action.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Cunningham v. Amer Cunningham Co., L.P.A. </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 323, 324, 762 N.E.2d 1012, quoting <em>State ex rel. Stamps v. Montgomery Cty. Automatic Data Processing Bd. </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 164, 166, 538 N.E.2d 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">{\u00b6 14} Although the allegations of relators\u2019 complaint are partially couched in terms of compelling affirmative duties, i.e., to order respondents to apportion and distribute these funds in accordance with the 1990 alternate formula, the essence of their claims involve declaratory judgment and prohibitory injunction. That is, they request (1) a declaratory judgment: a judgment declaring that H.B. 329 is inapplicable to apportionment and distribution of ULGF and ULGRAF in 2003 and a judgment declaring that H.B. 329 is unconstitutional, and (2) a prohibitory injunction: an order enjoining respondents from applying H.B. 329. Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to consider these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">{\u00b6 15} Second, \u201c[w]here, as here, an action in mandamus does not provide effective relief unless accompanied by an ancillary [preventive] injunction, it would appear that injunction rather than mandamus is the appropriate remedy.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Corron v. Wisner </em>(1971), 25 Ohio St.2d 160, 163, 54 O.O.2d 281, 267 N.E.2d 308. For example, in <em>State ex rel. Walker v. Bowling Green </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 391, 632 N.E.2d 904, the relators requested (1) a declaration that ward boundaries for electing city council representatives were unconstitutional and that all future elections under that system were void and (2) a writ of mandamus compelling the city and its officials to reapportion the ward boundaries so that each ward contains substantially equal populations. We held that mandamus was not an appropriate remedy because it would not provide effective relief unless accompanied by an ancillary preventive or prohibitory injunction:</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>{\u00b6 16} \u201cIt is clear that were this court to find the city\u2019s apportionment plan unconstitutional, mandamus would not provide effective relief unless accompanied by an ancillary preventive or prohibitory injunction. Indeed, relators seek such injunctive relief by asking for a declaration <em>\u2018that all future elections under this system are void.\u2019 </em>Although stated in positive language, the essence of such a request is to enjoin the city from conducting any future elections under the present apportionment system.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 69 Ohio St.3d at 393, 632 N.E.2d 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">{\u00b6 17} Similarly, relators here request in part that we <em>\u201cdeclare the alternate method of apportionment </em>adopted and approved in Columbiana County pursuant to Sub.H.B. 329 <em>null and void.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Therefore, based on <em>Walker, </em>mandamus is not the proper remedy for relators because mandamus would not provide adequate relief absent an ancillary prohibitory injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">{\u00b6 18} Third, \u201c[c]onstitutional challenges to legislation are generally resolved in an action in a common pleas court rather than in an extraordinary writ action filed here.\u201d <em>Rammage v. Saros, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 430, 2002-Ohio-6669, 780 N.E.2d 278, \u00b6 11. We similarly sua sponte dismissed a mandamus action challenging a newly enacted statute prohibiting certain municipalities from issuing speeding citations on interstate freeways as violative of the Uniformity Clause of the Ohio Constitution by holding that \u201can action for declaratory judgment is here an adequate remedy at law.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Linndale v. Teske </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 1415, 655 N.E.2d 736; see, also, <em>Grendell, </em>86 Ohio St.3d at 634, 716 N.E.2d 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">{\u00b6 19} Admittedly, some precedent might facially support relators\u2019 claim that mandamus is an appropriate remedy. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Mill Creek Metro. Park Dist. Bd. of Commrs. v. Tablack </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 293, 297, 714 N.E.2d 917 (\u201cWe have recognized, however, that the constitutionality of a statute or ordinance may in certain circumstances be challenged by mandamus\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Zupancic v. Limbach </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 130, 568 N.E.2d 1206 (mandamus was appropriate remedy to require state Tax Commissioner to apportion public utility property values to taxing districts according to previously existing apportionment formula where relators alleged that statute containing currently applicable formula was unconstitutional).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">{\u00b6 20} Relators rely heavily on <em>Zupancic </em>to support their mandamus claim. Nevertheless, contrary to <em>Zupancic, </em>if H.B. 329 is declared unconstitutional in a declaratory judgment action and a prohibitory injunction is issued against applying its provisions to apportion and distribute ULGF and ULGRAF funds, there will be no need for an extraordinary ancillary mandatory injunction ordering respondents to follow the preexisting 1990 alternate formula. In fact, before the challenged provisions were enacted, we already effectively ordered respondents to follow this alternate formula. See <em>E. Liverpool, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 271, 737 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>N.E.2d 44. Presumably, respondents would abide by the applicable law. And R.C. 2721.09 authorizes courts to grant further relief based upon a previously granted declaratory judgment \u201cwhenever necessary or proper.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b592-9\">John R. Varanese, for relators.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AE1\">Charles L. Payne, East Liverpool City Law Director, for relator East Liverpool.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AjQb\">Robert L. Herron, Columbiana County Prosecuting Attorney, and Andrew A. Beech, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for respondents.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">{\u00b6 21} Moreover, at one point in their memorandum in opposition to the dismissal motion, relators specify that \u201cno statutory void will occur if the court declares Sub.H.B. No. 329 unconstitutional because former R.C. 5747.53 and 5747.63 will be in full force and effect,\u201d indicating relators\u2019 belief that a declaratory judgment would provide them with complete, beneficial, and speedy relief. Significantly, this is not an election matter, unlike some of the cases cited by relators in support of their proposition that mandamus is available to test the constitutionality of statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">{\u00b6 22} Based on the foregoing, we grant respondents\u2019 motion and dismiss the cause. Relators have an adequate remedy to challenge this new legislation by an action for declaratory judgment and prohibitory injunction. If they had acted expeditiously and had filed this action near the August 2002 effective date of the amended statutory provisions and if the action were to have proved meritorious, they would have received essentially the same relief that they request here: a declaration that the amended provisions are unconstitutional or do not otherwise apply to the apportionment and distribution of the ULGF and ULGRAF funds and an order preventing the application of the Act. Instead, they chose to wait nearly five months and file this improper action for extraordinary relief. Relators\u2019 motion to advance the case on the docket is therefore moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Cause dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b592-8\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
