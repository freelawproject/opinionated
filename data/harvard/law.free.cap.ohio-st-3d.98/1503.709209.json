Buckley be, and hereby is, granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-10\">It appears from the records of this court that the appellee/cross-appellant American Casualty Company of Reading, Pennsylvania, has not filed a jurisdictional memorandum, due March 3, 2003, in compliance with the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court and therefore has failed to prosecute this case with the requisite diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-11\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED by the court that the cross-appeal be dismissed, sua sponte.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
