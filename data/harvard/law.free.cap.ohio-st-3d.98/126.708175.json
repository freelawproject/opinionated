(\u201cEnquirer\u201d), operates as The Cincinnati Enquirer, a newspaper of general circulation in appellee <em>city of </em>Cincinnati, Ohio. Appellee Fay Dupuis is the Cincinnati Solicitor and her official duties include responsibility for the custody of certain documents concerning legal matters involving Cincinnati.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">{\u00b6 2} In April 2001, the United States Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) started an investigation into alleged patterns and practices of the Cincinnati Police Department. As that investigation proceeded, on March 7, 2002, the city received a proposed settlement agreement from the DOJ. On that same date, Cincinnati Deputy Solicitor Pete Heile advised Greg Korte, a reporter for the Enquirer, that certain documents related to the investigation, including the proposed settlement agreement, were not disclosable.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">{\u00b6 3} By facsimile transmission dated March 8, 2002, Korte requested that Heile provide the Enquirer with the records they had talked about the previous day, including \u201ca copy of the city\u2019s settlement with the U.S. Justice Department over its recent patterns and practices investigation, and any drafts, memos, correspondence, reports, notes, analyses, e-mails, annotations, appendices, attachments, or other documents related thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">{\u00b6 4} On February 19, 2002, in <em>Tyehimba v. Cincinnati, </em>S.D. Ohio (W.D.) No. C-1-99-317, 2001 WL 1842470, United States District Court Judge Susan J. Dlott issued a protective order that governed \u201cthe parties during negotiations under the Order Establishing Collaborative Procedure.\u201d Judge Dlott ordered that \u201call drafts of any terms for settlement, including correspondence and other documents related to said drafts, whether offered by the Special Master or by the parties, shall be deemed confidential and may not be released by any person receiving said document except to counsel and the parties in this case.\u201d The DOJ was not a party in the <em>Tyehimba </em>case. By letter dated March 14, 2002, a confidentiality agreement among the <em>Tyehimba </em>parties was confirmed in which Cincinnati \u201cagreed to release to the collaborative attorneys only, documents related to the proposed settlement between the city and the U.S. Department of Justice, including the draft settlement proposal itself.\u201d The agreement by the <em>Tyehimba </em>parties concerned the use of certain materials submitted in the mediation of that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>{\u00b6 5} Appellees, Dupuis and Cincinnati, did not provide access to the requested records, including the DOJ\u2019s proposed settlement agreement. On March 14, 2002, the Enquirer filed a complaint in the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County for a writ of mandamus to compel Dupuis and the city to make the records available for inspection and copying in accordance with R.C. 149.43(B) and for an award of attorney fees. Dupuis and the city filed an answer, and the parties filed stipulated facts and memoranda. In their answer, Dupuis and the city contended that they had no duty to provide access to the proposed settlement agreement received from the DOJ because (1) the agreement was subject to Judge Dlott\u2019s protective order in <em>Tyehimba, </em>(2) disclosure of the proposal would violate Dupuis\u2019s professional duty not to disclose confidential attorney-client communications and attorney work product, (3) the proposal was a confidential law enforcement investigatory record, and (4) the federal Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d) prevented the city from disclosing the proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">{\u00b6 6} On June 14, 2002, the court of appeals, in a two-to-one decision, denied the writ. The court of appeals concluded that the proposed settlement agreement sent by the DOJ to Cincinnati constituted an exempt \u201ctrial preparation record\u201d under R.C. 149.43(A)(4). 147 Ohio App.3d 561, 2002-Ohio-2883, 771 N.E.2d 340, at \u00b6 4. This cause is now before the court upon the Enquirer\u2019s appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Mootness</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">{\u00b6 7} On appeal, Cincinnati and its Solicitor claim that the city voluntarily released the requested proposed settlement agreement after a final settlement agreement was approved by Cincinnati and the DOJ. According to appellees, this occurred before oral argument and the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">{\u00b6 8} In general, the provision of requested records to a relator in a public-records mandamus case renders the mandamus claim moot. <em>State ex rel. Wadd v. Cleveland </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 50, 52, 689 N.E.2d 25; <em>State ex rel. Taxpayers Coalition v. Lakewood </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 385, 392, 715 N.E.2d 179. An event that causes a case to become moot may be proved by extrinsic evidence outside the record. <em>State ex rel. Nelson v. Russo </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 227, 228, 729 N.E.2d 1181.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">{\u00b6 9} Appellees, however, offer no proof that they have provided this record aside from the bare unverified assertions in their appellate brief. The Enquirer has not conceded that it has received the proposed settlement agreement, and the court of appeals never so found. Furthermore, the Enquirer\u2019s claim of attorney fees would not be rendered moot by the provision of the requested record. <em>State ex rel. Pennington v. Gundler </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 171, 661 N.E.2d 1049, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>{\u00b6 10} Based on the foregoing, we refuse to dismiss this appeal based on mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">Mandamus: General Provisions</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">{\u00b6 11} The Enquirer seeks a writ of mandamus to compel Cincinnati and its Solicitor to provide it with access to the requested proposed settlement agreement. Mandamus is the appropriate remedy to compel compliance with R.C. 149.43, Ohio\u2019s Public Records Act. <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer v. Krings </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 654, 657, 758 N.E.2d 1135. \u201cR.C. 149.43 must be construed liberally in favor of broad access to records kept by public offices, and any doubt is to be resolved in favor of disclosure of the records.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Wallace v. State Med. Bd. of Ohio </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 431, 433, 732 N.E.2d 960. With these standards in mind, the Enquirer\u2019s claims are now considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">R.C. 149.43 and 149.011(G): Records</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">{\u00b6 12} A \u201cpublic record\u201d includes \u201crecords kept by any public office.\u201d R.C. 149.43(A)(1). R.C. 149.011(G) defines \u201c[r]ecords\u201d broadly to include \u201cany document * * * created or received by * * * any public office of the state or its political subdivisions, which serves to document the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the office.\u201d The proposed settlement agreement requested by the Enquirer constituted a record for purposes of R.C. 149.43. See R.C. 149.011(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">{\u00b6 13} In its response to the Enquirer\u2019s claim in the court of appeals, Cincinnati admitted that it \u201cdid not produce the proposed settlement agreement to the Cincinnati Enquirer while settlement negotiations were proceeding between the City and the Department of Justice.\u201d The city and its Solicitor note on appeal, and the court of appeals found, that the proposal was merely a step in the negotiation process between the city and the DOJ. By so arguing, appellees in effect concede that they considered the proposal in the negotiation process concerning the investigation by the DOJ into the patterns and practices of the Cincinnati Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">{\u00b6 14} Consequently, the requested DOJ proposal kept by appellees and used by them in attempting to reach a settlement in the DOJ investigation of the city\u2019s police department constituted a public record for purposes of R.C. 149.43(A)(1) and 149.011(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">Trial-Preparation Record</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">{\u00b6 15} The court of appeals recognized that an agreement settling a lawsuit in which a public office is a party is generally a public record subject to disclosure under R.C. 149.43. <em>State ex rel. Findlay Publishing Co. v. Hancock Cty. Bd. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number><em>Commrs. </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 134, 136, 684 N.E.2d 1222; <em>State ex rel. Sun Newspapers v. Westlake Bd. of Edn. </em>(1991), 76 Ohio App.3d 170, 601 N.E.2d 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">{\u00b6 16} Nevertheless, the court of appeals determined that the proposed settlement agreement was exempt from disclosure as a trial-preparation record. R.C. 149.43(A)(1)(g). \u201c[EJxceptions to disclosure must be strictly construed against the public records custodian, and the custodian bears the burden to establish the applicability of an exception.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Besser v. Ohio State Univ. </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 396, 398, 732 N.E.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">{\u00b6 17} The court of appeals erred in so concluding. As the appellate court in <em>State ex rel. Kinsley v. Berea Bd. of Edn. </em>(1990), 64 Ohio App.3d 659, 663, 582 N.E.2d 653, observed in rejecting a comparable argument concerning the applicability of the trial-preparation exemption to a settlement agreement:</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cA settlement agreement is not a record compiled in anticipation of or in defense of a lawsuit. It simply does not prepare one for trial. A settlement agreement is a contract negotiated with the opposing party to prevent or conclude litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">{\u00b6 19} Similarly, a settlement proposal received by a public office is not a record compiled in anticipation of or in defense against a lawsuit. It is simply an offer intended to prevent or conclude litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">{\u00b6 20} Moreover, we have consistently held that \u201c[e]ven if a record is not in final form, it may still constitute a \u2018record\u2019 for purposes of R.C. 149.43 if it documents the organization, policies, functions, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of a public office.\u201d See <em>State ex rel. Calvary v. Upper Arlington </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 229, 232, 729 N.E.2d 1182, and cases cited therein. The court of appeals found that the settlement proposal constituted a step in the negotiation process. Consequently, the city and its Solicitor considered the proposal, and it documents their policies and decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">{\u00b6 21} There is no specific exemption for documents provided to a public office to negotiate the settlement of a potential lawsuit or for settlement proposals before a final settlement agreement is reached. If the General Assembly had so intended, it would have specifically provided such an exemption. Cf., e.g., Mo. Stat. 610.021(1) (settlement agreement not subject to disclosure prior to final disposition). Although there may be good policy reasons to exempt settlement proposals, these policy considerations cannot override R.C. 149.43, because the General Assembly is the ultimate arbiter of public policy. <em>State ex rel. E. Cleveland Fire Fighters\u2019 Assn., Local 500, Internatl. Assn. of Fire Fighters v. Jenkins, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 68, 2002-Ohio-3527, 771 N.E.2d 251, at \u00b6 12; <em>State ex rel. Master v. Cleveland </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 23, 28-29, 661 N.E.2d 180. Public offices \u201ccannot withhold public records simply because they disagree with the policies behind the law permitting the release of these records.\u201d <em>State ex rel. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number><em>Consumer News Serv., Inc. v. Worthington City Bd. of Edn., </em>97 Ohio St.3d 58, 2002-Ohio-5311, 776 N.E.2d 82, at \u00b6 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">{\u00b6 22} In fact, as the <em>Tyehimba </em>parties\u2019 confidentiality agreement establishes, appellees agreed to voluntarily disclose the DOJ\u2019s settlement proposal to the opposing parties in <em>Tyehimba. </em>Voluntarily disclosing the requested record can waive any right to claim an exemption to disclosure. See <em>State ex rel. Zuern v. Leis </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 20, 22, 564 N.E.2d 81; <em>State ex rel. Gannett Satellite Info. Network, Inc. v. Petro </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 261, 265, 685 N.E.2d 1223.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">{\u00b6 23} Therefore, the trial-preparation exemption is inapplicable to the requested settlement proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Protective Order and Confidentiality Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">{\u00b6 24} The city and its Solicitor assert that the DOJ\u2019s settlement proposal is also exempt because of Judge Dlott\u2019s protective order in <em>Tyehimba </em>and the parties\u2019 confidentiality agreement in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">{\u00b625} Under R.C. 149.43(A)(1)(v), public records do not include \u201c[rjecords the release of which is prohibited by state or federal law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">{\u00b6 26} Here, however, the protective order does not apply to the DOJ\u2019s settlement proposal. The DOJ was not a party to the <em>Tyehimba </em>litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">{\u00b6 27} Moreover, the confidentiality agreement was executed <em>after </em>the Enquirer\u2019s request for access to the proposal. And no contract or promises of confidentiality altered the public nature of the proposal. See <em>State ex rel. Gannett Satellite Info. Network, Inc. v. Shirey </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 400, 403, 678 N.E.2d 557; <em>State ex rel. Dispatch Printing Co. v. Columbus </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 39, 42, 734 N.E.2d 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">{\u00b6 28} Therefore, neither the protective order nor the confidentiality agreement precluded disclosure of the settlement proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">Canons of Code of Professional Responsibility</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">{\u00b6 29} Appellees also claim that various Canons of the Code of Professional Responsibility prevented the Solicitor from disclosing the settlement proposal. But they did not meet their burden of establishing that any of the specified canons exempted the record from R.C. 149.43. There is nothing in the record proving that disclosure of the requested record would expose the confidences and secrets of the city, would inhibit the Solicitor\u2019s exercise of independent professional judgment on behalf of the city, or would affect the Solicitor\u2019s zealous representation of the city within the bounds of the law. See Canons 4, 5, and 7, Code of Professional Responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Confidential Law Enforcement Investigatory Record</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">{\u00b6 30} Appellees contend that the DOJ settlement proposal is exempt from disclosure because it is a confidential law enforcement investigatory record under R.C. 149.43(A)(2)(c). This statute exempts the disclosure of certain records where their release would create a high probability of disclosure of specific confidential investigatory techniques or procedures or specific investigatory work product.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">{\u00b6 31} This exemption is inapplicable here. As noted previously, appellees\u2019 voluntary disclosure of the settlement proposal could waive any exemptions. <em>Zuern, </em>56 Ohio St.3d at 22, 564 N.E.2d 81. In addition, the proposal was not exempt investigatory work product; it was not prepared in anticipation of litigation. Cf. <em>State ex rel. Steckman v. Jackson </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 420, 434, 639 N.E.2d 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">FOIA</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">{\u00b6 32} Appellees finally claim that FOIA precluded disclosure of the DOJ settlement agreement. Like their other claimed exemptions, this claim is merit-less. FOIA does not apply to nonfederal agencies or officers. Sections 551(1) and 552(f), Title 5, U.S.Code; <em>State ex rel. Findlay Publishing Co. v. Schroeder </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 580, 582, 669 N.E.2d 835; <em>State ex rel. Warren v. Warner </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 432, 433, 704 N.E.2d 1228.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">Attorney Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">{\u00b6 33} The Enquirer is also entitled to attorney fees. It has established a sufficient public benefit. The proposed settlement of the DO J\u2019s investigation into the practices and policies of the Cincinnati Police Department was a matter of great public interest. The Enquirer\u2019s access to the requested record would enable it to provide complete and accurate news to the public. See <em>State ex rel. Beacon Journal Publishing Co. v. Maurer </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 54, 58, 741 N.E.2d 511. And the city\u2019s and its Solicitor\u2019s claimed exemptions lacked any reasonable basis, particularly when they agreed to voluntarily disclose the proposal to other parties in the <em>Tyehimba </em>litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">{\u00b6 34} Based on the foregoing, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the cause to that court for further proceedings consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>with our opinion. The Enquirer has established entitlement to the writ of mandamus and an award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b241-6\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer and Cook, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b241-7\">Lundberg Stratton, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b241-8\">Douglas, J., not participating.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b241-9\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AIX\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">{\u00b6 35} I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision, particularly its finding that the proposed agreement, the object of the mandamus action, has not yet been provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">{\u00b6 36} Appellees state that the city <em>has </em>provided the requested proposed settlement agreement and did so before oral argument in the court of appeals and before the judgment of the court of appeals was issued. However, the majority denies dismissal for mootness because the majority finds that the appellees offered no \u201cproof\u2019 that the city provided the proposed settlement agreement and the Enquirer \u201chas not conceded\u201d that it received the proposed agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">{\u00b6 37} The majority\u2019s finding is completely contrary to the concessions in the merit briefs. The city, in its merit brief, states, beginning on the first line of the very first paragraph of its statement of facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b241-13\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cRespondents/Appellees (\u2018the City of Cincinnati\u2019 or \u2018the City\u2019) supplement the statement of facts. In fact, and as admitted by the Enquirer at the oral argument before the Court of Appeals, the City provided the requested proposed settlement agreement to the Enquirer after the final settlement agreement had been executed by the City, the United States Department of Justice, and the parties to the federal court case <em>Tyehimba v. City of Cincinnati, et al., </em>Case No. C-1-99-317, 2001 WL 1842470 (Southern District of Ohio) (renamed <em>In re Cincinnati Policing). </em>Insofar as the Enquirer filed suit to obtain that particular document, that claim is moot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-14\">{\u00b6 39} The Enquirer in its reply brief, in the first line of the first paragraph of its statement of facts, concedes:</p>\n<p id=\"b241-15\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cRespondents Dupuis and the City of Cincinnati (the \u2018City\u2019) do not dispute the facts set out in the Enquirer\u2019s brief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-16\">{\u00b6 41} The Enquirer contends only that the document was not produced upon its <em>initial </em>request, a point no one disputes. The court of appeals simply ignored these contentions, and it certainly made no opposite conclusion. For this court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>make a contrary finding flies in the face of both statements of facts, the admissions by the parties, and the general rule of law concerning admissions by parties. We have never required a party to provide proof on an issue that is <em>admitted. </em>Of course the city provided no additional proof. It had no idea our court would require such an unprecedented step. The current request for mandamus is moot because both parties <em>admit </em>that the document has been provided.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b242-8\">Graydon, Head &amp; Ritchey, L.L.P., John C. Greiner and John A. Flanagan, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Ao4\">Julia L. McNeil, Cincinnati City Solicitor, and Richard Ganulin, Assistant City Solicitor, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">{\u00b6 42} That said, I agree with the majority\u2019s grant of attorney fees, but only for the fees accrued up to the date that the document was actually provided, because, for the reasons stated in the majority\u2019s opinion, the document should have been released upon the Enquirer\u2019s initial request.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">{\u00b6 43} Therefore, I would dismiss the request for mandamus as moot but would award attorney fees up to the date that the city released the requested document to the Enquirer.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">{\u00b6 44} Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
