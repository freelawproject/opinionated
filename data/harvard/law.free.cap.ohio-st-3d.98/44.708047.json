For the following reasons, we affirm Noling\u2019s convictions and death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">{\u00b6 2} On April 5, 1990, in the course of a burglary and robbery, defendant-appellant, Tyrone Noling, shot and killed Bearnhardt and Cora Hartig in Portage County, Ohio. After a 1992 dismissal of charges against Noling, a grand jury reindicted him in August 1995 for the Hartig murders. The state proved the offenses charged through the testimony of police officers and others, including accomplices Butch Wolcott and Joseph Dalesandro.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">{\u00b6 3} The testimony adduced at trial revealed that in early April 1990, Noling, Gary St. Clair, Dalesandro, and Wolcott stayed at the house of a teenage friend, Johnny Trandifer, in Alliance, Ohio. To obtain money, the group \u201cwent car shopping * * * opened up car doors that were unlocked and stole the change * * * radios, phones, whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">{\u00b6 4} Noling then suggested \u201cthe idea that old people were getting their * * * Social Security checks early in the month and * * * would be the best target to rob.\u201d Noling planned to gain entry into the homes by knocking on the door and pretending to need to use their telephone to call about his disabled car. At that point, the group was armed with a shotgun and a BB gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">{\u00b6 5} Noling and St. Clair implemented just such a plan in robbing a Mr. and Mrs. Hughes, in their Alliance home, approximately a quarter of a mile from Trandifer\u2019s house. Noling told Wolcott that he had knocked on the door, asked to use the phone because his car was broken down, and when he and St. Clair got in, they held the Hugheses up. According to St. Clair, Noling got inside, \u201ckicked the door shut, pulled the sawed off shotgun out,\u201d and told Mr. Hughes, \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d They used a pillowcase to carry away a VCR, jewelry, and a .25 caliber pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-13\">{\u00b6 6} Around noon the next day, Noling used this stolen .25 caliber pistol to rob the Murphy family in Alliance. Noling acted alone and said that he had had to fire the weapon while inside the house. Noling stole a VCR, rings, and money from the Murphy residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-14\">{\u00b6 7} Around 3:30 to 4:00 p.m. that same day, Dalesandro drove Noling, St. Clair, and Wolcott from Alliance into Portage County. They stopped at the Hartigs\u2019 ranch home in Atwater Township. The Hartigs were both 81 years old. When Dalesandro stopped and Noling and St. Clair got out, Bearnhardt Hartig was mowing the grass.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>{\u00b6 8} Noling knocked on the front door, and when Cora Hartig answered, Noling \u201cpushed his way in\u201d and St. Clair followed him. St. Clair had the shotgun, and Noling had a .25 caliber semiautomatic, with one clip in the gun and another clip in his pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">{\u00b6 9} After dropping Noling and St. Clair off, Dalesandro and Wolcott drove around for a while, returned, and parked in the Hartigs\u2019 driveway. About 20 to 30 minutes after Noling and St. Clair had entered the Hartigs\u2019 home, Wolcott \u201cheard some gunshots, * * * heard a lady scream and then * * * a couple of more gunshots * * * and then a few seconds later [Noling and St. Clair] came running out\u201d and got in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">{\u00b6 10} Noling looked \u201cflabbergasted,\u201d and things were hysterical. He told Dalesandro, who was driving, to \u201c[g]et out of here * * * I just killed two old people.\u201d Noling said that \u201che had to do it, just didn\u2019t have a choice\u201d because \u201cthe old man wouldn\u2019t stop, that he kept coming at him.\u201d Noling also claimed that the lady \u201ccould tell the police who they were.\u201d Noling put the .25 caliber pistol in the glove compartment, and Dalesandro drove back to Alliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">{\u00b6 11} Once back, Noling was concerned about getting rid of his blood-stained clothes. Noling also told Dalesandro that if Dalesandro said anything about what had occurred, Noling would kill him. That night, Noling also put a gun to Wolcott\u2019s head and said that \u201cif [Wolcott] talked he would blow [his] head off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">{\u00b6 12} On April 7, 1990, James Davis, the son of neighbors of the Hartigs, noticed that the Hartigs\u2019 garage door was open and that the lawn tractor had been sitting in the yard for two days. He checked on the Hartigs and found them lying on their kitchen floor. Davis called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">{\u00b6 13} The police found the bodies fully clothed in the kitchen and noticed a strong smell, apparently from decaying flesh. Detectives found ten Winchester .25 caliber shell casings near the bodies, and recovered eight .25 caliber bullets from the crime scene and autopsies. Nancy Bulger, a firearms expert, concluded that a single .25 caliber semiautomatic pistol had ejected all of the shells found and that a single weapon had fired all eight bullets recovered. Bulger testified that the ammunition clip for most .25 caliber semiautomatics carries six or seven rounds, but extended magazines for .25 caliber firearms, although not common, do exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">{\u00b6 14} In the Hartigs\u2019 master bedroom, detectives found open dresser drawers as well as seven empty ring boxes. In the living room, police found a metal box with a lock and key.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">{\u00b6 15} Dr. Elizabeth Balraj, the Cuyahoga County Coroner, supervised and observed the autopsies. She testified that Cora Hartig had been shot five times and had died \u201cas a result of * * * gunshot wounds to her chest with internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>injuries.\u201d Bearnhardt Hartig, shot three times, died from \u201cgunshot wounds to [his] right chest with multiple visceral injuries.\u201d Dr. Balraj found no evidence of stippling or gunpowder residue; therefore, Dr. Balraj concluded, the shots had been fired from a distance greater than one and one half to three feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">{\u00b6 16} On the day that police discovered the Hartigs\u2019 bodies, Noling and his cohorts had a party at Trandifer\u2019s house. At the party, Noling was acting drunk and bragging about the Alliance robberies, but not about the Atwater Township murders. After a police cruiser drove by, Noling grabbed Wolcott, started screaming, and said that \u201che was going to kill him, he better not have told.\u201d Noling also asked Robyn Elliot if she \u201chad heard anything on the police scanner about two old people getting shot in Atwater.\u201d When she said no, Noling was \u201cjust laughing and acting like a big shot.\u201d In fact, the first television news reports about the Hartig murders did not air until the evening of the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">{\u00b6 17} Two days after the discovery of the Hartigs\u2019 bodies, Alliance police arrested Noling and his accomplices in connection with the Alliance robberies. While in police custody with Noling, St. Clair asked Alliance police officers the identity of two out-of-town detectives who wanted to interview them. After being told their names, St. Clair asked, \u201cIs it about the two old people who were lolled in Atwater?\u201d Noling immediately told St. Clair, \u201cKeep your mouth shut about that, don\u2019t say another word, keep quiet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">{\u00b6 18} Noling admitted his involvement in the Hartig murders to two fellow jail inmates. He told inmate Paul Garner that he \u201cdidn\u2019t mean to do it. Just happened. The lady said: I know who you are.\u201d St. Clair had \u201csaid his name, and so they had to kill both of them.\u201d Noling also described the murders to jail inmate Ronnie Gantz. Noling told Gantz that St. Clair was the shooter, but then subsequently recanted, claiming instead that he was the shooter because St. Clair \u201cwas too weak to shoot anyone.\u201d Noling told Gantz that he shot Bearnhardt with a .25 caliber automatic because \u201cthe man tried to be a hero.\u201d St. Clair denied any involvement in the murders to Gantz.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">{\u00b6 19} Noling told Corrections Officer Lawrence Kouri that St. Clair was \u201ctrying to frame\u201d Noling for the Hartigs\u2019 murder. On May 4, 1990, Noling also told Portage County Sheriff Duane Kaley that Wolcott and St. Clair had committed the murders, but Noling \u201cknew where the firearm involved\u201d was and knew about a bloody shirt and stolen stereo. Noling talked about two semiautomatic .25 caliber weapons. Based on the information from Noling and from a man named Chico, police recovered the .25 caliber semiautomatic pistol that Noling had fired during the Murphy robbery. Police never recovered the weapon used to kill the Hartigs.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">{\u00b6 20} Noling later told Anthony Travise, a fellow inmate, how St. Clair, Dalesandro, Wolcott, and Noling had robbed several people. Noling admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>that he was a suspect in the Hartig murders, but never admitted to Travise that he was responsible for their deaths. Noling also told Travise that if he ever testified against Noling, \u201che would get [him] one way or another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">{\u00b6 21} At trial, St. Clair described a somewhat different version of events. St. Clair testified that the group had stolen items from unlocked cars and that Noling had suggested robbing elderly people in their homes by asking to use a telephone. St. Clair also described how he and Noling had robbed the Hughes family and what he knew about Noling\u2019s robbery of the Murphy family.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">{\u00b6 22} St. Clair admitted that he had pled guilty to aggravated robbery and aggravated murder in connection with the Hartig murders, and that he had received a sentence of 20 years to life. St. Clair denied, however, that Noling or he had been in Atwater Township on April 5, 1990, and steadfastly claimed that they had no part in the Hartig murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">{\u00b6 23} The grand jury indicted Noling on two counts of aggravated felony murder; Count One charged the murder of Bearnhardt Hartig, and Count Two charged the murder of Cora Hartig. Death specifications in each count charged murder in the course of \u201cAggravated Robbery and/or Aggravated Burglary (spec. 1),\u201d R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), and murder to escape \u201cdetection or apprehension or trial or punishment\u201d for another offense (spec. 2), R.C. 2929.04(A)(3). Counts Three and Four both charged aggravated robbery, and Count Five charged aggravated burglary. All five counts included gun specifications. The trial jury found Noling guilty as charged. Noling was separately convicted and sentenced for the Murphy and Hughes robberies.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">{\u00b6 24} Following a penalty hearing, the jury recommended that Noling be sentenced to death on Counts One and Two. The trial court sentenced Noling to death on both counts and to consecutive prison terms for Counts Three, Four, and Five and for the firearms specifications. The 11th District Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions and death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">{\u00b6 25} The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">II. Summarily Rejected Propositions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"AqM\">{\u00b6 26} Noling presents 21 propositions of law for our consideration. This court is not required under R.C. 2929.05, however, to address and discuss in opinion form each proposition of law an appellant raises in a capital case. <em>State v. Tibbetts </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 146, 149, 749 N.E.2d 226; <em>State v. Treesh </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 463, 739 N.E.2d 749. Accordingly, we summarily overrule Noling\u2019s twentieth proposition of law, which challenges the court\u2019s reasonable-doubt instruction and the statutory definition from R.C. 2901.05 because his complaint lacks merit. See <em>State v. Jones </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 403, 417, 739 N.E.2d 300; <em>State v. Van Gundy </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 230, 232, 594 N.E.2d 604; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number><em>State v. Nabozny </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 195, 8 O.O.3d 181, 375 N.E.2d 784, paragraph two of the syllabus. Further, the use of the term \u201cfirmly convinced of the truth of the charge\u201d in the penalty phase was harmless. <em>State v. Mitts </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 223, 233, 690 N.E.2d 522; <em>State v. Taylor </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 15, 29, 676 N.E.2d 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">{\u00b6 27} We also summarily reject Noling\u2019s twenty-first proposition of law challenging the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death penalty statute. See <em>State v. Carter </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 593, 606-608, 734 N.E.2d 345; <em>State v. Clemons </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 438, 454, 696 N.E.2d 1009; <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 520 N.E.2d 568, syllabus. Noling failed to raise his international law challenge at the trial court or before the court of appeals and thereby waived the claim. <em>State v. Coley </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 253, 271, 754 N.E.2d 1129; <em>State v. Awan </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 120, 22 OBR 199, 489 N.E.2d 277, syllabus. That international law challenge also lacks merit. <em>State v. Bey </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 487, 502, 709 N.E.2d 484; <em>State v. Phillips </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 103-104, 656 N.E.2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">III. Evidentiary Issues</p>\n<p id=\"Agy\">A. Limits on Cross-examination</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">{\u00b6 28} In his first proposition of law, Noling argues that the trial court improperly precluded him \u201cfrom cross-examining a witness about a strong motive to fabricate testimony\u201d and thereby deprived Noling \u201cof his confrontation and due process rights.\u201d Noling has forfeited this issue, however, by not raising it before the court of appeals. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">{\u00b6 29} We also find no merit in Noling\u2019s arguments. Noling claims that the trial court unfairly limited his cross-examination of Joseph Dalesandro about statements by an assistant prosecutor in July 1992. At Dalesandro\u2019s sentencing hearing in July 1992, an assistant prosecutor repudiated Dalesandro\u2019s plea bargain agreement due to his lack of cooperation and truthfulness. At trial, Noling wanted to cross-examine Dalesandro to elicit that assistant prosecutor\u2019s 1992 opinion about Dalesandro\u2019s cooperation and truthfulness in the investigation. The trial court refused to allow the proposed cross-examination because the prosecutor\u2019s \u201copinion whether [Dalesandro] is telling the truth * * * is [an issue] for the jury to determine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">{\u00b6 30} In our view, the trial court correctly excluded evidence about the assistant prosecutor\u2019s 1992 opinion as to Dalesandro\u2019s credibility. As this court has commented before, \u201cthe trier of fact * * * is burdened with assessing the credibility and veracity of witnesses.\u201d <em>State v. Moreland </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 58, 62, 552 N.E.2d 894. See, also, <em>State v. Boston </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 108, 128-129, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>545 N.E.2d 1220 (\u201can expert may not testify as to the expert\u2019s opinion of the veracity of the statements of a child declarant\u201d). Further, the prosecutor\u2019s subjective beliefs were irrelevant, and his out-of-court statements about Dalesandro\u2019s veracity would have constituted hearsay. See Evid.R. 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">{\u00b6 31} Moreover, Noling extensively cross-examined Dalesandro about his motives and the underlying plea agreement. The slight limitation on cross-examination to exclude the prosecutor\u2019s opinion on Dalesandro\u2019s credibility therefore could not have constituted an abuse of discretion or prejudiced Noling. See <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall </em>(1986), 475 U.S. 673, 682, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (violation of confrontation rights is subject to harmless-error analysis). Accordingly, we overrule Noling\u2019s first proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">B. State Treatment of Hostile Witness</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">{\u00b6 32} In his second proposition of law, Noling argues that the trial court erred both in declaring St. Clair a hostile witness and in not restricting the state\u2019s cross-examination and impeachment of its own witness. We reject Noling\u2019s contentions that these acts constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">{\u00b6 33} At trial, St. Clair testified as a prosecution witness about Noling\u2019s involvement in the Hughes and- Murphy robberies. St. Clair also confirmed that he had pled guilty to aggravated murder and aggravated robbery and received a sentence of 20 years to life in connection with the Hartig murders. St. Clair denied, however, that either he. or Noling went to Portage County on April 5 or that they were involved in the Hartig murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">{\u00b6 34} After St. Clair\u2019s denial, the state asked the court \u201cto declare the witness a hostile witness.\u201d The court responded, \u201cI suspect you laid the groundwork for that.\u201d The state then asked St. Clair additional leading questions about his guilty plea and sentence relating to the Hartig murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">{\u00b6 35} Over continuing defense objection, the state questioned St. Clair about details in his pretrial confession admitting that he and Noling had robbed the Hartigs and that Noling had shot them. St. Clair admitted making the statement, but continued to deny involvement in the Hartig murders. As Noling points out, the state asked no \u201cless than sixty-seven (67) questions regarding St. Clair\u2019s prior statement, literally reading questions and answers [from the statement].\u201d Thus, the state placed the substance of St. Clair\u2019s confession that implicated Noling before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">{\u00b6 36} The state then began to question St. Clair by quoting from a narrative of another police interview of St. Clair. The court asked the prosecutor, \u201cAre you suggesting that the jury should accept as true the statements that you are now cross examining on, is that what you\u2019re trying to do?\u201d The prosecutor responded, \u201cyes.\u201d Then the court declared it would \u201csustain an objection from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>now on. You have impeached your witness and you established he * * * didn\u2019t tell the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">{\u00b6 37} Evid.R. 607(A) allows a party calling a witness to attack the witness\u2019s credibility \u201cby means of a prior inconsistent statement only upon a showing of surprise and affirmative damage.\u201d Noling concedes that the state proved the latter requirement of affirmative damage. But he argues that because the state failed to demonstrate the former requirement \u2014 that it was surprised by St. Clair\u2019s denial of Noling\u2019s guilt \u2014 the use of the prior inconsistent statements was improper. Noling further argues that the trial court failed to control the state\u2019s cross-examination of St. Clair when the state repeatedly quoted St. Clair\u2019s pretrial confession that implicated Noling. In response, the state contends that Noling waived, or forfeited, this complaint by not raising it at the court of appeals. Because Noling did complain at the court of appeals about the court\u2019s declaration of St. Clair as a hostile witness, we conclude that he properly preserved the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">{\u00b6 38} We hold that the prosecutor\u2019s improper cross-examination of St. Clan-does not require reversal of the jury\u2019s verdict of guilt. We reach this result for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">{\u00b6 39} First, the trial court specifically instructed the jury that \u201c[i]f statements in a transcript or written or typed statements differed from the testimony given by the same witness in the courtroom, you may consider them to test the credibility or believability of such witness, and/or <em>no other purpose.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Noling neither objected to this instruction nor asked for additional instructions, and we presume that jurors follow the court\u2019s instructions. See, e.g., <em>State v. Williams </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 153, 159, 652 N.E.2d 721. Thus, we presume that the jury considered the substance of the inconsistent statement <em>only </em>as it reflected upon St. Clair\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">{\u00b6 40} Second, we cannot say that the prosecutor\u2019s improper tactics actually prejudiced Noling in light of the other abundant evidence establishing Noling\u2019s guilt. Noling admitted to Wolcott, Dalesandro, and others that he had personally shot and killed the Hartigs. Wolcott and Dalesandro also directly placed Noling inside the Hartigs\u2019 home with a .25 caliber semiautomatic pistol, the type of weapon used to kill the Hartigs. Moreover, St. Clair\u2019s total disclaimer of guilt, on behalf of Noling and himself, lacked any credibility because St. Clair had pled guilty to the murder of the Hartigs.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">{\u00b6 41} We therefore find no error warranting reversal in relation to Noling\u2019s second proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">C. \u201cOther Acts\u201d Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">{\u00b6 42} In his third proposition of law, Noling argues that the trial court erred in admitting, over objection, \u201cother acts\u201d criminal-propensity evidence that preju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>diced him. Noling challenges the admission of evidence that he robbed the Hughes and Murphy families, stole from unlocked cars, and thought about robbing a Dairy Mart. His arguments regarding this evidence are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">{\u00b6 43} The admission of evidence lies within the broad discretion of a trial court, and a reviewing court should not disturb evidentiary decisions in the absence of an abuse of discretion that has created material prejudice. <em>State v. Issa </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 64, 752 N.E.2d 904. We must therefore confine our inquiry to determining whether the trial court acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, or unconscionably in deciding the evidentiary issues about which Noling complains. See <em>State v. Barnes </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 23, 759 N.E.2d 1240.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">{\u00b6 44} Under Evid.R. 404(B), \u201c[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove\u201d a defendant\u2019s character as to criminal propensity. \u201cIt may, however, be admissible * * * [to show] motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d This court has declared that \u201cthe standard for determining admissibility of such evidence is strict.\u201d <em>State v. Broom </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 277, 533 N.E.2d 682, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">{\u00b6 45} We have also recognized, however, that \u201c[o]ther acts forming a unique, identifiable plan of criminal activity are admissible to establish identity under Evid.R. 404(B).\u201d <em>State v.

In order \u201c[t]o be admissible to prove identity through a certain <em>modus operand^ </em>other-acts evidence must be related to and share common features with the crime in question.\u201d <em>State v. Lowe </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 527, 634 N.E.2d 616, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">{\u00b6 46} There were some differences in the offenses against the Hughes and Murphy families as contrasted with the offenses against the Hartigs. But this court has held that \u201c[a]dmissibility is not adversely affected simply because the other [crimes] differed in some details.\u201d <em>Jamison, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 187, 552 N.E.2d 180. Accord <em>State v. Wogenstahl </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 344, 366, 662 N.E.2d 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">{\u00b6 47} In this case, Noling\u2019s robbery of the Hughes and Murphy families helped to establish Noling\u2019s identity as a participant in the aggravated robbery and aggravated murder of the Hartigs. That evidence also showed Noling\u2019s \u201cintent, preparation, [and] plan\u201d in accordance with Evid.R. 404(B). Noling had devised a scheme of securing entry and robbing elderly persons in their homes by asking to use their telephone on the pretense that his car had broken down. In each instance, Noling was armed with a firearm. Each robbery occurred near the beginning of the month when Noling thought that the families would have cashed their Social Security checks. And in each instance, Noling targeted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>elderly persons in their homes because he thought that they would be more vulnerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">{\u00b6 48} Moreover, we note that the trial court instructed the jury that the evidence was \u201creceived for a very limited purpose. * * * [Y]ou may not consider it to prove the character of the defendant in order to show the act in conformity or in accordance with the character.\u201d The court then instructed the jury as to the limited purposes for which the jury could consider such evidence. In fact, the court repeated an \u201cother acts\u201d instruction at key points <em>throughout </em>the trial. In light of the instructions given and the probative value of the evidence of the Murphy and Hughes robberies, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing this \u201cother acts\u201d evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">{\u00b6 49} The court may have abused its discretion by admitting evidence that Noling stole from unlocked cars or contemplated robbing a Dairy Mart. Those offenses were not \u201csimilar acts\u201d and did not show identity or a common scheme or plan. No prejudicial error exists, however, because the impact of that evidence was minimal given the other-acts instruction and the abundant, compelling evidence of Noling\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">{\u00b6 50} Finally, Noling complains that \u201cother acts\u201d evidence also affected the penalty phase. As discussed, the trial court properly admitted the evidence of the Murphy and Hughes robberies at trial. Moreover, this court has recognized that a defendant\u2019s prior crimes are directly relevant to his \u201chistory, character, and background,\u201d R.C. 2929.04(B), which a sentencing jury must consider. <em>State v. Waddy </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 424, 428-429, 588 N.E.2d 819. Accord <em>State v. Cooey </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 20, 35, 544 N.E.2d 895. We thus overrule Noling\u2019s third proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">D. Manifest Weight of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">{\u00b6 51} Noling argues in his fourth proposition of law that his conviction \u201cis against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d However, Noling failed to argue that issue before the court of appeals, which was the appropriate forum. When this court reviews a criminal case, including a capital case on appeal from the court of appeals, this court weighs \u201cevidence only to determine whether it is of sufficient probative force to support a finding of guilt.\u201d <em>State v. Tyler </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 33, 553 N.E.2d 576, citing <em>State v. Nicely </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 147, 155, 529 N.E.2d 1236.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">{\u00b6 52} In this case, we find that substantial evidence supports Noling\u2019s conviction for the aggravated burglary, robbery, and murder of the Hartigs. Wolcott and Dalesandro saw Noling, who alone was armed with a .25 caliber semiautomatic, forcibly enter the Hartig home with St. Clair, and knew that they planned to rob the Hartigs. Wolcott heard shots, and both Wolcott and Dalesan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>dro saw Noling and St. Clair then run from the Hartig home. Noling told both Wolcott and Dalesandro that he had shot the Hartigs and warned them not to tell the police. Noling also told St. Clair in front of the police to keep his mouth shut about the Atwater Township murders. Additionally, Noling admitted to fellow inmates Garner and Gantz that he shot the Hartigs and admitted to inmate Travise that he had robbed the Hartigs. Noling additionally admitted to police that he knew about the crime, although he tried to blame St. Clair. Finally, other evidence established that Noling had devised the plan to rob elderly individuals in their homes and that he had robbed two other couples within a day of shooting the Hartigs.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">{\u00b6 53} To support his arguments challenging the evidence, Noling points to alleged credibility issues concerning Garner, Gantz, Wolcott, and Dalesandro, the lack of forensic evidence, the fact that the police never recovered the murder weapon, and St. Clair\u2019s avowal of innocence. Essentially, Noling is rearguing the evidence that he believes supported his defense. But the jury considered and rejected each of these arguments when it found him guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">{\u00b6 54} The jury has the primary responsibility to weigh the evidence and assess the credibility of the witnesses. See <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus. We therefore reject this proposition of law as lacking merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">E. Victim-impact Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">{\u00b6 55} In his sixth proposition of law, Noling argues that the trial court wrongfully admitted victim-impact evidence during the trial phase. Noling refers specifically to the testimony of James Davis, who discovered the Hartigs\u2019 bodies. Davis testified over defense objection that the Hartigs liked to play cards, talk to people, and work around the yard. Noling also challenges the testimony of Bonnie Treesh (also spelled Treash in record), the Hartigs\u2019 niece who spent summers with the Hartigs and identified their photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">{\u00b6 56} No reversible error exists. We note that the trial court sustained objections to details about the personal lives of the Hartigs. The testimony targeted by overruled objections was admissible. Davis explained why he went to check on the Hartigs. Because the Hartigs were gregarious and meticulous, the fact that their lawn mower had been left out and that their garage door had been left open were notable to Davis. Cf. <em>State v. Allen </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 626, 633, 653 N.E.2d 675. Moreover, Davis\u2019s testimony helped to prove the time of death. And Treesh\u2019s testimony simply established that the Hartigs had been living persons, an element of the aggravated murder charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">{\u00b6 57} The foregoing testimony was thus related to the crimes and was not simply inflammatory as Noling claims. As this court noted regarding similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>evidence in <em>State v. Lorraine </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 414, 420, 613 N.E.2d 212, \u201cthis evidence illustrated the nature and circumstances of the crimes. * * * The victims cannot be separated from the crime.\u201d See, also, <em>State v. Fautenberry </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 435, 440, 650 N.E.2d 878; <em>State v. Combs </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 278, 283, 581 N.E.2d 1071. Consequently, we overrule the sixth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">IV. Indictment and Form of Charges</p>\n<p id=\"AvX\">A. Missing Element in Indictment</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">{\u00b6 58} Noling argues in his seventh proposition of law that the felony-murder death specifications in the indictments were fatally deficient in not alleging that Noling \u201cwas the principal offender in the commission of the aggravated murder or, if not the principal offender, committed the aggravated murder with prior calculation and design,\u201d as R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) requires. An accused must be the principal offender or act with prior calculation and design to be guilty of an (A)(7) death specification. See <em>State v. Taylor </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 295, 612 N.E.2d 316, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">{\u00b6 59} As Noling notes, the indictment refers to R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) but simply alleges in Counts One and Two that Noling committed the respective murders while \u201ccommitting Aggravated Robbery and/or Aggravated Burglary. Such act being a Specification of Felony Murder.\u201d At the close of the state\u2019s case, Noling noted the deficiency and moved under Crim.R. 29 to dismiss the (A)(7) specifications. The state never moved to amend the indictment, and the trial court rejected the motion to dismiss. The trial court, however, instructed the jury that it must determine whether Noling was the principal offender, and the jury verdicts specifically found that Noling was the principal offender in each murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">{\u00b6 60} We recognize that every defendant has a due process right to notice of the specific charge. <em>Cole v. Arkansas </em>(1948), 333 U.S. 196, 201, 68 S.Ct. 514, 92 L.Ed. 644. Here, the state never amended the indictment to more properly allege a death-penalty specification under R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). Compare <em>Dunn v. United States </em>(1979), 442 U.S. 100, 99 S.Ct. 2190, 60 L.Ed.2d 743; <em>Stirone v. United States </em>(1960), 361 U.S. 212, 80 S.Ct. 270, 4 L.Ed.2d 252; <em>State v. Dilley </em>(1989), 47 Ohio St.3d 20, 546 N.E.2d 937.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">{\u00b6 61} Noling, however, never complained about the language missing from the specifications until the state rested. Under Crim.R. 12(B), now (C), \u201c[d]efenses and objections based on defects\u201d in the indictment must be raised before trial. As then specified in Crim.R. 12(G), now (H), \u201c[fjailure by the defendant to raise defenses or objections\u201d within the time required \u201cshall constitute waiver thereof,\u201d although the court may grant relief from such waiver. Accord <em>Williams, </em>51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364; <em>State v. Brooks </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 148, 158, 661 N.E.2d 1030; <em>State v. Mills </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 357, 362, 582 N.E.2d 972.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">{\u00b6 62} We therefore consider whether plain error exists. \u201cUnder Crim.R. 52(B), \u2018[p]lain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.\u2019 We have previously explained that this rule \u2018places three limitations on a reviewing court\u2019s decision to correct an error despite the absence of a timely objection at trial\u2019: (1) \u2018there must be an error, <em>i.e., </em>a deviation from a legal rule,\u2019 (2) \u2018the error must be plain,\u2019 which means that it \u2018must be an \u201cobvious\u201d defect in the trial proceedings,\u2019 and (3) \u2018the error must have affected \u201csubstantial rights,\u201d \u2019 which means that \u2018the trial court\u2019s error must have affected the outcome of the trial.\u2019 <em>Barnes, </em>94 Ohio St.3d at 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240. Further, the decision to correct a plain error is discretionary and should be made \u2018 \u201cwith the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d \u2019 Id., quoting <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph three of the syllabus.\u201d <em>State v. Gross, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 121, 2002-Ohio-5524, 776 N.E.2d 1061, at \u00b6 45 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">{\u00b6 63} We find no plain error because one could not reasonably conclude that but for the missing language the trial result would have been otherwise. And because Noling does not argue that the form of the indictment constitutes \u201ca special category of forfeited erro[r] that can be corrected regardless of [its] effect on the outcome\u201d of his trial, we need not and do not address that issue. See id. at fn. 2. The form of the indictment has caused no \u201cmiscarriage of justice.\u201d The indictment charged only Noling, and the state\u2019s evidence proved that Noling was the actual shooter, hence the principal offender. Moreover, the indictment afforded Noling adequate notice of the death penalty because both specifications specifically mentioned R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). See <em>State v. Joseph </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 450, 456, 653 N.E.2d 285 (specification is sufficient if defendant knows which subsection has been alleged). Similarly, in <em>State v. Biros </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 426, 436, 678 N.E.2d 891, this court also found the defect waived when the accused failed to complain that the indictment did not include the \u201cprincipal offender\u201d language. Accord <em>Carter, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 597, 734 N.E.2d 345 (missing element of offense in rape-murder not fatal in view of failure to object). Cf. <em>State v. Bonnell </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 179, 184, 573 N.E.2d 1082 (no plain error although no instructions or jury finding as to \u201cprincipal offender\u201d status).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">{\u00b6 64} In the present case, unlike <em>Bonnell </em>and <em>Biros, </em>the trial court specifically instructed the jury that it must find whether Noling was the principal offender, and the jury specifically so found. Thus, this case differs from the issue the federal court recently decided in <em>Esparza v. Mitchell </em>(C.A.6, 2002), 310 F.3d 414. In <em>Esparza, </em>the trial judge never instructed the jury to determine whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>accused was the principal offender and the jury\u2019s verdict failed to find specifically that the defendant was the principal offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">{\u00b6 65} We reject the seventh proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">B. Ambiguous Indictment</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">{\u00b6 66} In his eighth proposition of law, Noling argues that the indictment and the jury\u2019s verdict were deceptive, thereby violating his right to a unanimous jury verdict. In the indictment, both Counts One and Two, and specification 1 in both counts, referred to Noling committing the murders in the course of \u201cAggravated Robbery and/or Aggravated Burglary.\u201d Noling argues that this manner of charging \u201cdeprived him of his right to a unanimous jury verdict\u201d because some jurors might have convicted him of these specifications on the basis of aggravated robbery and others on the basis of aggravated burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">{\u00b6 67} The form of the charge and the specifications, combining \u201caggravated robbery and/or aggravated burglary,\u201d was unnecessary and perilous. Using \u201cand/or\u201d can create ambiguity. See Garner, Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage (2d Ed.1995) 56. Noling, however, faded to raise this issue at trial or before the court of appeals and thus waived the issue save for plain error. See Crim.R. 12(B); 12(G) (now [H]). Accord <em>Williams, </em>51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus; <em>Brooks, </em>75 Ohio St.3d at 158, 661 N.E.2d 1030.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">{\u00b6 68} We find no plain error. This court previously rejected a similar plain-error claim based on the use of a charge of \u201cburglary and/or robbery\u201d in a single aggravating circumstance. <em>State v. Keene </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 646, 664, 693 N.E.2d 246. The <em>Keene </em>court ruled that \u201cthe outcome would not clearly have been otherwise had the indictment been worded differently\u201d because the jury there, as in this case, had separately convicted the defendant of aggravated burglary and aggravated robbery. Id. Accord <em>State v. Berry </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 354, 358, 369, 650 N.E.2d 433. Thus, jurors did not convict Noling of these charges or specifications on alternative theories because the same jury separately convicted Noling of <em>both </em>aggravated robbery and aggravated burglary. See, also, <em>State v. Spivey </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 405, 420, 692 N.E.2d 151, fn. 2. Noling has thus failed to satisfy at least the third prong of our plain-error inquiry \u2014 that <em>prejudicial </em>error exists. His eighth proposition of law is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">C. Guilt-phase Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">{\u00b6 69} Noling argues in his ninth proposition of law that the trial court\u2019s instructions on mens rea improperly reduced the state\u2019s burden of proof. But Noling failed to object at trial, submit alternative instructions, or raise these issues before the court of appeals. He thereby forfeited his complaints absent plain error. See Crim.R. 30(A) and 52(B); <em>State v. Underwood </em>(1983), 3 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>St.3d 12, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E.2d 1332, syllabus; <em>Williams, </em>51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">{\u00b6 70} No plain error exists for two primary reasons. First, Noling complains about jury instructions incorporating the following language:</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">{\u00b6 71} \u201cWhen the central idea of the offense is a prohibition against conduct of a certain nature, a person acts purposely when it is his specific intention to engage in conduct of that nature regardless of what he may have intended to accomplish by his conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">{\u00b6 72} The jurors could not reasonably have been confused by this disputed instructional language. The trial court\u2019s instructions emphasized that Noling must have specifically intended to cause the death of another to be guilty of murder. Moreover, Noling\u2019s decision to repeatedly shoot Bearnhardt and Cora Hartig left no question as to his intentions. Finally, this court has previously rejected similar arguments in other murder cases. See, e.g., <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 381, 392, 659 N.E.2d 292; <em>Carter </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 545, 552, 651 N.E.2d 965.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">{\u00b6 73} Second, Noling argues that the causation instructions included inappropriate language for murder cases, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">{\u00b6 74} \u201cThe defendant\u2019s responsibility is not limited to the immediate or most obvious result of the defendant\u2019s act or failure to act. The defendant is also responsible for the natural, foreseeable consequences or results that follow, in the ordinary course of events, from the act or failure to act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">{\u00b6 75} This court has held that such foreseeability language, while <em>inappropriate </em>in murder cases, does not create plain error. See, e.g., <em>State v. Getsy </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 180, 196, 702 N.E.2d 866; <em>Phillips, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 100, 656 N.E.2d 643; <em>State v. Frazier </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 323, 330, 652 N.E.2d 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">{\u00b6 76} We thus overrule the ninth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">V. Penalty-phase Issues</p>\n<p id=\"Al1\">A. Sentence Appropriateness</p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">{\u00b6 77} In his fifth proposition of law, Noling first argues that the state failed to prove the charged aggravating circumstances. For the reasons previously discussed, however, the state proved Noling\u2019s identity as the killer of the Hartigs. The state also proved that Noling purposefully killed the Hartigs while committing or attempting to commit aggravated robbery and aggravated burglary, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). Noling unlawfully entered the Hartig home by force or deception, and his motive was robbery. Additionally, the state proved the (A)(3) specification (murder to escape detection or apprehension).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>{\u00b6 78} Noling also asks that we give mitigating weight to residual doubt. This court has previously rejected residual doubt as a mitigating factor. <em>State v. McGuire </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 390, 686 N.E.2d 1112, syllabus. Moreover, we have no doubt that Noling was the actual killer given the abundant evidence against him, such as his own admission to several people that he shot the Hartigs.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">{\u00b6 79} Noling next argues that in view of his age, history, and background, the death penalty is not appropriate. We will consider these claims in connection with our independent sentence evaluation in Part XI, infra.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">B. Duplicative Aggravating Circumstances</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">{\u00b6 80} Noling argues in his tenth proposition of law that the trial court erred in not merging the R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) death specifications with the (A)(7) specifications. On appeal, the court of appeals determined that the trial court should have merged these specifications relating to Bearnhardt Hartig, but upheld the trial court\u2019s decision not to merge the (A)(3) and (A)(7) specifications as to Cora Hartig.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">{\u00b6 81} This court has stated that \u201cwhere two or more aggravating circumstances arise from the same act or indivisible course of conduct and are thus duplicative, the duplicative aggravating circumstances will be merged for purposes of sentencing.\u201d <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, paragraph five of the syllabus. At times, we have merged (A)(3) and (A)(7) specifications. See, e.g., <em>State v. Wiles </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 71, 84, 571 N.E.2d 97; <em>Cooey, </em>46 Ohio St.3d at 39, 544 N.E.2d 895; <em>Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 197, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264. In some situations, however, we have found that R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) and (A)(7) specifications can properly be viewed as separate and need not be merged. See, e.g., <em>State v. Sheppard </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 230, 232, 242, 703 N.E.2d 286; <em>State v. Palmer </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 543, 574, 687 N.E.2d 685; <em>Wogenstahl, </em>75 Ohio St.3d at 367, 662 N.E.2d 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">{\u00b6 82} In this case, we conclude that the court of appeals correctly upheld the trial court\u2019s decision not to merge the (A)(3) and (A)(7) specifications as to Cora Hartig. The facts show a separate motivation and decision to shoot Mrs. Hartig. Noling told Wolcott that after first shooting the \u201cold man,\u201d he later shot Cora Hartig because she had \u201cseen them, [and] she could tell the police who they were.\u201d Noling would have had to reload his semiautomatic gun before killing Cora Hartig. When asked why he killed them, Noling told Dalesandro that \u201che didn\u2019t want no witnesses.\u201d According to Garner, Noling asserted that St. Clair \u201csaid [Noling\u2019s] name, and so they had to kill both of them.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reject Noling\u2019s tenth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>C. Exclusion of Mitigation Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">{\u00b6 83} In his eleventh proposition of law, Noling argues that the trial court erred in excluding the testimony of Jim Aylward, a public defender. Aylward would have explained the meaning of consecutive, concurrent, and life sentences, and the penalties for the firearms specifications. We reject Noling\u2019s argument because he forfeited the issue by not asserting it below. <em>Williams, </em>51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">{\u00b6 84} Further, the exclusion of Aylward\u2019s testimony does not constitute plain error. Aylward\u2019s testimony was not relevant because it did not relate to Noling\u2019s history, character or background, the circumstances of the- offense, or Noling\u2019s \u201cmoral culpability.\u201d See <em>Franklin v. Lynaugh </em>(1988), 487 U.S. 164, 188, 108 S.Ct. 2320, 101 L.Ed.2d 155 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring). Accord <em>Treesh, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 463, 739 N.E.2d 749, fn. 1 (exclusion of similar expert on effect of firearms specifications); <em>State v. White </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 433, 447, 709 N.E.2d 140 (court can exclude expert testimony about length of life sentence in aggravated murder case including effect of firearms specifications); <em>State v. Williams </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 569, 660 N.E.2d 724, paragraph two of the syllabus (exclusion of attorney\u2019s testimony as to meaning of the lack of significant criminal history). Noling has thus failed to satisfy at least the first prong of our plain-error inquiry in that he has failed to identify an error.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">{\u00b6 85} Moreover, we note that Noling\u2019s counsel explained to the jury without objection that Noling faced at least 29 or 39 years in prison because of the gun specifications. The jury knew that Noling faced lengthy imprisonment and nonetheless chose the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">{\u00b6 86} We accordingly overrule the eleventh proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">D. Penalty-phase Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">{\u00b6 87} Noling argues in connection with his twelfth proposition of law that the sentencing instructions were flawed in failing to (1) delineate evidence relevant to the aggravating circumstances; and (2) direct the jury to consider only aggravating circumstances relevant to each murder count. In his thirteenth proposition of law, Noling then argues that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that a single juror could force the imposition of a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">{\u00b6 88} Noling never objected on these grounds at trial, nor did he request other instructions. His failure to object \u201cconstitutes a waiver * * *, unless, but for the error, the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise.\u201d <em>State v. Underwood, </em>3 Ohio St.3d 12, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E.2d 1332, syllabus. Noling also failed to raise these issues before the court of appeals. Because the trial court\u2019s penalty instructions did not involve plain error, we reject these propositions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>VI. Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">{\u00b6 89} In his fourteenth proposition of law, Noling complains about prosecutorial misconduct, but Noling objected on only some points at trial. Also, Noling raised misconduct issues at the court of appeals relating only to the prosecutor\u2019s peremptory challenges and penalty-phase arguments, namely, comments about Noling\u2019s age, the harm to the Hartigs, sympathy, and a personal opinion on the penalty. Thus, waiver, or forfeiture, applies. <em>Williams, </em>51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, paragraph two of the syllabus. Noling\u2019s complaints also lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">A. Peremptory Challenges</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">{\u00b6 90} Noling argues that the state improperly used peremptory challenges against jurors who were hesitant to impose the death penalty. This court has held that prosecutors may use peremptory strikes against prospective jurors who are hesitant about the death penalty. See <em>State v. Cook </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 516, 518, 605 N.E.2d 70; <em>State v. Evans </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 231, 249, 586 N.E.2d 1042. By failing to identify an error, Noling has thus failed to satisfy the first prong of our plain-error inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">B. Prosecutor\u2019s Guilt-phase Closing</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">{\u00b6 91} Noling claims that remarks in the prosecutor\u2019s guilt-phase argument were improper. Whether a prosecutor\u2019s remarks constitute misconduct requires analysis as to (1) whether the remarks were improper, and (2) if so, whether the remarks prejudicially affected an accused\u2019s substantial rights. <em>State v. Smith </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 14 OBR 317, 470 N.E.2d 883. Accord <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 165, 555 N.E.2d 293. The touchstone of this analysis \u201cis the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Smith v. Phillips </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">{\u00b6 92} Here, the prosecutor did not create plain error by declaring, without objection, that the gun Noling used to kill the Hartigs carried six bullets. Extended magazines for a .25 caliber semiautomatic pistol are uncommon; .25 caliber guns generally hold only six or seven shells, and ten shells from the same weapon were found at the scene. According to Wolcott, Noling had two clips for the murder weapon on his way to the scene. Thus, the prosecutor\u2019s theory that Noling reloaded the weapon is a fair inference based on the evidence. See <em>State v. Richey </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 353, 362, 595 N.E.2d 915.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">{\u00b6 93} Further, the prosecutor\u2019s assertion, over defense objection, that \u201cthese people cannot tell you what happened, they are dead,\u201d was a brief truism of no particular significance. See <em>Biros, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 454, 678 N.E.2d 891 (remark that victim could not testify was \u201ca rather obvious fact of which everyone was already aware\u201d and not prejudicial). Similarly, the prosecutor\u2019s statement that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>\u201cthe State doesn\u2019t pick its witnesses, we\u2019re not going to have fine upstanding witnesses at scenes like this. * * * [Bjirds of a feather fly together\u201d was also of no particular significance. The prosecutor simply pointed out that the state did not choose the witnesses, events did. Instead of arguing \u201cguilt by association,\u201d the prosecutor was attempting \u2014 without defense objection \u2014 to excuse the unsavory character of the state\u2019s own witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">{\u00b6 94} Additionally, the prosecutor\u2019s unfinished remark that \u201cif the defendant failed to demonstrate or [in] any way, shape or form explain [the evidence]\u201d did not constitute a comment on Noling\u2019s failure to testify. A prosecutor\u2019s reference to \u201cuncontradicted evidence is not a comment on the accused\u2019s failure to testify.\u201d <em>State v. Ferguson </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 160, 5 OBR 380, 450 N.E.2d 265, paragraph one of the syllabus. Accord <em>State v. Webb </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 325, 329, 638 N.E.2d 1023. Moreover, isolated comments by a prosecutor are not to be taken out of context and given their most damaging meaning. <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo </em>(1974), 416 U.S. 637, 647, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431. Rather, an appellate court must review a closing argument in its entirety to determine whether prejudicial error exists. <em>Frazier, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 342, 652 N.E.2d 1000. Even construing the prosecutor\u2019s remark as misconduct, it lacks prejudicial effect warranting reversal because the court sustained Noling\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">{\u00b6 95} The court\u2019s instructions also negated any potential prejudice arising from improprieties in the prosecutor\u2019s argument. The court instructed the jury on the presumption of innocence, the state\u2019s burden of proof, and reasonable doubt. It further instructed the jurors that counsel\u2019s statements, counsel\u2019s arguments, and stricken statements were not evidence and cautioned them not to speculate on an unanswered question or why an objection was sustained. We conclude that no prejudicial error warranting reversal occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">C. Penalty-phase Questioning</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">{\u00b6 96} Noling argues that the prosecutor improperly questioned the defense psychologist, Dr. Jeffrey Smalldon, about \u201ca witness list from the defendant of approximately forty names.\u201d Over objection, the prosecutor asked Dr. Smalldon if he had contacted everyone on the witness list. Dr. Smalldon said that he had not seen the list, and shortly thereafter the trial court declared that the prosecutor could not comment about witnesses not called to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">{\u00b6 97} Here, the prosecutor attempted to cross-examine Dr. Smalldon by suggesting that his opinions were based on limited information because Dr. Smalldon had not interviewed a number of individuals who presumably knew about Noling. The prosecutor improperly brought before the jury the topic of the defense witness list. See, e.g., Crim.R. 16(C)(3) (\u201cThe fact that a witness\u2019 name is on a list * * * and that the witness is not called shall not be commented upon at the trial\u201d). Accord <em>State v. Hannah </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 84, 90, 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>O.O.3d 84, 374 N.E.2d 1359 (commenting on absence of alibi witness is error). We find no prejudice in the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the witness list in light of the overall events at trial and the abundant evidence against Noling.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">{\u00b6 98} Noling also argues that the prosecutor improperly cross-examined defense witnesses because Noling did not raise the (B)(3) mitigating factor. Noling claims that the prosecutor could not ask witnesses, such as Dr. Smalldon, whether Noling understood the consequences of his actions and knew right from wrong. Noling is wrong. Dr. Smalldon testified that Noling had an antisocial personality disorder, a learning disability, and a hyperactivity disorder or \u201cbrain disorder.\u201d A prosecutor can legitimately examine the parameters of defense mitigation evidence, including cross-examining a defense psychologist. See <em>State v. Green </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 352, 374, 738 N.E.2d 1208. Here, the prosecution\u2019s questions enabled the jury to place in context and understand the complex defense psychological testimony presented. Whether Noling understood the difference between right and wrong and that what he did was wrong was indeed relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">D. Prosecutor\u2019s Penalty-phase Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">{\u00b6 99} Noling claims misconduct in the prosecutor\u2019s sentencing argument. But, as we note, Noling on occasion failed to object and on those points waived all but plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">{\u00b6 100} First, the prosecutor did improperly suggest, over unsuccessful objection, that Noling\u2019s \u201ctwo-day crime spree\u201d was an aggravating circumstance. See, e.g., <em>Green, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 362, 738 N.E.2d 1208 (other offenses are \u201cnot relevant to the specified aggravating circumstance\u201d). This remark could not be said to have prejudiced Noling, given the court\u2019s instruction as to the aggravating circumstances to be considered. And evidence of the two-day crime spree was properly before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">{\u00b6 101} In contrast, the prosecutor could appropriately refer to the facts of the offense, namely, the plan to commit the crime, the extra ammunition clip, the ransacking of the Hartigs\u2019 home, the disposal of the weapon, and the fact that the Hartigs were \u201cold and helpless.\u201d \u201cThe facts [of an offense] are relevant in determining whether the nature and circumstances of the offense are mitigating.\u201d <em>Green, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 374, 738 N.E.2d 1208, citing <em>Lorraine, </em>66 Ohio St.3d at 420, 613 N.E.2d 212. Moreover, \u201cboth the criminal <em>and his crime </em>are properly considered in determining the propriety of imposing a death sentence.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id., quoting <em>State v. Hill </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 200, 661 N.E.2d 1068.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">{\u00b6 102} The prosecutor\u2019s comments that the crime was \u201cscary\u201d because it involved a home invasion, that the crime \u201chorrified\u201d the community or \u201cfrightens us,\u201d and that Noling should not be allowed to walk the streets again were fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>comments. \u201cProsecutors can be \u2018colorful or creative.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilson, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 399, 659 N.E.2d 292, citing <em>State v. Brown </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 305, 317, 528 N.E.2d 523. Moreover, Noling did not object, and because no prejudicial error resulted from such comments, Noling has failed to satisfy at least the third prong of our plain-error inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">{\u00b6 103} Nor did the prosecutor err by arguing that mitigation evidence, unrelated to the crime, should be given little weight. \u201cProsecutors can urge the merits of their cause and legitimately argue that defense mitigation evidence is worthy of little or no weight.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 399, 659 N.E.2d 292. \u201cThe fact that * * * evidence is admissible * * * does not automatically mean that it must be given any weight.\u201d <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">{\u00b6 104} Equally permissible was the prosecutor\u2019s comparing Noling with his siblings who had an identical family background. Even though evidence concerning his siblings was scarce, some evidence exists in the record. Because Noling sought to mitigate his offenses by relying on his family background, the state could argue that others who had the same family background had not committed comparable crimes. See, e.g., <em>State v. Campbell </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 320, 343, 738 N.E.2d 1178 (court did not err by comparing law-abiding siblings from same abusive home to defendant); <em>Wilson, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 399, 659 N.E.2d 292 (arguing that others with deprived backgrounds do not commit such crimes was not error).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">{\u00b6 105} The prosecutor\u2019s brief comment that mitigation did not outweigh Noling\u2019s crimes did not impermissibly shift the burden of proof. The trial court\u2019s instructions, counsel\u2019s argument, and the verdict form clearly reflected the state\u2019s burden of proof. Moreover, Noling did not object.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">{\u00b6 106} Finally, Noling\u2019s complaint that reversible error exists because the prosecutor expressed a personal opinion that death was the appropriate punishment lacks merit. On three occasions, the court sustained defense objections to comments by the prosecutor that might be construed as a personal opinion on the death penalty. The prosecutor then rephrased his argument, and no prejudicial error resulted from these inartful comments. Although limits exist, \u201c \u2018it is difficult for prosecutors to argue vigorously for the death penalty without making what might arguably be statements of personal opinion.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Durr </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 86, 96, 568 N.E.2d 674, quoting <em>Tyler, </em>50 Ohio St.3d at 41, 553 N.E.2d 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">{\u00b6 107} Noling received a fair trial, and prosecutorial misconduct did not permeate the trial. Nor did any misconduct deprive Noling of his right to a fair and individualized sentencing determination. We therefore reject his fourteenth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>VII. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">{\u00b6 108} Noling argues in his fifteenth proposition of law that his counsel inadequately investigated his case, failed to question jurors about pretrial publicity, failed to make necessary objections to charges, instructions, and prosecutorial misconduct, and argued ineffectively to the jury. Reversal of convictions on ineffective assistance requires that the defendant show, first, that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and, second, that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Accord <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373. \u201cTo establish prejudice, \u2018the defendant must prove that there exists a reasonable probability that, were it not for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the trial would have been different.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tibbetts, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 164, 749 N.E.2d 226, quoting <em>Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">{\u00b6 109} Noling has forfeited his claim that trial counsel were ineffective, however, because his appellate counsel did not raise that issue before the court of appeals. <em>Williams, </em>51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">{\u00b6 110} In any event, we find that his claims lack merit. For example, as discussed in connection with his eighth proposition of law, the use of ambiguous language \u2014 \u201cRobbery and/or Burglary\u201d in the death specifications \u2014 did not affect Noling\u2019s rights. See <em>Keene, </em>81 Ohio St.3d at 664, 693 N.E.2d 246. The failure to object to this language does not constitute ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">{\u00b6 111} Nor does Noling establish either deficient performance or prejudice when he argues that his counsel did not adequately voir dire juror Renfroe about pretrial publicity. Renfroe never stated that he had read or knew about the case, only that he was \u201cglancing through the newspaper\u201d and noticed jury selection had been cancelled the previous week. Counsel made a reasoned tactical decision not to question Renfroe further, and \u201cwe will not second-guess trial strategy decisions such as those made in voir dire.\u201d <em>State v. Cornwell </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 560, 569, 715 N.E.2d 1144, citing <em>State v. Mason </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 144, 157, 694 N.E.2d 932. Further, Noling has not explained adequately how this decision prejudiced him. See <em>Mason, </em>82 Ohio St.3d at 157-158, 694 N.E.2d 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">{\u00b6 112} Noling also argues that his counsel inadequately investigated the possibility of another pretrial agreement between Dalesandro and the state. That possibility, however, was discussed at trial. And because the record before us does not show what investigation Noling\u2019s counsel undertook, we cannot say that it reveals this alleged error. See <em>State v. Nields </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 6, 35, 752 N.E.2d 859, citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>State v. Sanders </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 274, 750 N.E.2d 90. Nor does the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>record show any prejudice arising from any such inquiry or lack thereof. We therefore reject Noling\u2019s claims in this regard as speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">{\u00b6 113} Noling\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance for failure to object to alleged prosecutorial misconduct also lack merit. As discussed in connection with Noling\u2019s fourteenth proposition of law, see Part VI, supra, Noling had no basis to object to the state\u2019s peremptory challenges or to the state\u2019s guilt-phase or sentencing arguments. Thus, Noling has not established either deficient performance or prejudice. Cf. <em>Tibbetts, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 155, 749 N.E.2d 226 (there is no ineffective assistance where none of the challenged statements would warrant reversal). In contrast, Noling\u2019s counsel preserved his claim of error as to the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of St. Clair as previously discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">{\u00b6 114} Equally unsuccessful are Noling\u2019s claims that counsel were ineffective for failing to object to the guilt-phase or penalty instructions. Counsel\u2019s decisions represented reasonable professional judgment. See our discussion on propositions of law nine, twelve, thirteen, and twenty. Additionally, Noling offers no basis to find that if he had objected, a \u201creasonable probability\u201d exists that the trial result would have been different. <em>Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">{\u00b6 115} We similarly reject Noling\u2019s complaint that his counsel discussed punishment in his opening statement. Counsel simply made a tactical decision to explain the voir dire death-qualification process that had just been concluded. \u201c[A] strong presumption [exists] that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. And Noling has failed to demonstrate how counsel\u2019s choice prejudiced his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">{\u00b6 116} Noling further argues that his counsel inaccurately described the jury\u2019s role by asking the jury to acquit if it doubted \u201cthe honesty of the State\u2019s case.\u201d Noling claims that his counsel\u2019s argument was inflammatory, attacked the prosecutor\u2019s integrity, and trivialized reasonable doubt. Noling\u2019s arguments lack merit, however, because they accord unreasonable interpretations to phrases employed by counsel, interpretations that no reasonable juror would have made. By referring to the honesty of the case, counsel simply questioned the credibility of the state\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">{\u00b6 117} In sum, we reject Noling\u2019s fifteenth proposition of law. At trial, Noling had competent and thorough lawyers who fought hard for their client. We find neither deficient performance nor prejudice as required by <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">VIII. Trial Court\u2019s Sentencing Hearing and Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"AAW\">A. Sentencing Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">{\u00b6 118} In his sixteenth proposition of law, Noling argues that victim-impact evidence requires vacation of his death sentence. Specifically, Noling complains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>that after the jury\u2019s death-penalty verdict, Wilton Treesh, a Hartig family representative, asked the trial court to follow the jury\u2019s death-penalty recommendation. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">{\u00b6 119} The United States Constitution does not prohibit victim-impact evidence in capital cases. <em>Payne v. Tennessee </em>(1991), 501 U.S. 808, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720. This court has held, however, that \u201c[expressions of opinion by a witness as to the appropriateness of a particular sentence in a capital case violate\u201d a defendant\u2019s rights. <em>State v. Huertas </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 22, 553 N.E.2d 1058, syllabus. The same principle applies to family representatives who express opinions about the penalty at sentencing hearings. See <em>State v. Goodwin </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 331, 343, 703 N.E.2d 1251; <em>Fautenberry, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 439, 650 N.E.2d 878.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">{\u00b6 120} Here, the remarks about which Noling complains do not require reversal. Not only did Noling fail to object to Treesh\u2019s remarks, but the jury never heard the opinion. Rather, Treesh\u2019s remarks were directed only to the trial judge. We have explained that \u201cwhere such opinion is expressed to the judge only, as was the case here, it is not reversible error unless there is some indication that the judge <em>actually considered it </em>in sentencing the defendant to death.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State v. Franklin, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 1, 2002-Ohio-5304, 776 N.E.2d 26, at \u00b6 88, citing <em>Fautenberry, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 439, 650 N.E.2d 878. Noling has failed to identify evidence suggesting that the trial judge <em>actually </em>considered the remarks. Absent evidence of actual consideration, we must presume that the trial judge remained uninfluenced in sentencing Noling because his sentencing decision never referred to Treesh\u2019s opinion. Cf. <em>Treesh, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 486, 739 N.E.2d 749; <em>State v. Allard </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 482, 488-492, 663 N.E.2d 1277; <em>Fautenberry, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 439, 650 N.E.2d 878.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">B. Sentencing Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">{\u00b6 121} In his seventeenth proposition of law, Noling argues that the trial court erred in considering duplicative aggravating circumstances and improper evidence in its sentencing opinion. He also complains that the trial court failed to consider significant mitigating evidence. We conclude that this proposition presents no reversible error for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">{\u00b6 122} First, contrary to Noling\u2019s arguments, the R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) and (A)(7) death specifications are separate aggravating circumstances as to the murder of Cora Hartig. See Part V(B), supra. As to the aggravated murder of Bearnhardt Hartig, the court of appeals determined the (A)(3) and (A)(7) should have been merged, but independently reassessed the sentence in light of that error. The court of appeals thus corrected this asserted deficiency in the trial court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>{\u00b6 123} Second, although the trial court may have improperly cited impeachment evidence of St. Clair as substantive evidence in describing exactly what occurred inside the Hartig home, any such error failed to prejudice Noling. That court\u2019s sentencing opinion noted that \u201c[t]he defendant held * * * the Hartigs in the kitchen area * * * while St. Clair ransacked the bedrooms * * *. At some point, St. Clair heard shooting and ran from the bedroom to see Noling shooting Mrs. Hartig.\u201d We agree that no direct evidence of those events is in the record. Nonetheless, we find that any error was harmless given that other evidence established that Noling personally shot the Hartigs, and the jury found that he was the principal offender. See Parts IV(A) and V(B), supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">{\u00b6 124} Third, Noling is wrong in arguing that the trial court misconstrued the role that mitigation plays in sentencing and failed to consider relevant mitigating evidence. The trial court\u2019s decision that Noling\u2019s history, character, or background did not mitigate the offenses was within its discretion. \u201c[T]he assessment and weight to be given mitigating evidence are matters for the trial court\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>Lott, </em>51 Ohio St.3d at 171, 555 N.E.2d 293. Accord <em>Bey, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 504, 709 N.E.2d 484; <em>State v. Fox </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 183, 193, 631 N.E.2d 124. See, also, <em>State v. Stumpf </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 95, 512 N.E.2d 598, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">{\u00b6 125} The trial court\u2019s use of terms such as \u201cexplain,\u201d \u201cjustify,\u201d or \u201clessen\u201d does not demonstrate constitutional error in the evaluation of mitigation evidence. As this court held in <em>Steffen, </em>31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, paragraph two of the syllabus, \u201cThe fact that an item of evidence is admissible under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7) does not automatically mean that it must be given any weight.\u201d Finally, our \u201cindependent review of a sentence will cure any flaws in the trial court\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Fox, </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 191, 631 N.E.2d 124. Accord <em>McGuire, </em>80 Ohio St.3d at 395, 686 N.E.2d 1112; <em>Hill, </em>75 Ohio St.3d at 210, 661 N.E.2d 1068.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">{\u00b6 126} We overrule proposition of law seventeen.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">IX. Court of Appeals\u2019 Sentencing Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">{\u00b6 127} Noling complains in his eighteenth proposition of law about the court of appeals\u2019 sentencing opinion, including its independent review of Noling\u2019s death sentence. We reject his arguments as meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">{\u00b6 128} First, Noling argues that the court of appeals relied on nonstatutory aggravating circumstances and points to references about Noling\u2019s \u201cplan to steal from the weak and infirm,\u201d Noling\u2019s other robberies, and his prior discharge of a firearm. The context shows that, in referring to these circumstances, the appellate court was evaluating Dr. Smalldon\u2019s testimony, not piling on aggravating factors. Moreover, the court of appeals precisely defined the aggravating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>circumstances. This court has held that \u201c[w]hen a court correctly identifies the aggravating circumstances in its sentencing opinion, we will presume that the court relied only on those circumstances and not on nonstatutory aggravating circumstances.\u201d <em>Clemons, </em>82 Ohio St.3d at 447, 696 N.E.2d 1009, citing <em>State v. Hill </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 433, 441, 653 N.E.2d 271. Noling presents us with no persuasive reason to stray from that presumption here.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">{\u00b6 129} Second, Noling claims that the court of appeals \u201cappears to penalize [him] for his failure to meet the arduous standard\u201d in R.C. 2929.04(B)(3). We reject this claim. The context of the opinion shows that the court of appeals was evaluating Dr. Smalldon\u2019s testimony and granting it mitigating weight, but also pointing out that this testimony failed to establish any mental disease or defect within the meaning of R.C. 2929.04(B)(3). The opinion never implied that Noling was punished for not meeting that standard, and we regard Noling\u2019s contrary inference as incorrectly drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">{\u00b6 130} Third, Noling argues that the court of appeals improperly minimized mitigation evidence. It is apparent from the record, however, that the court of appeals carefully reviewed the sentence and expressed its views in a 13-page independent evaluation. Further, we have held that \u201c \u2018[a] decisionmaker need not weigh mitigating factors in a particular manner. The process * * * as well as the weight, if any, to assign a given factor is a matter for the discretion of the individual decisionmaker.\u2019 \u201d <em>Taylor, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 31-32, 676 N.E.2d 82, quoting <em>Fox, </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 193, 631 N.E.2d 124. Accordingly, this argument also lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">{\u00b6 131} Fourth, Noling\u2019s claim that the court of appeals placed the burden of proof as to sentencing on him also lacks merit. The appellate court\u2019s comment that Noling\u2019s \u201cage and background [do] not overcome the enormous weight of the aggravating circumstances\u201d in context does not reflect misunderstanding of the state\u2019s burden of proof. The court of appeals correctly noted the burden in numerous references.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">{\u00b6 132} Finally, in regard to the foregoing arguments, we note that our independent sentence evaluation will readily correct any deficiencies in the court of appeals\u2019 opinion. See, e.g., <em>Phillips, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 102, 656 N.E.2d 643; <em>Frazier, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 343, 652 N.E.2d 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">X. Ineffective Assistance of Appellate Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">{\u00b6 133} In proposition of law nineteen, Noling points to examples of claimed ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. As with claims of ineffective trial counsel, reversal for ineffective assistance of appellate counsel also requires demonstration of deficient performance and prejudice. See, e.g., <em>Strickland, </em>466 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>U.S. at 669, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>Spivey, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 25, 701 N.E.2d 696; <em>State v. Reed </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 534, 535, 660 N.E.2d 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">{\u00b6 134} There is no .ineffective assistance of appellate counsel here. Appellate counsel raised 15 primary issues before the court of appeals, many with subparts, and strongly argued their case. It is well settled that appellate counsel have no constitutional duty to raise every nonfrivolous issue. <em>Jones v. Barnes </em>(1983), 463 U.S. 745, 751, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987. Rather, appellate counsel can make a reasoned tactical judgment not to raise issues that lack substantial merit. See, e.g., our discussion on propositions of law one, four, eleven, seventeen, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">{\u00b6 135} Moreover, as to issues Noling argues that his counsel should have raised, no \u201creasonable probability\u201d of a different result exists even if counsel had raised those claims before the court of appeals. <em>Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph three of the syllabus. See, e.g., our discussion on propositions of law two, fourteen, and fifteen. Thus, we reject proposition of law number nineteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">XI. Independent Sentence Evaluation</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">{\u00b6 136} Having rejected each of Noling\u2019s propositions of law, we now turn to our statutory duty to independently weigh the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors and to determine whether Noling\u2019s sentence is disproportionate to sentences in similar cases. R.C. 2929.05(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">A. Penalty-phase Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">{\u00b6 137} At the penalty phase of the trial, Noling presented testimony about his history, character, and background from his mother, sister, other relatives, and friends, as well as from Dr. Jeffrey Smalldon, a clinical psychologist. We summarize that testimony as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">{\u00b6 138} Judith Mann, Noling\u2019s mother, was married to Gary Noling for ten years. She had four children with him, including Noling, who was born in 1972. Although Gary Noling was an alcoholic, he worked steadily, but the marriage broke up when Noling was less than one year old. Judith later married Wayne Allen, also an alcoholic; this union also ended in divorce. Wayne was cruel to Noling, and his father, Gary, expressed little interest in Noling and rarely visited.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">{\u00b6 139} As a child, Noling was a hyperactive slow learner, had problems in school for stealing and truancy, and spent time in detention and in group homes. In 1986, he was adjudged a delinquent for petty theft, felony theft, and breaking and entering. In 1988, he was adjudged a delinquent for criminal trespass, aggravated burglary, and assault, and in 1989, he was found delinquent for assault, criminal trespass, and obstructing justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>{\u00b6 140} Diana Riggs, Noling\u2019s sister, confirmed that their mother had raised the children on welfare and that her alcoholic father did not support them. Her mother suffered from depression and a variety of ailments.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">{\u00b6 141} Scott Brahler, Noling\u2019s cousin, recalled playing baseball, football, and other sports with Noling, and that Noling was fine when he visited. Scott was very surprised that Noling had committed these crimes and believes that Noling\u2019s life is worth saving. Dexter Neiswanger, another of Noling\u2019s cousins, grew up with him, loves him, and would not want Noling to receive the death penalty. Jane Brahler, Noling\u2019s aunt, described Noling as a well-behaved child, a \u201csweet kid\u201d who lacked a father figure. She never thought that Noling \u201ccould ever, ever do such a thing.\u201d She stated that Noling will always have \u201ca place in [her] heart, always did and always will.\u201d Orm Smith, Noling\u2019s uncle, recalled when Noling\u2019s father \u201cwas smacking the heck out of his mother,\u201d and he stopped it. While growing up, Noling lacked discipline, love, and affection, and was not treated fairly.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">{\u00b6 142} Sue Ann Dangel and James Dangel manage a campground in Wooster and employed Noling one summer for four or five months when Noling was 14 to 15 years old. Noling then lived at a Christian children\u2019s home where a juvenile court had placed him. Noling was a good worker, did a wide variety of tasks, was honest and trustworthy, got along well with everyone, and was fun to be around. Both were shocked that Noling had committed these crimes. David Miller, a social worker, was Noling\u2019s therapist at the children\u2019s home. When Noling first .arrived, he was \u201cagitated\u201d and \u201cvery belligerent,\u201d but reportedly began to do well in a structured and controlled environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">{\u00b6 143} Dr. Jeffrey Smalldon, a psychologist, evaluated Noling, related his family history to the jury, and reported that as a child Noling was hyperactive, suffered from attention deficit disorder, and had a learning disability. As an adolescent, Noling was mouthy, defiant, and difficult. After a juvenile court declared Noling unruly, that court placed him in the children\u2019s home in Wooster for a year. Then he returned to live with his mother, the old problems resurfaced, and for a while Noling lived with his father, which did not work out.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">{\u00b6 144} When Noling was nine or ten years old, he first got into trouble with the law for theft and was arrested for a variety of offenses as an adolescent. School records reflected that Noling was unruly, frequently involved in fights and verbal altercations, and difficult to control. Noling experimented with drugs when he was 11 to 13 years old, tried hard drugs, and had a history of marijuana abuse. In 1990, when Noling was 18, he was sentenced to prison for aggravated robbery (which involved the \u201cother acts\u201d offenses discussed supra).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">{\u00b6 145} Dr. Smalldon concluded that Noling suffered from \u201cdysthymia,\u201d which is \u201ca longstanding depressive condition.\u201d His depression manifested in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>\u201cacting out behavior.\u201d His overall IQ has consistently tested in the 85 to 90 range, but he gets over 100 in nonverbal skills and only around 80 in verbal skills. Noling has \u201ctremendous difficulty with abstract thinking,\u201d and a \u201cvery flawed\u201d conceptual understanding. Noling suffers from an antisocial personality disorder, which is an enduring pattern of thinking, emotions, feelings, and interpersonal behavior. One psychiatrist described him as a 22-year-old man \u201cwith the inner controls of a two year old child.\u201d He noted that Noling could adjust reasonably well in prison where he has \u201ca great deal of structure and consistency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">{\u00b6 146} In an unsworn statement, Noling declared that he was \u201cwilling to accept any responsibility [for] what I have done and that I\u2019m very sorry. * * * I just beg [you] from the bottom of my heart that you spare my life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">B. Sentence Evaluation</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">{\u00b6 147} After independent assessment, we determine that the evidence proves the aggravating circumstances \u2014 that Noling murdered Bearnhardt Hartig during an aggravated burglary and an aggravated robbery, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), and killed Cora Hartig to escape detection or apprehension, R.C. 2929.04(A)(3), and in the course of an aggravated burglary and an aggravated robbery, (A)(7). Because the form of the specification charged \u201caggravated robbery and/or aggravated burglary,\u201d we deem it appropriate to treat the felony-murder specification as a single specification in each count. See our discussion in Part III(A), supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">{\u00b6 148} In regard to mitigation, there are no mitigating features in the nature and circumstances of the offense. In the course of a home-invasion robbery, Noling murdered an elderly couple by repeatedly shooting them. Nor does Noling\u2019s character offer mitigating features. There are modest mitigating features, however, in Noling\u2019s history and background. Noling grew up in an unstructured home; his mother suffered chronic illnesses, and his father, an alcoholic, abandoned the family. His stepfather was abusive. Noling was in trouble throughout his teenage years and developed an antisocial personality disorder, an attention deficit disorder, and a learning disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">{\u00b6 149} As to statutory mitigating factors, we conclude that the statutory factors in R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) to (B)(3), (B)(5), and (B)(6) are not applicable. Under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7) (\u201cother factors\u201d), we consider as mitigating factors Noling\u2019s remorse as expressed in his unsworn statement, the love and concern of his relatives, his learning disability, his antisocial personality disorder, and his adaptability to a structured environment. We also recognize that Noling\u2019s age is a mitigating factor, R.C. 2929.04(B)(4), because he was born on March 22, 1972, and was just two weeks past his 18th birthday when the offenses occurred. We do not, however, necessarily regard age as a strong or compelling mitigating factor. This court upheld the death penalty in the following cases when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>defendants committed murder at the age of 18. <em>Franklin, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 1, 2002-Ohio-5304, 776 N.E.2d 26, at \u00b6 98; <em>Carter, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 611, 734 N.E.2d 345; <em>State v. Raglin </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 253, 273, 699 N.E.2d 482; <em>State v. Dennis </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 421, 438, 683 N.E.2d 1096; <em>State v. Slagle </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 597, 613, 605 N.E.2d 916; <em>State v. Hill </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 313, 335, 595 N.E.2d 884.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">{\u00b6 150} After weighing the aggravating circumstances against the collective mitigating evidence, we have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances as to each aggravated murder count outweigh those collective mitigating factors. In the course of a brutal home-invasion robbery, Noling repeatedly shot and killed elderly people. Moreover, Noling planned the burglary and robbery and took other youths along to participate in these brutal crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">{\u00b6 151} We hold that the death penalty is proportionate when compared with other aggravated murders committed during the course of an aggravated burglary and an aggravated robbery. See, e.g., <em>State v. Jones </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 403, 739 N.E.2d 300; <em>State v. Stallings </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 280, 731 N.E.2d 159; <em>Spivey, </em>81 Ohio St.3d 405, 692 N.E.2d 151; <em>Berry, </em>72 Ohio St.3d 354, 650 N.E.2d 433; <em>Slagle, </em>65 Ohio St.3d 597, 605 N.E.2d 916; <em>State v. Murphy </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 554, 605 N.E.2d 884; <em>Lott, </em>51 Ohio St.3d 160, 555 N.E.2d 293; and <em>Barnes, </em>25 Ohio St.3d 203, 25 OBR 266, 495 N.E.2d 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">{\u00b6 152} We further hold that the death penalty is also proportionate when compared with cases involving killings to escape detection. See, e.g., <em>Sheppard, </em>84 Ohio St.3d 230, 703 N.E.2d 286; <em>State v. Burke </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 399, 653 N.E.2d 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">XII. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">{\u00b6 153} For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that none of Noling\u2019s propositions of law has merit. We have also independently weighed the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors as to each murder victim and have considered the proportionality of the death sentence. We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and the death sentence imposed against Noling.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b181-12\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b181-13\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b181-14\">{\u00b6 154} Proposition of Law No. 1: Where a trial court precludes a capital defendant from cross-examining a witness about a strong motive to fabricate testimony, the trial court deprives that capital defendant of his confrontation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>due process rights as guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article 1 \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 16 of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">{\u00b6 155} Proposition of Law No. 2: A trial court abuses its discretion when it declares a witness hostile without the showing required by Ohio Rule of Evidence 607. Further, when a trial court permits a witness to be impeached pursuant to Rule 607, the trial court has an obligation to control the nature and extent of that cross-examination. The trial court\u2019s failure to do either violates a capital defendant\u2019s due process rights as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and \u00a7 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">{\u00b6 156} Proposition of Law No. 3: Where evidence of other crimes lacks a distinct behavioral fingerprint, such evidence is inadmissible.

V, VI, VIII, and XIV.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">{\u00b6 157} Proposition of Law No. 4: A capital defendant\u2019s conviction cannot stand where it is against the manifest weight of the evidence. To allow such a conviction to stand violates a capital defendant\u2019s due process rights as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, \u00a7 16 of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">{\u00b6 158} Proposition of Law No. 5: This death penalty is inappropriate and in violation of the Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution as well as Article I, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 10 and 16 of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">{\u00b6 159} Proposition of Law No. 6: Where the trial court admits victim impact evidence during the trial phase unrelated to the crimes, a capital defendant\u2019s rights as guaranteed [by the] Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, \u00a7\u00a7 16 are violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">{\u00b6 160} Proposition of Law No. 7: The state may not obtain a conviction for an offense where the indictment for that offense fails to include an essential element of the offense. To do so offends fundamental due process. U.S. Const. Amend. XIV and Article I, \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 16 of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">{\u00b6 161} Proposition of Law No. 8: A verdict that a defendant committed felony murder based on the charge that the murder was committed during an \u201cAggravated Robbery and/or Aggravated Burglary\u201d cannot stand because it is duplicitous.
