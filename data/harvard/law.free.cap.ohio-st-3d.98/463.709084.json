Zaino, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 463, 2003-Ohio-1915.]</p>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>(Nos. 2002-0914 and 2002-0915</docketnumber>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"A1C\">Submitted February 12, 2003</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ADD\">Decided April 30, 2003.)</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b572-5\">Lundberg Stratton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">{\u00b6 1} The question presented by these cases is whether the buses being operated by Campus Bus Service (\u201cCBS\u201d) during late 1999 and early 2000 were operated \u201cby or for\u201d the city of Kent and therefore entitle CBS to a refund of motor fuel tax. We find that CBS is not entitled to a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">{\u00b6 2} These cases have been consolidated by the court for hearing and decision. In both cases, CBS has filed a claim for a refund of motor vehicle fuel taxes. The claim for refund in case No. 2002-0914 covers October 1, 1999, through December 31, 1999. The claim in case No. 2002-0915 covers January 1, 2000, through March 31, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">{\u00b6 3} CBS is a transportation service owned and operated by Kent State University (\u201cKSU\u201d). CBS operates 20 buses at any one time on its scheduled routes. The buses have seating capacities ranging from 29 to 47 persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">{\u00b6 4} Some of CBS\u2019s scheduled routes serve only campus areas. Other routes, while starting on the campus, travel through Kent and into adjoining townships. In addition to its scheduled routes, CBS provides campus and airport shuttles and transportation for disabled students.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the school term, CBS also provides buses for students and commuters who travel to and from Cleveland. Other CBS routes connect with the Akron Metro Regional Transit Authority and the Portage Area Regional Transit Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">{\u00b6 5} Travel within the KSU campus area is free. Travel off the campus is at no additional charge for KSU students, who pay a per-credit-hour transportation fee. Nonstudents who use the buses in Kent or adjoining townships pay a fare.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">{\u00b6 6} CBS has no contract, understanding, or financial arrangement of any type with Kent. CBS has no contract or financial arrangements with either the Portage Area Regional Transit Authority or the Akron Metro Regional Transit Authority. About 86 percent of CBS\u2019s expenses are covered by KSU student fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-12\">{\u00b6 7} Both the Tax Commissioner and the Board of Tax Appeals denied CBS\u2019s claims for reimbursement of motor vehicle fuel tax, finding that CBS\u2019s buses did not meet the definition of \u201ctransit bus\u201d set forth in R.C. 5735.01(Q).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>{\u00b6 8} This court considered the topic of reimbursement of motor vehicle fuel tax in <em>Lakefront Lines, Inc. v. Tracy </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 627, 629, 665 N.E.2d 662, and held that a claim for reimbursement of motor vehicle fuel tax is to be treated as an exemption from taxation. As an exemption from taxation, the statute granting the exemption must be strictly construed, and the person claiming the exemption must affirmatively establish his or her right thereto. <em>Natl. Tube Co. v. Glander </em>(1952), 157 Ohio St. 407, 47 O.O. 313, 105 N.E.2d 648, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">{\u00b6 9} The statutory provision under which CBS seeks reimbursement of the motor vehicle fuel tax is R.C. 5735.142, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cAny person who uses any motor fuel, on which the tax imposed by sections 5735.05, 5735.25, and 5735.29 of the Revised Code has been paid, for the purpose of operating a transit bus shall be reimbursed in the amount of the tax paid on motor fuel used by public transportation systems providing transit or paratransit service on a regular and continuing basis within the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">{\u00b6 11} The term \u201ctransit bus\u201d used in R.C. 5735.142 is defined in R.C. 5735.01(Q), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cAs used in this chapter:</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">{\u00b6 1.3} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(Q) \u2018Transit bus\u2019 means a motor vehicle having a seating capacity of more than ten persons which is <em>operated </em>for public transit or paratransit service on a regular and continuing basis within the state <em>by or for </em>a county [or] <em>a municipal corporation * </em>* (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">{\u00b6 15} Thus, for the purposes of this case, R.C. 5735.01(Q) sets forth three requirements that a motor vehicle must meet in order to be a \u201ctransit bus,\u201d therefore entitling its owner to fuel tax reimbursement:</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">{\u00b6 16} 1. Have \u201ca seating capacity of more than ten persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">{\u00b6 17} 2. Be \u201coperated for public transit * * * on a regular and continuing basis within the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-13\">{\u00b6 18} 3. Be operated <em>\u201cby or for </em>* * * a municipal corporation * * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b573-14\">{\u00b6 19} The controversy in this case centers on requirement three. CBS contends that it meets this criterion because its buses are operated \u201cfor the benefit of\u2019 the city of Kent. Citing dictionaries, CBS asserts that \u201cfor\u201d in R.C. 5735.01(Q) requires only the bestowing of a benefit upon Kent and does not require the bus service to be under the control of a municipality or provided pursuant to a contract.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b574-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Amer Cunningham Co., L.P.A., Andrew R. Duff and Thomas R. Houlihan, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Auq\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, and Richard C. Farrin, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b574-3\">{\u00b6 20} The Tax Commissioner contends that CBS is not properly defining \u201cfor\u201d when asserting that the buses are operated \u201cby or for\u201d Kent.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">{\u00b6 21} The words \u201cby\u201d and \u201cfor\u201d as used in R.C. 5735.01(Q) are not defined in the statute. R.C. 1.42 provides, \u201cWords and phrases shall be read in context and construed according to the rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d Furthermore, \u201c[t]o determine the common, everyday meaning of a word, we have consistently used dictionary definitions.\u201d <em>State v. Wells </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 32, 34, 740 N.E.2d 1097. When we look at the dictionary definitions of the word \u201cby,\u201d the most appropriate in the context of R.C. 5735.01(Q) is \u201cthrough the means or instrumentality of.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1993) 307. Likewise, the first appropriate definition for the word \u201cfor\u201d is \u201cin behalf of.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1993) 886. Thus, to be \u201ctransit buses\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 5735.01(Q), CBS\u2019s buses must be operated either \u201cthrough the means or instrumentality\u201d of a municipal corporation (Kent) or \u201cin behalf of\u2019 a municipal corporation (Kent).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">{\u00b6 22} The facts in this case fail to support CBS\u2019s contention that the buses were operated either \u201cthrough the means or instrumentality of\u2019 Kent, or \u201cin behalf of\u2019 that city. The buses are operated \u201cby\u201d KSU, not Kent. While the buses may have benefited some of Kent\u2019s residents, there are no facts to show that Kent, as a corporate entity, had any involvement in the operation of the buses or that the buses were operated for its benefit. Mere use of streets and bus stops located in the city is not evidence that the buses are being operated by or for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">{\u00b6 23} Therefore, we find the decisions of the BTA to be reasonable and lawful, and we affirm them.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Decisions affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b574-8\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
