XVIII:</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">{\u00b6 2} \u201c(1) Are the requirements of <em>Linko v. Indemnity Ins. Co. </em>[2000], 90 Ohio St.3d [445, 739 N.E.2d 338], relative to an offer of UM/UIM coverage, applicable to a policy of insurance written after enactment of [1997] HB 261 and before [2001] SB 97?</p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">{\u00b6 3} \u201c(2) If the <em>Linko </em>requirements are applicable, does, under [1997] HB 261, a signed rejection act as an effective declination of UM/UIM coverage, where there is no other evidence, oral or documentary, of an offer of coverage?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-13\">{\u00b6 4} We answer certified question No. 1 in the affirmative and certified question No. 2 in the negative.</p>\n<judges id=\"b270-14\">Douglas, Resnick, F.E.

Indemn. Ins. Co. </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 445, 739 N.E.2d 338, are applicable to an insurance policy written after the enactment of 1997 H.B. 261 and before 2001 S.B. 97. As a preliminary matter, I note that although I dissented in part in <em>Linko, </em>I acknowledge its holding as controlling precedent for insurance policies issued prior to the enactment of H.B. 261. Nevertheless, R.C. 3937.18, as amended by H.B. 261, sets forth new requirements for a valid offer and rejection of UM/UIM motorist coverage. Accordingly, we are not bound by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number><em>Linko </em>in determining whether extrastatutory requirements should be imposed on insurers after the effective date of H.B. 261.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b271-10\">Elk &amp; Elk Co., L.P.A., David J. Elk and Todd 0. Rosenberg, for petitioners Sherrie L. Kemper et al.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AJS\">Gallagher, Sharp, Fulton &amp; Norman, Alton L. Stephens, James T. Tyminski Jr. and D. John Travis, for respondent Michigan Millers Mut. Ins. Co.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AyL\">Gallagher, Gams, Pryor, Tallan <em>&amp; </em>Littrell, L.L.P., and James R. Gallagher, for amicus curiae Ohio Association of Civil Trial Attorneys.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ALY\">Wiles, Boyle, Burkholder &amp; Bringardner Co., L.P.A., Michael L. Close and Samuel M. Pipino, for amicus curiae American International Companies.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">{\u00b6 6} By its holding today, the majority requires insurers to \u201cinform the insured of the availability of UM/UIM coverage, set forth the premium for UM/UIM coverage, include a brief description of the coverage, and expressly state the UM/UIM coverage limits in its offer\u201d even after the adoption of H.B. 261. <em>Linko, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 447-448, 739 N.E.2d 338. The majority not only imposes these requirements without any statutory basis or legal analysis, but it also ignores the fact that R.C. 3937.18, as amended by H.B. 261, unlike the former statute, speaks directly to the requirements that are necessary for a valid offer and rejection of UM/UIM coverage. In view of these amendments and the absence of any statutory support to impose the <em>Linko </em>requirements, I would conclude that such requirements are inapplicable to insurance policies written after the effective date of H.B. 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">{\u00b6 7} Because I would answer certified question No. 1 in the negative, I would conclude that question No. 2 is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">{\u00b6 8} For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b271-9\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
