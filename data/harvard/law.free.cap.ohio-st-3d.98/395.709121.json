USX Corporation (\u201cU.S. Steel\u201d). Each of these workers claimed that he was diagnosed with the occupational diseases asbestosis and asbestos-related pleural disease, and each worker filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim. The district hearing officer of the Industrial Commission denied the claims, the commission\u2019s staff hearing officer affirmed the district hearing officer\u2019s orders and denied the claims, and the commission refused the claimants\u2019 further appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-14\">{\u00b6 2} On January 4, 2002, Carter and McDonaldson filed in the Lorain County Court of Common Pleas a joint notice of appeal from the commission\u2019s orders as well as a complaint for a judgment declaring that they are entitled to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation fund for asbestosis and asbestos-related pleural disease. On February 26, 2002, Wilson, Reinoehl, and Mustard filed a comparable joint notice of appeal and complaint in the common pleas court. On March 7, 2002, McLendon, William, and Makuch filed a similar joint notice of appeal and complaint in the common pleas court. The notices of appeal stated the names of the claimants and their employer, the numbers of their claims, the dates of the commission orders appealed from, and the fact that the claimants were appealing therefrom. U.S. Steel moved to dismiss the appeals, claiming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>that because the claimants\u2019 notices had been filed jointly, they failed to comply with R.C. 4123.512. In April and May 2002, appellee, Judge Edward M. Zaleski of the common pleas court, denied the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">{\u00b6 3} U.S. Steel subsequently filed complaints in the Court of Appeals for Lorain County for writs of prohibition to prevent Judge Zaleski from exercising any further jurisdiction over the claimants\u2019 appeals and to dismiss the cases with prejudice. Judge Zaleski filed Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motions to dismiss the complaints for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. In July and August 2002, the court of appeals granted Judge Zaleski\u2019s motions and dismissed the complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">{\u00b6 4} In its appeals as of right, U.S. Steel -asserts that the court of appeals erred in dismissing its prohibition actions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Request for Oral Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">{\u00b6 5} U.S. Steel requests oral argument for these appeals pursuant to S.Ct. Prac.R. IX(2). \u201cAmong the factors we consider in determining whether to grant oral argument in appeals in which oral argument is not required is whether the case involves a matter of great public importance, complex issues of law or fact, a substantial constitutional issue or a conflict between courts of appeals.\u201d <em>Clark v. Connor </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 309, 311, 695 N.E.2d 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">{\u00b6 6} Oral argument is not warranted here. Although the underlying issue of whether R.C. 4123.512 prohibits joint notices of appeal may be significant, the court of appeals did not expressly determine that issue, nor need we; our review is instead restricted to whether extraordinary relief in prohibition is warranted. The parties\u2019 briefs are sufficient to resolve this limited issue. No issues of legal or factual complexity are involved, no constitutional issue is implicated, and no conflict between courts of appeals is claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">{\u00b6 7} Therefore, we deny U.S. Steel\u2019s request for oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">Prohibition</p>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">{\u00b6 8} The dismissals of the prohibition complaints were warranted if, after all factual allegations of the complaints were presumed true and all reasonable inferences were made in U.S. Steel\u2019s favor, it appeared beyond doubt that U.S. Steel could prove no set of facts warranting the requested extraordinary relief in prohibition. <em>State ex rel. Suburban Constr. Co. v. Skok </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 645, 646, 710 N.E.2d 710. \u201cIn the absence of a patent and unambiguous lack of jurisdiction, a court having general subject-matter jurisdiction can determine its own jurisdiction, and a party challenging that jurisdiction has an adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>remedy by appeal.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Nalls v. Russo, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 410, 2002-Ohio-4907, 775 N.E.2d 522, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">{\u00b6 9} U.S. Steel claims that Judge Zaleski patently and unambiguously lacked jurisdiction over the appeals because the notices of appeal did not comply with R.C. 4123.512. More specifically, U.S. Steel asserts that R.C. 4123.512 prohibits joint notices of appeal by multiple claimants from multiple common pleas court decisions. Based on the following, U.S. Steel\u2019s prohibition claim is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">{\u00b6 10} Under R.C. 4123.512(A), \u201c[t]he claimant or the employer may appeal an order of the industrial commission made under division (E) of section 4123.511 of the Revised Code in any injury or occupational disease case, other than a decision as to the extent of disability to the court of common pleas of the county in which the injury was inflicted * * In these appeals, R.C. 4123.512(B) requires the following contents for the notice of appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe notice of appeal shall state the names of the claimant and the employer, the number of the claim, the date of the order appealed from, and the fact that the appellant appeals therefrom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">{\u00b6 12} Notwithstanding U.S. Steel\u2019s claims to the contrary, a combined or joint notice of appeal by multiple claimants pursuant to R.C. 4123.512 does not patently and unambiguously divest a common pleas court of jurisdiction over the appeal. In construing the statute, our paramount concern is legislative intent, and words and phrases must be read in context. <em>State ex rel. Moss v. Ohio State Hwy. Patrol Retirement Sys., </em>97 Ohio St.3d 198, 2002-Ohio-5806, 777 N.E.2d 259, \u00b6 20-21. No language in R.C. 4123.512 expressly precludes joint appeals or combined notices of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">{\u00b6 13} Moreover, U.S. Steel\u2019s assertion that the language of R.C. 4123.512 referring to <em>the </em>claimant and <em>the </em>order appealed from prohibits claimants from filing a joint notice of appeal ignores applicable rules of statutory interpretation. R.C. 1.43(A) provides that \u201c[t]he singular includes the plural, and the plural includes the singular.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">{\u00b6 14} In <em>Republic Steel Corp. v. Quinn </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 57, 58-59, 12 OBR 49, 465 N.E.2d 413, we relied on R.C. 1.43(A) to reject a comparable argument in a case in which an employer sought a writ of prohibition to prevent a common pleas court from considering a combined appeal by a single claimant from two separate workers\u2019 compensation decisions by the Industrial Commission:</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cAppellant contends that R.C. 4123.519[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] does not authorize two or more decisions of the commission to be appealed to the court of common pleas in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>a single action. Instead, appellant contends that Gordon was required to institute a separate appeal from each claim addressed by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cIn support of this contention, appellant relies upon the language of R.C. 4123.519 providing for an appeal of \u2018a decision\u2019 of the commission within sixty days of having received the \u2018decision,\u2019 as it pertains to a \u2018claim\u2019 made due to the infliction of an \u2018injury.\u2019 Since Gordon initiated a single appeal involving two decisions of the commission, appellant argues that R.C. 4123.519 was not adhered to and that, as such, [the court of common pleas] is wholly without jurisdiction to consider the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cWe are unpersuaded by appellant\u2019s argument which completely overlooks the provisions of R.C. 1.43(A) wherein the General Assembly has stated, with respect to statutory construction, that \u2018[t]he singular includes the plural, and the plural includes the singular.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c* * * [T]he application of R.C. 1.43(A) is neither prohibited by the provisions of R.C. 4123.519, nor does it conflict with related provisions contained in R.C. Chapter 4123, as long as any and all decisions sought to be appealed are instituted within the sixty-day limitation period prescribed by R.C. 4123.519. In the subject cause, each decision was appealed within the sixty-day limitation period. Accordingly, [the common pleas court] is not exercising jurisdiction unauthorized by law and, therefore, the court of appeals properly denied the writ [of prohibition].\u201d See, also, <em>Akers v. Johnson Controls, Inc. </em>(June 27, 1997), Highland App. No. 96CA900, 1997 WL 360569, which reached a similar conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">{\u00b6 20} Furthermore, we have expressly noted that the \u201cjurisdictional requirements of R.C. [4123.512] are satisfied by <em>the filing of a timely notice of appeal which is in substantial compliance with the dictates of that statute.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Fisher v. Mayfield </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 8, 30 OBR 16, 505 N.E.2d 975, paragraph one of the syllabus, construing former R.C. 4123.519. \u201cSubstantial compliance for jurisdictional purposes occurs when a timely notice of appeal filed pursuant to R.C. [4123.512] includes sufficient information, in intelligible form, to place on notice all parties to a proceeding that an appeal has been filed from an identifiable final order which has determined the parties\u2019 substantive rights and liabilities.\u201d Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">{\u00b6 21} The claimants\u2019 joint notices contained all of the information required by R.C. 4123.512(B), notifying all parties, including U.S. Steel, of the appeals and orders being appealed. See, e.g., <em>Fisher </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>Holmes v. Pipeline Dev. Co. </em>(Feb. 17, 2000), Cuyahoga App. No. 76835, 2000 WL 193254. U.S. Steel does not assert that the combined notices misled or prejudiced them in preparing a defense. In fact, U.S. Steel readily concedes that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>notices of appeal \u201ccontain sufficient information, without misstatement or technical error, to put all parties on notice of the workers\u2019 compensation claims being appealed.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b507-10\">Rademaker, Matty, McClelland &amp; Greve, Robert C. McClelland and Jennifer L. Whitt; and Roberta K. Spurgeon, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AyO\">Gregory A. White, Lorain County Prosecuting Attorney, and M. Robert Flanagan, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">{\u00b6 22} Notably, U.S. Steel cites no appellate case holding that R.C. 4123.512 requires an individual notice of appeal for each claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">{\u00b6 23} Therefore, Judge Zaleski does not patently and unambiguously lack jurisdiction over the claimants\u2019 appeal. In so holding, we need not expressly rule on U.S. Steel\u2019s jurisdictional claims because our review is limited to determining whether Judge Zaleski <em>patently and unambiguously </em>lacks jurisdiction. <em>State ex rel. Shimko v. McMonagle </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 426, 431, 751 N.E.2d 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">{\u00b6 24} Based on the foregoing, the court of appeals properly dismissed U.S. Steel\u2019s prohibition actions. U.S. Steel has adequate legal remedies by appeal to raise its jurisdictional claims. Accordingly, we affirm the judgments of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Judgments affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b507-9\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook, Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Connor, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-13\">. We grant U.S. Steel\u2019s motion to consolidate these cases because they involve the same background facts and they raise identical legal issues. See <em>State ex rel. Lemmon v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 186, 187, 677 N.E.2d 347, fn. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b505-13\">.
