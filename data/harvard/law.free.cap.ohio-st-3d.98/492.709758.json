Appellant\u2019s motion for summary reversal is granted. This cause is remanded to the trial court to consider whether the insurer was prejudiced under <em>Ferrando v. Auto-Owners Mut. Ins.

Auto-Owners Mut. Ins. Co., </em>98 Ohio St.3d 186, 2002-Ohio-7217, 781 N.E.2d 927. I dissented from paragraph two of the <em>Ferrando </em>syllabus, in which the court merely presumed the prejudicial effect of an insured\u2019s breach of a subrogation provision in an insurance policy. Id. at \u00b6 105. I believe that an insured\u2019s breach of a subrogation-related provision of an insurance policy is per se prejudicial. There is no need for the additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>time and expense of a factual inquiry into the issue. This is particularly so in a <em>Scott-Pontzer </em>case, in which a party may be asserting an extremely stale claim or one in which the possibility of collection from the tortfeasor never existed and therefore the usual issues of the insurer\u2019s refusal to defend or participate never arose. See <em>Scott-Pontzer v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 660, 710 N.E.2d 1116.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b601-7\">Freund, Freeze &amp; Arnold, Stephen C. Findley, Shaun A. Roberts and Richard C. Brooks Jr., for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AkmG\">Maney &amp; Brookes and Mark C. Brookes, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Aq1\">Boyk &amp; Crossmock, L.L.C., and Steven L. Crossmock, urging reversal for amicus curiae Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">{\u00b6 3} As I explained in <em>Ferrando, </em>the rights of the insurer are actually prejudiced by the breach of a consent-to-settle or subrogation provision of an insurance policy. Since the tortfeasor has been released from further liability, it is my opinion that any inquiry is a useless exercise that merely prolongs the tortuous routes created by <em>Scott-Pontzer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">{\u00b6 4} Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
