Cox of Cleveland, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0002250, to represent him for claims arising out of an automobile accident. In 1997, after the client rejected a settlement offer by the defendant\u2019s insurance company, respondent filed a complaint on behalf of the client in the Cleveland Municipal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">{\u00b6 2} In 1998, following the filing of a motion for change of venue by the defendant in the municipal court case, respondent gave the file to another attorney to take over the case. The new attorney sent a letter to the client advising him that the attorney would be assisting respondent in handling the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">{\u00b6 3} In January 1999, the client notified respondent that he was discharging him as his attorney because of respondent\u2019s delay in resolving his claim. In February 1999, the client filed a grievance against respondent with relator, Cleveland Bar Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-14\">{\u00b6 4} In February 2000, the new attorney dismissed the municipal court case without prejudice and returned the client\u2019s file to respondent. Respondent did not notify the client about the dismissal, although he made several unsuccessful attempts to contact the client to discuss the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-15\">{\u00b6 5} Relator investigated the client\u2019s grievance and after an inquiry by relator\u2019s grievance committee, respondent returned the file to the client in March 2001. When relator subsequently learned of the dismissal of the municipal court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>case, a member of relator\u2019s grievance committee asked respondent whether he knew the attorney who had dismissed it. Respondent told the committee member that he did not know the attorney. The committee member thereafter called respondent back and confronted him with a copy of the dismissal entry with the attorney\u2019s name on it. Respondent then admitted that he knew the attorney and that the attorney occasionally handled cases for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">{\u00b6 6} On December 10, 2001, relator filed a complaint charging respondent with having violated several Disciplinary Rules. A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline of the Supreme Court (\u201cboard\u201d) heard the matter on the parties\u2019 pleadings, testimony, and exhibits. The panel found the facts as previously set forth and concluded that respondent had violated DR 1-102(A)(4) (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation) by initially lying to relator about knowing the attorney who had dismissed the client\u2019s municipal court case and by not specifically notifying his client about the dismissal. In mitigation, the panel found that respondent had no prior disciplinary record in 23 years of practice and that he had no selfish motive in this matter. The panel recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for six months, with the entire suspension stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">{\u00b6 7} The board adopted the findings of the panel but recommended that respondent be publicly reprimanded \u201cbased on the entire record and the limited harm suffered.\u201d The board further recommended that the costs of the proceeding be taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">{\u00b6 8} We adopt the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the board. Although an actual suspension from the practice of law is the general sanction when an attorney has violated DR 1-102(A)(4), a lesser sanction is appropriate \u201cwhen the misconduct is an isolated incident and not a course of conduct in an otherwise unblemished legal career.\u201d <em>Toledo Bar Assn. v. Kramer </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 321, 323, 731 N.E.2d 643. Given the isolated nature of respondent\u2019s misconduct and the limited harm attributable to the misconduct, a public reprimand is appropriate. Cf., e.g., <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Lange </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 43, 564 N.E.2d 1069. Respondent is hereby publicly reprimanded. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b529-9\">Resnick, F.E.
