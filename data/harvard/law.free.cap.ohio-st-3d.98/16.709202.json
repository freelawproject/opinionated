Smith, was hurt on the job in 1977. In May 1992, he moved appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio for permanent total disability compensation (\u201cPTD\u201d). A previous award of temporary total disability compensation (\u201cTTD\u201d) continued until it was terminated on August 23, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">{\u00b6 2} On September 9, 1993, claimant contacted appellee Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation and informed the bureau that it had erroneously paid him TTD for several periods between January and August 1993 when he had been attempting to return to gainful employment. The next day, he forwarded paycheck stubs and offered to repay any overpayment. For reasons unknown, the bureau did nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">{\u00b6 3} The commission finally ruled on claimant\u2019s PTD application on August 23, 1995. During the two-year period between termination of TTD and his PTD hearing, claimant intermittently attempted to work. Evidence of these attempts were contained several places in the commission\u2019s claim file. A vocational evaluation for the commission referred to short-term employment in 1993 and as recently as February 1994. That report also referred to \u201cnumerous involuntary job terminations,\u201d further demonstrating attempts at work. A March 27, 1995 report from Dr. John R. Scharf also recorded that claimant \u201capparently works to some degree as a nurse\u2019s aid[e] and he is a certified nurse\u2019s aid[e] in the nursing homes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>{\u00b6 4} On August 23, 1995, the commission awarded PTD. A synopsis of facts prepared for the adjudicator\u2019s review had the handwritten notation \u201c13 jobs\u2014 1992.\u201d Despite the evidence before it as to claimant\u2019s prior job history, the commission nevertheless awarded PTD retroactively to August 24, 1993 \u2014 covering periods in which it knew or should have known that claimant had worked. There is no evidence of any employment after these benefits were awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">{\u00b6 5} In 1999, comparison of bureau and employment services records indicated that claimant had concurrently received total disability compensation and wages for intermittent periods between 1992 and 1995. The bureau eventually found evidence of 15 jobs that claimant had performed during this time. The bureau moved for a declaration of overpayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">{\u00b6 6} The commission complied with the bureau\u2019s request, ruling that all TTD and PTD paid after June 1, 1992, was overpaid. The commission declared that fraud had been committed and terminated further PTD. In a mandamus action brought by the claimant, the Court of Appeals for Franklin County found no abuse of discretion by the commission. Claimant has appealed here as a matter of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">{\u00b6 7} At issue is claimant\u2019s receipt of total disability compensation \u2014 temporary and permanent \u2014 over periods of employment. While this is not a new topic for us, nothing about this controversy is typical.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">{\u00b6 8} Previous cases have always featured claimants who were awarded total disability compensation, secured employment thereafter, and got caught. This claimant\u2019s receipt of TTD saw factors one and two, but not three. This claimant did not get caught working and drawing compensation. Instead, <em>he </em>notified the bureau that it had improperly paid him TTD over a period that he had previously worked and offered to repay it. And as to PTD, the usual sequence was completely inapplicable. Claimant never worked after PTD was awarded. Concurrent payment occurred because the commission backdated the award over periods that claimant worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">{\u00b6 9} There is considerable finger-pointing in this litigation. Try as they might, however, to deflect responsibility, the commission and bureau erred. They knew that claimant had worked sporadically between 1992 and 1995. Claimant never hid this. He volunteered this information to the bureau years earlier, and the file was replete with evidence of it. Despite this, appellees awarded PTD over periods of employment and ignored the TTD overpayment that claimant had tried to repay years before.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">{\u00b6 10} Appellees stress that they knew of only some of claimant\u2019s jobs, implying that if they had known them all, the outcome would have been different. This argument is hollow. Some was enough. For our purposes, it matters not how many jobs claimant held over the relevant period. That he had <em>any </em>made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>total disability compensation improper over the corresponding period and should have raised questions as to the validity of the underlying medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">{\u00b6 11} The implication that claimant deliberately hid information is not a fair one. First, and again, there was ample evidence in the file to advise the commission. Second, we do not know that claimant did not reveal this information. The PTD statement of facts used by the adjudicating hearing officer has the' handwritten notation \u201cthirteen jobs \u2014 1992.\u201d We know that claimant did not have 13 jobs in 1992, but that he did have approximately 13 jobs <em>since </em>1992. This suggests that claimant may have brought this information to the hearing officer\u2019s attention. Finally, claimant was unrepresented by counsel when PTD was awarded. If claimant did not volunteer this information, it may have been because claimant did not know that the commission had the ability to award compensation retroactively. Claimant may have thought that past work activity was irrelevant to his receipt of prospective benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">{\u00b6 12} In any event, claimant does not dispute the impropriety of concurrently receiving wages and disability benefits, nor is he endeavoring to keep that money. Rather, he contests (1) the declaration of fraud, (2) termination of further PTD, and (3) the declaration that <em>all </em>compensation for total disability was overpaid. Preliminary to all of this, of course, is an exploration of the commission\u2019s authority to revisit at all the issue of entitlement to compensation \u2014 i.e., whether continuing jurisdiction was properly invoked. For the reasons to follow, we find that continuing jurisdiction was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">{\u00b6 13} The commission\u2019s continuing jurisdiction under R.C. 4123.52 is not unlimited. It must be precipitated by one of the following: (1) new and changed circumstances <em>(State ex rel. Cuyahoga Hts. Bd. of Edn. v. Johnston </em>[1979], 58 Ohio St.2d 132, 12 O.O.3d 128, 388 N.E.2d 1383), (2) clerical error <em>(State ex rel. Weimer v. Indus. Comm. </em>[1980], 62 Ohio St.2d 159, 16 O.O.3d 174, 404 N.E.2d 149), (3) error by an inferior tribunal <em>(State ex rel. Manns v. Indus. Comm. </em>[1988], 39 Ohio St.3d 188, 529 N.E.2d 1379), (4) fraud <em>(State ex rel. Kilgore v. Indus. Comm. </em>[1930], 123 Ohio St. 164, 174 N.E. 345), or (5) clear mistake of law <em>(State ex rel. B &amp; C Machine Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>[1992], 65 Ohio St.3d 538, 605 N.E.2d 372).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">{\u00b6 14} In our case, a clear mistake of law was indeed present. Receipt of both wages and total disability compensation for the same period is contrary to law. Even where a clear mistake exists, however, continuing jurisdiction must still be exercised within a reasonable time. <em>State ex rel. Gordon v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 469, 588 N.E.2d 852. Reasonableness, in turn, must be judged case by case. Here, six years passed between claimant\u2019s notification to the bureau of an overpayment of TTD and action by the commission or bureau. Four years passed between the granting of PTD and the commission\u2019s renewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>interest in claimant\u2019s eligibility. Given this evidence in the file before the PTD hearing and contemporaneous with receipt of TTD, continuing jurisdiction cannot be considered to have been timely. <em>Gordon </em>supports this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">{\u00b6 15} Gordon also received concurrent wages and TTD. For over three years, the bureau and commission proposed various amounts of overpayment. On December 27,1984, a district hearing officer established the amount at $4,455. The bureau did not appeal, and claimant repaid the amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">{\u00b6 16} In May 1985, the bureau contacted the district hearing officer, questioning his calculation. The district hearing officer, in turn, reset the matter for hearing. A second district hearing officer then declared the matter res judicata. Again, the bureau did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">{\u00b6 17} In August 1988, the bureau moved the commission to exercise its continuing jurisdiction and vacate the district hearing officer\u2019s order. The commission did so and increased the declared amount of overpayment, claiming that even legitimately paid installments of compensation had been paid in the wrong amount. Claimant challenged the determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">{\u00b6 18} The court of appeals held that the commission had abused its discretion by exercising continuing jurisdiction in an untimely manner. We agreed, finding that the four-year delay between the initial district hearing officer and the bureau\u2019s motion to vacate was not reasonable:</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cThree dates are key here: (1) December 27, 1984 \u2014 the date of the district hearing officer\u2019s overpayment calculation; (2) May 22, 1987 \u2014 the date on which another district hearing officer found the overpayment question to be <em>res judicata; </em>and (3) August 30,1988 \u2014 the date of the bureau\u2019s motion to vacate. As to the first date, we reiterate that when the district hearing officer issued his December 1984 order, other evidence suggested that the district hearing officer\u2019s figure was wrong. The bureau, however, did not appeal the district hearing officer\u2019s order. Moreover, in the two and one-half years between that order and the May 22, 1987 follow-up, the commission made no effort to exercise its continuing jurisdiction. !</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cSimilarly, when a different district hearing officer found the overpayment issue to be <em>res judicata </em>in 1987, the commission and bureau had three additional overpayment calculations before it, including its <em>own </em>tentative <em>order </em>setting the overpayment at $6,051.94. Again, the bureau did not appeal. Again, no immediate effort to exercise continuing jurisdiction was made. Instead, the bureau waited over 15 months before acting.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cIn summary, the bureau had <em>two </em>opportunities to appeal district hearing officer orders addressing the overpayment question. Ignoring these opportunities, the commission waited approximately four years \u2014 until claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>had repaid the $4,455 that the unappealed district hearing officer\u2019s 1984 order had stated that she owed \u2014 to exercise continuing jurisdiction. Under these circumstances, the commission did not exercise its authority within a reasonable time.\u201d Id., 63 Ohio St.3d at 472-473, 588 N.E.2d at 852.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b128-8\">Altick &amp; Corwin Co., L.P.A., Deborah J. Adler and John A. Cervay, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Alr\">Betty D. Montgomery, Attorney General, and Gerald H. Waterman, Assistant Attorney General, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">{\u00b6 22} The present case, like <em>Gordon, </em>covered a considerable span of time. Similarly, in each case, the commission and bureau had ample opportunity to have acted sooner, but did not. In fact, had the evidence been more closely reviewed, the situation could have been avoided entirely. For these reasons, we find that continuing jurisdiction was not exercised within a reasonable time and was therefore improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">{\u00b623} Accordingly, we find that the commission abused its discretion in revisiting claimant\u2019s PTD entitlement, terminating his PTD award, and declaring all compensation after June 1, 1992, to be overpaid as the result of fraud. The judgment of the court of appeals is hereby reversed. We hereby order the commission to vacate its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Judgment reversed and writ granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b128-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
