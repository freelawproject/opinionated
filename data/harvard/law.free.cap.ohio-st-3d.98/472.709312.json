On February 23, 1998, a district hearing officer for appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio ruled on whether to continue temporary total disability compensation (\u201cTTC\u201d). The district hearing officer found that claimant had reached maximum medical improvement and terminated TTC as of November 13, 1997, based on a report prepared by Dr. Carl D. Metz on that date. Claimant did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-13\">{\u00b6 2} In January 1999, the commission \u2014 pursuant to the newly released decision in <em>State ex rel. Russell v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 516, 696 N.E.2d 1069 \u2014 sua sponte modified its February 1998 order, changing the date of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>termination from the date of Dr. Metz\u2019s letter to the date of the district hearing officer\u2019s hearing. Again, claimant did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">{\u00b6 3} Four months later, claimant\u2019s newly retained legal counsel moved to recommence TTC as of its termination date, claiming that Dr. Metz had not signed his report. Dr. Metz\u2019s office, upon request, promptly faxed a signed copy of the report to the commission, apologizing for the oversight. A district hearing officer then denied claimant\u2019s motion:</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cClaimant did not raise the issue of defective medical reports due to lack of signature at the time of the 02/23/1998 maximum medical improvement determination. The issue is now before the District Hearing Officer upon the filing of the motion 05/21/1999. At Hearing 12/22/1999, the file contains the 11/13/1997 medical report with the alleged defect cured; i.e., a copy of the report with the doctor\u2019s signature is contained in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe issue has become moot. There is no basis to disturb the 02/23/1998 finding of the District Hearing Officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">{\u00b6 6} That order was administratively affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">{\u00b6 7} The Court of Appeals for Franklin County denied claimant\u2019s mandamus complaint, citing claimant\u2019s failure to appeal the two earlier orders and the fact that the defect in Dr. Metz\u2019s report had been remedied by the time claimant\u2019s motion was heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">{\u00b6 8} This cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">{\u00b6 9} A writ of mandamus will not issue where the relator has a plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. <em>State ex rel. Berger v. McMonagle </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 28, 6 OBR 50, 451 N.E.2d 225. Accordingly, the failure to pursue an administrative remedy bars a writ of mandamus. <em>State ex rel. Reeves v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 212, 559 N.E.2d 1311.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">{\u00b6 10} Claimant failed to appeal two termination orders that were based on Dr. Metz\u2019s unsigned report. Claimant responds that she failed to appeal because she was not represented by counsel at the time and thus is immunized against application of principles governing appealability and mandamus. This argument, of course, fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">{\u00b6 11} Claimant also challenges the commission\u2019s refusal to exercise continuing jurisdiction under R.C. 4123.52 to reopen the issue of TTC entitlement. We find however, that the commission did not abuse its discretion in determining that the prerequisites for invoking its continuing jurisdiction were not met. As the court of appeals pointed out, the lack of a signed copy of Dr. Metz\u2019s report in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>commission\u2019s record was remedied by the time claimant\u2019s motion was heard, negating the basis upon which claimant sought relief.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b582-9\">Bashein &amp; Bashein Co., L.P.A., Richard W. Bashein; Paul W. Flowers Co., L.P.A., and Paul W. Flowers, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AlHL\">Lee M. Smith &amp; Associates Co., L.P.A., Elizabeth P. Weeden and Lee M.
