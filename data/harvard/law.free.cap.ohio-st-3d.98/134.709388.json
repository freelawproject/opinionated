As a polisher, Robinson was required to use a large polishing wheel to strip off the outer layer of chrome from old car bumpers and then buff and polish the underlying nickel base before the bumpers were replated.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>Robinson was forced to quit his job in late 1996, after being diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the left maxillary sinus. He underwent radical maxillectomy followed by radiation and chemotherapy, but the cancer eventually metastasized, and Robinson died in January 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">{\u00b6 3} The decedent\u2019s wife, claimant-appellee Carrie Richardson, filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim for death benefits, alleging that the death of her husband resulted from workplace exposure to nickel and chrome dust. The claim was allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">{\u00b6 4} Richardson also filed an application for an additional award based on Supreme Bumpers\u2019 alleged violation of a specific safety requirement (\u201cVSSR\u201d). She claimed that her husband\u2019s death was due to Supreme Bumpers\u2019 failure to comply with Industrial Commission specific safety rules IC-5-10 and IC-5-11, which require employers to furnish adequate respiratory equipment or to utilize other equally effective methods to control an employee\u2019s exposure to harmful air contaminants.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">{\u00b6 5} On February 5, 2000, a staff hearing officer (\u201cSHO\u201d) for appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio determined that \u201cthe decedent\u2019s death was the result of a failure to supply an appropriate respiratory device or otherwise control air contaminants as required by IC-5-10.05(A) and IC-5-11.03.\u201d The SHO made the following findings: (1) that Robinson \u201cwas exposed to \u2018air contaminants,\u2019 as that term is defined in IC-5-11.02(A),\u201d (2) that Robinson \u201cwas exposed to injurious concentrations of chrome and nickel dust,\u201d (3) that the application of IC-5-11 is not limited \u201cto the few substances listed in the Appendix,\u201d i.e., Appendix I, Threshold Limit Values Table, (4) that although \u201c[t]he employer did make available paper dust masks, * * * this \u2018respiratory equipment\u2019 was not sufficient or appropriate for the chrome and nickel dust the [decedent] was for years exposed to,\u201d and (5) that the various other methods allegedly utilized by the employer, such as a general ventilation system, local exhaust hoods on the polishing machines, and the application of a liquid glue to the buffing wheel, were ineffective in controlling exposure to the nickel and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>chrome dust that was generated in its polishing department. Accordingly, the SHO ordered that \u201can additional award of compensation be granted to the spouse-claimant in an amount equal to 15 percent of the maximum weekly rate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">{\u00b6 6} After the Industrial Commission denied reconsideration, Supreme Bumpers filed an original action with the Franklin County Court of Appeals requesting a writ of mandamus. The matter was referred to a magistrate, who recommended that the appellate court issue a writ ordering the commission to vacate its VSSR award. According to the magistrate, \u201cthere is no evidence in the record to establish that relator either knew that chrome and nickel [were] \u2018toxic,\u2019 or that relator knew that there was an injurious concentration of nickel and chrome dust present in the workplace in excess of the limits which would not normally result in injury to an employee. * * * Furthermore, there is absolutely no evidence in the record establishing what the air quality was in the factory prior to the 1990\u2019s. As such, there is no evidence to support a finding that relator knew it was exposing its employees to injurious concentrations of nickel and chrome dust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">{\u00b6 7} In concluding that the commission abused its discretion in ordering an additional award, the magistrate found it necessary to keep \u201cin mind that a VSSR is in the nature of a penalty to the employer subject to the rule of strict construction with all reasonable doubts concerning the interpretation of the safety standard to be construed against the applicability of the standard to the employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">{\u00b6 8} On objection to the magistrate\u2019s decision, the court of appeals found it necessary to lay out substantial portions of the evidence upon which the commission relied \u201c[i]n addition to the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact.\u201d In doing so, the court of appeals concluded that there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the commission\u2019s order finding a VSSR, particularly with regard to the employer\u2019s knowledge. Accordingly, the court sustained Richardson\u2019s objection to the magistrate\u2019s decision and denied Supreme Bumpers\u2019 request for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">{\u00b6 9} The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">{\u00b6 10} There is no dispute that Robinson contracted an occupational disease and died as a result of being exposed to nickel and chrome dust in the course of and arising from his employment with Supreme Bumpers. The sole question for our review is whether the commission abused its discretion in finding that Supreme Bumpers failed to control that exposure as required by IC-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">{\u00b6 11} As relevant here, IC-5, as effective January 1,1967, provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cIC-5-10</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cPERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>{\u00b6 14} \u201cIC-5-10.01 SCOPE</p>\n<p id=\"AxB\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cThe requirements of this part of the code relate to the personal protective equipment listed immediately below as required for employees on operations described in IC-5-10, in which there is a known hazard, recognized as injurious to the health or safety of the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(A) Eye protection</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(B) Face shields</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(C) Respirators and masks</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(D) Helmets and hoods</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(E) Gloves, Aprons and sleeves:</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(1) Rubber or plastic, designed to afford protection from harmful chemicals,</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c(2) Electrician\u2019s rubber gloves.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b245-13\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cIC-5-10.05 RESPIRATORY EQUIPMENT</p>\n<p id=\"A0X\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(A) RESPONSIBILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cThe employer shall furnish respiratory equipment which has been approved by the U.S. Bureau of Mines [footnote omitted], where there are air contaminants, as defined in IC-5-11 of this code.

See <em>State ex rel. Ohio Mushroom Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 47 Ohio St.3d 59, 547 N.E.2d 973; <em>State ex rel. Haines v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St.2d 15, 58 O.O.2d 70, 278 N.E.2d 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-15\">{\u00b6 47} Workers\u2019 compensation statutes are generally construed in favor of awarding compensation to injured employees and the dependents of deceased employees. R.C. 4123.95. But because a VSSR award is in the nature of a penalty to the employer, we have found that specific safety requirements \u201cmust be strictly construed, and all reasonable doubts concerning the interpretation of the safety standard are to be construed against its applicability to the employer.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Burton v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 170, 172, 545 N.E.2d 1216. See, also, <em>State ex rel. Carder v. Indus. Comm. </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 165, 166-167, 761 N.E.2d 32. The application of the strict-construction rule cannot, however, justify an illogical result or one that is contrary to the clear intention of the code. <em>State ex rel. Maghie &amp; Savage, Inc. v. Nobel </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 328, 331, 691 N.E.2d 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-16\">{\u00b6 48} Supreme Bumpers initially claims that pursuant to IC-5-10 and IC-5-11, employers are not required to afford any protection against nickel and chrome <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>dust. In support, Supreme Bumpers relies on IC-5-11.01, which delimits the scope of IC-5-11. According to Supreme Bumpers, this provision \u201cdefines air contaminants as those <em>named </em>in \u2018this code\u2019 and * * * Appendix I does <em>not </em>list chromium or nickel dust as contaminants.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">{\u00b6 49} The flaw in this argument is immediately apparent. Appendix I lists approximately 70 potentially harmful substances to which the requirements of IC-5-11 apply. However, IC-5-11.01 contains an explicit disclaimer that certain appendices to the rule, including Appendix I, \u201care for information and guide purposes only and are not specific requirements of this code.\u201d Thus, IC-5-11.01 cannot be interpreted as limiting the scope of IC-5-11 to those substances listed in Appendix I.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">{\u00b6 50} Nevertheless, the argument continues, IC-5-11 still applies \u201conly to contaminants <em>named </em>in the Code. (IC-5-11.01). Neither nickel nor chrome dust [is] listed in Appendix I <em>or in any other portion of the Code. </em>As a result, they <em>are not </em>air contaminants for purposes of imputing liability to an employer under IC-5.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">{\u00b6 51} There is, of course, a certain inherent inconsistency in these two aspects of Supreme Bumpers\u2019 no-coverage argument. In arguing that nickel dust and chrome dust are excluded from the scope of the rule because they are not listed in Appendix I, Supreme Bumpers necessarily assumes that this appendix is where contaminants \u201cnamed in this code\u201d are intended to be cataloged. In other words, a contaminant must be listed in Appendix I to be considered a named contaminant for purposes of coverage under IC-5-11.01. But when faced with the disclaimer in IC-5-11.01, Supreme Bumpers then agrees that Appendix I \u201cis not a limitation upon the various air contaminants covered by IC-5-11.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">{\u00b6 52} In any event, we find that the commission reasonably interpreted its own rules in this case. IC-5-10 and IC-5-11 are clearly designed to protect Ohio employees against the known harmful effects of industrial air contaminants, including fibrosis-producing or toxic dusts. The commission attempted to enumerate contaminants known to be potentially injurious in Appendix I, but disclaimed any intent to make this an exhaustive list. It would be patently illogical for us to assume that the code\u2019s drafters intended Ohio employees to run the risk of being injured or killed by some fibrosis-producing or toxic dusts but not by others. There is certainly nothing to suggest that the authors meant to create a gap in which an employer, knowing full well that its employees are being exposed to harmful air contaminants, can nevertheless sit idly by, refuse to provide any form of protection, and yet rest comfortably under the supposed shelter given to unnamed substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">{\u00b6 53} In <em>Nobel, </em>we explained that \u201cthe commission \u2018has the discretion to interpret its own rules; however, where the application of those rules to a unique <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>factual situation gives rise to a patently illogical result, common sense should prevail.\u2019 \u201d Id., 81 Ohio St.3d at 331, 691 N.E.2d 277, quoting <em>State ex rel. Harris v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 152, 153, 12 OBR 223, 465 N.E.2d 1286. Surely we cannot insist that the commission interpret its own rules so as to <em>achieve </em>an illogical result.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">{\u00b6 54} Supreme Bumpers\u2019 second and primary claim is that \u201cthe magistrate properly concluded that the Industrial Commission abused its discretion in the absence of any evidence that Appellant knew of injurious concentrations of toxic [dusts].\u201d As did the court of appeals, we too find it necessary to set forth the evidence in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">{\u00b6 55} Larry Curl was employed at Supreme Bumpers, Inc., from April 1987 to February 1997. For approximately six years of that time, he worked as an inspector in the pohshing department where decedent Franklin Robinson worked. In his affidavit, Curl stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cDuring the time I worked in the pohshing department, the conditions were extremely dusty from the dust coming off the chrome bumpers at the pohshing machines. The ventilation units at the pohshing machines did not work effectively, and dust would escape all over the shop. The polishers would be covered, head to toe, with pohshing dust. The dust would get in the polishers\u2019 hair, on their clothes, and cover their faces.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cIn my opinion, * * * [t]he exhaust systems on the pohshing machines * * * were never effective in removing the bulk of the dust from the bumpers for any lasting period of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">{\u00b6 58} Willie Broughton was a coworker of decedent during the mid-1960s. In his affidavit, Broughton stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cThe company did not provide any safety training * * * [or] any type of respiratory masks to polishers during the time I was employed there. I recall seeing Franklin Robinson covered with dust off the pohshing wheel, from head to toe, on several occasions while I worked at the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">{\u00b6 60} Working as a pohsher at Supreme Bumpers, we were constantly exposed to the dust that was coming off the pohshing wheel. Our shifts lasted 8 to 10 hours and at the end of the shift there would be a considerable amount of dust all over the shop and on the floor that would have to be swept up. Dust from the pohshing process generally covered all the objects in the shop, including the polishers. The polishers would have dust all over their clothes, in their hair, in their ears and noses. I would have to blow my nose and dust would come out.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cThere were exhaust hoods on the pohshing machines but they were never effective in significantly reducing the amount of dust that would escape. They would often plug up. Even when they were working, the amount of dust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>was excessive and would still cover everything in the shop. Very often, windows and doors would be opened to try to reduce the amount of the dust in the shop, but that would not work effectively either.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">{\u00b6 62} In a report dated March 4, 1997, decedent\u2019s treating physician, Michael A. Yanik, M.D., opined that Robinson\u2019s squamous cell carcinoma of the left maxillary sinus was work-related. Dr. Yanik explained, \u201cThese carcinomas have been directly linked to specific occupations notably individuals who had chrome and nickel exposure for several years. * * * It is truly one of the few actual disease processes * * * that are directly related to a specific work place hazard. This is well documented in all of the occupational health textbooks as well as standard surgical textbooks.\u201d Dr. Yanik also stated that at the time of Robinson\u2019s orbital exenteration and maxillectomy, \u201cthe specimen was literally glistening with fine metallic particles.\u201d Indeed, the specimen was so \u201cinteresting,\u201d as Dr. Yanik put it, that he felt compelled to note in his report that during the surgery \u201cseveral physicians from other rooms as well as several of the operating room nurses came in to look at the fine metallic particles on the carcinoma.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">{\u00b6 63} In a report dated June 23, 1997, Michael K. Riethmiller, M.D., J.D., who performed a medical evaluation of Robinson at the request of the employer\u2019s attorney, also concluded, \u201cMr. Robinson\u2019s development of a left maxillary squamous cell carcinoma was directly caused by his work place exposure to nickel and chromium dust over a number of years. It is well known that these metals can cause mucous membrane changes which lead to squamous cell carcinoma.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">{\u00b6 64} Nevertheless, the magistrate concluded that \u201cthere is no evidence to support a finding that [Supreme Bumpers] knew it was exposing its employees to injurious concentrations of nickel and chrome dust.\u201d In defending this conclusion, Supreme Bumpers points to two pieces of evidence cited by the court of appeals as relevant to the issue of the employer\u2019s knowledge and argues that neither of these evidentiary items is capable of bearing the weight that the appellate court would have it support. Thus, Supreme Bumpers argues that (1) \u201cthe use of an exhaust system does not establish that deceden[t] was exposed to a known hazard\u201d because \u201c[e]xhaust systems are frequently installed for a variety of reasons having nothing to do with injurious concentrations of toxic dust,\u201d and (2) although \u201cDr. Riethmiller opined in 1997 that it <em>is </em>well known that nickel and chrome dust can lead to cancer * * *, [this] determination almost one year subsequent to decedent\u2019s employment does not establish that Appellant knew prior to that time that nickel and chrome dust were toxic or that injurious concentrations occurred in the plant during decedent\u2019s employment.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">{\u00b6 65} The obvious and overriding deficiency in this analysis lies in its failure to account for the <em>totality </em>of the evidence in this case. The record in this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>when reviewed in its entirety, does not merely suggest the \u201cuse of an exhaust system\u201d in the plant, but reveals that the employer took several measures in an effort to reduce the level of, and exposure to, airborne dust generated by the polishing machines. Indeed, Supreme Bumpers refers to evidence that \u201cpaper-type masks were supplied\u201d to the polishers and, in a subsequent proposition of law, argues that \u201cthe buffing wheels at which decedent work[ed] were covered with a \u2018liquid\u2019 glue which controlled airborne dust.\u201d The SHO found that in addition to general ventilation methods, \u201cthese polisher/buffer machines were equipped with a local exhaust hood and duct work to remove dust created in the polishing process. * * * However, * * * this exhaust hood on the polisher/buffer often did not work and did not remove the dust at its source the way it was supposed to.\u201d The affidavits of Curl and Broughton also describe the exhaust hoods as being \u201con the polishing machines.\u201d And Supreme Bumpers, again in a subsequent proposition of law, argues that it did in fact \u201cprovide ventilation and exhaust equipment as required by IC-5-11,\u201d and that these devices effectively \u201creduced the exposure of employees to that below the permissible exposure limits\u201d for nickel and chrome dusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">{\u00b6 66} Although Supreme Bumpers suggests that employers often install exhaust systems for reasons other than to minimize toxicity levels of airborne dust, it does not reveal what those other reasons might be, and it never actually claims that its exhaust system was installed for any particular purpose or purposes unrelated to the ambient concentration level of toxic dusts that were being generated by the polishing machines. When we consider all of the measures taken in this case, it becomes obvious that Supreme Bumpers is urging us to speculate that it might have had other considerations in mind. The furnishing of paper masks hardly serves any such hypothetical purpose as avoiding product contamination, good housekeeping, or general maintenance; and the application of liquid glue to the polishing wheels, coupled with the fact that exhaust hoods and ductwork were installed on or with reference to the polishing machines themselves, indicates that Supreme Bumpers was attempting to filter out the very contaminants at issue. In any event, it is certainly reasonable for the SHO, as factfinder, to infer from the use of these various methods that Supreme Bumpers knew its employees were being exposed to injurious concentrations of nickel and chrome dust.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">{\u00b6 67} Contrary to the magistrate\u2019s findings, IC-5-10 and IC-5-11 do not require that the employer have specific knowledge that \u201cthere was an injurious concentration of nickel and chrome dust present in the workplace in excess of <em>the limits </em>which would not normally result in injury to an employee.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Because the threshold limit value table in Appendix I to these rules is \u201cfor information and guide purposes only,\u201d IC-5-11.01, the claimant need not establish that the employer had actual or constructive scientific knowledge that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>the particular concentration of the relevant contaminant was so many parts per million in excess of the daily limit values. Instead, it is sufficient that the employer knew the concentrations \u201cto be in excess of those which would not normally result in injury to an employee\u2019s health if the employee had not been previously exposed to such air contaminants.\u201d IC-5-11.02(K).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">{\u00b6 68} Similarly, Dr. Riethmiller\u2019s report is not the only evidence that these metals are \u201cwell known\u201d to cause squamous cell carcinoma. Dr. Yanik reported that the direct link between squamous cell carcinoma and \u201cseveral years\u201d of exposure to nickel and chrome dust \u201cis well documented in all of the occupational health textbooks as well as standard surgical textbooks.\u201d In evaluating the sufficiency of this evidence, we must therefore consider that it takes \u201cseveral years\u201d of exposure to nickel and chrome dust for any individual to contract squamous cell carcinoma, that it took 30 years for any symptomatology to become manifest in Robinson\u2019s case, and that by March 1997, the date of Dr. Yanik\u2019s report, the direct link between these carcinomas and exposure to nickel and chrome was already so \u201cwell known\u201d and so \u201cwell documented\u201d that the fact appears \u201cin all of the occupational health * * * [and] standard surgical textbooks.\u201d With these considerations in mind, we cannot reasonably conclude, as a matter of law, that these reports have no evidentiary value in determining the question of the employer\u2019s knowledge \u201cprior to that time\u201d or \u201cduring the time of decedent\u2019s employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">{\u00b6 69} Moreover, it would not be appropriate for us to analyze these two pieces of evidence in isolation and insist that one of them must alone sustain the claimant\u2019s burden of proving knowledge. This court has never required direct evidence of a VSSR. To the contrary, in determining the merits of a VSSR claim, the commission or its SHO, like any factfinder in any administrative, civil, or criminal proceeding, may draw reasonable inferences and rely on his or her own common sense in evaluating the evidence. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Burton, </em>supra, 46 Ohio St.3d at 172, 545 N.E.2d 1216. In fact, we have been critical of the commission where, en route to a factual determination, it separately examined individual evidentiary items without ever considering the combined or cumulative effect of the evidence as a whole. See <em>State ex rel. Hayes v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 572, 679 N.E.2d 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">{\u00b6 70} Nor does the rule requiring strict construction of VSSR awards apply here. The issue of the employer\u2019s knowledge in this case is a factual question, and the strict-construction rule does not apply in resolving factual disputes. It is a rule of statutory, not evidentiary, interpretation, devised only as a guide to interpreting the specific requirements of a safety standard in VSSR claims. See, e.g., <em>Nobel, </em>supra, 81 Ohio St.3d at 330, 691 N.E.2d 277 (\u201cStrict construction and requirement specificity are primarily rules of interpretation. The problem in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>case, however, is more of application than interpretation.\u201d). It permits neither the commission nor a reviewing court to construe the <em>evidence </em>of a VSSR strictly in the employer\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">{\u00b6 71} The question of the employer\u2019s knowledge in this case is therefore governed by the same adjective principles that govern questions of fact in all workers\u2019 compensation cases: the claimant has the burden of proving a YSSR by a preponderance of the evidence, the commission alone is responsible for evaluating the weight and credibility of the evidence, and this or any other reviewing court may not reweigh the evidence, but must instead uphold the commission\u2019s decision so long as it is supported by \u201csome evidence.\u201d See <em>Burton, </em>46 Ohio St.3d at 171, 172, 545 N.E.2d 1216; <em>State ex rel. Am. Home Prod. Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 317, 318, 530 N.E.2d 873; <em>State ex rel. Pre Finish Metals, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 314, 316, 530 N.E.2d 918.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">{\u00b6 72} Thus, the evidence of an exhaust system and Dr. Riethmiller\u2019s statement must not only be considered together, but must also be evaluated in conjunction with all of the evidence upon which the SHO relied, including that Robinson\u2019s carcinoma \u201cwas literally glistening with fine metallic particles,\u201d that nickel and chrome dust permeated the polishing area, covered the polishers from head to toe for eight to ten hours a day, and penetrated their nostrils, that there was a documented direct link between squamous cell carcinoma and years of exposure to nickel and chrome dust, and that both Supreme Bumpers and its employees took various measures to reduce exposure to these air contaminants.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">{\u00b6 73} Considering the entire record in this case, we conclude that the totality of the evidence is more than sufficient to support a finding that Supreme Bumpers knew that the concentrations of nickel and chrome dust existing in its polishing department were \u201cin excess of those which would not normally result in injury to an employee\u2019s health.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">{\u00b6 74} Finally, Supreme Bumpers proposes that an employer may not be held liable under IC-5-10 and IC-5-11 where it utilizes an effective exhaust system or a \u201cwet method\u201d to minimize air contaminants. Supreme Bumpers then argues that it did in fact \u201cprovide ventilation and exhaust equipment as required by IC-5-11,\u201d as well as \u201capply a liquid substance to the polishing wheels.\u201d Further, with regard to the liquid glue, Supreme Bumpers contends that while \u201c[t]he Industrial Commission found that this was \u2018not a true \u201cwet method\u201d envisioned by IC-5-11.03(A)(6)[,]\u2019 [t]his determination was made without explanation or description of the evidence relied upon.\u201d Thus, the commission should be ordered to provide \u201cfurther hearing or clarification setting forth the basis of its decisio[n] as required by <em>State ex rel. Mitchell v. Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 481 [6 OBR 531, 453 N.E.2d 721].\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b253-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Eastman &amp; Smith, Ltd., John T. Landwehr and Katharine T. Talbott, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">{\u00b6 75} We agree that these sections of the code permit an employer to use general ventilation or a wet method instead of respiratory equipment, that is, so long as these alternative methods are \u201ceffective\u201d and provide \u201cequal or greater protection.\u201d IC-5-10.05(A). See, also, IC-5-11.03(A)(5) and (6). However, the SHO specifically found that the ventilation units utilized by Supreme Bumpers were ineffective. With regard to the application of liquid glue to the polishing wheels, the SHO did not simply opine that \u201cthis is not a true \u2018wet method,\u2019 \u201d but went on to explain that \u201c[t]his latter finding encompasses the additional finding that none of the six \u2018methods of control\u2019 specified in IC-5-11.03(A) effectively minimized the air contaminants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">{\u00b6 76} There may be some limited truth to Supreme Bumpers\u2019 observation that evidence of dust is not necessarily synonymous with evidence of hazardous air contaminants. But considering all of the evidence going to the excessively dusty conditions at the plant, including Curl\u2019s opinion that the ventilation units did not work effectively, Broughton\u2019s statement that he and others \u201cwere constantly exposed to the dust that was coming off the polishing wheel,\u201d and the undisputed fact that decedent\u2019s carcinoma \u201cwas literally glistening with fine metallic particles,\u201d it cannot be said that the commission\u2019s findings with regard to the effectiveness of these proffered alternative methods were devoid of evidentiary support.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">{\u00b6 77} Based on all of the foregoing, we hold that the commission did not abuse its discretion in awarding claimant an additional award for a VSSR. Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals denying Supreme Bumpers a writ of mandamus is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b253-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, F.E.
