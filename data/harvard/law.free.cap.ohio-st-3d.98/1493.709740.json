This cause is pending before the court as an appeal and cross-appeal from the Court of Appeals for Greene County. Upon consideration of appellants/cross-appellees\u2019 motion for summary reversal,</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">IT IS ORDERED by the court, sua sponte, that the oral argument in this case scheduled for March 25, 2003, be, and hereby is, cancelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the court of appeals\u2019 decision with respect to appellants/crossappellees\u2019 Propositions of Law Nos. I and II be reversed on the authority of <em>Kemper v. Michigan Millers Mut. Ins. Co., </em>98 Ohio St.3d 162, 2002-Ohio-7101, 781 N.E.2d 196. Whereas this is a decision on the merits of appellants/cross-appellees\u2019 Propositions of Law Nos. I and II, the provisions of S.Ct.Prac.R. XI(2) apply to this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that appellants/cross-appellees\u2019 Proposition of Law No. Ill and the cross-appeal remain pending and are held for decision pending disposition of Supreme Court case No. 2002-0610, <em>Geren v. Westfield Ins. Co., </em>Lucas App. No. L-01-1398, 2002-Ohio-1230.</p>\n<judges id=\"b777-12\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Ppeiper, Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Connor, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b777-13\">Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Connor, JJ., concur separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b777-14\">Cook, J., not participating.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b777-15\">O\u2019Connor, J., concurring separately.</judges>\n<p id=\"b777-16\">Because I acknowledge that <em>Kemper v. Michigan Millers Mut. Ins. Co., </em>98 Ohio St.3d 162, 2002-Ohio-7101, 781 N.E.2d 196, controls this issue, I agree that summary reversal is appropriate. Nonetheless, I am compelled to write this concurrence because I voted to reconsider <em>Kemper. </em>98 Ohio St.3d 1492, 2003-Ohio-1189, 785 N.E.2d 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-17\">In <em>Kemper, </em>we accepted jurisdiction on the following questions certified by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio: \u201c(1) Are the requirements of <em>Linko v. Indemnity Ins. Co. </em>[2000], 90 Ohio St.3d [445, 739 N.E.2d 338], relative to an offer of UM/UIM coverage, applicable to a policy of insurance written after enactment of [1997] HB 261 and before [2001] SB 97?\u201d and \u201c(2) If the <em>Linko </em>requirements are applicable, does, under [1997] HB 261, a signed rejection act as an effective declination of UM/UIM coverage, where there is no other evidence, oral or documentary, of an offer of coverage?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-18\">In response to these questions, the majority summarily stated, \u201cWe answer certified question No. 1 in the affirmative and certified question No. 2 in the negative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-19\">Chief Justice Moyer, joined by Justice Lundberg Stratton, authored a dissent that amply illustrated the flaws inherent in that majority\u2019s holding. Chief Justice Moyer wrote: \u201cThe majority not only imposes [the Linko] requirements without any statutory basis or legal analysis, but it also ignores the fact that R.C. 3937.18, as amended by H.B. 261, unlike the former statute, speaks directly to the requirements that are necessary for a valid offer and rejection of UM/UIM coverage. In view of these amendments and the absence of any statutory support to impose the <em>Linko </em>requirements, I would conclude that such requirements are inapplicable to insurance policies written after the effective date of H.B. 261.\u201d 98 Ohio St.3d 162, 2002-Ohio-7101, 781 N.E.2d 196, at \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-20\">Moreover, \u201cwhere the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, it is the duty of the court to enforce the statute as written, making neither additions to the statute nor subtractions therefrom.\u201d <em>Hubbard v. Canton City School Dist. Bd. of Edn., </em>97 Ohio St.3d 451, 2002-Ohio-6718, 780 N.E.2d 543, at \u00b6 14. As illustrated in Chief Justice Moyer\u2019s dissent, the <em>Kemper </em>decision adjusted the statutory UM/UIM offer-and-rejection mandates that came into effect following H.B. 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-21\">I voted to reconsider <em>Kemper </em>for the purpose of bringing this court\u2019s rule of law into conformity with R.C. 3937.18. Now that this court has resolved not to reconsider <em>Kemper, </em>I accordingly must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1494\">*1494</page-number>concur that summary reversal is appropriate here.</p>\n<judges id=\"b778-5\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
