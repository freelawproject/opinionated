Berrios, was involved in an automobile accident on December 16, 1997. The driver of the other vehicle was at fault in the collision and was insured by Progressive Insurance Company (\u201cProgressive\u201d). Berrios suffered damages that included $6,354.37 in medical bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>At the time of the accident, Berrios was insured under an automobile insurance policy with appellee, State Farm Insurance Company (\u201cState Farm\u201d), which provided $100,000 per person in underinsured motorist (\u201cUIM\u201d) coverage and $25,000 in medical payments coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">{\u00b6 3} Under the policy that covered Berrios, State Farm charged separate premiums for UIM coverage and medical payments coverage. The policy\u2019s biannual premium included $26.80 for uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage and $41.65 for medical payments coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">{\u00b6 4} As to medical payments coverage, the policy reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cWe will pay reasonable medical expenses incurred, for bodily injury caused by accident, for services furnished within three years of the date of the accident. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">(\u00b6 6} \u201c* * * We will pay medical expenses for bodily injury sustained by:</p>\n<p id=\"AUS0\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c2. any other person while occupying:</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">{\u00b6 9} \u201ca. a vehicle covered under the liability coverage * *</p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">{\u00b6 10} In the policy, State Farm claims a right of subrogation over medical payments paid. The language reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b218-14\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c3. Our Right to Recover Our Payments</p>\n<p id=\"b218-15\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b218-16\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cb. Under medical payments coverage:</p>\n<p id=\"b218-17\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(1) we are subrogated to the extent of our payments to the right of recovery the injured person has against any party liable for the bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"A9N\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b218-18\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(3) if the person to or for whom we make payment recovers from any party liable for the bodily injury, that person shall hold in trust for us the proceeds of the recovery, and reimburse us to the extent of our payment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ADY\">{\u00b6 17} Before Berrios settled with Progressive, State Farm paid $6,354.37 for Berrios\u2019s medical bills under the medical payments coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-19\">{\u00b6 18} Progressive offered the entirety of the tortfeasor\u2019s $12,500 coverage to settle the case. State Farm gave its consent for Berrios to accept Progressive\u2019s $12,500 offer, thereby waiving its subrogation rights under the UIM coverage. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>State Farm did not, however, waive its subrogation rights for its medical payments. State Farm asserted a right to be repaid its $6,354.37 payment from the $12,500 paid by Progressive.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">{\u00b6 19} Berrios accepted Progressive\u2019s limits of $12,500 with the understanding that he would challenge State Farm\u2019s claim to reimbursement for the medical payments. Berrios and State Farm settled Berrios\u2019s UIM claim for an additional $6,000, and they agreed that State Farm\u2019s right to reimbursement of the amount of the medical payments, $6,354.37, would be determined in litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">{\u00b6 20} On April 9, 1999, Berrios filed a declaratory judgment action in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. On February 3, 2000, the parties stipulated facts, narrowing the controversy to the question of whether State Farm could enforce a right of subrogation for the medical payments from the proceeds of Berrios\u2019s settlement with the tortfeasor, in light of the fact that State Farm had also paid Berrios UIM coverage benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">{\u00b6 21} Both parties submitted motions for summary judgment. On April 10, 2000, the trial court granted State Farm\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied that of Berrios. Berrios appealed, and the Tenth District Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court. The cause is before this court upon the allowance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">{\u00b6 22} In <em>Shearer v. Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 1, 7 O.O.3d 1, 371 N.E.2d 210, this court struck down an insurance policy provision that permitted an insurer to reduce the amount recoverable under uninsured motorist (\u201cUM\u201d) coverage by the amount the insurer paid under the medical payments portion of the policy. \u201cA contract condition providing for a deduction for medical payments paid under another portion of the insurance contract is in derogation of the public policy and purpose underlying R.C. 3937.18.\u201d Id. at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">{\u00b6 23} This court considered the contractual setoff as a whittling away of the uninsured motorist protection insurers were required to provide by statute:</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c \u2018Permitting offsets of any type would allow insurers, by contract, to alter the provisions of the statute and to escape all or part of the liability which the Legislature intended they should provide. The medical payment coverage part of the policy is independent of the uninsured motorist coverage and should be treated the same as if it were carried with a different company. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c \u2018* * * The fact that the motorist sees fit to clothe himself with other insurance protection and pays a premium therefor \u2014 such as medical payments\u2014 cannot alter the mandatory safeguards that the Legislature considers necessary for the well-being of the citizen drivers of our state.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shearer, </em>53 Ohio St.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>7-8, 7 O.O.3d 1, 371 N.E.2d 210, quoting <em>Bacchus v. Farmers Ins. Group Exchange </em>(1970), 106 Ariz. 280, 282-283, 475 P.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">{\u00b6 26} In addition to the public-policy reasoning behind <em>Shearer </em>was a more practical issue \u2014 that people who pay separate premiums for separate coverages should get what they pay for: \u201c \u2018[A] policy provision which the insured considers to be additional protection and for which he pays a premium with such extra protection in mind cannot be transposed by the insurer into a reduction of the mandatory minimum coverage.\u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">{\u00b6 27} In <em>Grange Mut. Cas. Co. v. Lindsey </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 153, 22 OBR 228, 489 N.E.2d 281, this court considered whether a subrogation clause, rather than a setoff clause as in <em>Shearer, </em>could allow insurers to reduce UM coverage payments by the amount paid under medical payments coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">{\u00b6 28} In <em>Lindsey, </em>the insured was injured in an automobile collision caused by an uninsured motorist. The insurer paid the insured\u2019s medical bills pursuant to his medical payment coverage. The insured\u2019s UM claim went to arbitration. The arbitrator arrived at an award well within the policy limits. The insurer sought to reduce the amount of the arbitration award by the amount it had previously paid under the medical payments coverage. The insurer argued that its case was different from the insurer in <em>Shearer </em>because of the subrogation clause, which had been lacking in <em>Shearer. </em>This court, concerned less with terminology than with the practical effect of the subrogation clause, rejected that distinction:</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c[A]n insurance policy clause which provides to the insurer a contractual right of subrogation as to payments made under the medical payments portion of the policy does not enable the insurer to avoid obligations it incurs pursuant to the uninsured motorist provision of the same insurance policy. Thus, even where the policy provides for subrogation as to payments made as medical payments coverage, a contract provision which would, in essence, enable the insurer to set off such medical payments against amounts due to the insured pursuant to uninsured motorist coverage is void as in derogation of the public policy and purpose underlying R.C. 3937.18.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">{\u00b6 30} The court in <em>Lindsey </em>realized that, as in <em>Shearer, </em>its decision resulted in a \u201cdouble recovery\u201d \u2014 i.e., recovery under both the UM and medical payments policy provisions \u2014 for the insured. <em>Lindsey, </em>22 Ohio St.3d at 155, 22 OBR 228, 489 N.E.2d 281. Double recovery did not trouble the court. Instead, it was more concerned that insurers would use subrogation clauses to avoid their obligations to provide full coverage:</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cWe cannot accept [the] argument that the presence of a subrogation clause prevents the medical payments coverage provided under one portion of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>insurance policy from being considered as \u2018collateral\u2019 to uninsured motorist coverage provided under a separate portion of the same policy. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c \u2018Permitting offsets of any type would allow insurers, by contract, to alter the provisions of the statute and to escape all or part of the liability which the Legislature intended they should provide. * * *\u2019 <em>Bacchus v. Farmers Ins. Group Exchange </em>(1970), 106 Ariz. 280, 282, 475 P.2d 264.\u201d <em>Lindsey, </em>22 Ohio St.3d at 155-156, 22 OBR 228, 489 N.E.2d 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">{\u00b6 33} The court concluded that \u201c[s]o long as the insured pays separate premiums for medical payments coverage and uninsured motorist coverage, each of which the insured considers to be additional protection, the mere inclusion of a subrogation clause within the policy, which will enable the insurer to pursue collection from the tortfeasor of both types of payments made, does not alter the result mandated by <em>Shearer.\u201d </em>Id. at 156, 22 OBR 228, 489 N.E.2d 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">{\u00b6 34} There is nothing in the present case that significantly differentiates it from <em>Shearer </em>and <em>Lindsey. </em>Like the insurer in <em>Lindsey, </em>State Farm treated UIM coverage separately from medical payments coverage by setting out separate conditions for payment under the contract and charging separate premiums. As was the case in <em>Lindsey, </em>State Farm was required to offer its insured UM/UIM motorist coverage by R.C. 3937.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">{\u00b6 35} One difference between this case and its predecessors is that this case involves UIM coverage rather than UM coverage. There is no significance to that distinction. The thrust of <em>Shearer </em>and <em>Lindsey </em>was the rejection of policy language that created setoffs against statutorily mandated UM coverage. The version of R.C. 3937.18 operative in this case mandated UIM as well as UM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">{\u00b6 36} Moreover, as this court stated in <em>Clark v. Scarpelli </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 271, 276, 744 N.E.2d 719, beneficiaries of UIM and UM coverage are entitled to the same final result:</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cAs can be gleaned from the public policy behind the enactment of the underinsured motorist statute, as well as the statutory language, the purpose of underinsured (and uninsured) motorist coverage is to treat injured automobile liability policyholders the same whether a tortfeasor is underinsured or uninsured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">{\u00b6 38} Thus, we must apply <em>Lindsey </em>to this case involving UIM coverage as we would to a case involving UM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">{\u00b6 39} If Berrios had been injured by an uninsured driver, and suffered the same injuries, State Farm would have paid his $6,354.37 in medical bills pursuant to the medical payments coverage in the policy. Assuming that his claims were valued at $18,500 (as they were here), State Farm would be responsible for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>paying Berrios the $6,000 difference between the amount of damages and the limit of the tortfeasor\u2019s coverage. Pursuant to <em>Lindsey, </em>State Farm would not be able to set off or subrogate the $6,354.37 it had previously paid under the medical payments coverage. Berrios would receive double recovery under the policy, a result deemed acceptable by the court in <em>Lindsey </em>to prevent the dilution of statutorily mandated coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">{\u00b6 40} To be treated the same as UM policyholder in this case, Berrios must recover under both the medical payments and UIM coverage. That is the result of the payment of separate premiums as well as the applicability of <em>Shearer, Lindsey, </em>and <em>Clark.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">{\u00b6 41} Appellee attempts to paint this case as strictly a subrogation matter. It cites <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Mut. of Ohio v. Hrenko </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 120, 647 N.E.2d 1358, as controlling. In <em>Hrenko, </em>the insured was injured by an uninsured motorist. His group health insurer, Blue Cross, had a subrogation clause in its contract allowing for reimbursement from money received from any other insurer as the result of an accident. Hrenko received $42,000 from Allstate Insurance Company pursuant to his UM claim. Blue Cross then sought recovery of its medical payments from the UM coverage proceeds. This court held that Blue Cross was entitled to reimbursement from Hrenko after Hrenko had received compensation by way of settlement from Allstate. The court rejected Hrenko\u2019s argument that the Blue Cross subrogation provision was unenforceable because it violated public policy by interfering with the contract with his motor vehicle insurer and by reducing his UM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">{\u00b6 42} The dispositive distinction between this case and <em>Hrenko </em>is that, here, the same company is offering the UIM and medical payments coverages. In <em>Hrenko, </em>whether Allstate was diluting its UM coverage by subtracting another amount it was liable for was not an issue. Allstate paid its entire $42,000 to Hrenko without any setoff. The insurer seeking reimbursement in <em>Hrenko </em>was not a party to the contract providing UM/UIM coverage. <em>Shearer </em>and <em>Lindsey </em>are about forcing UM/UIM insurers to meet the public-policy expectations of their statutorily mandated coverage. <em>Shearer </em>and <em>Lindsey </em>do not address what happens to proceeds from the UM coverage outside the relationship of the policyholder and the UM insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">{\u00b6 43} This case, like <em>Shearer </em>and <em>Lindsey </em>before it, does no violence to most insurance subrogation clauses. These cases exist in the separate world of UM/UIM coverage. This court has long held that UM/UIM provisions are worthy of special protection from any dilution by payments made under other policy provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">{\u00b6 44} Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Douglas, Resnick and F.E.

Cas. Co. v. Lindsey </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 153, 156, 22 OBR 228, 489 N.E.2d 281, relied upon by the majority, Justice Holmes urged the adoption of the following proposition of law: \u201cWhen an automobile liability policy provides medical payments coverage and also uninsured motorist coverage within the same contract, a provision which reduces the amount of any payment owed under the uninsured motorist coverage by the amount of any payments made under the medical payments coverage is valid and enforceable if under the contract the insurer is subrogated to the rights of the insured to the extent of any payments made under the medical payments provision and if the insured\u2019s total damages are equal to or less than the limits of coverage provided for protection against uninsured motorists.\u201d Justice Holmes cogently observed that the majority\u2019s holding in <em>Lindsey </em>produced the illogical result that a policyholder is better off being struck by an uninsured motorist than by a tortfeasor with sufficient policy limits to cover his full claim. Only in that manner could the insured obtain the double recovery that the <em>Lindsey </em>majority acknowledged resulted from its decision. Justice Holmes deemed the holding in <em>Lindsey </em>to be inconsistent with the legislative purpose of compulsory uninsured motorist coverage, that being \u201c \u2018to place the injured policyholder in the same position, with regard to the recovery of damages, that he would have been in if the tortfeasor had possessed liability insurance.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 157, 22 OBR 228, 489 N.E.2d 281, quoting <em>Bartlett v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1973), 33 Ohio St.2d 50, 52, 62 O.O.2d 406, 294 N.E.2d 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">{\u00b6 46} I agree with Justice Holmes\u2019s analysis, which applies in the context of a claim for underinsurance benefits as fully as it does to a claim for uninsurance benefits. See <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Mut. of Ohio v. Hrenko </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 120, 123, 647 N.E.2d 1358, quoting <em>Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. v. Andrews </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 362, 365, 604 N.E.2d 142 (\u201cThe underlying public policy for provision of uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage is \u2018to assure that an injured person receive at least the same amount of compensation whether the tortfeasor is insured or uninsured\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">{\u00b6 47} There is no public policy that an insured receive <em>more </em>than he or she would have received had the tortfeasor been fully insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">{\u00b6 48} As noted by the court of appeals herein, Berrios \u201csettled his underinsured claim with [State Farm] for $6,000, making his total recovery $18,500. [Berrios] had available to him $87,500 in underinsured coverage with State Farm. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>There is no reason for him to settle for a mere $6,000 unless he believed he was fully compensated for all his damages. Therefore, because [Berrios] was fully compensated, [State Farm] is entailed to reimbursement for medical payments from the $12,500 recovered from the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance company.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b224-7\">Frank E.
