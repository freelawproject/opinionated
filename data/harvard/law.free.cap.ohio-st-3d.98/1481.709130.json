The commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1482\">*1482</page-number>recommended the imposition of sanctions against certain attorneys and judges, including the above-named respondent, for failure to comply with the provisions of Gov.Bar R. X and Gov.Jud.R. IV, for the 2000-2001 reporting period.</p>\n<p id=\"AiVB\">On November 6, 2002, pursuant to Gov.Bar R.

Respondent filed objections to the commission\u2019s recommendation and this cause was considered by the court. Upon consideration thereof,</p>\n<p id=\"AUyz\">IT IS ORDERED by the court, sua sponte, that respondent shall pay to the Commission on Continuing Legal Education, within 30 days of the date of this order, by certified check, bank check, or money order, a sanction fee which is hereby imposed in the total amount of $430.00.</p>\n<p id=\"A5E\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk of the court shall record the respondent\u2019s status on the roll of attorneys as \u201cNOT IN GOOD STANDING\u201d until such time as the respondent has complied with this order but that this order shall not be considered a disciplinary order pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V or Gov.Bar R. X(6)(H).</p>\n<p id=\"AZY\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the commission shall notify the Clerk of the court when payment of the imposed sanction has been made by respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"A9Nz\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, payment of the sanction notwithstanding, respondent shall comply with the requirements imposed by Gov.Bar R. X for the 2000-2001 reporting period. See CLE Reg. 503.04.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
