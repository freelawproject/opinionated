On January 18, 2000, Ferguson applied for a reparations award under the Victims of Crime Act, R.C. 2743.51 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">{\u00b6 2} Following an investigation, appellee Ohio Attorney General recommended that Ferguson\u2019s application be denied under R.C. 2743.60(E) because he had engaged in felonious conduct within ten years prior to the criminally injurious conduct that gave rise to his claim. In February 2001, a single commissioner of appellee Court of Claims of Ohio, Victims of Crime Division, denied Ferguson\u2019s claim because of his \u201cfelonious conduct which occurred within ten years prior to the criminally injurious conduct.\u201d The commissioner noted that on May 17, 1994, while Ferguson was being arrested for certain traffic violations, he had engaged in conduct that would have constituted a felony offense of escape:</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cThe Attorney General\u2019s investigation revealed that the applicant was arrested for various traffic violations on May 17, 1994. When the police tried to handcuff the applicant, he ran from the arresting officer and escaped. Pursuant to former R.C. 2921.34, escape constituted a felony of the fourth degree. However, the applicant was permitted to plead guilty to a misdemeanor count of failure to comply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">{\u00b6 4} Ferguson objected to the commissioner\u2019s decision, and in September 2001, a panel of three commissioners overruled Ferguson\u2019s objection and affirmed the denial of Ferguson\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">{\u00b6 5} Ferguson appealed the panel\u2019s order, and in February 2002, appellee Court of Claims Judge Fred J. Shoemaker denied Ferguson\u2019s claim and entered judgment for the state of Ohio. Judge Shoemaker held that Ferguson had failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he was entitled to an award of reparations.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">{\u00b6 6} On March 13, 2002, Ferguson filed a complaint for a writ of mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County. In his complaint, as subsequently amended, Ferguson sought a writ of mandamus to compel appellees, the Court of Claims of Ohio, Victims of Crime Division, Judge Shoemaker, and the Ohio Attorney General, to vacate the Court of Claims orders denying benefits to Ferguson and to pay him benefits. Appellees moved to dismiss Ferguson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>complaint pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">{\u00b6 7} In May 2002, a court of appeals magistrate recommended that the court of appeals grant appellees\u2019 motion and dismiss Ferguson\u2019s complaint. Ferguson objected to the magistrate\u2019s decision, and on August 20, 2002, the court of appeals overruled Ferguson\u2019s objection, adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation, and denied the writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">{\u00b6 8} This cause is now before the court upon Ferguson\u2019s appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Civ.R. 12(B)(6) Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">{\u00b6 9} Ferguson asserts that the court of appeals erred in granting appellees\u2019 Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion and dismissing his mandamus complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The dismissal was appropriate if, after all factual allegations of the complaint were presumed true and all reasonable inferences were made in Ferguson\u2019s favor, it appeared beyond doubt that Ferguson could prove no set of facts warranting the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus. <em>State ex rel. Ragozine v. Shaker, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 201, 2002-Ohio-3992, 772 N.E.2d 1192, \u00b6 7; <em>State ex rel. Hummel v. Sadler, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 84, 2002-Ohio-3605, 771 N.E.2d 853, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">{\u00b6 10} In order to be entitled to the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus, Ferguson had to establish a clear legal right to the vacation of the Court of Claims\u2019 denial of his claim, a corresponding clear legal duty on the part of the Court of Claims, and the lack of an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. <em>State ex rel. N. Olmsted v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 529, 532, 757 N.E.2d 314. These requirements would have been satisfied if the Court of Claims had abused its discretion in denying his application for crime-victim reparations. <em>State ex rel. Jenkins v. Tyack </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 242, 17 OBR 479, 479 N.E.2d 267, syllabus; <em>State ex rel. Bernard v. Kainrad </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 103, 104, 28 OBR 196, 502 N.E.2d 632.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018Abuse of discretion\u2019 implies an unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable attitude.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Wilke v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 55, 61, 734 N.E.2d 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">{\u00b6 11} For the reasons that follow, dismissal was warranted because Ferguson could not establish that the Court of Claims abused its discretion in denying his crime-victim reparations claim.</p>\n<p id=\"Agi\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Statutory Construction</p>\n<p id=\"AMUN\">{\u00b6 12} The Court of Claims held that Ferguson\u2019s claim for benefits was barred by former R.C. 2743.60(E), which applied to his claim<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and provided that no award may be granted if a preponderance of the evidence establishes that the victim or claimant engaged in felonious conduct within ten years of the criminally injurious conduct giving rise to the claim:</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(E) Neither a single commissioner nor a panel of commissioners shall make an award to a claimant if any of the following applies:</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(3) It is proved by a preponderance of the evidence presented to the commissioner or the panel that the victim or the claimant engaged, within ten years prior to the criminally injurious conduct that gave rise to the claim or during the pendency of the claim, in <em>conduct that would constitute a felony </em>under the laws of this state, another state, or the United States.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 1996 Sub.S.B. No. 363, 146 Ohio Laws, Part III, 4371.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">{\u00b6 16} Ferguson suggests in part that only a prior felony <em>conviction </em>within ten years of the criminally injurious conduct that is the basis for the claim can bar an otherwise meritorious reparations claim. In analyzing former R.C. 2743.60(E)(3), \u201cwe must first review the statutory language, reading undefined words and phrases in context and construing them in accordance with the rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Portage Lakes Edn. Assn., OEA/ NEA v. State Emp. Relations Bd., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 533, 2002-Ohio-2839, 769 N.E.2d 853, \u00b6 36. After so construing the pertinent language, it is evident that the statute requires only <em>\u201cconduct </em>that would constitute a felony\u201d and not a felony <em>conviction. </em>(Emphasis added.) If the General Assembly had intended to limit this bar to reparations to convictions, it could have readily done so with the appropriate language. In fact, it did so in former R.C. 2743.60(E)(1) and (2), which both required felony <em>convictions </em>within the applicable ten-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Police Reports</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">{\u00b6 17} Ferguson asserts that the Court of Claims abused its discretion in relying on an unsworn police report to find the former R.C. 2743.60(E)(3) bar applicable. Ferguson claims that the report was inadmissible hearsay. Fergu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>son\u2019s assertion lacks merit. \u201cThe Ohio Rules of Evidence do not, of course, obtain in evaluations and hearings utilized in Victims of Crime reparations claims.\u201d <em>In re Rea </em>(1989), 61 Ohio Misc.2d 732, 739, 584 N.E.2d 1350. As the Court of Claims held in <em>Rea:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cConsequently, hearsay statements, even of the self-serving variety, are not excluded from consideration. Instead, such statements are evaluated for trustworthiness and given weight accordingly.\u201d Id. See, also, <em>In re Grow </em>(1983), 7 Ohio Misc.2d 26, 28-29, 7 OBR 175, 454 N.E.2d 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">{\u00b6 19} R.C. 2743.55(A) expressly provides: \u201cThe attorney general, a court of claims panel of commissioners, or a judge of the court of claims shall determine all matters relating to claims for an award of reparations. The attorney general, a court of claims panel of commissioners, or a judge of the court of claims <em>may order law enforcement officers to provide copies of any information or data gathered in the investigation of the criminally injurious conduct that is the basis of any claim to enable the attorney general, a court of claims panel of commissioners, or a judge of the court of claims to determine whether, and the extent to which, a claimant qualifies for an award of reparations.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) See, also, the comparably worded former R.C. 2743.55(A), 1997 Sub.H.B. No. 478, 147 Ohio Laws, Part II, 4095.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">{\u00b6 20} Therefore, the Court of Claims did not err in considering the unsworn police report in its determination of Ferguson\u2019s reparations claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Res Judicata</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">{\u00b6 21} Ferguson next claims that because he was charged with only a minor misdemeanor arising out of his May 1994 traffic charges, res judicata barred the Court of Claims from considering conduct that would have constituted felony escape from his May 1994 arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">{\u00b6 22} Res judicata bars the litigation of all claims that either were or might have been litigated in a first lawsuit. <em>State ex rel. Commt. for the Referendum of Lorain Ordinance. No. 77-01 v. Lorain Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 308, 2002-Ohio-4194, 774 N.E.2d 239, \u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">{\u00b6 23} Res judicata did not, however, bar the Court of Claims from considering Ferguson\u2019s felonious conduct in assessing his reparations claim even though that prior conduct did not result in a conviction. As previously determined, the plain language of former R.C. 2743.60(E)(3) does not require a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">{\u00b6 24} Moreover, there are qualitative differences between the previous criminal proceedings and the civil reparations action that prohibit the application of res judicata. For example, in <em>Walden v. State </em>(1989), 47 Ohio St.3d 47, 547 N.E.2d 962, at the syllabus, we held that \u201c[w]here a person claiming compensation for wrongful imprisonment has presented an affirmative defense of self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>defense at his criminal trial, and has obtained a judgment of acquittal, that judgment is not to be given preclusive effect in a proceeding [for wrongful imprisonment] under R.C. 2305.02.\u201d \u201c[T]he qualitative differences between civil and criminal proceedings [including the differing standards of proof, rules of discovery, and rules of evidence] militate against giving criminal judgments preclusive effect in civil or quasi-civil litigation.\u201d Id. at 52, 547 N.E.2d 962; <em>Manley v. Rufus Club Mozambique </em>(1996), 111 Ohio App.3d 260, 263, 675 N.E.2d 1342.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">{\u00b6 25} Therefore, res judicata did not bar the Court of Claims from considering evidence of Ferguson\u2019s prior felonious conduct in determining his reparations application.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Stare Decisis</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">{\u00b6 26} Ferguson contends that the Court of Claims abused its discretion by failing to follow its previous judgments in <em>In re Faris </em>(1996), 85 Ohio Misc.2d 37, 684 N.E.2d 112, and <em>In re Carver </em>(1997), 91 Ohio Misc.2d 178, 698 N.E.2d 151, and in relying on the unreported decision of a three-commissioner panel in <em>In re Sawyer </em>(Jan. 20, 1995), Ct. of Cl. No. V93-61412, in determining Ferguson\u2019s claim. He asserts that the Court of Claims thereby violated the doctrine of stare decisis and former S.Ct.R.Rep.Op. 2 (1983), 3 Ohio St.3d xxi.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">{\u00b6 27} The cases Ferguson relies upon to support his claim, however, are distinguishable. <em>Faris </em>did not involve any police report, and in <em>Carver, </em>the police reports did not include the statements of any officers having firsthand knowledge of the applicant\u2019s felonious conduct. Conversely, Ferguson does not claim that the police report here fails to include the statements of officers having firsthand knowledge of his felonious conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">{\u00b6 28} Furthermore, nothing in either former S.Ct.R.Rep.Op. No. 2(G)(2) or current S.CtR.Rep. 4 requires that the Court of Claims ignore unpublished opinions. Under former S.Ct.R.Rep.Op. No. 2(G)(2), the Court of Claims was entitled to treat <em>Sawyer </em>as persuasive authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">Constitutional Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">{\u00b6 29} Ferguson also asserts that the Court of Claims\u2019 interpretation of former R.C. 2743.60(E) denies crime victims their constitutional rights. But the plain language of the statute supports the court\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">{\u00b6 30} Moreover, to the extent that Ferguson attacks the constitutionality of the statute itself, it is presumed to be constitutional unless shown beyond a reasonable doubt to violate a constitutional provision. <em>State ex rel. Watson v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 239, 242, 725 N.E.2d 255. Ferguson\u2019s generalized attacks have not met that burden.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b513-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Carl G. McMahon, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ALa\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, and Martin D. Susec, Assistant Attorney General, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b513-3\">{\u00b6 31} As we observed in rejecting an equal-protection challenge to former R.C. 2743.60(E):</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c[T]he rationale to conserve governmental resources by generally excluding persons associated with crime is apparent on the face of the law. Conserving scarce resources is a legitimate purpose, and excluding persons convicted or otherwise shown to have committed felonies promotes that purpose. Therefore, the classification made by the law is reasonable and does not violate equal protection of the laws.\u201d <em>State ex rel Matz v. Brown </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 279, 280-281, 525 N.E.2d 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">{\u00b6 33} Therefore, the court of appeals did not err in dismissing Ferguson\u2019s mandamus complaint. The Court of Claims did not abuse its discretion by relying on the police report and denying his reparations claim. We thus affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b513-8\">Mover, C.J., Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook, Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Connor, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-10\">. This appeal's to be an exception to the general rule that \u201ca writ of mandamus will not issue to control judicial discretion, even if that discretion is abused.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Carroll v. Corrigan </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 331, 332, 744 N.E.2d 771.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b510-10\">. R.C. 2743.60(E) was amended effective July 1, 2000, but that amendment provided that \u201c[f]or purposes of an application for an award of reparations under sections 2743.51 to 2743.72 of the Revised Code, any issues concerning participation in the program, eligibility for benefits, and exclusionary conditions shall be determined under the version of those sections in effect at the time of the criminally injurious conduct.\u201d Section 3 to Am.Sub. S.B. No. 153, 148 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 9248. The criminally injurious conduct that Ferguson suffered occurred on November 20, 1999, before the amendment became effective.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
