The state charged the defendant, John W. Sullivan, with sexual assault in the first degree pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (l)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>. After a jury trial, he was found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>guilty and sentenced to ten years imprisonment, execution to be suspended after five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The defendant appealed from the judgment of the Appellate Court, which, in a per curiam opinion, had affirmed the trial court judgment against him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>44 Conn. App. 902, 688 A.2d 368 (1996). In response to his petition for certification to appeal, we granted certification limited to the following issue: \u201cWhether the Appellate Court correctly concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence regarding a constancy of accusation witness?\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>240 Conn. 919, 692 A.2d 812 (1997). We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In the summer of 1992, the defendant, then a Massachusetts state trooper, was married to the victim\u2019s first cousin. The victim was working part-time as a bookkeeper and part-time as an exotic dancer. She had done some modeling, including posing for nude photographs. On July 1, 1992, the defendant contacted the victim and told her that, along with twenty-five other people on a \u201csecret indictment list,\u201d she would be charged with telephone solicitation, drug trafficking, racketeering, prostitution and illegal pornography. The defendant stated that the police had copies of some of the victim\u2019s nude photographs, and that she was facing three to six years in prison. He told her that if she cooperated with him, he could have her name removed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>from the secret indictment list. The victim did not learn until September 15,1992, that the defendant\u2019s representations were baseless. In the meantime, frightened by their apparent import, especially by the threat of criminal prosecution, she accompanied the defendant to various places, including a location in Connecticut, where he forced her to engage in sexual intercourse. When she discovered the true facts, she reported these events to the state police in both Connecticut and Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">At his trial for having committed those sexual assaults, the defendant submitted a motion in limine requesting that the court allow him to cross-examine the victim and her father. The defendant sought the opportunity to cross-examine those two witnesses with respect to a statement that the father had made to the police. That statement represented that the victim had been sexually assaulted once before, in 1990, and that the Worcester, Massachusetts police had handled that investigation. Defense counsel informed the court that discussions with the Worcester police had revealed that they had no record of a complaint by the victim regarding this alleged prior incident. In support of his motion, the defendant submitted a copy of the father\u2019s statement to the police in the current case, and a letter from the Worcester police confirming that they had no record of a previous sexual assault investigation concerning this victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion. The court noted that this alleged prior sexual assault complaint had been mentioned only in a statement by the victim\u2019s father, not in the victim\u2019s own testimony. The court reasoned that cross-examination of the victim and her father regarding this collateral incident would be irrelevant and distracting. We agree with the Appellate Court; <em>State </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>supra, 44 Conn. App. 902; that the judgment of the trial court should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>In his appeal to this court, the defendant claims that, contrary to the conclusion of the Appellate Court, the trial court abused its discretion in disallowing this line of questioning. He asserts that the proffered evidence was relevant to show that the victim had lied to her father about an official investigation. According to the defendant, the fact that the victim\u2019s father had testified on her behalf as a constancy of accusation witness gave the defendant the right of cross-examination about the prior investigation. The defendant further argues that this line of questioning would not have violated Connecticut\u2019s rape shield law, General Statutes \u00a7 54-86f,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because the relevant inquiry would have focused, not on the occurrence of a sexual assault in 1990, but on the victim\u2019s alleged misrepresentation to her father about the existence of an official investigation. Finally, the defendant argues that, because the doctrine of constancy of accusation permits witnesses to present hearsay testimony to corroborate the victim\u2019s story, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>defendant should be allowed broad latitude to cross-examine such witnesses to determine whether the victim had lied in the past about matters of similar gravity.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The constancy of accusation doctrine is well established in Connecticut and recently has been reaffirmed by this court. <em>See State v. Troupe, </em>237 Conn. 284, 297-98, 303-304, 677 A.2d 917 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>229 Conn. 557, 565, 643 A.2d 854 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dabkowski, </em>199 Conn. 193, 199-203, 506 A.2d 118 (1986). The doctrine originally was premised on the arguably inaccurate premise that, if a woman had been sexually assaulted, it would be \u201cnatural\u201d for her to confide in others.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>De Wolf, </em>8 Conn. 93, 99 (1830). Until <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 304, we permitted witnesses to testify about the details of a victim\u2019s accounts of the alleged sexual assault on the theory that, if the victim\u2019s story were true, \u201cthe evidence would show constancy in the charge even to the details, and the truth would the more clearly appear.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>44 Conn. 153, 156-57 (1876); <em>State </em>v. <em>De Wolf, </em>supra, 99. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 284, however, we restricted the doctrine so that a constancy of accusation witness could testify only to the fact and the timing of the victim\u2019s complaint. Even so limited, the evidence would be admissible solely for corroboration of the victim\u2019s testimony, and not for substantive purposes. Id., 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Notwithstanding our decision in <em>Troupe, </em>we recognize that the constancy of accusation doctrine creates a tension between competing well recognized principles. It remains a powerful weapon in the state\u2019s arsenal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>to secure justice for victims of sexual assaults. It also, however, constitutes a potential threat to the accused\u2019s right of confrontation under the sixth amendment to the constitution of the United States and under article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>To resolve this tension, the defendant must be allowed an adequate opportunity to cross-examine constancy of accusation witnesses. Such cross-examination properly includes questioning the witness not only about the victim\u2019s report of the present charge, but also about the victim\u2019s prior false statements, to that witness, that tend to undermine the credibility of the victim\u2019s present complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">At trial in this case, the defendant sought to cross-examine the victim and her father about claimed false statements by the victim to her father regarding a prior alleged sexual assault and its investigation. The defendant\u2019s motion in limine stated that the subject of the proposed cross-examination was a \u201cprior allegation of rape . . . which the father claims was under investigation by the Worcester [p]olice [department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">As the defendant acknowledges, it is well established that \u201c[t]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility of evidence. <em>\"State </em>v. <em>Miller, 202 </em>Conn. 463, 482, 522 A.2d 249 (1987). \u201cThe trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Avis, </em>209 Conn. 290, 298, 551 A.2d 26 (1988), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1097, 109 S. Ct. 1570, 103 L. Ed. 2d 937 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">In a sexual assault case, the admissibility of evidence of the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct, including past allegations of sexual assault, is narrowly circumscribed by \u00a7 54-86f.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A clear statement of the defendant\u2019s theory of relevance is all important in determining whether the evidence is offered for a permissible purpose. As the defendant conceded at oral argument before this court, his offer of proof was not a model of clarity. The defendant\u2019s written motion in limine<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and supplementary oral representations to the trial court<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>interpreted to present at least two possible theories of relevance. Considered together, they indicate that the proposed subject of cross-examination might have been: (1) claimed false allegations by the victim of a prior sexual assault; or (2) claimed false statements by the victim to her father regarding a previous investigation of a prior alleged sexual assault.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In this court, the defendant also argued that he sought to pursue this line of questioning in order to demonstrate that the victim had lied to a constancy of accusation witness about the existence of a serious felony investigation, without revealing that the investigation had involved a sexual assault charge. We conclude that the trial court acted within its discretion in disallowing this line of questioning on any of these theories of relevance.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Insofar as the defendant sought to cross-examine the victim and her father regarding an alleged prior sexual assault and its investigation, the trial court was bound, in the exercise of its discretion, by our rape shield statute. Section 54-86f limits the admissibility of evidence of a victim\u2019s prior allegations of sexual assault. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kulmac, </em>230 Conn. 43, 50-56, 644 A.2d 887 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>43 Conn. App. 667, 671-73, 685 A.2d 677 (1996), cert. denied, 240 Conn. 923, 692 A.2d 819 (1997); <em>State v. Manini, </em>38 Conn. App. 100, 106-108, 659 A.2d 196 (1995), cert. denied, 234 Conn. 920, 661 A.2d 99 (1995). Under \u00a7 54-86f (4), such evidence is admissible if it is \u201cso relevant and material to a critical issue in the case that excluding it would violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">The defendant bears the burden of establishing the relevance of the proffered testimony. In order to get <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>such evidence before the jury, he must make a showing that, in fact, the prior complaint was: (1) made by the victim; and (2) false. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 563; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>208 Conn. 365, 377, 545 A.2d 1048 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>43 Conn. App. 680, 694-95, 686 A.2d 500 (1996), cert. denied, 240 Conn. 920, 692 A.2d 817 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>supra, 43 Conn. App. 674; <em>State </em>v. <em>Manini, </em>supra, 38 Conn. App. 114-15. Even if the defendant succeeds in establishing the relevance of the prior false allegation of sexual assault, however, the trial court still may exclude the evidence if its probative value is outweighed by such factors as time, confusion or prejudice.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, </em>186 Conn. 696, 702-703, 443 A.2d 915 (1982); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Kindrick, </em>30 Conn. App. 56, 59-60, 619 A.2d 1 (1993) (evidence admissible under \u00a7 54-86f [4] only if its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">In order to carry his threshold burden of establishing relevance, a defendant must make an \u201coffer of proof as a prerequisite to obtaining an evidentiary hearing to determine the admissibility of evidence . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>v. <em>Manini, </em>supra, 38 Conn. App. 114. The preliminary showing must be sufficient to demonstrate that \u201cthe evidence sought to be explored in the evidentiary hearing is relevant . . . [and] to enable the trial court to make an informed ruling in connection with the exercise of its discretion on the issue.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">In this case, the defendant failed to make an adequate preliminary showing to justify cross-examining the victim and her father about claimed allegations of an alleged prior sexual assault and its investigation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>satisfy his burden of showing relevance, the defendant submitted to the trial court a motion in limine requesting permission to cross-examine the victim and her father in the presence of the jury. The defendant\u2019s offer of proof was, on its face, deficient in various respects. First, the defendant\u2019s offer of proof did not allege facts that would support a finding either that the prior allegation of sexual assault had been made by the victim or that the prior accusation was false. The offer of proof contained no statement that the victim was the source of her father\u2019s belief that she had been sexually assaulted in 1990. Furthermore, as a factual basis for the claim of falsity, the offer of proof represented only that the Worcester police had found no record of such a complaint. Without a further statement by a member of the Worcester police, the offer of proof provided the trial court no basis for determining whether the absence of such a record indicated that the victim had made no such complaint. Furthermore, even if we assume, arguendo, that no investigation had occurred, the trial court reasonably could reject the inference that the victim had not been sexually assaulted at an earlier time. Thus, the defendant\u2019s assertions in his offer of proof were too speculative to require a determination that the victim had made prior false statements to her father regarding a previous sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">For many of the same reasons, the trial court also acted within its discretion in disallowing cross-examination of the victim\u2019s father to demonstrate that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>victim had made false statements to a constancy of accusation witness about the existence of a prior sexual assault investigation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Again, the defendant\u2019s offer of proof did not allege facts that, if proven, would have demonstrated relevance. As stated previously, the offer of proof did not contain facts indicating that the victim was the source of her father\u2019s belief that there had been such an investigation. Furthermore, the offer of proof stated merely that the Worcester police had no record of such an investigation at the time of trial, not that the victim never had made such a complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Even if the facts that were offered indicated that the victim had lied to her father about the existence of a prior sexual assault investigation, the trial court reasonably could have concluded that the victim\u2019s prior false statement was of limited probative value in assessing her credibility in this case. Even if we were to assume, arguendo, that the rape shield statute did not bar the proffered evidence, the trial court acted within its discretion in excluding the evidence under the general evidentiary rules governing impeachment by prior misconduct. See C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 7.22.2, pp. 204-205. The trial court reasonably could have concluded that the claimed events were remote in time, had minimal bearing on the victim\u2019s credibility and would have injected a collateral issue into the trial. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>211 Conn. 555, 571-72, 560 A.2d 426 (1989). Specifically, the factual circumstances of the prior alleged sexual assault, which may well have been a \u201cdate rape,\u201d were far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>removed from the facts of this case. A victim\u2019s inaccurate statement to her father about whether she had reported a \u201cdate rape\u201d to the police is not necessarily probative of whether that same victim would lie under oath about a sexual assault by a police officer. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>856 F.2d 1071, 1088 (8th Cir. 1988); <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Raines, </em>641 F.2d 790, 793 (9th Cir. 1981); see also D. Johnson, \u201cPrior False Allegations of Rape: Falsus in Uno, Falsus in Omnibus?,\u201d 7 Yale J.L. <em>&amp; </em>Feminism 243 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">\u201cThe trial court has wide discretion to determine the relevancy of evidence and the scope of cross-examination. Every reasonable presumption should be made in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling in determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>232 Conn. 740, 746-47, 657 A.2d 611 (1995); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 563. Accordingly, in light of the insufficiency of the defendant\u2019s offer of proof to support his claim with respect to the relevancy of the proffered evidence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in disallowing this line of questioning, and the Appellate Court properly affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">In this opinion BORDEN and PALMER, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b661-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person (1) compels another person to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force against such other person or a third person, or by the threat of use of force against such other person or against a third person which reasonably causes such person to fear physical injury to such person or a third person . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b662-8\"> The sole issue presented to the Appellate Court was: \u201cWhether the trial court abused its discretion in excluding evidence that the victim falsely claimed to have initiated other police investigations of rape?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b662-9\"> The question that we certified did not include any issue of constitutional law. The defendant\u2019s petition for certification did not raise any issue of constitutional law. The petition stated the question to be \u201cthe interplay between the rape shield law and the constancy of accusation doctrine.\u201d Although the petition alluded to the constitutional caveat contained in General Statutes \u00a7 54-86f (4), the petition characterized the issue as pertaining to \u201cthe relevancy of prior false statements.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b664-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-86f provides: \u201cIn any prosecution for sexual assault under sections 53a-70, 53a-70a, and 53a-71 to 53a-73a, inclusive, no evidence of the sexual conduct of the victim may be admissible unless such evidence is (1) offered by the defendant on the issue of whether the defendant was, with respect to the victim, the source of semen, disease, pregnancy or injury, or (2) offered by the defendant on the issue of credibility of the victim, provided the victim has testified on direct examination as to his or her sexual conduct, or (3) any evidence of sexual conduct with the defendant offered by the defendant on the issue of consent by the victim, when consent is raised as a defense by the defendant, or (4) otherwise so relevant and material to a critical issue in the case that excluding it would violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. Such evidence shall be admissible only after a hearing on a motion to offer such evidence containing an offer of proof. On motion of either party the court may order such hearing held in camera, subject to the provisions of section 51-164x. If the proceeding is a trial with a jury, such hearing shall be held in the absence of the jury. If, after hearing, the court finds that the evidence meets the requirements of this section and that the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect on the victim, the court may grant the motion. The testimony of the defendant during a hearing on a motion to offer evidence under this section may not be used against the defendant during the trial if such motion is denied, except that such testimony may be admissible to impeach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>the credibility of the defendant if the defendant elects to testify as part of the defense.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b665-10\"> As we noted in <em>Troupe, </em>the assumption that it is \u201cnatural\u201d for victims to report that they have been sexually assaulted has been largely discredited by modern research indicating that victims may not tell others about a sexual assault owing to feelings of shame or fear of public embarrassment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 295.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b666-8\"> At no point in these proceedings has the defendant claimed that the provisions of our state constitution afford him rights greater than those arising under the federal constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b666-9\"> The defendant has not briefed a claim that the trial court\u2019s ruling violated his constitutional rights under either the United States or the Connecticut constitution. He claims only that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding the proffered testimony. Accordingly, we analyze this claim as an evidentiary issue within the discretion of the trial court, albeit one controlled by a statutory exception incorporating constitutional standards. General Statutes \u00a7 54-86f (4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b667-7\"> Justice Berdon\u2019s dissenting opinion points to law from other jurisdictions to argue that a victim\u2019s prior false allegations of sexual assault may not be covered by our rape shield statute. It is at least doubtful that an <em>allegation </em>by a defendant that a victim\u2019s prior claim was false would be sufficient to circumvent \u00a7 54-861'. Such a rule could eviscerate the prophylactic function of our rape shield statute. In any event, this controversial issue has not been raised by the defendant in this case, who argues only that the rape shield statute would not cover prior statements about whether the police had initiated a previous sexual assault investigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b667-8\"> The defendant\u2019s motion in limine provided: \u201cNow comes the defendant in the above-entitled matter and moves that this Honorable Court allow defense counsel to cross-examin[e] the complaining victim and her father with respect to a prior allegation of rape . . . which the father claims was under investigation by the Worcester Police Department Discussions with members of the Worcester Sexual Assault unit disclosed that this was never [a] complain[t] made by [the victim] with respect to another rape.

He alleges that [the victim] had been raped in the past by a young man who was working for Rob Roy\u2019s, which is a hair salon in Worcester, and that that particular matter was brought to the attention of the Worcester Police Department and that particular incident was under investigation by the Worcester Police. We have had contact with the Worcester Police. I believe it was Lieutenant [William P.] O\u2019Connor who heads the sexual assault unit in Worcester and there was no investigation. There was no report of a rape in this particular case by [the victim], Your Honor. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>we would seek to cross-examine on that matter because it goes to the credibility of both [the victim] and also [her father].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b668-9\"> To the extent that the defendant\u2019s offer of proof was intended to give the defendant greater latitude to cross-examine the victim herself, that claim does not involve the constancy of accusation doctrine. The victim\u2019s father <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>is the only person whose cross-examination is at issue with respect to impeachment of a constancy of accusation witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b669-8\"> For example, a trial court might act within its discretion to exclude evidence of even a demonstrably false prior allegation of sexual assault if the circumstances of the victim\u2019s earlier accusation were so different from the case at bar that the prejudicial effect of the prior incident would outweigh its probative value. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>856 F.2d 1071, 1088 (8th Cir. 1988) (circumstances of two cases were so dissimilar that even if victim had lied about first case, probative value of that fact was slight); <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Raines, </em>641 F.2d 790, 793 (9th Cir. 1981) (aside from fact that proffer was insufficient to demonstrate falsity, prior sexual assault allegation had involved date rape and current case was stranger rape). Because the defendant\u2019s proffer in this case was too weak to establish even relevance, as discussed later in this opinion, we are not required to engage in this balancing here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b669-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-86f provides in relevant part: \u201cSuch evidence shall be admissible only after a hearing on a motion to offer such evidence containing an offer of proof. On motion of either party the court, may order such hearing held in camera .... If the proceeding is a trial with a jury, such hearing shall be held in the absence of the jury. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b670-7\"> The defendant argued in his brief to this court that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to order an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the evidence was admissible. As discussed subsequently, however, defense counsel did not request such a hearing at trial. In this court, the defendant also claimed that the trial court should have ordered an evidentiary hearing sua sponte, even in the absence of a request by defense counsel. The defendant, however, cited no cases to support his claim that the trial court had an affirmative duty to order an evidentiary hearing sua sponte. As discussed previously in footnote 3 of this opinion, the certified question presents only an evidentiary question, not a constitutional claim. In such circumstances, \u201cwe are not required to review issues that have been improperly presented to this court through an inadequate brief.\u201d <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Giacomi, </em>242 Conn. 17, 44-45, 699 A.2d 101 (1997); see also <em>State v. Tweedy, </em>219 Conn. 489, 510 n.17, 594 A.2d 906 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">Contrary to the assertion of Justice Berdon in his dissenting opinion, we are not holding that the defendant was <em>required </em>to move for an evidentiary hearing in order to bolster this presentation. Moreover, the defendant\u2019s election not to move for such a hearing did not deprive the trial court of its ability to order such a hearing sua sponte. Had the trial court found the defendant\u2019s offer of proof persuasive, it would have been within its discretion in ordering such a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">We reject, however, the defendant\u2019s claim, in passing, that the court was <em>obligated, </em>sua sponte, to hold such a hearing. We have held that a trial court may abuse its discretion if it fails to inquire into charges of juror misconduct. <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>235 Conn. 502, 521, 668 A.2d 1288 (1995). Similarly, the trial court is obligated to inquire whether the defendant is making a knowing and voluntary waiver of certain fundamental constitutional trial rights. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Frye, </em>224 Conn. 253, 262, 617 A.2d 1382 (1992) (right to represent oneself); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>205 Conn. 456, 461, 534 A.2d 230 (1987) (right to trial by jury); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>203 Conn. 159, 166-67, 523 A.2d 1284 (1987) (right to conflict-free representation). A trial court\u2019s duty of independent inquiry, however, arises in situations implicating the fundamental fairness of the proceedings and the defendant\u2019s core constitutional trial rights. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>We never have held that a trial court has an independent obligation to order, sua sponte, a hearing on an evidentiary matter, in the absence of both a request for a hearing and an adequate offer of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">Finally, we disagree with the suggestion in Justice McDonald\u2019s dissenting opinion that \u00a7 54-86f, which was not cited to the trial court, requires such a sua sponte hearing in this case. We never have held so. The issue now before us does not raise any question about the manner in which the hearing should have been conducted, if the defendant had made a proper request for one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b672-7\"> In this court, the defendant claimed that he had sought to pursue this line of questioning in order to demonstrate that the victim had lied about the existence of a serious felony investigation, without necessarily revealing that the alleged investigation had involved a sexual assault charge. The defendant\u2019s written and oral submissions to the trial court, however, do not present this alternative. Thus, we do not consider whether the trial court would have abused its discretion in disallowing this line of questioning.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b673-9\">BERDON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A2tG\">dissenting. This is one of those cases in which the defendant, who may very well be innocent, will lose his liberty because of this court\u2019s failure to recognize his fundamental constitutional right to cross-examine witnesses and its adherence to the anachronistic rule on constancy of accusation evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">In order to appreciate the prejudice to the defendant by not allowing him an opportunity to cross-examine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>the alleged victim, K, and her father concerning a prior false statement about a sexual assault investigation by the Worcester, Massachusetts police department, this case must be viewed in the context of the undisputed facts, which are not fully stated by the majority. The credibility of K, of course, was of vital importance in this case. The defendant, John W. Sullivan, then an officer with the Massachusetts state police, went to the apartment of K, his wife\u2019s cousin, on July 1, 1992. K, a part-time exotic dancer and bookkeeper who used marijuana, cocaine and heroin, showed the defendant a collection of professional photographs taken of her in the nude. Later that day, the defendant and K went to a nudist resort located in Woodstock, Connecticut, where they had sexual intercourse; this sexual encounter is the basis of the charge of sexual assault in this case. On July 5, 1992, K went to the defendant\u2019s home, where K undressed but did not have sexual intercourse with the defendant. K testified that she accompanied the defendant to the resort on July 1, and met him at his home on July 5, because the defendant claimed that she was on a police list of persons to be indicted for telephone solicitation, drug trafficking, criminal racketeering, prostitution and illegal pornography and that he had offered to help her avoid the indictment. On September 17, 1992, more than two months after this sexual encounter, K filed a complaint with the Connecticut state police who subsequently arrested the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The only evidence to support the conviction of the defendant for the sexual assault of K was the testimony of K and that of nine constancy of accusation witnesses,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> witnesses who had no personal knowledge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>the assault but who testified solely on what was told to them by K. In this case, not only were these nine constancy of accusation witnesses paraded before the jury and allowed to testify based solely upon the hearsay statements of K, but they were also allowed to recite the details of what K had told them about the alleged sexual assault to bolster the state\u2019s case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the cross-examination of K and her father, one of the constancy of accusation witnesses, was of vital importance to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The defendant filed a motion for permission to cross-examine K and her father concerning a prior false statement about a sexual assault investigation by the Worcester police department, which allegation was contained in the father\u2019s statement to the Connecticut state police. This motion obviously was filed pursuant to the rape shield statute, General Statutes \u00a7 54-86f.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>I set forth the motion in its entirety, together with the attached exhibit and oral argument of trial counsel, because it is important that the defendant\u2019s entire representation be reviewed. The motion provides: \u201cNow comes the defendant in the above-entitled matter and moves that this Honorable Court allow defense counsel to cross-examin[e] the complaining victim and her father with respect to a prior allegation of rape . . . which the father claims was under investigation by the Worcester Police Department. Discussions with members of the Worcester Sexual Assault unit disclosed that th[ere] was never [a] complain[t] made by [K] with respect to another rape. This evidence is relevant and material to the impeachment of [K\u2019s] and [her father\u2019s] credibility.\u201d Attached to the motion was a letter from Lieutenant William P. O\u2019Connor, a member of the sexual assault unit of the Worcester police department, on official stationery, which stated: \u201cThere are no reports on file in the Worcester Police Department pertaining to [K].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">In argument before the court on the motion, trial counsel for the defendant stated: \u201cAnd the other matter, Your Honor, is a motion in limine with respect to my cross-examining both [K] and also her father with respect to prior rape allegations in a statement that was given to the Connecticut state police by [K\u2019s constancy of accusation witness], that is [K\u2019s] father. He alleges that [K] had been raped in the past by a young man who was working for Rob Roy\u2019s, which is a hair salon in Worcester, and that that particular matter was brought to the attention of the Worcester police department and that particular incident was under investigation by the Worcester police. We have had contact with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>the Worcester police. I believe it was Lieutenant O\u2019Con-nor who heads the sexual assault unit in Worcester and there was no investigation. <em>There was no report of a rape [of K\\ in this particular case . </em>. . <em>Your Honor. And we would seek to cross-examine on that matter because it goes to the credibility of both [K[ and also [her father].\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Trial counsel pointed out that in the father\u2019s statement to the police, he stated the following: \u201c \u2018[K] was also raped in Worcester, Massachusetts, back in 1990, at a park. A black male that she went to school with raped her. Worcester police handled the investigation.\u2019 \u201d A fair reading of both the motion and the argument of trial counsel inescapably leads to the conclusion that K lied to her father that she had made a previous complaint about being raped by a black male, or that the father had lied to the police, or that they both had lied.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion, not on the basis that the defendant failed to make an adequate offer of proof or that he failed to satisfy the rape shield statute, but because it was not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">As a preliminary matter, I address whether the rape shield statute is applicable, as the majority claims, to the alleged false statement made by K and/or her father about the investigation of the prior alleged sexual assault. The majority asserts that evidence of a claimant\u2019s prior false statement concerning a nonexistent investigation of an alleged sexual assault falls under the rape shield statute because it involves the sexual conduct of the claimant. I disagree for several reasons. First, the term conduct, by definition, refers to \u201ca mode or standard of personal behavior especially] as based on moral principles . . . [or] behavior in a particular situation or relation or on a specified occasion . . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>present case, the defendant neither sought to prove K\u2019s sexual lifestyle, nor did he intend to address K\u2019s sexual behavior in a particular situation. The defendant merely sought to question K and her father about a prior false statement concerning a nonexistent police investigation of a sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Second, questioning K and her father about K\u2019s and/ or her father\u2019s prior false statement concerning the noninvestigation of an alleged sexual assault does not contravene the purposes of the rape shield statute. Section 54-86f was enacted by our legislature to promote the following purposes: \u201cprotecting the victim\u2019s sexual privacy and shielding her from undue harassment . . . and enabling the victim to testify in court with less fear of embarrassment.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Cassidy, 3 Conn. App. 374, 379, 489 A.2d 386, cert. denied, 196 Conn. 803, 492 A.2d 1239 (1985). Clearly, K\u2019s sexual privacy would not be violated, nor would she be subject to undue harassment if she had to answer questions about a false statement she allegedly made to her father. See H. Galvin, \u201cShielding Rape Victims in the State and Federal Courts: A Proposal for the Second Decade,\u201d 70 Minn. L. Rev. 763, 862 (1986) (\u201cproof of prior false allegations of rape will almost never require the introduction of sexual conduct evidence\u201d); 23 C. Wright &amp; K. Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure (1980) \u00a7 5384, pp. 546-47, and n. 63 (prior false accusations of rape \u201cought to be excluded from the definition of \u2018sexual behavior\u2019 \u201d in rule 412 of Federal Rules of Evidence [rape shield]).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Third, other jurisdictions hold that the victim\u2019s false allegations of sexual assault, not just the victim\u2019s prior false statements about assault investigations, do not fall within their rape shield statutes. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Stamper, </em>766 F. Sup. 1396 (W.D.N.C. 1991), aff'd without published opinion sub nom. <em>In re One Female Juvenile Victim, </em>959 F.2d 231 (4th Cir. 1992); <em>Covington </em>v. <em>State, </em>703 P.2d 436 (Alaska App.), aff'd in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>part, 711 P.2d 1183 (Alaska 1985); <em>West </em>v. <em>State, </em>290 Ark. 329, 719 S.W.2d 684 (1986); <em>People </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>198 Cal.

Va. 432, 490 S.E.2d 34 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Because K\u2019s prior alleged false statement concerning the noninvestigation by the Worcester police department of an alleged sexual assault does not fit within the phrase \u201csexual conduct,\u201d \u00a7 54-86f is not relevant to the inquiry before us. In other words, the trial court was not bound in the exercise of its discretion by \u00a7 54-86f, but, rather, by our evidentiary rules regarding impeachment of a witness by specific acts of misconduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201c[I]n attacking a witness\u2019 credibility, inquiry may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>be made, in the discretion of the trial court, as to particular acts of misconduct tending to show a lack of veracity, even though such evidence might be irrelevant to the issues in the case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Dolphin, 195 Conn. 444, 459, 488 A.2d 812 (1985); <em>Martyn </em>v. <em>Donlin, </em>151 Conn. 402, 408, 198 A.2d 700 (1964); <em>Vogel </em>v. <em>Sylvester, </em>148 Conn. 666, 675, 174 A.2d 122 (1961); <em>Shatter y. Bullock, </em>78 Conn. 65, 69, 61 A. 65 (1905). Under these rules, I would find that the trial court abused its discretion by denying the defendant\u2019s motion. Indeed, most jurisdictions that have considered the issue of impeachment of complaining witnesses have held that evidence of prior false accusations is admissible to impeach the complainant\u2019s credibility.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Covington </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 703 P.2d 442; <em>People </em>v. <em>Simbolo, </em>188 Colo. 49, 52, 532 P.2d 962 (1975); <em>State </em>v. <em>Schwartzmiller, </em>107 Idaho 89, 92, 685 P.2d 830 (1984); <em>People </em>v. <em>Gorney, </em>107 Ill. 2d 53, 58-61, 481 N.E.2d 673 (1985); <em>Little </em>v. <em>State, </em>413 N.E.2d 639, 643 (Ind.

Rev. 858 (\u201c[o]ne would be hard-pressed to dispute the high probative value of evidence that on [a] previous [occasion] the complainant had made false allegations of rape\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Even if the rape shield statute applied to the inquiry sought by the defendant, I would come to the same conclusion that a new trial is required. The majority incorrectly refuses to review the defendant\u2019s claim with respect to his right to cross-examine K and her father within the contours of the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation pursuant to the sixth amendment to the United States constitution because it claims the constitutional issue was not briefed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The majority is incorrect that the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment rights were not raised and briefed before this court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Even if it were true that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>the defendant failed to raise the constitutional claim, it simply is impossible to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in not allowing the cross-examination without reference to the defendant\u2019s constitutional right. The sixth amendment establishes the floor below which the court cannot tread in order to protect the defendant\u2019s basic constitutional right of confrontation. Although this court has held that a trial court is allowed \u201c \u2018wide discretion to determine the relevancy of evidence and the scope of cross-examination\u2019 <em>State v. Bova, </em>240 Conn. 210, 219, 690 A.2d 1370 (1997); \u201c[that] discretion comes into play . . . only after the defendant has been permitted cross-examination sufficient to satisfy the sixth amendment.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>197 Conn. 396, 402, 497 A.2d 956 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>227 Conn. 231, 248, 630 A.2d 577 (1993), on appeal after remand, 234 Conn. 683, 663 A.2d 339 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1140, 116 S. Ct. 972, 133 L. Ed. 2d 892 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>196 Conn. 421, 424, 493 A.2d 223 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaynor, </em>182 Conn. 501, 508, 438 A.2d 749 (1980). If the answers sought by the defendant through his proffered cross-examination would have \u201c *aid[ed] the court [and the] jury in appraising the credibility of the [two] witnesses] and assessing the probative value of the[ir] direct testimony . . .\u2019 McCormick, Evidence (2d Ed.) \u00a7 29; see <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States, </em>409 A.2d 1093, 1099 (D.C. App. 1979) (rape case)\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ouellette, </em>190 Conn. 84, 102, 459 A.2d 1005 (1983); the trial court was required under the sixth amendment to have granted the defendant\u2019s motion, and allowed such cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Accordingly, I begin my analysis of the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion with a review of established federal constitutional principles relative to the right to cross-examine adverse witnesses. \u201cCross-examination is the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the truth of his testimony are tested.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 316, 94 S.

Instead, according to the majority, the defendant\u2019s entitlement to a hearing is dependent on his ability to make an adequate showing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>in an offer of proof \u201cthat, in fact, the prior [statement concerning the investigation by the Worcester police] was: (1) made by the victim; and (2) false.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The majority\u2019s holding on this issue of first impression for this court is based entirely on the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Manini, </em>38 Conn. App. 100, 113-14, 659 A.2d 196, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 920, 661 A.2d 99 (1995), in which the Appellate Court, on the basis of \u201cthe language of \u00a7 54-86f and on the reasoning of the sibling state decisions\u201d adopted the same rule with respect to defense motions to cross-examine complainants in sexual assault cases. The Appellate Court decision is incorrect because that court misinterpreted the clear language of \u00a7 54-86f, and it relied on clearly distinguishable decisions of the Idaho Court of Appeals; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gabrielson, </em>109 Idaho 507, 708 P.2d 912 (App. 1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Palin, </em>106 Idaho 70, 675 P.2d 49 (App. 1983); and the New Mexico Court of Appeals. <em>State </em>v. <em>Herrera, </em>92 N.M. 7, 582 P.2d 384 (App. 1978). Pursuant to \u00a7 54-86f, evidence that is so \u201crelevant and material to a critical issue in the case that excluding it would violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights . . . shall be admissible only after <em>a hearing on a motion to offer such evidence </em>containing an offer of proof. ... If, <em>after hearing, </em>the court finds that the evidence meets the requirements of [\u00a7 54-86f] and that the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect on the victim, the court may grant the motion.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In my view, once the defendant has established the relevance of his proposed inquiry through one of the three recognized methods in this state, \u00a7 54-86f requires that the trial court hold an evidentiary hearing outside the presence of the jury, \u201ceither before trial or during trial, to determine if the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect on the victim.\u201d C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 2.2.4, p. 17. The trial court has discretion only to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>grant or to deny a defendant\u2019s motion to cross-examine after the evidentiary hearing is completed. Indeed, \u201c[i]n all the cases previously decided [by the appellate courts of this state], where a defendant moved to introduce evidence of the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct, the trial court [held] an evidentiary hearing to determine the admissibility of the [proffered] evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Christiano, </em>[228 Conn. 456, 637 A.2d 382, cert. denied, 513 U.S. 821, 115 S. Ct. 83, 130 L. Ed. 2d 36 (1994)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Rinaldi, </em>220 Conn. 345, 599 A.2d 1 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>208 Conn. 365, 545 A.2d 1048 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sieving, </em>35 Conn.

For example, in <em>Rinaldi, </em>the trial court allowed the defendant to examine, outside the presence of the jury, the complainant\u2019s friend concerning whether the complainant had engaged in sexual intercourse with someone other than the defendant on the night of the alleged sexual assault. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rinaldi, </em>supra, 351-52. Moreover, in <em>Kelly, </em>the trial court allowed the defendant to question the complainant about a prior sexual assault; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>supra, 373; and, in <em>Sieving, </em>in what the Appellate Court referred to as the \u201cstatutorily mandated hearing,\u201d the defendant examined the complainant about sexual intercourse she had engaged in one day prior to the alleged sexual assault. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sieving, </em>supra, 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">The decisions of the Idaho Court of Appeals and the New Mexico Court of Appeals that the Appellate Court relied on in <em>Manini, </em>are distinguishable on important procedural grounds. First, Idaho and New Mexico allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>for pretrial discovery in criminal cases. In fact, the defendant in <em>Herrera </em>was appealing the trial court\u2019s decision to prohibit him from asking the victim questions, in a pretrial deposition, concerning her prior sexual conduct. <em>State </em>v. <em>Herrera, </em>supra, 92 N.M. 13. In <em>Gabrielson, </em>Justice Bistline, in a concurring and dissenting opinion, pointed out that the state argued in its appellate brief that the defendant should not have been allowed to inquire about the complainant\u2019s sexual conduct in an evidentiary hearing because he had the opportunity to take a pretrial deposition of the complainant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Gabrielson, </em>supra, 109 Idaho 512. Second, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Palin, </em>supra, 106 Idaho 72, the Idaho Court of Appeals\u2019 decision to uphold the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s proposed inquiry into the complainant\u2019s \u201cunchaste conduct\u201d to prove consent was based on general evidentiary principles, not on the rape shield statute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>The majority\u2019s imposition of a strict rule that an evi-dentiary hearing is no longer automatic once a motion is made under \u00a7 54-86f could be justified if this state, like Idaho and New Mexico, allowed criminal defendants to conduct pretrial depositions. But, because this state does not allow criminal defendants to obtain the same pretrial discovery that is available to the state,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> this new rule unjustifiably places a burden on criminal defendants that, in most instances, will be impossible to meet.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Even if the majority is correct that some showing is required under the rape shield statute before the defendant is granted an evidentiary hearing outside the presence of the jury in order to demonstrate that he should be allowed to cross-examine the witness before the jury, that showing has been made in this case. The defendant\u2019s offer of proof set forth the statement of K\u2019s father to the Connecticut state police in which the father had alleged that the Worcester police had investigated a prior sexual assault complaint. The offer of proof also included a letter from Lieutenant O\u2019Connor, a member of the sexual assault unit of the Worcester police department, in which O\u2019Connor represented that no sexual assault complaint was filed with the Worcester police department. From these basic facts, the trial court should have inferred that either K\u2019s father, K, or both were lying concerning the nonexistent police investigation. The defendant could not prove to the trial court that K had lied before he cross-examined K and her father, or at the least, had been given the opportunity to conduct a preliminary examination of them outside the presence of the jury, because he had no other way to obtain pretrial information about the false statement. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Chance, </em>236 Conn. 31, 61, 671 A.2d 323 (1996) (holding that state\u2019s attorney, who \u201chad no occasion, prior to the defendant\u2019s trial testimony, to question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>him under oath about his alleged false statements,\u201d should be given opportunity at trial to cross-examine defendant). The majority should recognize, therefore, that because of the restrictions placed on criminal discovery through deposition in Connecticut, the defendant\u2019s presentation of his offer of proof and his good faith belief that the evidence is relevant was sufficient to enable him to cross-examine K and her father about the prior false statement, or, at the least, to be allowed to question the witnesses outside the presence of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">I conclude that because the defendant\u2019s offer of proof was sufficient to establish the relevance of his proffered cross-examination, the trial court violated his confrontation right under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution. Although the majority attempts to shield its decision from the scrutiny of the constitution, the sixth amendment constitutional right to cross-examination \u2014 as I have previously pointed out \u2014 is not only implicit in our certified question, but also, it goes to the essence of the issue. In <em>Davis </em>v. Alaska, supra, 415 U.S. 320, the United States Supreme Court recognized that the defendant\u2019s right to examine a witness\u2019 motive to fabricate is a critical part of the defendant\u2019s right to present evidence on his own behalf, and it outweighs the state\u2019s interest \u201cin protecting the confidentiality of a juvenile offender\u2019s record . . . .\u201d The court stated that such an interest \u201ccannot require [the] yielding of so vital a constitutional right as the effective cross-examination for bias of an adverse witness. \u201d Id. In <em>Olden </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>488 U.S. 227, 232-33, 109 S. Ct. 480, 102 L. Ed. 2d 513 (1988), the United States Supreme Court reversed the Kentucky Court of Appeals\u2019 affirmance of the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow the defendant to impeach the sexual assault victim by introducing evidence of the victim\u2019s motive to fabricate her claims, which evidence would have also implicated her interracial living arrangement. The court explained in <em>Olden </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>that \u201c [speculation as to the effect of [the testimony on] jurors\u2019 racial biases cannot justify exclusion of cross-examination with such strong potential to demonstrate the falsity of [the victim\u2019s] testimony.\u201d Id., 232. In this case, therefore, the burden is on the state to prove that its interests in applying the rape shield statute outweigh the defendant\u2019s interest in cross-examining K and her father about a subject with such strong potential to demonstrate the falsity of K\u2019s and/or her father\u2019s testimony. See <em>Demers </em>v. <em>State, </em>209 Conn. 143, 160, 547 A.2d 28 (1988) (\u201c[t]o have deprived the petitioners [pursuant to the rape shield statute] of the ability to present such evidence which was so highly probative, relevant and material to an element of the crime charged would have violated their sixth amendment rights under the United States constitution to confront the witnesses against them\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Accordingly, I would, at the least, remand this case to the trial court to allow for an evidentiary hearing. If the trial court finds that there was sufficient evidence to support the proffered cross-examination, and finds that, subject to and within the context of the requirements of the sixth amendment of the United States constitution, \u201cthe probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect on the victim\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 54-86f; it should grant the defendant a new trial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">The defendant also argues in this case that if relevant evidence that would impact on the credibility of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>alleged victim and a constancy of accusation witness is excluded because of the rape shield statute, the constancy of accusation evidence that bolsters the alleged victim\u2019s credibility must also be excluded. Although the defendant here did not object to the constancy evidence on that basis, he raises the issue in his brief before this court without objection by the state.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, I would reach this issue on the basis of the plain error doctrine.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">At the time of the defendant\u2019s trial in 1995, before this court issued its ruling in <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>237 Conn. 284, 299-300, 677 A.2d 917 (1996), Connecticut was \u201cone of only five states<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> that continue[d] to permit [constancy of accusation] testimony regarding the details of a sexual assault victim\u2019s [out-of-court statements concerning the alleged assault] . . . .\u201d In no other situation do Connecticut courts permit prior consistent statements to be introduced to credit a witness\u2019 testimony. C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>(Sup. 1998) \u00a7 11.24.3, p. 246. As this court explained in <em>Troupe, </em>the hearsay exception of constancy of accusation was predicated on the discredited and unfounded assumption that because it is \u201cnatural for the victim of a sexual assault to complain promptly following the assault\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 300-301; a \u201cvictim who does not report the crime cannot be trusted to testify truthfully about the incident.\u201d Id., 303. The court further explained in <em>Troupe </em>that \u201cthere is an enhanced risk that the jury may be unduly swayed by the repeated iteration of the constancy of accusation testimony. Indeed, one commentator has opined that testimony by multiple witnesses about the facts of the victim\u2019s complaint may so unfairly bolster the victim\u2019s credibility that, in such cases, \u2018cross-examination of the victim is not a sufficient protection from prejudice.\u2019 C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (Sup. 1995) \u00a7 11.22.1, p. 196.\u201d <em>States. Troupe, </em>supra, 303. As aresult, the court in <em>Troupe </em>concluded that the constancy of accusation doctrine in place at the time of the defendant\u2019s trial needed to be trimmed. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Although I concurred in <em>Troupe </em>that trimming the constancy rule by prohibiting witnesses from testifying about the details of the alleged assault would reduce the prejudice, I suggested that we continue to allow it only in certain limited circumstances.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>1 also, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>pointed out that it is a myth to believe that by instructing the jury that it is allowed to use constancy of accusation evidence only for corroborative purposes that the jury will not misuse the evidence. I wrote: \u201cThis court justifies the continuation of the rule in a modified form in part on the ground that constancy evidence is admissible \u2018only to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony and not for substantive purposes.\u2019 As any trial lawyer can attest, prosecutor or defense counsel, this distinction is academic in the real world of criminal trials. It is clear that the prejudicial impact of constancy evidence is not eliminated merely because the trial judge instructs the jury that it is admitted only for corroboration. The distinction between corroborative evidence and substantive evidence has no meaning to the average juror. Constancy of accusation evidence bolsters the victim\u2019s courtroom story, rendering it more credible as if there was another witness to the sexual assault. See <em>Krulew-itch </em>v. <em>United States, </em>336 U.S. 440, 453, 69 S. Ct. 716, 93 L. Ed. 790 (1949) (Jackson, J., concurring) (\u2018[t]he naive assumption that prejudicial effects can be overcome by instructions to the jury . . . all practicing lawyers know to be unmitigated fiction\u2019).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 317 <em>(Berdon, J., </em>concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">At least under the circumstances of this case, where the defendant was unable to challenge the credibility of K, but the state was allowed to introduce nine other witnesses who attested to the credibility of K based solely on K\u2019s out-of-court statements, and where there was no other evidence to support K\u2019s claim of her tardy complaint of sexual assault, the defendant is entitled to a new trial. In other words, in this case, the trial court allowed the testimony of the state\u2019s only witness to the sexual assault to be bolstered by nine witnesses who in effect testified before the juiy that K was telling the truth. It was plain error for the trial court to allow any constancy of accusation testimony to be introduced when the defendant was not permitted to cross-examine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>K with respect to her credibility regarding a false statement about an alleged prior sexual assault.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>Rock </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>483 U.S. 44, 56, 107 S.

Furthermore, until such time as the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confrontation has been satisfied, the trial court has a narrow and clearly defined scope of discretion to determine the relevancy of evidence.

Indeed, \u201c[t]he benefits arising from the availability of a procedure which provides for the oral examination of parties or witnesses before trial are several. In addition to the advantages associated with other discovery devices \u2014 such as the prevention of delays, avoidance of surprise at trial, elimination of issues, and facilitation of the trial of the case through better preparation\u2014 the deposition can preserve testimony in the event a witness becomes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>unavailable. It can also provide a unique opportunity for preventing perjury by freezing testimony at a time when recollection is freshest in a setting, as contrasted to the responses elicited by written interrogatories, that encourages spontaneity. Moreover, depositions have the advantage of making available in a simple, convenient, and relatively inexpensive way facts which might otherwise not have come to light, as well as providing an opportunity for educating the parties in advance of trial to the real value of their allegations and defenses in circumstances where demeanor evidence can be closely observed.

The majority concedes that the \u201cdoctrine originally was premised on the arguably inaccurate premise that, if a woman had been sexually assaulted, it would be \u2018natural\u2019 for her to confide in others.\u201d The majority now seems to justify this exception on the basis that \u201c[i]t remains a powerful weapon in the state\u2019s arsenal to secure justice for victims of sexual assaults.\u201d But the majority forgets that we need to do justice for all, the accused as well as the accuser. \u201cSending the innocent to jail, or depriving the guilty of due process, is not a price our Constitution allows us to pay for the legitimate and worthy ambition to protect those already victimized from additional suffering.\u201d <em>Stephens </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>13 F.3d 998, 1010 (7th Cir. 1994) (Cummings, J., dissenting). If witnesses are going to be allowed to testify about a hearsay complaint of an alleged victim that she was sexually assaulted by the defendant \u2014 and in this case there was not one such witness, but nine \u2014 then, constitutionally, a defendant should be able to cross-examine the alleged victim about a prior false statement concerning an alleged sexual assault.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b694-9\"> The majority fails to appreciate that the only person that can be effectively cross-examined is the alleged victim; it is impossible to cross-examine a constancy of accusation witness with respect to the truth of what the victim told that witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b695-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>MCDONALD, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"arq-dedup-0\">dissenting. Here the defendant sought to establish that the complainant had made a false complaint of sexual assault in 1990. He presented a statement from her father representing that she had been sexually assaulted in Worcester, Massachusetts, and that the Worcester police \u201chad handled that investigation,\u201d and a letter from the Worcester police indicating that they had no record of such a complaint. He therefore moved, unsuccessfully, to cross-examine the complainant and her father concerning that incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">It may be true that the trial court might have ruled that the resulting evidence was inadmissible before the jury. What was foreclosed, however, was the defendant\u2019s only opportunity to establish from the complainant\u2019s father that the complainant was the source of his information, and from the complainant whether she did in fact make a false complaint of sexual assault in 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The majority observes that the defendant should have made a motion for an evidentiary hearing to be held outside the jury\u2019s presence. Although the defendant\u2019s motion in limine requesting cross-examination was not couched in terms of General Statutes \u00a7 54-86f, the rape shield statute, that statute explicitly required that such an inquiry be made outside the presence of the jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court should have allowed such an inquiry to afford the defendant an adequate opportunity to develop his cross-examination of the state\u2019s witnesses. In this manner the record would have ensured that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>evidence \u201cso relevant and material . . . that excluding it would violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights\u201d was not excluded improperly. General Statutes \u00a7 54-86f (4); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Kulmac, </em>230 Conn. 43, 50-56, 644 A.2d 887 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">With respect to harmfulness of the ruling, I join Justice Berdon\u2019s dissent as to the wholesale and detailed \u201cconstancy of accusation\u201d evidence. This evidence included the complainant\u2019s detailed statement to her father, as well as to the Massachusetts state police and the Connecticut state police, upon which statement the Connecticut police acted. This evidence, offered supposedly only to corroborate her complaint and not as substantive evidence, became substantive. If there was any question about this, the state\u2019s attorney made it clear in his final argument. He suggested that the constancy of accusation witnesses believed the complainant. In arguing that the complainant was not crafty, he stated: \u201cYou would think \u2014 you know- \u2014 she\u2019s hoodwinked the Connecticut state police, the Massachusetts state police \u2014 you saw them all march in here yesterday. Friends, relatives \u2014 she\u2019s not that crafty, ladies and gentlemen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b695-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-86f provides in relevant part: \u201cSuch evidence shall be admissible only after a hearing on a motion to offer such evidence containing an offer of proof. On motion of either party the court may order such hearing held in camera, subject to the provisions of section 51-164x. <em>If the proceeding is a trial with a jury, such hearing shall be held in the absence of the jury. . . </em>(Emphasis added.) The defendant did not cite the rape shield law. The trial judge, however, referred to it when the defendant presented his motion. After the motion was presented, the triril court asked defense counsel, who was admitted to the Massachusetts bar, if he was familiar with Connecticut\u2019s rape shield law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
