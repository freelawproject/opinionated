J.</author>\n<p id=\"aok-dedup-0\">The principal issue in this appeal is whether a claim for a work-related injury by the claimant, an illegal alien, is within the jurisdictional confines of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq. We conclude that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">The following facts and procedural history are uncon-troverted. On February 14, 1994, the respondents, Sol V. Slotnik and Diane Reverand,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who are husband and wife, hired the claimant, Victoria Dowling, as a live-in housekeeper and nanny for their two sons. At that time, the claimant informed the respondents that she was an illegal alien. She also exaggerated her prior work experience on her application for employment. In return for her services, the respondents agreed to pay the claimant a gross weekly salary of $400 and provide her with health insurance, room and board, use of an automobile and an allowance toward the cost of a private telephone. The respondents did not obtain workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage for the claimant, as required by General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 31-284,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or provide the agreed upon health insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>On February 28,1994, while going to the respondents\u2019 mailbox, which was located at the end of their driveway, the claimant slipped and fell on ice that had accumulated in the driveway, seriously injuring her right arm and hand. The claimant thereafter brought a timely claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the fourth district (commissioner) determined that, despite her status as an illegal alien, the claimant was an \u201cemployee\u201d as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (9),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that her claim consequently was within the jurisdiction of the workers\u2019 compensation commission (commission). The commissioner found that the fall had caused the claimant to suffer right brachial plexopathy and reflex sympathetic dystrophy as well as right ulnar neuropathy. The commissioner also found that the claimant\u2019s injuries had arisen out of and during the course of her employment and, therefore, were compensable pursuant to \u00a7 31-284 (a). The commissioner further found that those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>injuries had caused the claimant to be totally disabled between June 24, 1994, and August 30, 1995, and that the compensation rate applicable to her claim was $325.25 per week.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The commissioner ordered the respondents to pay: (1) $20,125.22 in disability benefits for the period from June 24, 1994, through August 30, 1995; (2) disability benefits for the period from August 31, 1995, forward, subject to further medical documentation of the claimant\u2019s disability; (3) interest on past due disability benefits at the rate of 12 percent per annum and the claimant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fee;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (4) a $10,000 fine to the second injury fund for failing to secure compensation coverage for the claimant as required by \u00a7 31-284;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (5) any reasonable medical expenses incurred by the claimant as a result of the fall;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (6) the claimant\u2019s testimonial expenses.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">The respondents appealed from the order of the commissioner to the compensation review board (board) pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-301.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>affirmed the commissioner\u2019s order. Acting pro se, Slotnik appealed from the decision of the board to the Appellate Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-301b.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The claimant subsequently filed a motion in the Appellate Court seeking dismissal of Reverand\u2019s appeal for her failure to file properly. The Appellate Court issued an order granting the claimant\u2019s motion to dismiss Reverand\u2019s appeal unless a corrected appeal was filed on or before May 29, 1997. On May 28, 1997, both respondents, acting pro se, filed a corrected appeal. We transferred the corrected appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 65-1, and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">On appeal, the respondents claim that the commissioner improperly determined that the claimant had sustained a compensable injury. Specifically, the respondents argue that: (1) the commission\u2019s authority was preempted, under the circumstances of this case, by the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (2) the commission lacked jurisdiction over the claimant\u2019s claim because illegal aliens are not included in the group of \u201cpersons\u201d eligible for workers\u2019 compensation benefits; (3) the commission lacked jurisdiction over the claimant\u2019s claim because the employment agreement between the claimant and the respondents, having been tainted by the illegality of the claimant\u2019s immigration status, does not constitute a \u201ccontract of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>service,\u201d and, consequently, the claimant is not an \u201cemployee\u201d as defined in \u00a7 31-275 (9); (4) the commission lacked jurisdiction over the claimant\u2019s claim because the employment agreement between the claimant and the respondents was invalidated by misrepresentations the claimant made in her employment application and, therefore, does not constitute the requisite \u201ccontract of service,\u201d and, consequently, the claimant is not an \u201cemployee\u201d as defined in \u00a7 31-275 (9); and (5) the commissioner\u2019s order is violative of the respondents\u2019 due process and equal protection rights under the United States and Connecticut constitutions. The respondents further claim that the commissioner abused his discretion by ordering the respondents to pay a $10,000 fine to the second injury fund for failing to procure workers\u2019 compensation coverage for the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Before reviewing the merits of the respondents\u2019 claims, we address a challenge raised in the claimant\u2019s brief to our jurisdiction over Reverand\u2019s appeal. The claimant argues that Reverand\u2019s appeal is not properly before this court because the Appellate Court lacked authority to permit the respondents to file a corrected appeal. In effect, the claimant contends that the Appellate Court lacked authority to allow Reverand to file a late appeal. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">\u201cWe note at the onset that... a claim that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction [may be raised] at any time. Subject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of the court to adjudicate the type of controversy presented by the action before it. . . . The objection of want of [subject matter] jurisdiction may be made at any time . . . and the court or tribunal may act on its own motion, and should do so when the lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>jurisdiction is called to its attention. . . . The requirement of subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived by any party and can be raised at any stage in the proceedings. ... If at any point, it becomes apparent to the court that such jurisdiction is lacking, the appeal must be dismissed. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous, </em>240 Conn. 708, 718, 694 A.2d 766 (1997); see <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Gaming Policy Board, </em>224 Conn. 693, 698-99, 620 A.2d 780 (1993); <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Rozbicki, </em>211 Conn. 232, 245, 558 A.2d 986 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Malkowski, </em>189 Conn. 101, 104, 454 A.2d 275 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Section 31-30 lb authorizes a party aggrieved by a final decision of the board to appeal from the board\u2019s decision to the Appellate Court. See <em>Cleveland </em>v. <em>U.S. Printing Ink, Inc., </em>218 Conn. 181, 184-85, 588 A.2d 194 (1991). Practice Book \u00a7 4165, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 76-1, provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he practice and procedure for appeals to the appellate court (1) from a decision of the compensation review board . . . shall conform to the rules of practice governing other appeals.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 4009 (a), now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 63-1 (a), provides in relevant part that \u201ca party shall have twenty days from the [date notice is given of the board\u2019s decision] ... to file an appeal . . . .\u201d It is undisputed that Reverand\u2019s appeal was not filed properly until after the twenty day limit established by \u00a7 4009 (a) had expired. The twenty day time limitation established by \u00a7 4009 (a), however, is not a \u201c \u2018constitutionally or legislatively created condition precedent to the jurisdiction of [the appellate] court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ambroise </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>226 Conn. 757, 763, 628 A.2d 1303 (1993); see <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Bonney, </em>221 Conn. 549, 558-59, 606 A.2d 693 (1992); <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>213 Conn. 66, 69-70 n.5, 566 A.2d 426 (1989). Furthermore, Practice Book \u00a7 4183, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 60-2, explicitly provides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>\u201cthe court having appellate jurisdiction from the time the appeal is filed, or earlier . . . may, on its own motion ... (6) order that a party for good cause shown may file a late appeal. . . .\u201d We eschew \u201cmechanistic interpretation^] of our appellate rules in recognition of the fact that an unyielding policy requiring strict adherence to an appellate limitation period \u2014 no matter how severe or unfair the consequences \u2014 does not serve the interests of justice.\u201d <em>Banks </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>241 Conn. 569, 586, 698 A.2d 268 (1997). Practice Book \u00a7 4183 (6) vested the Appellate Court with authority to permit Reverand to pursue a late appeal, and, consequently, her appeal is properly before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">We turn now to the respondents\u2019 substantive claims. We note that ordinarily we would not address the respondents\u2019 claim that the commission\u2019s authority to award workers\u2019 compensation benefits to the claimant was preempted by the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (Immigration Reform Act) until after the respondents\u2019 remaining jurisdictional claims had been resolved, because if the commission lacked jurisdiction over the claimant\u2019s claim for benefits, we would not need to consider the respondents\u2019 federal preemption claim. Because, however, the respondents\u2019 jurisdictional claims are inextricably intertwined with the Immigration Reform Act, we depart, for purposes of clarity, from our usual practice and first discuss the respondents\u2019 preemption claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">We begin with a brief overview of the purpose and relevant provisions of the Immigration Reform Act. \u201cThe [Immigration Reform Act] constituted a major . . . response to the vast tide of illegal immigration that had produced a \u2018shadow population\u2019 of literally millions of undocumented aliens in the United States.\u201d <em>McNary </em>v. <em>Haitian Refugee Center, Inc., </em>498 U.S. 479, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>481, 111 S. Ct. 888, 112 L. Ed. 2d 1005 (1991); see <em>Etuk </em>v. <em>Slattery, </em>936 F.2d 1433, 1437 (2d Cir. 1991). The Immigration Reform Act sought to reduce the flow of illegal immigration into the United States by removing the employment \u201cmagnet\u201d that draws undocumented aliens into the country. <em>Montero </em>v. <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, </em>124 F.3d 381, 384 (2d Cir. 1997); see H.R. Rep. No. 99-682(1), 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 45-46, 56 (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5649, 5649-50, 5660. The goal of the Immigration Reform Act was \u201cto reduce the incentives for employers to hire illegal aliens.\u201d <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>A.P.R.A. Fuel Oil Buyers Group, Inc., </em>134 F.3d 50, 55 (2d Cir. 1997); see <em>Patel </em>v. <em>Quality Inn South, </em>846 F.2d 700, 704 (11th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1011, 109 S. Ct. 1120,103 L. Ed. 2d 182 (1989) (Immigration Reform Act was designed to eliminate economic incentive to hire undocumented aliens); accord <em>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission </em>v. <em>Tortilleria \u201cLa Mejor,\" </em>758 F. Sup. 585, 591 (E.D. Cal. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Consistent with these goals, the Immigration Reform Act makes it unlawful knowingly to employ unauthorized workers. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a (a). Employers are required to verify that each of their employees is authorized to work in the United States and to complete an employment eligibility verification form, attesting that the employer has examined certain types of documents and has verified that the potential employee is not an unauthorized alien. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a (b). Civil fines may be imposed on an employer who violates the verification requirements or knowingly employs an unauthorized alien. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a (e) (4) and (5). A pattern or practice of knowingly employing unauthorized aliens may result in the infliction of criminal punishment. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a (f). In addition, the Immigration Reform Act provides that <em>\u201c[t]he provisions of [\u00a7 1324a] preempt any State or local law imposing civil or criminal </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number><em>sanctions . . . upon those who employ . . . unauthorized aliens.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a 00 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">\u201cThe question of preemption is one of federal law, arising under the supremacy clause of the United States constitution. . . . Determining whether Congress has exercised its power to preempt state law is a question of legislative intent.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Serrano </em>v. <em>Serrano, </em>213 Conn. 1, 5, 566 A.2d413 (1989); <em>see Northwest Central Pipeline Corp. </em>v. <em>State Corp. Commission of Kansas, </em>489 U.S. 493, 509, 109 S. Ct. 1262, 103 L. Ed. 2d 509 (1989). Preemption may be express or implied. <em>Assn. of International Automobile Manufacturers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Abrams, </em>84 F.3d 602, 607 (2d Cir. 1996). \u201cExpress preemption occurs to the extent that a federal statute expressly directs that state law be ousted to some degree from a certain field. . . . Even where there is no express statutory statement ousting state law from a given area, [however] there may be implied preemption.\u201d Id. \u201cThe United States Supreme Court has instructed us that, absent an explicit statement that Congress intends to preempt state law, courts should infer such intent where Congress has legislated comprehensively to occupy an entire field of regulation, leaving no room for the States to supplement federal law, <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Santa Fe Elevator Corp., </em>331 U.S. 218, 67 S. Ct. 1146, 91 L. Ed. 1447 (1947), or where the state law at issue conflicts with federal law, either because it is impossible to comply with both, <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Paul, </em>373 U.S. 132, 142-43, 83 S. Ct. 1210, 1217-18, 10 L. Ed. 2d 248 [reh. denied, 374 U.S. 858, 83 S. Ct. 1861, 10 L. Ed. 2d 1082] (1963), or because the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of congressional objectives, <em>Hines </em>v. <em>Davidowitz, </em>312 U.S. 52, 67, 61 S. Ct. 399, 404, 85 L. Ed. 581 (1941).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Serrano </em>v. <em>Serrano, </em>supra, 6; see <em>Northwest Central </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number><em>Pipeline Corp. </em>v. <em>State Corp. Commission of Kansas, </em>supra, 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">The respondents make two arguments in support of their claim that the Immigration Reform Act preempted the commissioner from awarding workers\u2019 compensation benefits to the claimant. They argue that to the extent that a workers\u2019 compensation award requires an employer to make payments to an undocumented alien, the award constitutes a civil sanction against the employer that is expressly preempted by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a (h) (2), the preemption provision of the Immigration Reform Act, and, in the alternative, that such an award impliedly is preempted by the Immigration Reform Act because providing workers\u2019 compensation benefits to an undocumented alien contravenes the purpose of the Immigration Reform Act. We disagree with both claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">We turn first to the respondents\u2019 claim that the Immigration Reform Act expressly preempts the commissioner from awarding workers\u2019 compensation benefits to undocumented aliens. Section 1324a (h) (2), the express preemption provision of the Immigration Reform Act, only prohibits the states from imposing civil <em>sanctions </em>upon those who employ undocumented aliens. Because workers\u2019 compensation benefits are designed \u201c \u2018to <em>compensate the worker for injuries </em>arising out of and in the course of employment, <em>without regard to fault, </em>by imposing a form of strict liability on the employer\u2019 (emphasis added) <em>Panaro </em>v. <em>Electrolux Corp., </em>208 Conn. 589, 598-99, 545 A.2d 1086 (1988); <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>179 Conn. 215, 217, 425 A.2d 1263 (1979); an award of such benefits reasonably cannot be described as a \u201csanction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">Moreover, even if we assume, arguendo, that workers\u2019 compensation benefits somehow do constitute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>\u201csanction\u201d rather than a compensatory remedy, the respondents\u2019 argument that \u00a7 1324a (h) (2) proscribes awards of workers\u2019 compensation benefits to illegal aliens is still unpersuasive. Section 1324a (h) (2) does not preempt the states from imposing any civil sanction <em>whatsoever </em>upon a person who employs an undocumented alien. Rather, the Immigration Reform Act expressly preempts the states from sanctioning an employer only <em>for employing an undocumented alien. </em>To construe the express preemption provision of the Immigration Reform Act otherwise would result in state and local officials being unable to impose even a traffic fine upon aperson who has employed an undocumented alien, an obviously absurd result. Accordingly, in order for an award of compensation benefits to an undocumented alien to fall within the purview of \u00a7 1324a (h) (2), the benefits must have been awarded <em>because the employee was an illegal alien. </em>The respondents, however, do not contend that the legislature intended that an award of workers\u2019 compensation benefits serve as a means of penalizing employers <em>for employing undocumented aliens, </em>nor do they claim that the commissioner awarded benefits to the claimant in order to sanction the respondents <em>for hiring the claimant, </em>and nothing in the record even suggests that was the case. We conclude, therefore, that the commissioner\u2019s award of workers\u2019 compensation benefits to the claimant does not constitute a civil sanction that is preempted by \u00a7 1324a (h), the express preemption provision of the Immigration Reform Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The respondents also maintain that to the extent that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act authorizes the commissioner to award benefits to undocumented aliens, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act <em>impliedly </em>is preempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>by the Immigration Reform Act.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201c[A] federal statute implicitly overrides state law either when the scope of a statute indicates that Congress intended federal law to occupy a field exclusively ... or when state law is in actual conflict with federal law. [The United States Supreme Court has] found implied conflict pre-emption where it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements ... or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Freightliner Corp. </em>v. <em>Myrick, </em>514 U.S. 280, 287, 115 S. Ct. 1483, 131 L. Ed. 2d 385 (1995); <em>Silkwood </em>v. <em>Kerr-McGee Corp., </em>464 U.S. 238, 248, 104 S. Ct. 615, 78 L.

The respondents do not claim that the Immigration Reform Act was intended to \u201coccupy [the] field\u201d or that it is impossible for employers to comply with the requirements of both the Immigration Reform Act and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, but argue instead that providing workers\u2019 compensation benefits to an undocumented alien would contravene the purpose of the Immigration Reform Act. \u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against federal preemption of state and local legislation.\u201d <em>Richmond Boro Gun Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>New York, </em>97 F.3d 681, 687 (2d Cir. 1996); see <em>California </em>v. <em>ARC America Corp., </em>490 U.S. 93, 101, 109 S. Ct. 1661, 104 L. Ed. 2d 86 (1989). This presumption is especially strong in areas traditionally occupied by the states, such as public health and safety. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number><em>Richmond Boro Gun Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra, 687; see <em>English </em>v. <em>General Electric Co., </em>496 U.S. 72, 79, 110 S. Ct. 2270, 110 L. Ed. 2d 65 (1990). Consideration of issues arising under the supremacy clause \u201c \u2018start[s] with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States [are] not to be superseded by . . . Federal Act unless that [is] the <em>clear and manifest </em>purpose of Congress.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Medtronic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lohr, </em>518 U.S. 470, 485, 116 S. Ct. 2240, 135 L.

Ed. 2d 695 (1995); <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Santa Fe Elevator Corp., </em>supra, 331 U.S. 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">The primary purpose of the Immigration Reform Act was to establish procedures that make it more difficult to employ undocumented workers and to punish employers who knowingly offer jobs to those workers. <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>A.P.R.A.

The Immigration Reform Act itself gives no indication that Congress intended the act to preempt state laws whenever state laws operate to benefit undocumented aliens. Indeed, \u201cit is clear from [the] legislative history [of the Immigration Reform Act] that Congress anticipated some conflict between the new statute and . . . various state . . . statutes ....

More important, excluding such workers from the pool of eligible employees would relieve employers from the obligation of obtaining workers\u2019 compensation coverage for such employees and thereby contravene the purpose of the Immigration Reform Act by creating a financial incentive for unscrupulous employers to hire undocumented workers.

Section 31-275 (9) (A) (i) defines \u201cemployee\u201d in relevant part as <em>\u201cany person </em>who ... [h]as entered into or works under <em>any contract of service . . . </em>with an employer . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) As is often the case in the context of workers\u2019 compensation legislation; see <em>Duni </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>supra, 239 Conn. 25; <em>Dos Santos </em>v. <em>F. D. Rich Construction Co., </em>233 Conn. 14, 20, 658 A.2d 83 (1995); the statutory language provides no <em>express </em>guidance as to whether the legislature intended to include illegal aliens in the group of \u201cpersons\u201d for whom the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provides the exclusive means of obtaining compensation for work-related injuries. The legislature\u2019s use of the term <em>\u201cany </em>person\u201d; (emphasis added); rather than <em>\u201ca </em>person,\u201d however, strongly suggests an intent to include all workers, rather than only workers legally present in this country, within the group of persons able to invoke the remedy provided by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Moreover, the fact that \u00a7 31-275 (9) (B) expressly excludes certain persons, but not illegal aliens, from the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d also suggests that the legislature did not intend to exclude illegal aliens from the purview of \u00a7 31-275 (9). \u201c[U]nless there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>is evidence to the contrary, statutory itemization indicates that the legislature intended the list to be exclusive.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Zachs </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>207 Conn. 683, 692-93, 542 A.2d 1145 (1988); see also <em>B.

The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act has been a part of our law since 1913. See Public Acts 1913, c. 138; see <em>also Bouley v. Norwich, </em>222 Conn. 744, 751, 610 A.2d 1245 (1992); A. Grillo, \u201cFifty Years of Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u2014 An Historical Review,\u201d 38 Conn. B.J. 239, 246 (1964). When enacted in 1913, it defined \u201cemployee\u201d as meaning \u201cany person who has entered into or works under any contract of service or apprenticeship with an employer. . . .\u201d Public Acts 1913, c. 138, pt. B, \u00a7 43. Although the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act subsequently has been amended to exclude certain persons from the operative definition of \u201cemployee\u201d; see General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (9) (B); and to bring certain public employees who do not work under a \u201ccontract of service\u201d within the purview of the act; see General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (9) (A) (iii) through (vi); the operative definition of \u201cemployee\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>has remained unchanged since 1913. See General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (9) (A) (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">We turn next to the legislative history of chapter 138 of the 1913 Public Acts. \u201cIt is now well settled that testimony before legislative committees maybe considered in determining the particular problem or issue that the legislature sought to address by the legislation. . . . This is because legislation is a purposive act . . . and, therefore, identifying the particular problem that the legislature sought to resolve helps to identify the purpose or purposes for which the legislature used the language in question.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New </em>Haven, 240 Conn. 422, 450, 692 A.2d 742 (1997); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>240 Conn. 317, 337, 692 A.2d 713 (1997); <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 430-31 n.15, 650 A.2d 557 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnano, </em>204 Conn. 259, 273-74 n.8, 528 A.2d 760 (1987). During the committee hearings on the bill that ultimately became chapter 138 of the 1913 Public Acts, Professor Willard C. Fisher, an economist from Wesleyan University who had been engaged by the standing committees on judiciary and labor to assist in drafting the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act; A. Grillo, supra, 38 Conn. B.J. 244-45; remarked that \u201c[u]nless the employer is required to pay the same [insurance premium for all workers] . . . he is . . . under inducement to take on [uncovered workers] . . . [the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] must not . . . exclude aliens from the benefits; because there would be precisely the same inducement under such a provision for an employer to take on the men who are not citizens of the country.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, supra, p. 124. He further stated that \u201cthe [proposed] bill is open to serious criticism . . . [and] you must not allow . . . discrimination between aliens and residents and citizens. . . . Connecticut cannot afford to discriminate against the employment of her own citizens . . . .\u201d Id., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>pp. 226-27. In light of the legislature\u2019s explicit consideration of whether aliens should be excluded from the purview of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the fact that, when ultimately adopted, chapter 138 of the 1913 Public Acts did not contain a provision excluding aliens from the statutory scheme is clear evidence that the legislature intended aliens to come within the statutory definition of an employee as <em>\u201cany person </em>who . . . enters into or works under <em>any contract of service . . . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (9) (A) (i); see Public Acts 1913, c. 138, pt. B, \u00a7 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Furthermore, we previously have stated that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u201capplies to <em>every natural or artificial person who enters upon a contract of </em>employment(emphasis added) <em>Douthwright </em>v. <em>Champlin, </em>91 Conn. 524, 528, 100 A. 97 (1917); and \u201cincludes <em>every alien </em>of any nationality.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Frasca </em>v. <em>City Coal Co., </em>97 Conn. 212, 214, 116 A. 189 (1922). \u201c[The] language [of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] is not that of restriction or limitation, but all-embracing. . . . [I]t applies to <em>\u2018all contracts </em>of employment,\u2019 and this was intended to mean ... by <em>whomsoever made. </em>... It defines an employer and an employee as \u2018any person.\u2019 <em>It excepts certain classes, and the designation of these exceptions marks the only limitation upon the definition.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Douthwright </em>v. <em>Champlin, </em>supra, 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">There is nothing in the language or legislative history of \u00a7 31-275 (9) (A) (i) to indicate that the legislature intended to include legal aliens but exclude illegal aliens from the purview of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, and the rationale for not excluding aliens from the group of \u201cpersons\u201d potentially able to invoke the remedy provided by the act applies with equal force to both legal and illegal aliens. Moreover, at the time \u00a7 31-275 (9) (A) (i) was enacted, it was not unlawful for an employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>to hire an undocumented alien, nor was it a criminal offense for an alien to accept employment after entering this <em>country </em>illegally. See <em>Sure-Tan, Inc. </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Board, </em>supra, 467 U.S. 893. Consequently, there is no evidence to suggest that the legislature, having intended to include aliens within the purview of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, did not also intend an employment agreement between an employer and a worker who is an illegal alien to constitute a \u201ccontract of service\u201d within the meaning of the act. We conclude, therefore, that the legislature intended to include illegal aliens in the group of \u201cpersons\u201d who, in order to obtain compensation for work-related injuries, are not only eligible, but also required, to invoke the remedy provided by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and that the legislature intended employment agreements between illegal aliens and their employers to constitute \u201ccontract[s] of service\u201d as is required by \u00a7 31-275 (9) (A) (i) to establish the employer-employee relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">The respondents nevertheless maintain that even if illegal aliens come within the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d provided by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the employment agreement between the claimant and the respondents, having been tainted by illegality as a result of the claimant\u2019s immigration status and the respondents\u2019 actions in knowingly employing an undocumented alien, does not constitute a \u201ccontract of service\u201d as is required by \u00a7 31-275 (9) (A) (i). Specifically, the respondents reason that: (1) the employment agreement between the respondents and the claimant is an \u201cillegal\u201d contract; (2) such contracts are \u201cnull and void\u201d; and (3) consequently, there was no \u201ccontract\u201d and, therefore, no \u201ccontract of service\u201d between the claimant and the respondents. Although we agree with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>the respondents that \u201cunder the [Workers\u2019 Compensation A]ct . . . coverage must arise from a contract of employment, either express or implied\u201d; <em>Blancato </em>v. <em>Feldspar </em>Corp., 203 Conn. 34, 38, 522 A.2d 1235 (1987); <em>Sibley </em>v. <em>State, </em>89 Conn. 682, 686-87, 96 A. 161 (1915); we do not agree that an employment agreement between an employer and an illegal alien is so tainted by illegality that, as a matter of law, the agreement cannot constitute a \u201ccontract of service\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 31-275 (9) (A) (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">In dictum in <em>Kenez </em>v. <em>Novelty Compact Leather Co., </em>111 Conn. 229, 234-35, 149 A. 679 (1930), the only case in which this court previously has considered what impact, if any, a taint of illegality in an employment agreement has upon a worker\u2019s status as an employee under \u00a7 31-275 (9) (A) (i), we discussed, but did not apply to the employment agreement at issue, the common-law doctrine against judicial enforcement of \u201cillegal\u201d contracts. Accordingly, a brief overview of that doctrine is helpful before we turn to the merits of the respondents\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">As a general rule, a \u201ccourt will [not] lend its assistance in any way toward carrying out the terms of a contract, the <em>inherent purpose </em>of which is to violate the law . . . but if both parties are in pari delicto, the law will leave them where it finds them.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Tator </em>v. <em>Valden, </em>124 Conn. 96, 101, 198 A. 169 (1938); see <em>Connecticut Importing Co. </em>v. <em>Janowitz, </em>128 Conn. 433, 436, 23 A.2d 514 (1941); <em>Vaszauskas </em>v. <em>Vaszauskas, </em>115 Conn. 418, 423, 161 A. 856 (1932). \u201cIt is not for [a defendant\u2019s] sake however that the objection [to enforcement of the contract] is ever allowed, but [the court\u2019s refusal to enforce the contract] is <em>founded in general principles of policy </em>[of] which the defendant has the advantage . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Funk </em>v. <em>Gallivan, </em>49 Conn. 124,128 (1881); see <em>Beit v.

Thus, it is in order to effectuate an underlying public policy, rather than to sanction a party seeking to enforce an \u201cillegal\u201d contract, that courts refuse to lend assistance to those who have contributed to the illegality that taints the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">In <em>Kenez </em>v. <em>Novelty Compact Leather Co., </em>supra, 111 Conn. 229, as in the present case, the taint of illegality did not arise by virtue of a contractual provision that required the employee to engage in an unlawful activity. Instead, it arose in connection with a child labor statute, which, like the Immigration Reform Act, had not been enacted at the time the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was adopted and which, like the Immigration Reform Act, prohibited the making of certain employment agreements.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Id., 234-35. Seeking to avoid liability under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the employer maintained that the employment agreement at issue in <em>Kenez </em>did not constitute a \u201ccontract of service\u201d because the \u201clegislature must . . . have intended ... to include only legal contracts and therefore it cannot have intended to include one made in violation of [the child labor] statute.\u201d Id., 234. The court determined that construing the employment agreement to constitute a \u201ccontract of service\u201d under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act would accord with both the language and legislative intent of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Id., 236-37. The court noted that, with respect to the violation of the child labor law, the parties were not in pari delicto and that the common-law doctrine against judicial enforcement of \u201cillegal\u201d contracts might preclude a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>court from enforcing the <em>employer\u2019s </em>rights under the prohibited employment agreement. Id., 234; see <em>Blan-cato </em>v. <em>Feldspar Corp., </em>supra, 203 Conn. 38-39. Seeking to ascertain the legislature\u2019s intent regarding the relevant statutes; <em>Kenez </em>v. <em>Novelty Compact Leather Co., </em>supra, 232; the court considered the effect that construing employment agreements involving illegally employed minors as \u201ccontracts of service\u201d would have on the public policy underlying the child labor law and concluded that giving effect to the contract would further, rather than impede, that policy. Id., 236. Observing that \u201c[w]hatever the legal situation with reference to the employment of a minor in contravention of the [child labor] statute, <em>he is in fact an employee, </em>working for and under the direction of his employer\u201d; (emphasis added) id.; the court concluded that the taint of illegality that had attached to the employment agreement by virtue of the child labor statute did not preclude the court from effectuating the legislature\u2019s intent with respect to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act by construing the tainted employment agreement to be a \u201ccontract of service\u201d and thereby bringing the claimant\u2019s claim within the jurisdictional confines of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Id., 236-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">We turn now to the merits of the respondents\u2019 claim that the illegal taint attached to the employment agreement between the respondents and the claimant by virtue of the claimant\u2019s immigration status precludes that agreement from constituting a \u201ccontract of service\u201d under \u00a7 31-275 (9) (A) (i). Having already determined on the basis of the language and legislative history of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act that including illegal aliens within the scope of \u00a7 31-275 (9) (A) (i) accords with the language and apparent legislative intent of that act, we turn to the question of whether effectuating that intent would contravene the public policy underlying the Immigration Reform Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>The primary purpose of the Immigration Reform Act was to establish procedures that inhibit the employment of undocumented workers and to punish employers who knowingly offer jobs to those workers. <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>A.P.R.A. Fuel Oil Buyers Group, Inc., </em>supra, 134 F.3d 55-56. The goal of the Immigration Reform Act was \u201cto reduce the incentives for employers to hire illegal aliens.\u201d Id. As the legislative history of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act indicates, if employers who knowingly employ illegal aliens were able to avoid liability under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act for work-related injuries sustained by those workers, there would be no reason for such employers to obtain workers\u2019 compensation coverage for undocumented workers. Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, supra, p. 124. Permitting employers to avoid liability under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, therefore, would not only provide employers with a financial incentive to hire illegal aliens in contravention of the policy of nondiscrimination embodied in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act; id., p. 227; it would also provide unscrupulous employers with an incentive to employ undocumented workers; id., p. 124; <em>Mendoza </em>v. <em>Monmouth Recycling Corp., </em>supra, 288 N. J. Super. 247; <em>Montoya </em>v. <em>Gateway Ins. Co., </em>supra, 168 N.J. Super. 104; see also <em>Sure-Tan, Inc. </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Board, </em>supra, 467 U.S. 893; <em>Patel </em>v. <em>Quality Inn South, </em>supra, 846 F.2d 704; and thereby violate the Immigration Reform Act. We conclude, therefore, that including employment agreements between illegal aliens and their employers within the purview of \u201ccontracts of service\u201d under \u00a7 31-275 (9) (A) (i) not only would effectuate the intent of the legislature with respect to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, it also would accord with, rather than contravene, the public policy Congress espoused when the Immigration Reform Act was enacted. Because construing the employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>agreement between the claimant and the respondents as a \u201ccontract of service\u201d under \u00a7 31-275 (9) (A) (i) would not contravene the public policy implemented when the Immigration Reform Act was enacted, we also conclude that judicial enforcement of the claimant\u2019s rights under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act cannot be said to undermine either the common-law doctrine against judicial enforcement of \u201cillegal\u201d contracts or the effect, if any, that doctrine may have upon the enforceability of both the claimant\u2019s and the respondents\u2019 contractual rights under their employment agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">In relying on the doctrine against judicial enforcement of \u201cillegal\u201d contracts, the respondents, in effect, urge us to recognize an exception to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act for reasons of public policy. We, however, consistently have eschewed recognizing such exceptions, repeatedly observing that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u201c \u2018represents a complex and comprehensive statutory scheme balancing the rights and claims of the employer and the employee arising out of work-related personal injuries\u2019 <em>Libby </em>v. <em>Goodwin Pontiac-GMC Truck, Inc., </em>241 Conn. 170, 174, 695 A.2d 1036 (1997); <em>Durniak </em>v. <em>August Winter &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>222 Conn. 775, 781, 610 A.2d 1277 (1992); and that \u201c \u2018the responsibility for carving out exceptions from any one of its provisions belongs to the legislature and not to the courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Libby </em>v. <em>Goodwin Pontiac-GMC Truck, Inc., </em>supra, 174-75; <em>Durniak </em>v. <em>August Winter &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>supra, 781; <em>Bouley </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 760; <em>Panaro </em>v. <em>Electrolux Corp., </em>supra, 208 Conn. 605; <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>supra, 196 Conn. 106. \u201cBecause of the statutory nature of our workers\u2019 compensation system, policy determinations as to what . . . jurisdictional limitations apply . . . <em>are for the legislature, not the judiciary </em>... to make.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Discuillo </em>v. <em>Stone &amp; Webster, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>Moreover, there is support for the proposition that an illegal alien\u2019s immigration status does not, as a matter of public policy, preclude him from falling within the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d in \u00a7 31-275 (9) (A) (i). We find that support in the fact that when the legislature acted to exclude illegal aliens from eligibility for unemployment compensation<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and general assistance,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> it took no action to amend the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act to exclude illegal aliens. We conclude, therefore, that any illegality that attached to the employment agreement between the claimant and the respondents, by virtue of the claimant\u2019s immigration status and the respondents\u2019 actions in knowingly employing an undocumented alien, does not preclude that employment agreement from constituting a \u201ccontract of service\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 31-275 (9) (A) (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">Finally, we note that our conclusion that the claimant\u2019s immigration status does not preclude the claimant from meeting the jurisdictional standard of \u201cemployee\u201d under \u00a7 31-275 (9) is consistent with the view of a majority of our sister states that \u201c[violation of a statute or commission of a crime does not affect a [workers\u2019] compensation claim when the illegal feature of the conduct was not the causative factor in producing the injury.\u201d 2 A.

Specifically, the respondents reason that: (1) the claimant misrepresented her employment history on her application for employment with the respondents; (2) those misrepresentations render the employment agreement between the claimant and the respondents \u201cvoid ab initio\u201d; and (3) consequently, there was no \u201ccontract\u201d and, therefore, no \u201ccontract of service\u201d between the claimant and the respondents. Here, too, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">In essence, the respondents ask that we recognize an exception to eligibility under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act in order to effectuate a public policy against resume fraud. This we cannot do. We reiterate that \u201cthe responsibility for carving out exceptions from any one of [the] provisions [of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] belongs to the legislature and not to the courts\u201d; <em>Libby </em>v. <em>Goodwin Pontiac-GMC Truck, Inc., </em>supra, 241 Conn. 174 \u2014 75; <em>Durniak </em>v. <em>August Winter &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>supra, 222 Conn. 781; <em>Bouley </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 760-61; <em>Panaro </em>v. <em>Electrolux Corp., </em>supra, 208 Conn. 605; <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>supra, 196 Conn. 106; and that \u201c[b]ecause of the statutory nature of our workers\u2019 compensation system, policy determinations as to what . . . jurisdictional limitations apply . . . <em>are for the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number><em>legislature, not the judiciary </em>... to make.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Discuillo </em>v. <em>Stone &amp; Webster, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 577. \u201cAlthough we recognize that, in enacting workers\u2019 compensation law, the legislature did not intend to create \u201c \u2018a general health and benefit insurance program\u2019 <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 698; <em>Hansen v.

General Statutes \u00a7 31-290c provides criminal and civil penalties for making a fraudulent claim for compensation benefits, and General Statutes \u00a7 31-290d establishes the workers\u2019 compensation fraud unit of the chief state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office to investigate fraudulent claims. There is nothing whatsoever in those provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act to suggest that in addition to imposing penalties upon persons who fraudulently attempt to obtain benefits, the legislature also intended to sanction workers who make misrepresentations on their employment applications. Mindful that the theme of legislative preeminence guides our construction of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act we decline the respondents\u2019 request for recognition of a resume fraud exception to that act. Such exception must come, if at all, from the legislature.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">The respondents further claim that the commissioner\u2019s order awarding benefits to the claimant is violative of their equal protection and due process rights under the United States and Connecticut constitutions.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> They reason that: (1) the claimant\u2019s immigration status precludes her from obtaining lawful employment,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and consequently, if and when the claimant becomes able to work, she will not be able to do so; (2) because the claimant will be unable to work, the respondents will be required to continue making total disability payments to the claimant regardless of the fact that she is no longer disabled; and (3) those payments, therefore, will deprive the respondents of equal protection and due process. The respondents\u2019 argument is based, therefore, on a hypothetical factual situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">We frequently have noted \u201c \u2018the imprudence of adjudicating constitutional questions in a \u201cfactual vacuum.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>227 Conn. 829, 844, 633 A.2d 296 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>217 Conn. 73, 78, 584 A.2d 1157 (1991); <em>Lehrer v.

Thus, unless the activities the claimant engaged in pursuant to her duties as a nanny and live-in housekeeper were otherwise unlawful, the employment agreement between the claimant and the respondents reasonably cannot be said to have required the claimant to commit a criminal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Moreover, in concluding that workers\u2019 compensation benefits provide an incentive for illegal aliens to enter this country, the dissent relies on the fact that federal law has been amended to preclude illegal aliens from receiving federal public benefits. The legislation to which the dissent refers is the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-193, 110 Stat. 2105, 2260. We agree that eligibility for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>public benefits such as welfare, food stamps and public housing operates as an incentive to enter or remain in this country illegally. We do not agree, however, that requiring an illegal alien who has sustained a work-related injury to forgo his right to bring a tort claim for damages against his employer and to accept, instead, workers\u2019 compensation benefits as compensatory damages for his injury provides a similar incentive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b835-7\"> As a practical matter, recognition of such an exception would lead to every workers\u2019 compensation claim being investigated to determine whether the claimant had made a misstatement when hired. The commissioner consequently would be required to adjudicate questions of fact in a forum that is not suited for making wide-ranging factual determinations. See General Statutes \u00a7 31-298 (commissioner not bound by rules of evidence; no formal pleadings required).

I do not agree that an illegal alien engaged in an illegal contract of employment is eligible for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. As the majority points out, the right to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits arises only in an employer-employee relationship. <em>Kinney </em>v. <em>State, </em>213 Conn. 54, 60, 566 A.2d 670 (1989). Such benefits are granted \u201cwithout regard to fault\u201d and imposed as \u201ca form of strict liability on the employer.\u201d <em>Panaro </em>v. <em>Electrolux Corp., </em>208 Conn. 589, 599, 545 A.2d 1086 (1988). The employment relationship is, therefore, at the heart of workers\u2019 compensation coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">This case concerns an alien, the claimant, Victoria Dowling, who illegally remained in the United States and a Connecticut couple, the named respondent, Sol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>Slotnik, and the respondent Diane Reverand, who, knowing her status, hired her as a live-in nanny and housekeeper. The alien claims a 1994 work-related injury and compensation. The respondents claimed no responsibility for such benefits because the claimant was an illegal alien.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Contrary to the majority, I conclude that employment benefits are an incentive for illegal immigrants to enter or remain in this country. Whatever effect requiring those hiring illegal aliens to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits may have to discourage that practice, it cannot be disputed that our decision confers employment benefits on illegal aliens. In doing so, it obviously makes employment in this country more attractive. In 1996, Congress explicitly recognized the compelling government interest to remove the incentive for illegal immigration provided by the availability of public benefits. It then provided that illegal aliens in general are not eligible for any federal public benefits. Pub. L. 104-193, Title IV, \u00a7 400, Aug. 22, 1996, 110 Stat. 2260.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">The effect of creating an incentive for the illegal immigrant to enter or remain in this country leads me to conclude that the contract of service in this case was illegal and does not give rise to workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq., entering into the contract was illegal, the parties committed a criminal act by doing so, and the contract required the alien to commit a criminal act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The majority recognizes such an illegal contract, entered into illegally by both the illegal alien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>and the knowing respondents. In <em>Kenez </em>v. <em>Novelty Compact Leather </em>Co., 111 Conn. 229, 194 A. 679 (1930), this court refused to apply the doctrine of illegal contract to deny workers\u2019 compensation benefits to a child laborer. We stated that the child was not the \u201creal wrongdoer\u201d when entering into the contract; id., 234; and that the child labor statute was plainly enacted for the benefit of children. Id., 233. In the present case, the circumstances are strikingly different. The Immigration and Nationality Act was passed to benefit not the illegal immigrant but to benefit our citizens and legal immigrants. By accepting unemployment benefits, the illegal alien deprives our citizens and legal immigrants of that employment opportunity. Moreover, the alien is the \u201creal wrongdoer\u201d creating the illegality by entering or remaining in this country illegally.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">In this case, the alien is seeking to enforce her rights to benefits which, if given, will, in my view, violate an important public policy. Our decision today, in light of the Immigration and Nationality Act, does clear and manifest damage to the goal of Congress to stem the \u201cvast tide of illegal immigration\u201d resulting in \u201cliterally millions of undocumented aliens in the United States.\u201d <em>McNary </em>v. <em>Haitian Refugee Center, Inc., </em>498 U.S. 479, 481, 111 S. Ct. 888, 112 L. Ed. 2d 1005 (1991). Concentrating our fire on the employer while at the same time conferring employment benefits on the illegal alien does not support our policy of controlling our borders. It is a mystery to me how providing state mandated employment benefits to illegal aliens will discourage them from coming to our shores or remaining here.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b840-8\"> The Immigration and Nationality Act was amended by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, Pub.
