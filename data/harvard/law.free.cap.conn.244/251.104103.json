The plaintiff, the New Milford Savings Bank (bank), brought an uncontested action against the defendants Maurice and Maria Jajer,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for foreclosure of a mortgage that they had executed as security for a $270,000 loan. Although the mortgage conveyance included three parcels of land, two vacant parcels and a third parcel containing the defendants\u2019 residence, the bank mistakenly had referred only to a description of the two vacant parcels in its foreclosure complaint and lis pendens.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On August 22,1994, the trial court, <em>Pickett, J., </em>rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure against only the two parcels described in the bank\u2019s complaint. The court found the mortgage debt to be $308,181.11 and the value of the property to be $170,000 based on an appraisal of all three parcels. In the absence of redemption of the property by the defendants or any other lien holder, title vested absolutely in the bank with the passage of the last law days on September 26, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Soon thereafter, the bank discovered its mistake in the course of federal bankruptcy proceedings initiated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>by the defendants\u2019 prayer for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362. In order to enforce its state court judgment, the bank moved the United States Bankruptcy Court, <em>Krechevsky, </em>J., to lift the automatic stay provision of the Bankruptcy Code. Relying on the defendants\u2019 concession that the bank\u2019s mortgage remained in effect on the omitted third parcel, the Bankruptcy Court found that the defendants retained no equity in the third parcel. The court concluded that the bank had a colorable claim to the third parcel and, on February 23, 1995, lifted the stay<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to enable the bank \u201cto take whatever action is appropriate in state court under the circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Returning to Superior Court, the bank moved to open the judgment of strict foreclosure. Despite the defendants\u2019 objection, the court, <em>R. Walsh, J., </em>granted the motion and permitted the bank to file an amended complaint requesting new law days for the omitted third parcel. On May 15, 1995, the trial court, <em>Pickett, J., </em>granted the bank\u2019s motion to render \u201cjudgment of strict foreclosure upon the amended complaint containing all other terms previously entered . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Before the law day on the third parcel had passed, the defendants appealed to the Appellate Court, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>reversed the judgment of the trial court in light of its conclusion that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to open the 1994 foreclosure judgment. The court construed the last sentence of \u00a7 49-15<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to preclude further trial court jurisdiction after title has vested in the foreclosing mortgagee with respect to any part of the mortgaged property. <em>New Milford Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Jajer, </em>44 Conn. App. 588, 594-95, 691 A.2d 598 (1997). In addition, the court construed \u00a7 49-1<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to preclude the bank from seeking further relief because its failure to pursue a deficiency judgment had the effect of discharging the defendants from further liability on the underlying note. Id., 595-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">The bank filed a petition for certification to appeal to this court. We granted certification to consider only the following question: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to open the judgment of foreclosure based on General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 49-15 and 49-1?\u201d <em>New Milford Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Jajer, </em>241 Conn. 906, 695 A.2d 540 (1997).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We disagree with the conclusion of the Appellate Court that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to render the 1995 foreclosure judgment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">We consider, first, the defendants\u2019 claim that \u00a7 49-15 deprived the trial court of jurisdiction to grant the bank\u2019s motions to open the judgment of foreclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>and to file an amended foreclosure complaint to correct the bank\u2019s inadvertent omission of the third parcel from its original complaint. Relying on the language of \u00a7 49-15 that \u201cno such judgment [of strict foreclosure] shall be opened after title has become absolute in any encum-brancer,\u201d the Appellate Court agreed with the defendants that the statute applied to any mortgage foreclosure, total or partial. <em>New Milford Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Jajer, </em>supra, 44 Conn. App. 594. We construe the statute differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The law governing strict foreclosure lies at the crossroads between the equitable remedies provided by the judiciary and the statutory remedies provided by the legislature.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>In re American Metal Products Co., </em>276 F.2d 701, 704 \u2014 705 (2d Cir. 1960); see <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Hillcrest Associates, </em>233 Conn. 153, 164-74, 659 A.2d 138 (1995). Because \u201cforeclosure is peculiarly an equitable action . . . the court may entertain such questions as are necessary to be determined in order that complete justice may be done.\u201d <em>Hartford Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Lenczyk, </em>153 Conn. 457, 463, 217 A.2d 694 (1966); see <em>Chappell </em>v. <em>Jardine, </em>51 Conn. 64, 69 (1883) (court of equity can devise appropriate remedy for enforcement of lawful lien). In exercising its equitable discretion, however, the court must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>comply with mandatory statutory provisions that limit the remedies available to a foreclosing mortgagee. <em>Nau-gatuck Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Fiorenzi, </em>232 Conn. 294, 305, 654 A.2d 729 (1995). It is our adjudicatory responsibility to find the appropriate accommodation between applicable judicial and statutory principles. \u201cJust as the legislature is presumed to enact legislation that renders the body of the law coherent and consistent, rather than contradictory and inconsistent . . . [so] courts must discharge their responsibility, in case by case adjudication, to assure that the body of the law \u2014 both common and statutory \u2014 remains coherent and consistent.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Fahy </em>v. <em>Fahy, </em>227 Conn. 505, 513-14, 630 A.2d 1328 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The equitable nature of foreclosure proceedings persuades us that \u00a7 49-15 does not preclude the trial court from exercising its discretion to open the judgment of strict foreclosure in the circumstances of this case. To apply the statutory mandate that, \u201cafter title [to real estate] has become absolute in any encumbrancer,\u201d a judgment of foreclosure cannot be opened, we must identify the property for which \u201ctitle has become absolute.\u201d The statute describes the relevant property as the \u201creal estate\u201d that was the subject of the initial foreclosure judgment. On its face, the statute makes no distinction between partial and total foreclosures. Whether the statute bars the bank\u2019s motion to open and amend the initial strict foreclosure judgment depends, therefore, on whether the terms of the 1994 foreclosure vested title in the bank to two or to three parcels of land. The trial court has the authority to determine the scope of the initial foreclosure judgment, and, therefore, whether the foreclosure judgment properly may be opened under \u00a7 49-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Before exercising its discretion to open the initial foreclosure to permit the bank to amend its complaint, the trial court properly held a hearing to assist it in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>deciding what property was covered by the original 1994 foreclosure judgment. See <em>Hartford Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Lenczyk, </em>supra, 153 Conn. 463 (inquiry into relevant circumstances was required to fulfill judiciary\u2019s equitable obligation \u201cin order that complete justice may be done\u201d). In this case, it was entirely reasonable for the court to conclude that the original foreclosure judgment encompassed only the two vacant parcels and not the third improved parcel. The foreclosure complaint itself was so limited, and the defendants conceded that \u201cthe Bank\u2019s mortgage remains on the third parcel . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The legal effect of the bank\u2019s inadvertent omission was that the title to the third parcel remained under a cloud. As would be true for any mortgaged property in Connecticut before foreclosure, the bank\u2019s title was a fee simple subject to defeasance by the defendants\u2019 exercise of their equity of redemption. <em>State </em>v. <em>Stonybrook, Inc., </em>149 Conn. 492, 496, 181 A.2d 601, cert. denied, 371 U.S. 185, 83 S. Ct. 265, 9 L. Ed. 2d 227 (1962). Thus, the bank\u2019s title to the third parcel was not absolute. Because no one had absolute title to the third parcel at the time of the bank\u2019s motion to open and to amend, \u00a7 49-15 did not limit the jurisdiction of the trial court to exercise its equitable discretion and modify the scope of the 1994 foreclosure judgment with respect to the third parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Moreover, as best we can determine, the legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting \u00a7 49-15 was not to preclude amendment to correct scrivener\u2019s errors, but rather to set out an orderly framework for a mortgagee\u2019s exercise of the equity of redemption.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We have no access to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>legislative history of \u00a7 49-15 because the original statute was enacted prior to the inauguration of published legislative history in 1945.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Legislators\u2019 remarks on subsequent amendments to \u00a7 49-15, however, emphasize that the purpose of \u00a7 49-15 is to ensure equitable foreclosure proceedings. For example, in 1967, when Public Acts 1967, No. 286 was enacted to delete a reference to the Circuit Court term, Representative Milton Caplan spoke in favor of the amendment, asserting that it \u201cwould permit a party equitably to come before the court and ask to reopen a judgment of foreclosure.\u201d 12 H.R. Proc., Pt. 6, 1967 Sess., p. 2717. Speaking in favor of Public Acts 1975, No. 75-11, which clarified that a court could open a judgment of foreclosure prior to the passage of the law day, even if that occurred in a subsequent court term, Representative James T. Healey explained that the bill \u201cstates specifically that the power of the court to reopen the judgment and extend the law day exists up until such time as the time for redemption has passed; in other words, [until] a person\u2019s rights have expired completely. It is a matter of equity and fairness . . . .\u201d 18 H.R. Proc., Pt. 2, 1975 Sess., pp. 904-905.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Although the foregoing legislative remarks focus on the protection of the mortgagor\u2019s equity of redemption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>rather than on the scope of a trial court\u2019s authority to open a foreclosure judgment, they shed some light on the purpose of \u00a7 49-15 and on its intended impact. First, the legislative history of those amendments emphasizes the legislature\u2019s understanding of foreclosure as an equitable proceeding and the consequent duty of the court to do justice to protect the rights of all the interested parties. Second, the remarks imply that the legislature\u2019s purpose in barring courts from opening a judgment, after the mortgagor\u2019s failure to redeem, was not to limit the mortgagee from further pursuit of its newly vested property rights but rather to prohibit the mortgagor from subsequent challenges to the enforceability of the mortgagee\u2019s property rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Neither the text of \u00a7 49-15 nor the purpose that it was intended to serve requires us to construe the statute so broadly that it would preclude trial courts from exercising their equitable discretion to correct inadvertent omissions in mortgage foreclosure proceedings. The defendants have not alleged that the bank\u2019s error caused them, in any way, to change their position to their detriment. The defendants were aware that a mortgage deed \u201cremain[ed] unreleased on the land records . . . .\u201d <em>New Milford Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Jajer, </em>supra, 44 Conn. App. 596. In these circumstances, if the defendants were to prevail on this issue, they would receive an unexpected and unjust windfall. Thus, as a matter of statutory construction, we conclude that \u00a7 49-15 does not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction to open a judgment of foreclosure to correct an inadvertent omission in a foreclosure complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">As support for its construction of \u00a7 49-15, the Appellate Court also relied on the proposition that \u201ca mortgage cannot be foreclosed piecemeal . . . .\u201d <em>New Milford Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Jajer, </em>supra, 44 Conn. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>595. We reject so categorical a limitation on the rights of a mortgagee.<footnotemark>13a</footnotemark> We need not decide, in this case, whether to go as far as the Nebraska Supreme Court, which held that, even for an intentional omission of mortgaged property, \u201c[t]he bank\u2019s action against [one parcel] does not deny it the right to enforce its multiple security interests in further actions involving different parties and different parcels of land.\u201d <em>Dupuy </em>v. <em>Western State </em>Bank, 221 Neb. 230, 237, 375 N.W.2d 909 (1985). At least in the circumstances of this case, in which the bank inadvertently omitted the third parcel from the original foreclosure action, we can discern no persuasive reason to preclude a subsequent foreclosure on the omitted parcel as a matter of law.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On this record there is no basis for a claim that the bank waived its rights to such a foreclosure.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We conclude that, consistently with its authority to exercise its equitable discretion in foreclosure proceedings, the trial court must be afforded the authority to open judgments on a case-by-case basis \u201cin order that complete justice may be done.\u201d <em>Hartford Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Lenczyk, </em>supra, 153 Conn. 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Our decision to permit partial foreclosures to be opened in appropriate circumstances is supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>public policy considerations. We agree with the Nebraska Supreme Court\u2019s observation that an unconditional ban on partial foreclosures might well disserve all the interested parties because \u201crequiring foreclosure upon all properties would needlessly involve the additional properties in litigation.\u201d <em>Dupuy </em>v. <em>Western State Bank, </em>supra, 221 Neb. 237; <em>see Michigan National Bank </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>19 Mich. App. 458, 463-64, 172 N.W.2d 920 (1969).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Furthermore, our conclusion is consistent with the law governing marshalling. Marshalling, an equitable principle, <em>requires </em>a mortgagee, in the case of a mortgage secured by several parcels of real estate, to foreclose first on those parcels that do not secure junior encumbrances.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Restatement (Third), Property, Mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>gages \u00a7 8.6, p. 633 (1997);<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> see D. Caron, Connecticut Foreclosures: An Attorney\u2019s Manual of Practice and Procedure (3d Ed. 1997) \u00a7 16.01A, p. 429; see also <em>Bry-son </em>v. <em>Newtown Real Estate &amp; Development Corp., </em>153 Conn. 267, 271-72, 216 A.2d 176 (1965). Implicit in the concept of marshalling is the understanding that a mortgagee does not waive an encumbrance on one of the parcels securing a mortgage by first foreclosing on other parcels. As long as junior lien creditors on all parcels securing the mortgage are made defendants in the foreclosure,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> so that they have an opportunity to request an apportionment if appropriate, partial foreclosure neither waives the mortgagee\u2019s encumbrance nor impairs the rights of other interested parties.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>because all the junior lienors held security interests in all three parcels of land, no junior encumbrancer was deprived of the opportunity to petition for an apportionment.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the Appellate Court improperly determined that \u00a7 49-15 deprived the trial court of jurisdiction, in the circumstances of this case, to open the judgment of foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The Appellate Court further concluded that, even if the bank\u2019s original foreclosure judgment in 1994 did not include the third parcel, the mortgage on that parcel had become unenforceable because of the bank\u2019s failure to enforce its right to a deficiency judgment against the defendants. General Statutes \u00a7 49-14.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Relying on \u00a7 49-1, the court stated that \u201ca judgment of strict foreclosure extinguishes all rights of the foreclosing mortgagee on the underlying note, with the exception of rights enforceable through the use of the deficiency judgment procedure under General Statutes \u00a7 49-14. . . . [A]ffcer the judgment of foreclosure and the running of the law days, the [bank] is no longer able to foreclose that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>mortgage because the underlying note has been extinguished.\u201d <em>New Milford Savings Bank </em>v. Jajer, supra, 47 Conn. App. 595-96. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The defendants argue that, under \u00a7 49-1, foreclosure of a mortgage bars both <em>in rem </em>and <em>in personam </em>actions on a mortgage debt. They assert that the language of \u00a7 49-1 precludes further action of both types against any person liable for such payment over whom the court could assert <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction. We reject this construction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">We begin our analysis of \u00a7 49-1 by observing that, textually, the section does not address a foreclosing mortgagee\u2019s right to enforce its interest in property that remains subject to an unreleased mortgage on the land records and that was not the subject of any previous foreclosure. Section 49-1 makes a mortgage foreclosure \u201ca bar to any further action <em>upon the mortgage debt, note or obligation against the person or persons who are liable for the payment thereof </em>who are made parties to the foreclosure . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">This text poses a serious problem for the defendants. The statute addresses the mortgagee\u2019s right to pursue <em>personal </em>remedies against the mortgagors with respect to their <em>personal </em>obligations on the underlying instrument of debt.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> It does not address the mortgagee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>right to pursue, instead, its <em>in rem </em>remedies against the mortgaged property. See <em>Hodge </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>178 Conn. 308, 313, 422 A.2d 280 (1979) (\u201can action in rem is an action brought to enforce or protect a pre-existing interest in particular property\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Whether the statute should be construed as impliedly barring an <em>in rem </em>remedy depends on whether, in expressly barring an <em>in personam </em>remedy, the statute has extinguished the mortgage debt itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">As a general proposition, it is established law that the mortgage bears a close relationship to the underlying debt. The mortgage secures the debt. <em>New England Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Bedford Realty Corp., </em>238 Conn. 745, 759, 680 A.2d 301 (1996); Restatement (Third), supra, \u00a7 1.1, p. 8. The mortgage follows the debt, in the sense that the assignment of the note evidencing the debt automatically carries with it the assignment of the mortgage. <em>Waterbury Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Weisman, </em>94 Conn. 210, 218-19, 108 A. 550 (1919); Restatement (Third), supra, \u00a7 5.4, p. 380. The mortgage cannot survive the extinction of the debt. <em>Hartford National Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Kotkin, </em>185 Conn. 579, 581, 441 A.2d 593 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">It is also established law, however, that, upon the default of the mortgagor, the mortgagee has multiple remedies against both the mortgagor and the mortgaged property. \u201c[T]he plaintiff is entitled to pursue its remedy at law on the notes, or to pursue its remedy in equity upon the mortgage, or to pursue both. A note and a mortgage given to secure it are separate instruments, executed for different purposes and, in this State, action for foreclosure of the mortgage and upon the note are regarded and treated, in practice, as separate and distinct causes of action, although both may be pursued in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>a foreclosure suit.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hartford National Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Kotkin, </em>supra, 185 Conn. 581; see <em>Wendell Corp. Trustee </em>v. <em>Thurston, </em>239 Conn. 109, 116, 680 A.2d 1314 (1996); <em>New England Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Bedford Realty Corp., </em>supra, 238 Conn. 759. Under our cases, a mortgagee\u2019s failure to pursue a deficiency judgment is not an election of remedies and does not, per se, extinguish the debt so as to preclude further equitable relief by way of foreclosure on the mortgaged property.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">We are not persuaded that the legislature intended \u00a7 49-1, by barring further action \u201cagainst the person or persons who are liable for the payment thereof,\u201d to extinguish the defendants\u2019 personal liability as well as their mortgage debt.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Restatement (Third), supra, \u00a7 1.1, p. 8 (\u201c[a] mortgage is enforceable whether or not any person is personally liable for that performance\u201d). By barring action on the mortgage debt, \u00a7 49-1 proscribes a remedy, but does not eliminate the underlying debt. See, e.g., <em>Markham </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>119 Conn. 355, 359, 176 A. 880 (1935) (\u201cthe statute of limitations does not destroy the debt but merely bars the remedy\u201d). Because the statute does not speak to the continued existence of the mortgage debt, it does not supersede the bank\u2019s continuing access to equitable foreclosure proceedings.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>If the Appellate Court finds no merit in the remaining issues raised by the defendants in that court, the trial court, on remand, will need to consider the extent of the bank\u2019s continuing mortgage interest in light of its past foreclosure of the mortgage with respect to the first and second parcels. If the bank decides to pursue an action for foreclosure, it must establish the amount of the mortgage debt. <em>New England Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Bedford Realty Corp., </em>supra, 238 Conn. 760 (\u201c[i]npursuing the remedy of strict foreclosure [the mortgagee] or its assignee nevertheless will have to establish the amount of the debt that [the defendant] owes\u201d).

Even after the initiation of a foreclosure action, the mortgagee\u2019s title does not become absolute until all eligible parties have failed to exercise their rights to redeem the property. <em>City Lumber Co. of Bridgeport, Inc. </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>120 Conn. 16, 19, 179 A. 339 (1935).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b278-7\"> The Appellate Court relied upon several Connecticut cases in concluding that a judgment of foreclosure cannot be opened, in any circumstances, after title has become absolute in the encumbrancer. We conclude, however, that the cases from this court are distinguishable, because they deal with extinguishment of the <em>mortgagor's </em>right of redemption after passage of the law day. See <em>Varanelli </em>v. <em>Luddy, </em>130 Conn. 74, 77, 32 A.2d 61 (1943); <em>Crane </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>v. <em>Loomis, </em>128 Conn. 697, 700, 25 A.2d 650 (1942).

App. 401, 408, 635 A.2d 879 (1994); that court applied \u00a7 49-15 to preclude a plaintiff bank from opening a judgment of strict foreclosure. In that situation, however, the bank had learned of the defendant\u2019s bankruptcy before the defendant\u2019s law day had run and had failed to move to open the judgment to stop the law day from running. The facts of that case are far removed from the unintentional omission in this situation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b279-8\"> The statute that became \u00a7 49-15 initially was enacted in 1923; Public Acts 1923, c. 145; and was revised in the General Statutes enacted in 1930; General Statutes (1930 Rev.) \u00a7 5084; and 1949.

It is also a question of fact. <em>Majernicek </em>v. <em>Hartford Casualty Ins. Co., </em>supra, 96. Because the bank\u2019s omission of the third parcel from its original foreclosure complaint was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>unintentional, it did not constitute a knowing waiver of the mortgage on that parcel. We disagree, therefore, with the Appellate Court\u2019s implied reliance on waiver to sustain its argument that partial foreclosures are improper. <em>New Milford Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Jajer, </em>supra, 44 Conn. App. 588.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b282-7\"> We do not address the problems that the bank might have faced if, instead of petitioning for an opening of the mortgage foreclosure, it had filed a separate cause of action to foreclose on the omitted third parcel. Possibly, such an action might have raised questions about the applicability of the law of claim preclusion or of issue preclusion. See, e.g., <em>Connecticut Natural Gas Corp. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>239 Conn. 313, 322-23, 684 A.2d 1173 (1996); <em>Delahunty </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins.

In essence, the blanket mortgage is treated as though it were a number of smaller mortgages on the separate parcels, and the foreclosure of each such smaller mortgage proceeds independently from others.\u201d D. Caron, Connecticut Foreclosures: An Attorney\u2019s Manual of Practice and Procedure (3d Ed. 1997) \u00a7 16.01A, p. 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">The procedural posture of this case is different from the situation described by Caron because the bank here, rather than seeking equitable apportionment, chose to foreclose the blanket mortgage in its entirety, albeit inadvertently omitting the description of one of the parcels securing the mortgage. It is, thus, the bank\u2019s attempt to open the foreclosure judgment that has become the subject of this appeal. Caron\u2019s description of equitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>apportionment in the strict foreclosure context, however, reinforces our conclusion that the bank has not \u201cwaived\u201d its mortgage on the third parcel by inadvertently omitting its description from the original foreclosure complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b283-6\"> Section 8.6 of the Restatement (Third) of Property, Mortgages, provides: \u201c[W]hen foreclosing a <em>mortgage covering more than one parcel of real estate, </em>upon the motion or application of the holder of a subordinate interest protected by this section, the mortgagee must proceed against the parcels in the following order:</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">\u201c(1) parcels on which no subordinate interests exist are foreclosed upon before parcels on which subordinate interests exist; and</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">\u201c(2) as among parcels on which subordinate interests exist, those with subordinate interests created more recently are foreclosed upon before those with subordinate interests created at a more remote time.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b283-9\"> The three creditors having junior encumbrances on the mortgaged property in this case \u2014 Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., Waterbury Telephone Employees Federal Credit Union, and the state department of revenue services\u2014 received notice of the foreclosure on parcels one and two. On May 12,1995, the trial court, entered a default for failure to appear against Sears, Roebuck <em>&amp; </em>Co. On that same day, the trial court rendered a judgment of default for failure to plead against Waterbury Telephone Employees Federal Credit Union and the state department of revenue services. Although the state appeared, it disclaimed its interest under its lien on May 12, 1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b283-10\"> Another equitable principle in the strict foreclosure context points toward a similar conclusion. If \u201call the property covered by a mortgage has been sold in parcels to different purchasers at different times, upon foreclosure of the mortgage the parcels are liable in inverse order of alienation.\u201d <em>New England Mortgage Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Rossini, </em>121 Conn. 214, 216, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>183 A. 744 (1936).

At such hearing the court shall hear the evidence, establish a valuation for the mortgaged property and shall render judgment for the plaintiff for the difference, if any, between such valuation and the plaintiffs claim.

Speaking in support of Senate Bill No. 834, which added the language limiting the application of \u00a7 49-1 to individuals subject to service of process in this state, Senator John Filer stated: \u201c[A] foreclosure of a mortgage bars further action <em>on the note </em>unless the person is liable for payment or made party to the foreclosure.

The bank asserts that <em>Swift </em>stands for the proposition that as long as a valid mortgage exists, the underlying debt is not extinguished and thus can be pursued in a second foreclosure. The defendants attempt to distinguish <em>Swift, </em>arguing that that case involved a second mortgagee who had not been named as aparty in the first proceeding. Because, however, at the time of <em>Sv;ift, </em>neither \u00a7 49-1 nor \u00a7 49-15 had been enacted, that case does not inform our decision in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b287-7\"> The bank concedes in its brief that it can no longer recover from the defendants personally.
