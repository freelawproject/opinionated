Specifically, the defendant claims that the court improperly instructed the jury concerning: (1) the element of intent; (2) consideration of his mitigating evidence of intoxication; (3) manslaughter in the first degree pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3) by describing it as \u201creckless indifference manslaughter\u201d; and (4) the definition of the term \u201cextreme\u201d as used in his affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance. The defendant further claims that the trial court improperly denied his motions to suppress identifications of him as the assailant. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The defendant and the victim, Gloria Austin, were married in 1989. During the summer of 1991, the couple began having marital problems that resulted in domestic disturbances. The defendant was arrested twice in 1991, for incidents involving violence against his wife but the victim chose not to press charges. She did, however, obtain a restraining order on two separate occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The defendant and the victim separated in October, 1992. The victim and the couple\u2019s three children remained in the family\u2019s apartment at 393 Sherman Avenue in New Haven, and the defendant moved into his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>mother\u2019s house on Southwest Drive in New Haven. In the spring of 1992, the victim filed for a divorce, which became final on December 30, 1992. At that time, the victim was employed as a nurse\u2019s aid at a New Haven nursing home. On January 16, 1993, the victim, who was scheduled to work at 11 p.m., left her apartment to go to work at approximately 10:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">That night, Marie Garrett, who lived next door to the victim, went to her window because she heard a woman shouting for help. Garrett saw a woman running down Sherman Avenue with a man chasing her. The woman tried to get into a car that was stopped at a traffic light but the car pulled away. The woman then ran across the street. Garrett subsequently heard a gunshot and saw the woman fall. Thereafter, the man stood over her body and fired several more shots. He then ran across the street into an alley between two houses. Garrett was unable to identify the man.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Rosco Sheffield and Priscilla Knox also observed the shooting. Sheffield saw a woman running down Sherman Avenue with a man chasing her with a gun in his hand. Sheffield heard the man shout at the woman: \u201c[Y]ou\u2019re dead wrong!\u201d Sheffield saw the woman try to get into a car that was stopped for a light but the car sped off when the man pointed a gun at the windshield. The woman then ran toward Sheffield, with the man still chasing her. Frightened, Sheffield ran up Goffe Street away from the shooter and, as he did, he heard three gunshots. Sheffield came back to Sherman Avenue after running around the block and saw the woman lying on the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Priscilla Knox was standing on the comer of Goffe Street and Sherman Avenue waiting for a friend, when she saw a woman running down Sherman Avenue screaming: \u201cSomebody help me! He\u2019s going to shoot me.\u201d Knox saw the woman, with a man following her, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>ran to a car that was stopped at a traffic fight and the car pull away. Although the man was not directly facing her, Knox could see his face. When he was approximately five to six feet away from the woman, Knox heard gunshots and saw the woman fall to the ground, after which Knox heard additional gunshots.The victim was taken to the hospital where she died of a gunshot wound to the back of her head. Two .25 caliber shell casings were found at the scene of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Thereafter, Sheffield and Knox each identified the defendant as the shooter. At trial, the defendant testified and admitted that he had shot the victim. He claimed, however, that he did not intend to kill her. According to the defendant, although he and the victim were separated and she had filed for divorce, he was unaware that the divorce had become final and he had hoped for a reconciliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">At trial, the defendant raised the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance pursuant to \u00a7 53a-54a (a) and introduced evidence of intoxication in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 53a-7.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the defendant admitted that he had shot the victim, the central issue in the trial was his intent. The defendant\u2019s testimony concerning the immediate circumstances surrounding his shooting of the victim was as follows. On January 13, three days before the shooting, he found a card and love letter from the victim to another man. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Feeling \u201cdisappointed\u201d and \u201cdistraught,\u201d the defendant decided to quit his job and move to Atlanta. On January 16, the defendant found another card and letter from the victim to the other man. When he telephoned the victim, she refused to speak to him. When he called again, a man answered the telephone and told the defendant not to call there anymore. The defendant testified that he then went to the victim\u2019s house but she was not at home. His daughter told him that the victim was seeing another man and had obtained a restraining order against the defendant. He returned to his mother\u2019s house where he proceeded to drink alcohol and use narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The defendant was familiar with the victim\u2019s work schedule and decided to confront her that night when she left for work. He carried a .25 caliber handgun in his pocket for protection, which, according to his testimony, was a common practice. He walked from his mother\u2019s house to the victim\u2019s house and waited in the driveway by the rear of her car for the victim to come out. As the victim was standing outside the apartment locking the front door, the defendant asked her why she was having another man in the house with the children present. According to the defendant, the victim replied: \u201c \u2018He\u2019s not in our house. He is upstairs right now in your bed.\u2019 \u201d The defendant said he \u201cwent ballistic\u201d and yelled: \u201cYou\u2019re dead wrong!\u201d He then pulled out his gun. The victim screamed and ran away from him. He testified that he chased her, intending to grab her and take her back to the house to confront the other man. He fired two shots at the victim, who fell to the ground. He denied firing any shots after she fell. The defendant then ran from the scene and hid the gun under a discarded tire.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The jury found the defendant guilty of murder. Thereafter, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>a new trial and judgment of acquittal and rendered judgment in accordance with the jury verdict. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as they become relevant in the context of the defendant\u2019s specific claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">We first address the defendant\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s instruction on the element of intent. In its preliminary instructions, the trial court charged the jury that \u201ca person acts intentionally with respect to a result or to conduct [described by a statute defining an offense] when his conscious objective is to cause such result or to engage in such conduct.\u201d The defendant contends that the portion of the definition relating to conduct improperly permitted the jury to find him guilty of murder if it found that he had the intent to engage in the conduct of firing his weapon. The state, on the other hand, argues that the trial court repeatedly gave a proper statement of the elements of each offense and that the jury was properly guided in its deliberations. The state argues that, in view of the entire charge and the instructional sheets that were distributed to the jury that properly listed the elements of each offense, the jury could not have been misled. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this issue. During the trial court\u2019s preliminary instructions, the court read the statutory definition of intent contained in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (ll).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court then instructed the jury on the elements of murder, stating that in order to find the defendant guilty of murder, the jury must find that he specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>intended to cause the death of the victim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court also instructed the juiy on intoxication, extreme emotional disturbance and the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At the conclusion of the court\u2019s charge, the defendant objected to the conduct portion of the instruction on intent.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial court did not reinstruct the jury. The trial court then provided the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>jury with instructional handouts that listed the elements of the various crimes and did not contain a definition of intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">During their deliberations, the jurors inquired of the court: \u201cAt what point in the event is intent determined? We are looking for clarification of \u2018intent.\u2019 Can it happen when the trigger is pulled?\u201d The defendant reiterated his concern that the portion of the definition on intent relating to conduct may have confused the jury. The court reread its original charge and reinstructed the jury that: \u201c[I]n order to prove the defendant guilty of murder, the state has the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt (1) that the defendant specifically intended to cause the death of the victim . . . and (2) acting with that intent, the defendant shot [the victim] and thereby caused her death. So the intent exists at the time of the shooting.\u201d The court reinstructed on the elements of intentional manslaughter in the first degree pursuant to \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (1). The jurors also requested that the testimony of the witnesses who saw the shooting be read back. The jurors later requested that the court reread the instructions on how intoxication can affect intent. The trial court then reiterated its instructions on intoxication and the statutory definition of intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">We begin by reviewing the relevant legal principles that govern our consideration of the defendant\u2019s claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>of improper jury instructions. \u201cIt is well established that [a] charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement, but it is to be considered rather as to its probable effect upon the jury in guiding them to a correct verdict in the case. . . . The charge is to be read as a whole and individual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . . The test to be applied to any part of a charge is whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Dyson, </em>217 Conn. 498, 501, 586 A.2d 610 (1991); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Faust, </em>237 Conn. 454, 473-74, 678 A.2d 910 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">We first note that \u201c \u2018[t]he specific intent to kill is an essential element of the crime of murder. To act intentionally, the defendant must have had the conscious objective to cause the death of the victim.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>235 Conn. 274, 322, 664 A.2d 743 (1995). \u201cDue process requires that the state establish beyond a reasonable doubt every essential fact necessary to establish the crime charged . . . including intent where intent is one of those elements.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>198 Conn. 560, 568, 504 A.2d 1029 (1986). \u201c[A]n improper instruction on an element of an offense ... is of constitutional dimension.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>supra, 284. The trial court, in defining intent, read the entire statutory definition of \u00a7 53a-3 (11), which contains references both to intent to cause a result and to intent to engage in proscribed conduct. Although we have stated that \u201c[i]t is improper for the trial court to read an entire statute to a jury when the pleadings or the evidence support a violation of only a portion of the statute\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>229 Conn. 529, 537, 643 A.2d 1213 (1994); that is not dispositive. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>We next must determine \u201c \u2018whether it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled\u2019 \u201d by the trial court\u2019s instructions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>supra, 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">In <em>Prioleau, </em>where we faced a similar situation, the trial court read the entire statutory definition of intent in a murder trial where it was not warranted by the pleadings or evidence. Although we agreed with the defendant that the portion of the instruction regarding the intent to engage in proscribed conduct was irrelevant to a murder prosecution pursuant to \u00a7 53a-54a, we rejected his claim that the instruction warranted reversal of his conviction. Our review of the record revealed that the corut referred to the intent to \u201c \u2018engage in conduct\u2019 \u201d only once and \u201crepeatedly instructed the jury that in order to find the defendant guilty of murder, it first had to find that he had intended to cause the death of the victim.\u201d Id., 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The defendant argues that <em>Prioleau </em>is distinguishable because, in the present case, the trial court read the improper definition of intent both in its initial charge and in its supplemental charge in response to the jurors\u2019 requests for \u201cclarification on \u2018intent\u2019 \u201d and \u201chow intoxication can impact intent . . . .\u201d The defendant posits that the jurors\u2019 requests for clarification indicate that confusion existed regarding intent. Based on their questions and the trial court\u2019s response, the defendant contends that it was possible that the court\u2019s instructions on intent permitted the jury to find that the defendant\u2019s intent to engage in the conduct of firing the gun satisfied the intent to cause the death of the victim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Our careful review of the entire charge persuades us that, as in <em>Prioleau, </em>any possible risk of jury confusion over the element of intent was eliminated by the trial court\u2019s numerous proper instructions on the elements of murder. Specifically, the trial court expressly stated both in its initial charge and supplemental charge that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>in order to find the defendant guilty of murder, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant specifically intended to cause the death of the victim. See footnote 8 of this opinion. Moreover, in its instruction on intentional manslaughter, the court distinguished between the specific intent to cause death, required for a conviction of murder, and the specific intent to cause serious physical injury, necessary for a conviction of intentional manslaughter. The trial court also provided the jury with instructional handouts that properly listed the elements of the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">In addition, the factual issues of this case mitigate against the possibility of jury confusion. \u201cA court\u2019s charge is not to be examined in a vacuum. Rather, it is to be viewed in the context of the factual issues raised at the trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kuroin, </em>186 Conn. 555, 558, 442 A.2d 1327 (1982). The defendant admitted that he pulled the trigger and shot the victim. Counsel for both parties agreed that the sole issue in dispute was the defendant\u2019s mental state. Under the circumstances, \u201c[i]t strains reason to believe that the jury could have [understood] the challenged instruction as not requiring that the state prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to kill [the victim].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">The defendant next argues that the trial court\u2019s instructions regarding intoxication misled the jury and deprived him of his constitutional right to due process.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Specifically, the defendant claims that: (1) the jury instructions set an improperly high standard for the jury\u2019s consideration of the evidence of intoxication and diluted the state\u2019s burden of proving intent beyond a reasonable doubt; and (2) the trial court improperly limited the jury\u2019s consideration of intoxication to specific intent offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The defendant contends that the court\u2019s instructions failed to advise the jury of the distinction between finding that he was capable of forming a specific intent, on the one hand, and finding that he actually formed the required intent, on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">At trial, the defendant testified that he was under the influence of alcohol and cocaine at the time of the shooting. The trial court instructed that: \u201cIf you find that the defendant was intoxicated at the time of the crime, you may take this fact into consideration in determining whether or not he was in such a state of intoxication as to be incapable of forming the required specific intent which is a necessary element for the commission of that particular crime. If you believe that the defendant, although intoxicated, was still capable of possessing the specific criminal intent, then his responsibility as to that particular crime is the same as if he were not intoxicated. You must first decide whether the defendant was intoxicated at the time of the alleged crime, and second, whether he was incapable of possessing the requisite specific criminal intent. . . . The state always has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was capable of forming the required specific intent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>As a preliminary matter, we note that \u201c[w]hile intoxication is neither a defense nor an affirmative defense to a murder charge in Connecticut, evidence of a defendant\u2019s intoxication is relevant to negate specific intent which is an essential element of the crime of murder.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 568; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Traficonda, </em>223 Conn. 273, 279, 612 A.2d 45 (1992) (\u201c \u2018criminal defendant\u2019s intoxication is relevant to the determination of his capacity to form a specific intent to commit a crime\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The defendant argues that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that the evidence of intoxication negated specific intent only if the jury determined that he was incapable of possessing the requisite intent. The defendant contends that this instruction imposes too high a threshold for the consideration of intoxication because it fails to inform the jury of the distinction between whether the defendant had the capacity to form specific intent and whether he actually formed such an intent. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">\u201cWe have eschewed, and continue to eschew, judging individual instructions in artificial isolation from the overall charge.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 571. In the present case, the trial court properly informed the jury that it must decide: (1) whether the defendant was intoxicated at the time of the offense; and (2) if so, whether that intoxication rendered him incapable of forming the intent required for the commission of the charged offenses. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>223 Conn. 41, 50, 612 A.2d 749 (1992). Our review of the jury instructions as a whole discloses that the court adequately informed the jury that the state had the burden of proving that the defendant actually possessed the requisite intent. We are unpersuaded that the challenged instructions, when considered in the context of the entire charge, either created an unlawful threshold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>for the jury\u2019s consideration of intoxication or diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof of specific intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury that his intoxication could be considered as affirmative proof that his mental state had been one of recklessness violated his due process rights. Specifically, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury to apply its instructions on intent and intoxication only to the specific intent crimes of murder and intentional manslaughter.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The state argues that this claim is unpreserved and should not be reviewed. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">The defendant concedes that this claim was not preserved at trial but maintains that he is entitled to review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the plain error doctrine pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4061,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 60-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>217 Conn. 648, 659, 588 A.2d 127 (1991), we rejected a virtually identical request for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>review. In <em>Ortiz, </em>the defendant in a murder trial claimed that the trial court had improperly failed to instruct the jury that they could consider his intoxication as proof \u201cthat his mental state had been the less culpable one of recklessness\u201d; id., 658; and sought review under <em>Golding. </em>Id., 658-59. We concluded that review of the defendant\u2019s unpreserved jury instruction claim under <em>Golding </em>was unavailing \u201c[b]ecause a lesser included offense instruction is purely a matter of common law, and therefore does not implicate constitutional rights . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 659. We further concluded that the defendant\u2019s claim was not reviewable as plain error because such review \u201cis reserved for those truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 659-60. Accordingly, in the present case, we decline to afford the defendant\u2019s claim further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court confused the jury by improperly referring to manslaughter in the first degree under \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> as \u201creckless indifference manslaughter.\u201d The defendant reasons that this reference \u201cminimized the gravity of the [defendant\u2019s] conduct\u201d such that it was reasonably possible that the jury would conclude that \u201cthe defendant should not be found guilty under this subsection, because his culpability was far greater\u201d than reckless indifference. This claim is also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Our examination of the entire charge reveals that, while the trial court did use the phrase \u201creckless indifference manslaughter,\u201d there was no reasonable possibility that the jury could have been misled regarding the requirement of extreme indifference. The defendant concedes that the trial court repeatedly instructed the jury properly regarding the elements necessary to convict him of manslaughter pursuant to \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and provided a proper definition in its instructional handout. Furthermore, the trial court on two separate occasions stated that the term it used to describe the crime had no significance and instructed the jury that it should focus instead on the elements of the crime.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201cThe jury is presumed to follow the court\u2019s directions in the absence of a clear indication to the contrary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Raguseo, </em>225 Conn. 114, 131, 622 A.2d 519 (1993). Finally, as the state aptly notes, it is not reasonably possible that the jury was misled because it convicted the defendant on the charge of murder and, therefore, did not even reach the elements of the lesser included offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">In the defendant\u2019s final challenge to the juiy instructions, he argues that, in instructing on his affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance, the trial court improperly defined the term \u201cextreme\u201d as \u201cthe greatest degree of intensity away from the normal state of the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The defendant contends that this definition reasonably could have misled the juiy to find that a person who had been violent in the past is not entitled to use the defense because \u201ca violent incident is not \u2018the furthest\u2019 away from the norm for the defendant.\u201d The state argues that this claim is unpreserved and should not be reviewed. Again, we agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The following additional facts are relevant to the defendant\u2019s claim. The defendant submitted a request to charge on the defense of extreme emotional disturbance that defined extreme as \u201cha[ving] its ordinary meaning . . . [of] great or substantial.\u201d The defendant further requested \u201cthat the Court <em>not </em>charge that \u2018extreme\u2019 means the \u2018greatest degree of intensity away from the norm, away from the normal or usual state, for the defendant.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) At the conclusion of the juiy instructions, the defendant objected to the trial court not having used his proffered definition of extreme.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>We note that \u201c[ejxtreme emotional disturbance operates as a partial affirmative defense to murder. One who kills while under the influence of an extreme emotional disturbance cannot be convicted of murder but can be found guilty of manslaughter.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fair, </em>197 Conn. 106, 108, 496 A.2d 461 (1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1096, 106 S. Ct. 1494, 89 L. Ed. 2d 895 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The defendant, in both his brief and at oral argument before this court, argues that the definition the trial court used was too restrictive. He advocates that we adopt a new definition of extreme as \u201c \u2018excessive, or far advanced, or grievous.\u2019 \u201d This was not, however, the definition that was proffered by defense counsel to the trial court. We decline to review this issue because the specific language that the defendant requests this court to adopt was not raised at trial. Thus, the trial court never had an opportunity to rule on the language that the defendant now advocates. Moreover, we note that the defendant\u2019s claim does not warrant review under <em>Golding </em>because we previously have determined that improper jury instructions concerning the defense of extreme emotional disturbance are not of constitutional dimension. <em>State </em>v. <em>Foreshaw, </em>214 Conn. 540, 546, 572 A.2d 1006 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Suggs, </em>209 Conn. 733, 751, 553 A.2d 1110 (1989). The defendant\u2019s claim, moreover, does not warrant review under the plain error doctrine because the trial court properly instructed the jury. See footnote 18 of this opinion. Accordingly, no manifest injustice resulted to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied his motions to suppress the identifications of him as the shooter by Sheffield and Knox in violation of his due process rights. He argues that both identifications resulted from unnecessarily suggestive procedures and were unreliable. We disagree.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this issue. Prior to trial, the trial court held a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motions to suppress both identifications. At the hearing, Sheffield testified that he had informed the police that he was at the scene of the shooting and that he had seen the shooter. He was directed by the police to go to the police station and was told to wait outside the station to see if he could identify the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">At that time, the defendant, who had been taken to the police station for an interview and had declined to make a statement without his counsel present, was leaving the station in the company of two officers, who were supposed to drive him home. Sheffield identified the defendant as the shooter as the defendant was leaving the police station. Sheffield stated that he \u201cimmediately recognized\u201d the defendant and, during the suppression hearing, Sheffield made an in-court identification of the defendant as the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Knox told a friend that she had seen the shooting and the friend subsequently contacted the police. On January 25,1993, Knox gave a tape-recorded statement to the police in which she described the shooter as a \u201cbrown skinned\u201d male who wore a pair of jeans, a blue, gray and red coat, and sneakers. In her statement, Knox stated that she was \u201cpretty sure\u201d that she would be able to identify the shooter if she were to see him again. The next day, the police showed Knox a photographic array containing photographs of eight persons from which she identified the defendant as the shooter, stating that she was certain that the defendant was the man that she had seen shoot the victim. She was then shown an individual photograph of the defendant, and she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>again identified him as the shooter. At the suppression hearing, Knox made an in-court identification of the defendant as the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">After hearing testimony, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motions to suppress. The trial court stated that, with regard to the identification made by Sheffield, \u201c[e]ven though a one-on-one showing may in certain circumstances tend to be suggestive, the court finds that under the circumstances of this case, there was no suggestiveness,\u201d and \u201c[t]here was no suggestion by any police officer who to identify . . . .\u201d The trial court concluded that Knox\u2019s identification of the defendant should not be suppressed because \u201c [t]he photo [graphic] array was not suggestive in any manner, and she made the identification, positively, of the defendant as the shooter.\u201d Finally, the trial court determined that the identifications by both Sheffield and Knox were reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">In determining whether identification procedures violate a defendant\u2019s due process rights, \u201c[t]he required inquiry is made on an ad hoc basis and is two-pronged: first, it must be determined whether the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive; and second, if it is found to have been so, it must be determined whether the identification was nevertheless rehable based on an examination of the totality of the circumstances. ... To prevail in his claim, the defendant must demonstrate that the trial court erred in both of its determinations regarding suggestiveness and reliability of identifications in the totality of the circumstances. ... An identification procedure is unnecessarily suggestive only if it gives rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. ... If the procedures used to identify the defendant were not unnecessarily suggestive, we need not independently analyze whether the identification was reliable.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>239 Conn. 481, 498-99, 687 A.2d 489 (1996), cert. denied, 521 U.S. 1121, 117 S. Ct. 2515, 138 L. Ed. 2d 1017 (1997). \u201cThe defendant bears the burden of proving both that the identification procedures were unnecessarily suggestive and that the resulting identification was unreliable.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>229 Conn. 125, 162, 640 A.2d 572 (1994). \u201cGenerally, \u2018[t]he exclusion of evidence from the jury is . . .a drastic sanction, one that is limited to identification testimony which is manifestly suspect.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wooten, </em>227 Conn. 677, 685-86, 631 A.2d 271 (1993); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>235 Conn. 145, 159, 665 A.2d 63 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">We turn first to the question of whether the procedures used in Sheffield\u2019s identification were unnecessarily suggestive. The defendant contends that the combination of the one-on-one confrontation, the police\u2019s request to help them identify the shooter, the police station setting of the identification, and the presence of two police officers flanking the defendant as he exited the station rendered Sheffield\u2019s identification of the defendant as the shooter unconstitutionally suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">\u201cWe have recognized that generally a one-to-one confrontation between a [witness] and the suspect presented to him for identification is inherently and significantly suggestive because it conveys the message to the [witness] that the police believe the suspect is guilty.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatum, </em>219 Conn. 721, 727, 595 A.2d 322 (1991). We have concluded, however, that under certain circumstances such a procedure does not constitute impermissible suggestiveness. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wooten, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 686-87; <em>State </em>v. <em>Collette, </em>199 Conn. 308, 310-11, 507 A.2d 99 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Amarillo, </em>198 Conn. 285, 292, 503 A.2d 146 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamele, </em>188 Conn. 372, 377-78, 449 A.2d 1020 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>In <em>State </em>v. <em>Wooten, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 686, the defendant was seated in the back of a police car when the victim identified him as her assailant. We stated that the confrontation \u201calthough suggestive, was nonetheless not unnecessarily so because the exigencies of the situation justified the procedure . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. The identification procedure provided \u201cthe victim with the opportunity to identify her assailant while her memory of the incident was still fresh\u201d; id.; and permitted the police to quickly eliminate the person as a suspect and to \u201c \u2018continue the investigation with a minimum of delay . . . . Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">As in <em>Wooten, </em>we are persuaded that the identification procedure in the present case, although suggestive, was not unnecessarily so. \u201cAs we have remarked, [a]n immediate viewing of the suspect may be justified where it [is] important for the police to separate the prime suspect gold from the suspicious glitter, so as to enable them ... to continue their investigation with a minimum of delay.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 686-87. In the present case, the defendant was not under arrest, he had refused to make any statement, and it was necessary for the police to make a prompt identification in order to detain him. Furthermore, the trial court noted that there was no evidence that the police at any time suggested to Sheffield that the defendant was the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Even if we were to assume that the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive, Sheffield\u2019s identification was reliable under the totality of the circumstances. \u201c[Reliability is the linchpin in determining the admissibility of identification testimony .... To determine whether an identification that resulted from an unnecessarily suggestive procedure is reliable, we must weigh the corrupting effect of the suggestive procedure in light of certain factors such as the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>crime, the witness\u2019 degree of attention, the accuracy of [that person\u2019s] prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated at the confrontation, and the time between the crime and the confrontation.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 687-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">At the suppression hearing, Sheffield testified that he was standing approximately thirty feet from where the shooting had occurred. His attention was focused on the scene of the man, with a gun in his hand, chasing the woman. The area was well lit and he had an unobstructed view of the man\u2019s face. The identification was made within hours of witnessing the incident. Sheffield stated that he recognized the defendant immediately and he displayed no uncertainty in identifying the defendant. We agree with the trial court that Sheffield\u2019s identification was reliable and, accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress Sheffield\u2019s identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">We next consider whether Knox\u2019s identification should have been suppressed because, as the defendant alleges, the photographic array was unnecessarily suggestive. In her interview with Detective James Ponteau, Knox described the man as \u201cbrown skinned.\u201d The defendant claims that the photographic array contained eight photographs, \u201conly one of which has an apparently \u2018light\u2019 skin tone, one has a medium tone, and six others have very dark skin tones.\u201d The defendant contends that the \u201cunique light skin characteristic of the defendant\u2019s photograph in relation to others in the array rendered the identification procedure unnecessarily suggestive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">\u201cThe presentation of an array of several photographs to witnesses, including that of the suspect, does not constitute an impermissibly suggestive pretrial identification procedure in the absence of any unfairness or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>other impropriety in the conduct of the exhibit.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">After reviewing the challenged array, we conclude that it was not impermissibly suggestive. The photographic array shown to Knox was a black and white photocopy of eight photographs rather than an array of color photographs, thus rendering any distinction based on skin tone extremely subtle.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The defendant was depicted with seven other black males who all appeared to be approximately the same age. All of the individuals had short hair and mustaches. Although the defendant\u2019s skin tone arguably appears somewhat lighter than the other individuals, \u201c \u2018[a]ny array composed of different individuals must necessarily contain certain differences.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Boscarino, </em>204 Conn. 714, 726, 529 A.2d 1260 (1987); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 499-500 (\u201c[w]e note that there exists no constitutional mandate that gives the defendant the right to a photographic array of look-alikes\u201d). The defendant\u2019s photograph was not so distinctive in skin tone from the other individuals in the photographs as to \u201c \u2018suggest to [Knox] that [the defendant] was more likely to be the culprit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jarrett </em>v. <em>Headley, </em>802 F.2d 34, 41 (2d Cir. 1986). Moreover, there was no evidence that the array was presented in a suggestive manner. Because we conclude that the array shown to Knox was not unnecessarily suggestive, we need not reach the defendant\u2019s second claim that her identification was not reliable. <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 164; <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatum, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b247-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a provides in relevant part: \u201cMurder, (a) A person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person or causes a suicide by force, duress or deception; except that in any prosecution under this subsection, it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant committed the proscribed act or acts under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant\u2019s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be, provided nothing contained in this subsection shall constitute a defense to a prosecution for, or preclude a conviction of, manslaughter in the first degree or any other crime. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b247-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 provides in relevant part: \u201cCarrying of pistol or revolver without permit prohibited.
