Section 42a-2-725 (2) further specifies that a cause of action for breach of warranty accrues upon tender of delivery of the contract goods. The principal issue in this case is the applicability of \u00a7 42a-2-725 to a contract for the sale of goods in which the seller agrees not only to deliver the goods but also to perform testing of the goods at the buyer\u2019s work site.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The plaintiffs, Flagg Energy Development Corporation (Flagg), CCF-1, Inc. (CCF-1), and Process Construction Services, Inc. (Process),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> brought an action claiming that the defendant, General Motors Corporation, Allison Gas Turbine Division,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> had delivered defective gas turbine engines for a construction project. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Because of losses allegedly suffered by the plaintiffs due to the failure of the engines to operate efficiently and economically, the plaintiffs claimed a right to recover compensatory and punitive damages, fees and costs. The defendant\u2019s answer raised, as a special defense, the claim that the warranty counts of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, filed October 26,1992, were time barred by the provisions of \u00a7 42a-2-725.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Although the major focus of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was on the defendant\u2019s alleged breaches of the express and implied warranties contained in their 1987 purchase agreement, the complaint also included a count for breach of contract and two counts charging Allison with misrepresentation and breach of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA). General Statutes \u00a7 42-110 (b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court, <em>Dorsey, J., </em>granted the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the latter two counts of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on the warranty counts, which the trial court, <em>Gaffney, J., </em>granted in part. The court concluded that Flagg and Process were not proper parties to this action and that CCF-l\u2019s breach of warranty claims were time barred except for the allegation of breach of a promise for repair or replacement of defective material and equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">In motions to open and vacate the summary judgment, and to reargue, CCF-1 raised no question either about the accuracy of the facts described in the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision or about the suitability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>of the case for summary disposition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Focusing only on the court\u2019s ruling on the statute of limitations, CCF-1 claimed, for the first time, that a 1990 settlement agreement between the parties contained new promises that, as a matter of law, constituted a novation and thereby renewed the accrual of the statute of limitations. The court concluded that the text of the settlement agreement did not support the plaintiffs\u2019 claim and, on that basis, denied CCF-l\u2019s motion on its merits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">CCF-1 then presented to a jury its damages claim pursuant to the repair or replacement clause in the purchase agreement. At the end of CCF-l\u2019s presentation, the trial court, <em>Gaffney, J., </em>directed a verdict in favor of the defendant on the ground of evidentiary insufficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">After the trial court\u2019s final judgment against them, the plaintiffs appealed to the Appellate Court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We transferred their appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4024<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">In their appeal, the plaintiffs challenge the adverse pretrial and trial rulings of Judge Dorsey and Judge Gaffney. They have raised four issues. First, they argue that the breach of warranty claims contained in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>October, 1992 complaint were timely filed, within the four year \u00a7 42a-2-725 limitations period, because the purchasing agreement required the defendant to perform on-site testing that was not completed until November, 1988. Second, they contend that the 1990 settlement agreement was a novation that restarted the running of the limitations clock, either because it imposed new warranty obligations on the defendant, or because it supported the plaintiffs\u2019 independent claim for breach of contract. Third, they maintain that the repair or replacement clause contained in the 1987 purchase agreement affords them an additional remedy for breach of warranty that extends the period of limitations. Fourth, they claim a right to recover damages for misrepresentation and breach of CUTPA.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We are persuaded by none of these claims.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">THE 1987 PURCHASE AGREEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">We begin with an examination of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that, under the terms of their purchase agreement, their breach of warranty claims were filed properly within the four year limitation period contained in \u00a7 42a-2-725. The plaintiffs do not dispute that \u00a7 42a-2-725 (2) provides for the accrual of a cause of action for breach of warranty, \u201cregardless of the aggrieved party\u2019s lack of knowledge of the breach . . . when tender of delivery is made . . . .\u201d They argue, however, that tender of delivery does not occur upon the physical delivery of the goods if, as in their case, a purchase agreement contains terms that postpone the tender of delivery. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>The record discloses the following facts. As the trial court observed, although the parties draw differing legal conclusions from the history of their contractual relationship, the underlying relevant facts and documents are not at issue.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On November 12, 1987, Sulzer Tur-bosystems, Inc. (Sulzer), and Process entered into a purchase agreement (1987 purchase agreement) for two gas turbine generator assemblies, including two engines manufactured by the defendant. Process needed the engines to power the generators required to fulfil its obligation to construct and operate a cogeneration power plant in Hartford. CCF-1 was the owner of the property on which the power plant was to be built. Soon after delivery of the engines, the plaintiffs voiced repeated complaints about their performance, and, on October 26, 1992, filed the present complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The terms of the 1987 purchase agreement contained express and implied warranties as well as a clause requiring Sulzer, for a period of one year from the date of acceptance of the engines, to replace or to remedy defective materials or equipment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The agreement also obligated Sulzer to provide staff, at the plaintiffs\u2019 construction site, to perform \u201ccheck-out, start-up, [and] preliminary acceptance testing] . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Finally, the agreement provided that CCF-1 would pay for the goods \u201c30 days after satisfactory completion of the Preliminary Acceptance Test, but not more than 60 days from date of delivery or 90 days from alternative due to [Sulzer] supply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Sulzer physically delivered the engines to the construction site on May 27 and June 23,1988. Their installation was completed by July 26, 1988. The tests described in the purchase agreement, however, had not been performed by that time. The check-out and component tests were not completed until November 3, 1988, and the acceptance tests were not completed until November 11, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Thereafter, Process complained to Sulzer both about alleged delays in Sulzer\u2019s delivery of the engines and about alleged deficiencies in the engines\u2019 performance. On July 31, 1990, to resolve these problems, the parties entered into a settlement agreement (1990 settlement agreement), pursuant to which, inter alia, the defendant agreed to accept delegation of most of Sulzer\u2019s duties under the 1987 purchase agreement. The parties also agreed that U.S. Turbine Corporation, a repair center acting under the authority of the defendant, would perform all future maintenance and repair work on the engines in accordance with a specified operating cost program.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The plaintiffs maintain, on appeal, that the trial court improperly concluded that their October 26, 1992 complaint was untimely. The parties agree that \u00a7 42a-2-725 contains the applicable statute of limitations. They disagree about the proper construction of subdivision (2) of that statute, which provides that a breach of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made, \u201cexcept that where a warranty <em>explicitly </em>extends to future performance of the goods and discovery of the breach must await the time of such performance the cause of action accrues when the breach is or should have been discovered.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The plaintiffs argue that, under article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, the testing obligations contained in the 1987 purchase agreement postponed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>date of accrual of their cause of action, from the date of the physical delivery of the second engine in June, 1988, until the date of completion of the contemplated testing in November, 1988. Alternatively, they maintain that the Uniform Commercial Code permits contractual variation of the limitations provisions of \u00a7 42a-2-725, and that their contract manifests the requisite agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The trial court rejected both arguments. Construing the Uniform Commercial Code, the court held that, presumptively, a breach of warranty occurs at the time of tender of delivery of the goods themselves without regard to subsequent inspection, testing or acceptance of the goods. This presumptive rule recognizes the commercial utility of establishing a definite time period to define the duration of a seller\u2019s liability for breach of warranty. See, e.g., <em>Cincinnati </em>v. <em>Dorr-Oliver, Inc., </em>659 F. Sup. 259, 264 (D. Conn. 1986); 1 J. White &amp; R. Summers, Uniform Commercial Code (3d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 11-9, p. 604. Construing the 1987 purchase agreement, the court held that its terms, as a matter of law, did not manifest <em>explicitly </em>the parties\u2019 intention to modify the accrual of the statute of limitations. The court noted that, insofar as the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of the 1987 purchase agreement suggested a contractual equivalence between delivery of the goods and final acceptance, that reading was inconsistent with the distinction in the agreement\u2019s payment clause between delivery and acceptance. It also observed that, because the agreement contained no time frame within which the on-site testing was to be performed, the plaintiffs\u2019 view of the agreement might create a situation in which, despite delivery, installation and use of the engines, accrual of the statute of limitations might be postponed indefinitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>The plaintiffs renew both claims on appeal to this court. Relying on General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-503,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the plaintiffs argue that the Uniform Commercial Code defines \u201ctender of delivery\u201d not by reference to physical delivery, but by compliance with the terms of contractually prescribed obligations, including, in their case, the defendant\u2019s obligation with respect to on-site testing. Relying on the 1987 purchase agreement as a contractual modification, they claim that the on-site testing provisions manifest an intent to postpone \u201ctender of delivery.\u201d For these reasons, they contend that the defendant\u2019s November, 1988 completion of on-site testing made their breach of warranty claims timely. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">For statutory authority on the meaning of \u201ctender of delivery\u201d in article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, the plaintiffs cite the text of \u00a7 42a-2-503 and the official comment 1 to that section.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We are not persuaded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>either the section or the official comment supports the position they espouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">It is indisputable that \u00a7 42a-2-503 (1) states that \u201c[t]he . . . time . . . for tender [is] determined by the agreement and this article . . . .\u201d Textually, that language does not address what constitutes a \u201ctender of delivery. \u201d Nowhere else does the statutory text of article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code contain an express definition of the phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The closer statutory rule may be found in the definitions of \u201ctender of delivery\u201d contained in the official comment 1 to \u00a7 42a-2-503. The language of the comment does not support the plaintiffs\u2019 position. One definition describes \u201ctender\u201d as \u201can offer coupled with a present ability to fulfill all the [contractual] conditions . . . [which] must <em>be followed </em>by actual performance . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) A.L.I., Uniform Commercial Code (14th Ed. 1995) \u00a7 2-503, official comment 1. The other definition describes \u201ctender\u201d as \u201can offer of goods . . . under a contract <em>as if </em>in fulfillment of [contractual] conditions . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. The meaning of this \u201cas if\u2019 proposition is clarified in the immediately succeeding sentence, which defines \u201ctender,\u201d in all cases, as \u201csuch performance by the tendering party as puts the other party in default if he fails to proceed in some manner.\u201d Id. Under the Uniform Commercial Code, the defendant\u2019s physical delivery of the engines required the plaintiffs, on pain of default; General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-703;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> to take some action, either by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>rejecting their tender; General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-602;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> or by paying the contract price to the defendant upon their acceptance. General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-607.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-606 (l)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> expressly ties \u201ca reasonable opportunity to inspect the goods\u201d to \u201cacceptance\u201d rather than to \u201ctender of delivery.\u201d Accordingly, the relevant statutory provisions in article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code do not, by themselves, make performance of the defendant\u2019s on-site testing obligations a condition of a tender of delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Our conclusion that there is a statutory distinction between preacceptance testing and tender of delivery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>is supported by holdings of courts in other jurisdictions. Many courts have held that contractual provisions for postdelivery testing or inspection do not delay the accrual of breach of warranty claims. <em>Cincinnati </em>v. <em>Dorr-Oliver, Inc., </em>supra, 659 F. Sup. 263-64; <em>Long Island Lighting Co. </em>v. <em>Transamerica Delaval, Inc., </em>646 F. Sup. 1442, 1455 (S.D.N.Y. 1986); <em>Ontario Hydro </em>v. <em>Zallea Systems, Inc., </em>569 F. Sup. 1261, 1265-68 (D. Del. 1983); cf. <em>New York </em>v. <em>Pullman, Inc., </em>662 F.2d 910, 919 (2d Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 stronger argument is that the 1987 purchase agreement was a permissible contractual variation of the otherwise applicable statutory rules. We agree with the plaintiffs that the Uniform Commercial Code confers broad authority on the contracting parties either to define statutory terms or otherwise to vary statutory provisions. General Statutes \u00a7 42a-l-102 (3).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 42a-l-102 counsels, however, that specific language in the text of any section of the Uniform Commercial Code may limit the scope of an otherwise permissible contractual variation. Section 42a-2-725 limits the authority of contracting parties in two respects. Subdivision (1) of the statute provides: \u201cBy the original agreement the parties may reduce the period of limitation to not less than one year but may not extend it.\u201d Subdivision (2) of the statute allows the parties to postpone the occurrence of a breach of warranty only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>if \u201ca warranty <em>explicitly </em>extends to future performance of the goods . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) We disagree with the conclusions that the plaintiffs draw from these statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The question before us is not whether the parties had the contractual power to modify the time when a breach of warranty occurs or to redefine tender of delivery, which presumptively starts the accrual of claims for breach of warranty. The issue, rather, is whether they exercised that power \u201cexplicitly,\u201d as \u00a7 42a-2-725 (2) requires.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We are not persuaded that they have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">If a statute requires an agreement \u201cexplicitly\u201d to extend the accrual of warranty obligations, the unstated intent of the parties cannot be relied upon to add to, or to explain, the terms of the agreement. We disagree, therefore, with the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the trial court improperly construed the 1987 purchase agreement as raising a question of law that could be resolved by summary judgment.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> See 2 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 212 (2) (1981).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">We are unable to discern any language in the 1987 purchase agreement that <em>explicitly </em>extends the defendant\u2019s responsibility for breach of warranty. The agreement contains no express linkage between the defendant\u2019s contractual duty to provide staff for on-site testing and a modification of the statutory conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>for tender of delivery or for accrual of claims for breach of warranty. That omission is notable because the payment clause of the agreement expressly distinguishes between delivery and acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">It would be questionable policy to interpolate linkage provisions into an agreement that contains no time frame for the performance that the plaintiffs allege to be contractual prerequisites to atender of delivery. <em>New England Power Co. </em>v. <em>Riley Stoker </em>Corp., 20 Mass. App. 25, 29, 477 N.E.2d 1054 (1985) (rejecting similar theory because it \u201cwould extend the statute of limitations indefinitely into the future since a defect at the time of delivery would prevent proper due tender from taking place until it was corrected\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Under the plaintiffs\u2019 argument, the date for accrual of their warranty claims might be postponed indefinitely, even for reasons entirely unrelated to the defendant\u2019s performance.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">In light of the disapproval under the Uniform Commercial Code of contracts that have the effect of extending the statute of limitations; General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-725 (1); we conclude that the 1987 purchase agreement did not meet the modification criterion specified by \u00a7 42a-2-725 (2). The 1987 purchase agreement, therefore, did not save the express and implied warranty counts<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint from the bar of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">THE 1990 SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">We next consider the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the 1990 settlement agreement made their breach of warranty claims timely. Their principal argument is that the 1990 settlement agreement was a novation, under which the defendant assumed newly actionable warranty obligations that accrued well within the four year limitations period of \u00a7 42a-2-725. Alternatively, they argue that, as a contract, the 1990 settlement agreement was actionable apart from the warranty claims in their complaint; General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-701;<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and, therefore, not subject to \u00a7 42a-2-725. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">CCF-1 presented the novation issue to the trial court in a motion to open and vacate the summary judgment rendered in favor of the defendant.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In the motion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>CCF-1 acknowledged that it was raising \u201ca new question of law, which the Court has not previously addressed, and which the parties have not previously briefed or argued.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">In its trial court brief in support of the motion to open and vacate, CCF-1 asserted that the settlement agreement was a novation, as a matter of law, because it substituted the defendant for Sulzer as the party responsible for Sulzer\u2019s warranty obligations. CCF-1 argued that it could not have pursued warranty claims against the defendant directly<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> until, by the terms of the 1990 settlement agreement, the defendant agreed to assume Sulzer\u2019s warranty obligations. On this reasoning, CCF-1 claimed that the 1990 settlement agreement made the complaint timely.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The trial court, <em>Gaffney, J., </em>concluded<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> that the 1990 settlement agreement was not a novation and, therefore, denied the motion of CCF-1. It relied on two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>aspects of the agreement, the absence of the word \u201cnovation,\u201d and the preservation of Sulzer\u2019s warranty obligation at least in some respects. The court held that the agreement was a modification and not a novation because it did not purport to extinguish all the rights and obligations of the parties under the 1987 purchase agreement, as the law of novation requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The plaintiffs, on appeal, focus on the provision in the 1990 settlement agreement that \u201c[a]ll duties of [Sulzer] under the [1987 pinchase agreement] <em>relating to components which [the defendant] supplied </em>shall be delegated to [the defendant], [the defendant] accepts the delegation and [Sulzer] shall be released from such duties.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Contrary to their position at trial, they now maintain that the trial court: (1) had no authority to decide their claim of novation by way of summary judgment because the existence of a novation is always an issue of fact; and (2) misconstrued the 1990 settlement agreement by failing to recognize its validity as a partial novation.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 first claim cannot be sustained. Even if we were inclined to overlook the inconsistency between their arguments to the trial court and to this court; Practice Book \u00a7 4061;<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> we could not consider their argument on its merits because we lack the record to do so. Practice Book \u00a7 4061. In light of the position taken in the motion to open and vacate, the plaintiffs never submitted any affidavit at trial that would support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>a claim of a factual controversy about the meaning of the 1990 settlement agreement. Absent such an affidavit, summary judgment was procedurally appropriate. See Practice Book \u00a7 880.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">The plaintiffs\u2019 second claim of novation is equally unavailing. We agree with the trial court that the language of the 1990 settlement agreement did not, in itself, create new warranty obligations and did not supersede or extinguish the warranty obligations contained in the 1987 purchase <em>agreement.</em><footnotemark><em>35</em></footnotemark><em>\u2019'Riverside Coal Co. </em>v. <em>American Coal Co., </em>107 Conn. 40, 47, 139 A. 276 (1927); <em>Bushnell Plaza Development Corp. </em>v. <em>Fazzano, </em>38 Conn. Sup. 683, 688, 460 A.2d 1311 (1983). To the extent that the 1990 settlement agreement substituted the defendant\u2019s new warranties for most of Sulzer\u2019s warranties, the content of the new warranties can be found only in the 1987 purchase agreement. The logic of the trial court\u2019s position is not undermined even if, as the plaintiffs now allege, the 1990 settlement agreement constituted only a partial novation. Although the parties may agree to a partial novation, an essential element of any novation is the extinguishing of the original contract by substitution of a new one. <em>Mace </em>v. <em>Conde Nast Publications, Inc., </em>155 Conn. 680, 688, 237 A.2d 360 (1967); <em>Ruwet Sibley Equipment Corp. </em>v. <em>Stebbins, </em>15 Conn. App. 21, 26, 542 A.2d 1171, cert. dismissed, 209 Conn. 806, 548 A.2d 437 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">There is, however, an even more fundamental flaw in the plaintiffs\u2019 argument of novation. In their complaint, the plaintiffs did not claim a right to damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>for breach of warranty arising directly under the 1990 settlement agreement. Although they alluded to the 1990 settlement agreement in paragraph thirteen of the first count of the complaint, that paragraph characterizes the defendant as having accepted Sulzer\u2019s duties <em>under the 1987purchase agreement. </em>Consistently with the terms of the complaint, in response to the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs\u2019 express and implied warranty claims, the plaintiffs relied on the terms of the 1987 purchase agreement and not on the terms of the 1990 settlement agreement. It is too late for the plaintiffs to amend their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">As the defendant notes, if the plaintiffs\u2019 novation argument were to be sustained, their pleadings would create a dilemma for them. The warranty claims in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, which rely on the 1987 purchase agreement, would have become unenforceable if the 1987 warranty obligations had been extinguished and superseded by the 1990 settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">We conclude that the 1990 settlement agreement modifies and incorporates, but does not extinguish, the terms of the 1987 purchase agreement. The trial court properly denied the motion of CCF-1 to open and vacate the summary judgment on the ground of novation.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">In addition to the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the 1990 settlement agreement was a novation with respect to their breach of warranty claims, the motion of CCF-1 to open and vacate the summary judgment referred to the defendant\u2019s contractual obligations under the 1990 settlement agreement and asserted that no cause of action could have accrued against the defendant until July 31, 1990. The plaintiffs now reiterate that claim by arguing that the trial court improperly found a statutory limitations bar to the contracts claim, as distinguished from the warranty claims, in their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Although the court originally granted summary judgment only with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 warranty claims, it subsequently broadened its holding in a verbal ruling. The court held that there was too close a congruence between the plaintiffs\u2019 contract claims and their express and implied warranty claims to warrant a distinction in the applicability of the breach of warranty statute of limitations in \u00a7 42a-2-725.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 argument that they should be permitted to pursue an independent claim for breach of contract founders on two grounds. First, count one of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, which states the only claim for breach of contract, does not rely on the 1990 settlement agreement as having imposed freestanding contracts liability upon the defendant. Second, the plaintiffs have offered no reasoned argument challenging the trial court\u2019s construction of the first count of the complaint as essentially grounded in claims of breach of warranty. In the circumstances of this case, the plaintiffs\u2019 contract claim, like its warranty claims, is governed by \u00a7 42a-2-725.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the 1990 settlement agreement did not extend the accrual of the statute of limitations. We affirm the rulings of the trial court that the plaintiffs\u2019 warranty and contract claims were untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">THE REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT CLAUSE</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">We turn now to the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that a clause in the 1987 purchase agreement for repair or replacement of defective material or equipment was an additional warranty on which they could rely to postpone the accrual of the statute of limitations. In effect, they claim that the clause is an express warranty of future performance, so that \u201cdiscovery of the breach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>must await the time of such performance [and] the cause of action accrues when the breach is or should have been discovered. ...\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-725 (2). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The repair or replacement clause is to be found in the following provision of the 1987 purchase agreement: \u201cAll material and equipment furnished under this order shall be guaranteed by the Seller against defects, and Seller agrees to replace without charge to Purchaser said material and equipment, or remedy any defects latent or patent not due to ordinary wear and tear or due to improper use or maintenance, which may develop within one year from date of acceptance by the Owner, or within the guarantee period set forth in applicable plans and specifications, whichever is longer.\u201d The controversy between the parties concerns only the proper interpretation of the language beginning \u201cand Seller agrees . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The construction of the repair or replacement clause became an issue at trial as a result of the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to all of the plaintiffs\u2019 warranty claims. The defendant argued that the clause was not an express warranty that postponed the running of the statute of limitations on the plaintiffs\u2019 warranty claims. The trial court agreed with the plaintiffs that the defendant\u2019s affirmative obligation to \u201cremedy any defects\u201d was an independent express warranty that extended to future performance. The court also held that the meaning and effect of the clause raised issues of fact that should not be resolved by a summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The court then conducted a jury trial to determine CCF-l\u2019s rights under the repair or replacement clause. CCF-1 attempted to prove breach of this clause by introducing evidence allegedly showing breach of express and implied warranties contained elsewhere in the 1987 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>purchase agreement.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The trial court refused to admit such evidence on the ground that it was not probative of a failure to perform required repairs or replacements. Because of the absence of any other probative evidence of breach of the repair or replacement clause, the court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">On appeal, the plaintiffs make the following claims. They argue that the trial court: (1) as a matter of law, improperly limited the scope of the repair or replacement clause by refusing to recognize its incoiporation of other warranty obligations; and (2) in abuse of the court\u2019s discretion, improperly failed to permit the plaintiffs to demonstrate breach of the repair or replacement clause by evidence that the engines delivered by the defendant suffered from design and other defects that made them unreasonably costly to maintain.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Before we reach these claims, however, we must consider an antecedent question concerning the relationship between the repair or replacement clause and the provisions of \u00a7 42a-2-725. Without establishing such a relationship, the plaintiffs cannot prevail on their warranty claims. The ultimate issue raised by the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment must be decided by determining the date of accrual of the plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>warranty claims for defective <em>performance </em>of the engines themselves.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The defendant argues, and we agree, that the repair or replacement clause contains no terms that, as a matter of law, would constitute an explicit warranty of future performance, as \u00a7 42a-2-725 (2) requires. In the event of defects in the engines, the clause describes no more than a contractual commitment by the defendant, for a limited period of time, to provide remedies additional to those provided by article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code. It is irrelevant that the plaintiffs have attached a warranty label to the clause. \u201cPutting a [warranty] tag on a [nonwarranty clause] will no more change its essential character than calling a bull a cow will change its gender.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gooch, </em>186 Conn. 17, 18, 438 A.2d 867 (1982). In light of its plain language, we conclude that the clause cannot be construed either as a new warranty of performance or as an additional commitment for future performance of other implied or express remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Although this question is one of first impression for this court, decisions in other jurisdictions support our construction of the repair or replacement clause. State courts around the country have concluded that such clauses provide a buyer no relief other than that expressly promised by the language of the clause. Consequently, they too have held that a promise to repair or replace, unless it contains express language to the contrary, is not a promise of future performance with respect to \u00a7 42a-2-725 (2). See, e.g., <em>Tittle </em>v. <em>Steel City Oldsmobile GMC Truck, Inc., </em>544 So. 2d 883, 886-91 (Ala. 1989); <em>Voth v. Chrysler Motor Corp., </em>218 Kan. 644, 648-52, 545 P.2d 371 (1976); <em>Herbstman </em>v. <em>Eastman Kodak Co., </em>68 N.J. 1, 11-12, 342 A.2d 181 (1975).<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Accordingly, we reject the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the repair or replacement clause in the purchase agreement tolls the running of the statute of limitations under \u00a7 42a-2-725. Although we do so on a ground that differs somewhat from that upon which the trial court relied,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> we affirm its judgment that all of the plaintiffs\u2019 warranty claims were filed too late. \u201cThis court is not required to reverse a ruling of the trial court which reached a correct result, albeit for a wrong reason.\u201d <em>Herrmann v. Summer Plaza Corp., </em>201 Conn. 263, 274, 513 A.2d 1211 (1986); <em>Favorite </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>176 Conn. 310, 317, 407 A.2d 974 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">MISREPRESENTATION AND UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 final claim is that their complaint stated valid causes of action for misrepresentation and for breach of CUTPA. In the fourth count, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant had knowingly or negligently misrepresented the future performance of the engines, and that the plaintiffs had relied on these misrepresentations to their detriment.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> In the sixth count, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant\u2019s misrepresentations had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>wrongMly induced them to purchase the engines produced by the defendant, and that, in consequence, the plaintiffs were entitled to actual and punitive damages and to attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The defendant filed a motion to strike these two counts \u201cbecause the plaintiffs are seeking recovery for commercial loss and, as a result, are limited to the remedies provided by the Uniform Commercial Code.\u201d The plaintiffs argued, to the contrary, that actions for fraud did not fall within the economic loss rule. Further, they maintained that, even if the economic loss rule would otherwise have barred their tort and unfair practices claims, those claims were validated by savings provisions contained in the Uniform Commercial Code, General Statutes \u00a7 42a-l-103<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> and \u00a7 42a-2-721.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Finally, they argued that their allegations of fraudulent inducement stated a valid claim under CUTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>The trial court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments and granted the defendant\u2019s motion to strike. After painstaking examination of the applicable case law and statutory authorities, the court concluded that \u201ca situation such as this one \u2014 involving commercial parties and economic losses suffered as a result of an alleged product failure \u2014 is precisely the type of circumstance where such misrepresentation and breach of contract [claims] are incompatible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">In their original brief on appeal, the plaintiffs did not contest the validity of the trial court\u2019s statutory analysis. Instead, they argued that the trial court improperly applied the economic loss rule because, in their view, the rule does not apply to claims \u201cfor negligent misrepresentation of information provided for the guidance of others or to claims for unfair trade practices.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> We agree with the holdings of cases in other jurisdictions that commercial losses arising out of the defective performance of contracts for the sale of goods cannot be combined with negligent misrepresentation. See <em>Duquesne Light Co. </em>v. <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp., </em>66 F.3d 604, 618 (3d Cir. 1995); <em>Princess Cruises, Inc. </em>v. <em>General Electric Co., </em>950 F. Sup. 151, 155 (E.D. Va. 1996) (\u201cThe parties are sophisticated corporations familiar with the type of services rendered, and the consequences of a mechanical failure likely to result from a failure to perform the contract as promised. The parties were free to allocate the risks, insure against potential losses, and adjust the contract price as they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>deemed most wise. This Court sees \u2018no reason to extricate the parties from their bargain.\u2019 \u201d); see also General Statutes \u00a7 52-572n (c);<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> 1 Restatement (Third), Torts, Products Liability (proposed final draft) \u00a7 6, p. 303 (1996).<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> These authorities are particularly persuasive in the circumstances of this case, in which the misrepresentation and CUTPA claims depend upon allegations of fact that are identical to those asserted in their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">In their reply brief, relying on \u00a7\u00a7 42a-1-103 and 42a-2-721 of the Uniform Commercial Code, the plaintiffs renew the statutory arguments that the trial court found unpersuasive. We agree with the trial court\u2019s rejection of these statutory claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Section 42a-l-103 preserves a broad range of common-law actions, including actions for fraud and misrepresentation, unless such actions are \u201cdisplaced by the particular provisions of this title.\u201d One such \u201cparticular provision\u201d is \u00a7 42a-2-721. Section 42a-2-721 provides that, in some circumstances, a claim for a remedy for material misrepresentation or fraud may be consistent with other claims arising under article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Such consistency may be found in the event of \u201crescission or a claim for rescission of the contract for sale [or] rejection or return <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>of the goods . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-721. The official comment to that section emphasizes that, even in such cases, the circumstances may make the remedies inconsistent.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> A.L.I., Uniform Commercial Code, supra, \u00a7 2-721, official comment. By implication, the intent of \u00a7 42a-2-721 is to make actions for fraud or misrepresentation presumptively <em>inconsistent </em>with postacceptance claims for breach of warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">In this case, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for fraud and for unfair trade practices cannot be squeezed into the narrow presumption of consistency contained in \u00a7 42a-2-721. Wisely, the plaintiffs never claimed that their complaint rests either on their rejection of the engines tendered to them by the defendant; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42a-2-601 through 42a-2-606;<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> or on their rescission of the 1987 purchase agreement.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Moreover, the relevant circumstances, as disclosed in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, do not support their \u00a7 42a-2-721 claim. As earlier noted, the pleadings in the fourth and sixth counts of the complaint depend, for their factual underpinnings, exclusively on facts alleged elsewhere in the complaint. This record fails to demonstrate a statutory basis to sustain the consistency of the challenged counts with other counts of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>The trial court, <em>Dorsey, J., </em>properly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the fourth and sixth counts of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.

Griffin, Jr., the president of Process, wrote to Sulzer that Process had expected on-site testing to begin \u201cshortly after delivery.\u201d The reason why such testing was not completed until November 3,1988, was \u201ca failure of the steam turbine provided by Murray Turbomachinery, Inc. That failure occurred on August 4, 1988, at which time we were projecting the start of a seven day series of tests on August 8, 1988.\u201d Referring to the alleged failure of the defendant to deliver the gas turbines in timely fashion, Griffin concluded that the defendant had \u201cdelayed project completion from May 15, 1988, to August 15, 1988 . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b161-8\"> The plaintiffs have not claimed that, with respect to the running of the statute of limitations, we should distinguish between any of the express or implied warranty counts in their complaint. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>The third count of their complaint, alleging breach of an implied warranty of fitness, expressly limits the scope of that warranty. That count alleges that the engines are not suitable \u201cbecause they run less than 5,000 hours between major overhauls and because of the defects and deficiencies set forth in paragraphs 16 and 24 of this complaint.\u201d At the jury trial, the plaintiffs expressly disclaimed any reliance on a warranty of fitness, but focused instead on the alleged warranty against design defects. Although the trial was limited to the terms of the repair or replacement clause, the plaintiffs maintained at the time that this clause incorporated their other express and implied warranty claims.
