Id., 559. Prior to the decision in that case, the plaintiff here had been receiving benefits in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>an amount equal to Ms base compensation. He now seeks retroactive recalculation of that award m accordance with <em>Szudora.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">The following facts are pertinent to tMs appeal. The plaintiff, Vincent Marone, a Waterbury police officer, was diagnosed on September 9,1980, as suffering from hypertension that resulted in a 10 percent disability of Ms cardiovascular system. He reached maximum medical improvement on April 15, 1982, and retired on that date with a pension of $272.59 per week. On July 14, 1983, the plaintiff was awarded disability benefits pursuant to \u00a7 7-433c m an amount eqmvalent to the base pay for Ms position. The award was retroactive to April 15, 1982. On April 17, 1990, tMs court decided <em>Szudora. </em>In September, 1993, the defendant, the city of Waterbury, voluntarily adjusted Marone\u2019s benefit cap to include overtime pay.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On June 21,1994, the plaintiff requested a recalculation, in accordance with <em>Szudora, </em>of his weekly compensation from April 15, 1982, the date he became entitled to disability benefits. On July 12, 1995, the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the fifth district (commissioner) declmed to apply <em>Szudora </em>retroactively because (1) the plaintiffs case was not pending at the time <em>Szudora </em>was decided, and (2) retroactive application would impose a new and significant burden on municipalities and taxpayers. On July 20, 1995, the plaintiff petitioned for review of the commissioner\u2019s decision. The compensation review board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>(board) affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision on January 10, 1997, determining that: (1) retroactive application of <em>Szudora </em>was inappropriate under <em>Chevron Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Huson, </em>404 U.S. 97, 92 S. Ct. 349, 30 L. Ed. 2d 296 (1971);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (2) the action was no longer pending; and (3) such a result would be unduly burdensome to municipalities. Without explaining the basis for its reasoning, the board further stated that <em>Szudora </em>could be applied prospectively to the plaintiffs future benefits and that such a claim would be cognizable by the workers\u2019 compensation commission (commission).5 The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the board to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">The plaintiff argues that <em>Szudora, </em>should be applied retroactively and that his benefits should, therefore, be recalculated to include overtime payments because: (1) judicial decisions are presumed to apply retroactively; (2) the circumstances of this case do not satisfy the three part test outlined in <em>Chevron Oil Co. </em>so as to overcome the presumption of retroactivity because the legislative history and remedial purpose of the act indicate that the <em>Szudora </em>decision was clearly foreshadowed, retroactive application of <em>Szudora </em>will further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>the remedial purpose of the act, and the equitable considerations weigh in favor of allowing the plaintiff the measure of benefits to which he became entitled from the date of his injury; and (3) the commissioner mistakenly relied on <em>Adams </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>39 Conn. Sup. 321, 464 A.2d 70 (1983), for the proposition that \u00a7 7-433c should not be applied retroactively.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">The defendant argues that in affirming the commission\u2019s decision to reject the plaintiffs claim of retroactive benefits the board correctly applied <em>Chevron Oil Co. </em>because <em>Szudora </em>was a case of first impression and the decision had not been clearly foreshadowed, a recalculation would not further the remedial purposes of the act because the plaintiff had not, in fact, earned overtime compensation while employed, and. retroactive application of <em>Szudora </em>to cases such as this one would be extremely burdensome to municipalities. The defendant further argues that even if <em>Szudora </em>should apply retroactively, it is inapplicable to the present case because it was not pending when <em>Szudora </em>was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">The amici curiae, the cities of Bridgeport and Hartford, argue that the plaintiff is not entitled to a recalculation of his benefits because: (1) reopening the original award based on a change of law such as that represented by <em>Szudora </em>would violate General Statutes \u00a7 31-315,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which governs the commission\u2019s power to modify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation awards; (2) the equitable doctrines of laches and estoppel prevent retroactive application of <em>Szudora-, </em>and (3) the public policy favoring finality of judgments forbids the recalculation of awards in nonpending cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">Determining whether the plaintiff is entitled to a recalculation of his benefits requires the resolution of two separate but related questions. First, we must determine whether the original award was a pending matter for the purpose of recalculation of benefits. If it was pending, we must next decide whether the presumption in favor of retroactivity has been overcome according to the terms of our decision in <em>Szudora </em>and the criteria set forth in <em>Chevron Oil Co. </em>If we were to conclude that retroactive application of <em>Szudora </em>is appropriate, we would then order a recalculation of the plaintiffs benefits to April 15, 1982, to include overtime. Second, we must determine whether the interpretation of \u00a7 7-433b (b) in <em>Szudora </em>constitutes proper grounds, pursuant to \u00a7 31-315, for modifying the original award and, if so, whether and to what extent such a modification should be applied retroactively. We agree with the defendant, the commission and the board that the 1983 award was not a pending matter when <em>Szudora </em>was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>decided. We also agree with the amici curiae that the commission lacked the statutory authority to modify the award on the basis of our decision is <em>Szudora, </em>either prospectively or retroactively.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, we need not determine whether <em>Szudora </em>requires the retroactive recalculation of benefits with regard to a claimant whose case was pending when <em>Szudora </em>was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">We must first determine the standard of review applicable to this appeal. Decisions of administrative agencies are generally accorded considerable deference by this court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Lieberman </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>216 Conn. 253, 263, 579 A.2d 505 (1990). This is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>particularly true where the issue on appeal involves questions of fact. See <em>Six </em>v. <em>Thomas O\u2019Connor &amp; Co., </em>235 Conn. 790, 798-99, 669 A.2d 1214 (1996); <em>Tomlinson </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>226 Conn. 704, 712-13, 629 A.2d 333 (1993); <em>Crochiere </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>227 Conn. 333, 347, 630 A.2d 1027 (1993). It is the function of the courts, however, rather than of administrative agencies, to \u201cexpound and apply governing principles of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lieberman </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>supra, 262; see <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>380 U.S. 278, 291, 85 S. Ct. 980, 13 L. Ed. 2d 839 (1965). The question presented by this appeal concerns the applicability of a decision by this court altering the manner in which benefits are determined to a claimant whose workers\u2019 compensation award has already been adjudicated. This question implicates both the finality of the award and the commission\u2019s statutory authority to modify it.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">We generally accord \u201cdeference to . . . time-tested agency interpretation of a statute, but only when the agency has consistently followed its construction over a long period of time, the statutory language is ambiguous, and the agency\u2019s interpretation is reasonable.\u201d <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>208 Conn. 709, 719, 546 A.2d 830 (1988); see also <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Liquor Control, </em>194 Conn. 165, 174, 479 A.2d 1191 (1984). The plaintiff has not claimed that the commission\u2019s time-tested interpretation of the law allows retroactive recalculation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>1983 award. \u201c[W]hen a state agency\u2019s determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny . . . the agency is not entitled to special deference.\u201d <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>236 Conn. 722, 736, 675 A.2d 430 (1996). The finality of workers\u2019 compensation awards and the scope and extent of the commission\u2019s power to modify those awards are issues that the commission and this court have addressed in the past. See, e.g., <em>Besade </em>v. <em>Interstate Security Services, </em>212 Conn. 441, 445, 562 A.2d 1086 (1989) (workers\u2019 compensation awards, although subject to modification, are final judgments); <em>Kalinick </em>v. <em>Collins Co., </em>116 Conn. 1, 4-5, 163 A. 460 (1932) (commission lacks power to modify award based on mistake of law). To the extent that issues of law have been previously decided by this court, the commission is bound to apply them. The question of law at issue in this appeal is, therefore, one to which the customary deference accorded the agency\u2019s determinations is not appropriate. <em>SLI International </em>v. <em>Crystal, </em>236 Conn. 156, 170, 671 A.2d 813 (1996); <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>supra, 718. Thus, we apply \u201ca broader standard of review than is ordinarily involved in deciding whether, in light of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion.\u201d <em>Lieberman </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">The commission and the board both concluded that the plaintiffs 1983 claim was no longer pending when <em>Szudora </em>was decided and that it was, therefore, inappropriate to recalculate his benefits retroactively. We agree. Although it is true that judgments that are not by their terms limited to prospective application are presumed to apply retroactively; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ryerson, </em>201 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Conn. 333, 339, 514 A.2d 337 (1986); this general rule applies to cases that are pending and not to cases that have resulted in final judgments.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The plaintiff has acknowledged that judgments that apply retroactively do so only with respect to pending decisions. He argues, however, that workers\u2019 compensation claims are continuously pending because they always are subject to modification. We, therefore, begin our analysis with a discussion of the principle of finality.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">It has long been accepted that a system of laws upon which individuals, governments and organizations rely to resolve disputes is dependent upon according finality to judicial decisions. \u201cIndefinite continuation of a dispute is a social burden. It consumes time and energy that may be put to other use, not only of the parties, but of the community as a whole. It rewards the disputatious. It renders uncertain the working premises upon which the transactions of the day are to be conducted. . . . The convention concerning finality of judgments has to be accepted if the idea of law is to be accepted, certainly if there is to be practical meaning to the idea that legal disputes can be resolved by judicial process.\u201d I Restatement (Second), Judgments, Introduction, p. II (1982). \u201c[A] party should not be able to relitigate a matter which it already has had an opportunity to litigate. . . . Stability in judgments grants to parties and others the certainty in the management of their affairs which results when a controversy is finally laid to rest.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-DE), </em>190 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Conn. 310, 318, 460 A.2d 1277 (1983); see <em>Delahunty </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>236 Conn. 582, 589, 674 A.2d 1290 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">While there is a distinction between finality for purposes of appeal and for purposes of res judicata, the two often overlap. 1 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 13. In limited circumstances, a decision may be appealable and yet not be final for purposes of res judicata. Id.; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983). On the other hand, once the time limit for appeal has passed, a judgment generally has preclusive effect with respect to subsequent actions. As noted in the Restatement, the trial court may entertain a request for relief from judgment based upon a change in law occurring during the appeal period. 2 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 71, comment (f). This power is, however, \u201cnot a substitute for an appeal.\u201d Id. \u201cFor res judicata purposes, a judgment is \u2018final\u2019 if no further judicial action by [the] court rendering judgment is required to determine [the] matter litigated.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990). A final award is \u201c[o]ne which conclusively determines the matter submitted and leaves nothing to be done except to execute and carry out the terms of [the] award.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Whether a judgment is final depends upon the governing statute. \u201c[T]he line that separates lower court judgments that are pending on appeal (or may still be appealed), from lower court judgments that are final, is determined by statute .... Having achieved finality ... a judicial decision becomes the last word of the judicial department with regard to a particular case or controversy . . . .\u201d <em>Plaut </em>v. <em>Spendthrift Farm, Inc., </em>514 U.S. 211, 227, 115 S. Ct. 1447, 131 L. Ed. 2d 328 (1995). Principles of finality are equally applicable to administrative decisions, such as workers\u2019 compensation awards, that are appealable to the Superior Court. Both employers and their injured employees must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>able to depend on the finality of administrative decisions and the appeals taken therefrom in order to regulate their future behavior. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-301a<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and 31-301b<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> govern the finality of workers\u2019 compensation awards, which become final when and if the parties fail to appeal within the statutory time period. In the present case, the plaintiff began receiving benefits pursuant to the 1983 award once the appeal period lapsed without either party having appealed the commission\u2019s determination. Because neither the plaintiff nor the defendant appealed the original award, it became final and was, accordingly, no longer pending when <em>Szudora </em>was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The plaintiff argues that workers\u2019 compensation awards are always interlocutory because they are subject to modification. See, e.g., <em>Wysocki </em>v. <em>Bradley &amp; Hubbard Co., </em>113 Conn. 170, 178, 154 A. 431 (1931) (award is \u201cmore nearly an interlocutory than a final judgment\u201d); <em>Tutsky </em>v. <em>YMCA of Greenwich, </em>28 Conn. App. 536, 541, 612 A.2d 1222 (1992) (characterizing workers\u2019 compensation awards as interlocutory but noting that \u00a7 31-315 limits commission\u2019s authority to modify). As we stated in <em>Wysocki, </em>however, \u201c[a] motion to open [an award] under such changed conditions is . . . virtually a new proceeding.\u201d <em>Wysocki </em>v. <em>Bradley &amp; Hubbard </em>Co., supra, 178. Therefore, while workers\u2019 compensation awards may bear some resemblance to interlocutory decrees, that similarity does not mean that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>such an award is, in fact, interlocutory. For example, a workers\u2019 compensation award conclusively establishes the employer\u2019s liability and precludes relitigation of that issue in a subsequent action brought in a court of general jurisdiction. See, e.g., <em>Saporoso </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>221 Conn. 356, 603 A.2d 1160 (1992), overruled on other grounds, <em>Santopietro </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>239 Conn. 207, 214-15, 682 A.2d 106 (1996). Although \u00a7 31-315 authorizes the commission to retain jurisdiction over the award during the entire disability period, that provision serves the purpose of preventing the claim from being challenged or modified in a court of general jurisdiction after the appeal period has lapsed; <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Arthur A. Fogarty, Inc., </em>157 Conn. 538, 255 A.2d 627 (1969); and does not render the award any less final. Workers\u2019 compensation awards are \u201cfinal judgments] as to benefits through the date of the hearing .... If such an award were not a final judgment because it was subject to such modification, no workers\u2019 compensation award could ever be final, and therefore appealable, until the claimant either died or recovered . . . .\u201d <em>Besade </em>v. <em>Interstate Security Services, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 445. The plaintiffs claim was, therefore, final and not pending at the time <em>Szudora </em>was decided. Thus, it is irrelevant to the plaintiffs situation whether <em>Szudora </em>should be applied retroactively to pending cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">Although the initial award is not a pending action, final judgments may be modified pursuant to statutory authority.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The amici curiae argue that \u00a7 31-315, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>governs the workers\u2019 compensation commission\u2019s authority to modify otherwise final awards, does not authorize modifications based on a new interpretation of law such as that contained in <em>Szudora. </em>We agree. Although the commission may modify awards under certain circumstances, its power to do so is strictly limited by statute. We conclude that \u00a7 31-315 does not permit recalculation of the plaintiffs award.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Although strict finality is strongly favored, there are certain situations that demand a flexible approach allowing for modifications. Two examples of such situations are custody and family maintenance actions, and workers\u2019 compensation awards. The statutory framework in each of these areas permits final awards to be modified in a subsequent action when certain criteria are satisfied.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In the family law context, alimony and support awards and child custody and visitation orders are subject to modification but, nevertheless, are considered to be final appealable judgments. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (a) (permitting modification of alimony and support awards); General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56 (permitting modification of child custody and visitation awards). Workers\u2019 compensation awards are modifiable pursuant to \u00a7 31-315.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Modifications pursuant to \u00a7 31-315 are, however, separate actions, brought in accordance with the procedures required for original work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>ers\u2019 compensation claims and are themselves subject to the finality restrictions of \u00a7\u00a7 31-301a and 31-301b.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The power of the commission to hear modification requests is determined by the provisions of \u00a7 31-315. \u201cIt is clear that an administrative body must act strictly within its statutory authority, within its constitutional limitations and in a lawful manner.\u201d <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>160 Conn. 226, 230, 278 A.2d 771 (1971). The parties to a claim cannot, by agreement, endow the commission with the authority to decide that claim. <em>Jester </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>99 Conn. 236, 238, 121 A. 470 (1923). Additionally, a decision of an administrative agency cannot be \u201cset aside upon the sole ground that it is erroneous in matter of law, except by a court exercising appellate or revisory jurisdiction, unless authorized by statute, or unless the error is one going to the jurisdiction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kalinick </em>v. <em>Collins Co., </em>supra, 116 Conn. 8. The defendant\u2019s decision voluntarily to recalculate the plaintiffs future benefits cannot, therefore, confer authority upon the commission retroactively to modify the award. Unless the commission had such authority, pursuant to \u00a7 31-315, it lacked the power to recalculate the plaintiffs benefits, either retroactively or prospectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Section 31-315 allows the commission to modify an award in three situations. First, modification is permitted where \u201cthe incapacity of an injured employee has increased, decreased or ceased, or . . . the measure of dependence on account of which the compensation is paid has changed . . . .\u201d The plaintiff has not alleged that either of these contingencies has occurred. Second, the award may be modified when \u201cchanged conditions of fact have arisen which necessitate a change of [the award].\u201d The plaintiff has pointed to no change of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>necessitating a change in the original award. Third, \u201c[t]he commissioner shall also have the same power to open and modify an award as any court of the state has to open and modify a judgment of such court.\u201d This provision extends the commission\u2019s power to open and modify judgments to cases of accident; <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Wallace &amp; Sons Mfg. Co., </em>100 Conn. 180, 188, 123 A. 9 (1923); to mistakes of fact; <em>Fair </em>v. <em>Hartford Rubber Works Co., </em>95 Conn. 350, 355, 111 A. 193 (1920); and to fraud; <em>Grabowski v. Miskell, </em>97 Conn. 76, 84, 115 A. 691 (1921); but not to mistakes of law. <em>Kalinick </em>v. <em>Collins Co., </em>supra, 116 Conn. 4-5.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The final clause of \u00a7 31-315 allows the commission to retain jurisdiction over claims during the entire compensable period. This provision, however, does not independently confer authority to modify awards for reasons not otherwise enumerated in \u00a7 31-315. Id., 7-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">In <em>Kalinick, </em>a case very similar to the present one, this court determined that the commission lacked the power to recalculate an award when the basis for the recalculation was a change of law. Id., 8. The plaintiff in <em>Kalinick </em>had been receiving benefits based upon his average weekly wage during the twenty-six week period next preceding his cessation of the work that caused his disability. After the original award in <em>Kalinick </em>was issued, this court subsequently decided that, for the type of disability in question, the appropriate measure was the average weekly wage during the twenty-six week period next preceding the onset of incapacity. See <em>Rousu </em>v. <em>Collins Co., </em>114 Conn. 24, 30, 157 A. 264 (1931). <em>In Kalinick, </em>the employer and its insurer sought to open and modify the award based on the decision in <em>Rousu. </em>This court concluded that \u201ca reopening and modification based upon a mistake of law, as here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>would not be permissible unless the control over its award for correction of errors of law, as distinguished from mistakes of fact, which a court possesses over its judgment only during the term in which it is rendered, is held to continue in the commissioner during the entire compensation period.

They argue, rather, that \u201c[i]t is beyond the authority of a Commissioner to malee <em>any </em>modification\u201d based upon our decision in <em>Szudora. </em>(Emphasis added.) We recognize that, in their conclusion, they request that the board\u2019s decision be affirmed and that we hold that <em>Szudora </em>should be applied in a \u201cprospective-only manner\u201d to this plaintiff. On the basis of the absence of any such distinction in their brief, however, we interpret this statement in light of the plaintiffs request for relief in this case and the voluntary agreement between the parties. See footnote 3 of this opinion. We, therefore, conclude that the amici curiae\u2019s request for prospective application of <em>Szudora </em>is not based on the argument that \u00a7 31-315 requires or permits such a distinction but, instead, recognizes that the defendant\u2019s voluntary decision to provide prospective relief eliminated this plaintiffs need to request it. The existence of this agreement between the parties does not, however, relieve us of our responsibility to interpret \u00a7 31-315 correctly. Our decision regarding whether the commission had the authority, pursuant to \u00a7 31-315, to modify the award does not turn on the fact that this particular claimant, for reasons independent of the commission\u2019s statutory authority, had no need for prospective relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b28-9\"> The majority of our decisions on workers\u2019 compensation law have required us to determine whether the compensation review board properly reviewed factual determinations made by the commissioner. See, e.g., <em>Fair </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Savings Bank, </em>207 Conn. 535, 538-42, 542 A.2d 1118 (1988), and cases cited therein. Although the context of these cases has not required us to set forth the standard of review for questions of law, we see no reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>to differentiate the standard of review applicable to legal decisions of the workers\u2019 compensation commission from those of other administrative agencies. The essential principles, as we have applied them, are the same. See, e.g., <em>Mathurin </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>136 Conn. 361, 366, 71 A.2d 599 (1950) (\u201caward must stand unless it results from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them\u201d); <em>Wysocki </em>v. <em>Bradley &amp; Hubbard Co., </em>113 Conn. 170, 177, 154 A. 431 (1931) (question of law not within discretion of commissioner).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b31-9\">Allowing re1 reactive application of judgments to nonpending cases would violate the principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel. See <em>Crochierev. Board of Education, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 342-43. Courts, therefore, have only a limited equitable power to open and modify judgments in the absence of express statutory authority to do so. See footnote 11 of this opinion. Implicit in our decisions that have discussed the retroactive application of judgments is the presumption that retroactivity is limited to pending cases. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ryerson, </em>supra, 201 Conn. 339-40; <em>State </em>v. <em>Castle, </em>161 Conn. 570, 571-72, 287 A.2d 744 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b33-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-301a provides: \u201cDecision of Compensation Review Board.

Although administrative agencies do not inherently possess the same power as do courts of general jurisdiction to modify their decisions, they may be authorized by statute to do so. Section 31-315 confers such authority upon the workers\u2019 compensation commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b35-7\"> See, e.g., 1 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 24, comment (f), which provides: \u201cChange of Circumstances.

He provides no basis for this distinction and nothing in \u00a7 31-315 suggests one. Section 31-315 permits modification in certain situations and does not, on its face, distinguish between retroactive and prospective application. See <em>Morisi </em>v. <em>Ansonia Mfg. Co., </em>108 Conn. 31, 33-34, 142 A. 393 (1928) (allowing retroactive modification to the date disability ceases); <em>Gagliardi </em>v. <em>Downing &amp; Perkins, Inc., </em>152 Conn. 475, 481-82, 208 A.2d 334 (1965) (date dependency ceases controls amount of award). In fact, the right to an award \u201carises by operation of law as soon as the incapacity for the statutory period exists and it continues during the incapacity of the employee and only ends with his decease.\u201d <em>Greenwood </em>v. <em>Luby, </em>105 Conn. 398, 400, 135 A. 578 (1926). We see no principled basis upon which to distinguish the vesting date for increases in awards based on modifications from the date applicable to original awards. Moreover, because we have determined that \u00a7 31-315 does not permit modification of this plaintiffs award, we need not reach the question of whether a modification <em>permitted </em>pursuant \u00a7 31-315 should not be applied retroactively based upon considerations such as those set out in <em>Chevron Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Huson, </em>supra, 404 U.S. 106-107.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b39-8\">BERDON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ad\">concurring in part and dissenting in part. I agree with the result reached by the majority that this court\u2019s decision in <em>Szudora </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>214 Conn. 552, 573 A.2d 1 (1990) \u2014 that is, calculation of disability benefits awarded pursuant to the Heart and Hypertension Act (act), General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 7-433b and 7-433c, must include overtime pay \u2014 should not be applied retroactively. I reach this result, not because, as the majority holds, the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner (commissioner) had no jurisdiction under the act to adjust the award to the plaintiff, Vincent Marone, a retired Waterbury police officer. Rather, I reach this result because retroactive application of the act \u201cwould have a burdensome financial impact on [Waterbury and the other] municipalities and taxpayers in Connecticut which would not be equitable\u201d as both the commissioner and the compensation review board (board) found.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Chevron Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Huson, </em>404 U.S. 97, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>106-107, 92 S.

Without the benefit of briefing from either the plaintiff or the defendant, or even the amici curiae,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the majority violates all principles of justiciability by deciding the issue of prospectivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">More importantly, I totally disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the commissioner does not have jurisdiction to modify an award during the entire period in which an employee receives compensation. General Statutes \u00a7 31-315, which gives the commissioner jurisdiction to modify an award or voluntary agreement for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation benefits, provides in relevant part that \u201c [t]he compensation commissioner shall retain jurisdiction over claims for compensation, awards and voluntary agreements, for any proper action thereon, during the whole compensation period applicable to the injury in question.\u201d I read \u00a7 31-315 literally as we are required to do. <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 193, 530 A.2d 171 (1987). It simply means that while the employee is receiving benefits, the commissioner has jurisdiction over the award for any proper action, which would include the increase of compensation as a result of interpretation of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act by the commissioner, the board or the courts. Indeed, in 1920, this court made this point crystal clear when it held that the commissioner has jurisdiction to increase the compensation for a condition that the worker had when the original award was entered but, due to the neglect of the worker, was not called to the attention of the commissioner. <em>Fair </em>v. <em>Hartford Rubber Works Co., </em>95 Conn. 350, 356-57, 111 A. 193 (1920). The court in <em>Fair </em>held that the modification statute, General Statutes (1918 Rev.) \u00a7 5355 (now \u00a7 31-315), \u201cexpressly provides that [awards] shall be open to revision until completely performed . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Id., 356; <em>Besade </em>v. <em>Interstate Security Services, </em>212 Conn. 441, 445, 562 A.2d 1086 (1989) (\u201cany workers\u2019 compensation award, although a final judgment as to benefits through the date of the hearing, is always subject to further proceedings, such as those ordered in the present case, to determine whether the award should be modified\u201d); <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Arthur A. Fogarty, Inc., </em>157 Conn. 538, 546, 255 A.2d 627 (1969) (\u201c[i]ncreased incapacity of the plaintiff, a change in conditions, a mutual mistake in procuring the award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>pursuant to the stipulation ... all fall within the terms of . . . [\u00a7 31-315], and proof of any of them might call for a revision of the award by the commissioner\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). The commissioner is not precluded by any rule of public policy from modifying the award because \u201c [t]he rule of public policy applicable to such cases as this is to carry out the spirit of [the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fair </em>v. <em>Hartford Rubber Works Co., </em>supra, 357.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Section 31-315 must be liberally and broadly \u201cconstrued to effectuate the purpose of providing compensation for an injury arising out of and in the course of the employment regardless of fault.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 91, 97, 491 A.2d 368 (1985). Allowing an injured employee to receive prospectively increased compensation as a result of a court\u2019s clarification of the law that was in effect when the employee was injured is consistent with the beneficent purposes of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. This construction of \u00a7 31-315 also takes into account that many injured workers are not represented by counsel when they appear before the commissioner, but, rather, depend upon the commissioner to protect their rights with respect to those matters that are undisputed at the time of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Accordingly, I agree that <em>Szudora </em>should not be applied retroactively. I would not reach the issue of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>prospective application. Being pressed to do so as a result of the majority opinion, however, I would hold that a commissioner has jurisdiction to adjust prospectively a claimant\u2019s disability award as a result of the <em>Szudora </em>decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b39-9\"> Although the \u201ccommission[er] and the board both concluded that the plaintiffs 1983 claim was no longer pending when <em>Szudora </em>was decided and that it was . . . inappropriate to recalculate his benefits retroactively,\u201d their decision was not based on whether the claim was pending, as the majority implies. Both the commissioner and the board referred to the pendency of the claim only to indicate that if it was pending when <em>Szudora </em>was decided, the plaintiff would have been entitled to retroactive application of the rule. Rather, the commissioner\u2019s and the board\u2019s decision not to extend <em>Szudora </em>retroactively was predicated on the \u201csubstantial inequitable result\u201d prong of <em>Chevron Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Huson, </em>404 U.S. 97, 106-107, 92 S. Ct. 349, 30 L. Ed. 2d 296 (1971) (\u201cFirst, the decision to be applied nonretroac-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>tively must establish a new principle of law, either by overruling clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied ... or by deciding an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed .... Second, it has been stressed that [the court] must . . . weigh the merits and demerits in each case by looking to the prior history of the rule in question, its purpose and effect, and whether retrospective operation will further or retard its operation. . . . Finally, [the court must weigh] the inequity imposed by retroactive application, for [w]here a decision of this Court could produce <em>substantial inequitable results </em>if applied retroactively, there is ample basis in our cases for avoiding the injustice or hardship by a holding of nonretroactivity.\u201d [Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b40-9\"> The majority\u2019s claim in footnote 8 of its opinion that the amici argued that the commissioner lacked the statutory authority to modify the award on the basis of our decision in <em>Szudora, </em>either prospectively or retroactively, is simply wrong.
