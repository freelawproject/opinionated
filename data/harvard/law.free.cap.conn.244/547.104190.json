The trial court rendered judgment sentencing the defendant to a total effective sentence of 120 years imprisonment with no possibility of parole. The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to this court pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 51-199 (b) (3).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>appeal, the defendant claims that he is entitled to a new trial: (1) due to alleged misconduct by the state\u2019s attorney; and (2) because the trial court permitted the state to introduce into evidence a videotape of the crime scene and slide photographs of the deceased victims, the prejudicial effect of which, he maintains, outweighed their probative value. We reject these claims and, consequently, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The defendant\u2019s wife, Esmay Notice, owned a three story duplex located at 85 Crescent Street in Waterbury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At all times relevant to this appeal, two families occupied separate apartments in the duplex: (1) Clarence Winston, Sr., and Barbara Winston, their three children, Tiana, Clarence, Jr., and Tarley, and Tiana\u2019s two children, three year old Tiana and eighteen month old Jostin; and (2) Dwayne Wilson and Laurie Mercer, and their six children.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">In early 1993, Notice became upset with Wilson and Mercer because they were not making timely rental payments. Notice also was angry with the defendant because he had been collecting rent from the Winstons and not turning it over to Notice. Due to the difficulty that Notice was having in obtaining the rental payments, she was obliged to use her own savings to make the mortgage payments on the duplex. Unhappy with the situation, Notice resolved to have the duplex burned down in order to have it \u201cout of [her] way,\u201d and to collect the proceeds of the insurance policy on the property.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>In late April or early May, 1993, Notice sought the assistance of an acquaintance, Valerie Evans, in locating someone who would be willing to set fire to the duplex. In return for Evans\u2019 help, Notice promised Evans, who was unemployed, that she \u201cwould never [again] be out of work.\u201d Evans agreed to introduce Notice to Donnie Burton, who, Evans thought, might agree to set fire to the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Several days later, Evans introduced Notice to Burton. Notice explained to Burton that she was looking for someone to set fire to a house, and she offered Burton cash and crack cocaine if he would do it. When Burton asked whether the home was occupied, Notice responded that the tenants had been evicted. Notice also told Burton that the defendant would meet with Burton later that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">That evening, the defendant and Evans met with Burton. The defendant asked Burton whether he \u201cknew what was going on, if [Notice had] spoke [n] to [him] already.\u201d Burton responded affirmatively, and the defendant told Burton that he would be notified when it was time for him to \u201cdo the job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Soon thereafter, Notice telephoned Evans, gave Evans the address of the duplex, and informed Evans that she was \u201cready to have the [duplex] burned down.\u201d The next day, Notice and Evans again met with Burton. Notice told Burton that she wanted the duplex burned \u201cdown to the ground\u201d by the end of the month, and reassured him that she would make it worth his while. Burton, however, was noncommittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">A short time later, Burton, concerned that the duplex might be occupied, proceeded to the address provided to him by Notice. Observing lights on inside the duplex and a leashed dog and a parked car outside, Burton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>concluded that the building was occupied. For that reason, Burton decided not to be involved in the plan to bum down the duplex.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Upon learning of Burton\u2019s decision, the defendant told Notice that he would set fire to the building. In preparation for doing so, the defendant obtained two one-gallon plastic containers and filled them with gasoline. The defendant also secured a homemade timing device that had been constmcted from a \u201cJello\u201d gelatin box and a book of matches. The defendant explained to Notice that he intended to use the device, along with a lit cigarette, to ignite the gasoline, which he planned to use as an accelerant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Notice went to bed at approximately 10 p.m. on May 30, 1993. The defendant, who had been visiting a friend that evening, returned home between midnight and 1 a.m., awakened Notice, and informed her that he was going back out to bum down the duplex. Notice then went back to sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">The defendant returned shortly and informed Notice that he had poured gasoline on the front steps of the duplex and ignited it. Notice detected a slight odor of gasoline on the defendant, who showered and went to bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">At approximately 3 a.m. on May 31, Wilson and Mercer, awakened by their intercom buzzer, proceeded to the first floor of the duplex and observed the front porch ablaze. Wilson and Mercer escaped through a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>rear door of the building with their children. Upon learning of the fire, Clarence Winston, Jr., and Tarley Winston also managed to escape through a rear exit, and Tiana Winston, their sister, jumped to safety from a rear second floor porch. Clarence Winston, Sr., and Barbara Winston, who, along with their granddaughter Tiana, were observed on the roof of the front second floor porch, refused to jump and, instead, reentered the duplex.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">By the time members of the Waterbury fire department arrived, flames were visible in all of the windows of the duplex, and the intensity of the fire prevented the firefighters from entering the building. When they finally were able to gain entrance into the duplex, firefighters found the remains of Clarence Winston, Sr., Barbara Winston, and their two grandchildren, Tiana and Jostin.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">At approximately 6 a.m. on May 31, Notice received a telephone call from a former tenant notifying her of the fire. Notice awakened the defendant, and they went outside to Notice\u2019s car. The defendant removed the two plastic containers from the car and placed them in a toolshed next to the garage. He also retrieved the timing device from the car\u2019s flunk, but inadvertently dropped the device on his way to the toolshed. The defendant and Notice thereafter drove to the duplex, informed the Waterbury police that they were the building\u2019s landlords and, at the request of the police, voluntarily proceeded to the police station, where they were questioned separately. Notice provided the police with a sworn statement implicating the defendant in the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Later that morning, Waterbury police officers, accompanied by Notice, executed a search warrant at the home where she and the defendant resided. The police seized numerous articles of clothing and other items of personal property from the residence. The police also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>retrieved the two plastic containers from the toolshed, along with the homemade timing device that the defendant accidentally had left in his yard earlier that morning. Tests conducted by the state forensic laboratory detected the presence of gasoline in the two plastic containers and on a pair of men\u2019s black slacks seized from the defendant\u2019s residence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The police also obtained a search warrant for Notice\u2019s car. Upon executing the warrant, the police detected a heavy odor of gasoline inside the vehicle. In addition, the floor mat and a piece of carpet retrieved from the front passenger side of the car tested positive for gasoline. Finally, the state tested wood samples taken from the front steps and porch of the duplex. These tests also revealed the presence of gasoline.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">On the basis of his review of the fire scene and the evidence collected by the police, Waterbury fire marshal Anthony Zappone concluded that the fire had been set deliberately, and that it had spread from the front porch of the duplex, where an accelerant had been used, to the rear of the building. Autopsies performed on the four victims revealed that they had died of smoke inhalation.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Both Notice and the defendant were arrested and charged in connection with the arson. Prior to trial, Notice pleaded guilty to one count of aiding and abetting first degree arson in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-8<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and 53a-lll (a) (1), and to one count of conspiracy to commit first degree arson in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 (a) and 53a-lll (a) (1). After the conclusion of the defendant\u2019s trial, Notice, who had been the state\u2019s key witness against the defendant, was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of twenty-five years for her involvement in the arson.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The defendant raises four claims of prosecutorial misconduct, each of which, he contends, deprived him of a fair trial in violation of his due process rights under the state and federal constitutions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant asserts that the state\u2019s attorney improperly: (1) failed to disclose the full extent of the promise made by the state to Notice in return for her agreement to cooperate against the defendant; (2) vouched for Notice\u2019s credibility; (3) referred to evidence that previously had been ruled inadmissible; and (4) commented on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. To the extent that the defendant did not preserve these claims properly at trial, he seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Alternatively, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>defendant seeks a new trial under the plain error doctrine; see Practice Book \u00a7 4061, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 60-5; or in the exercise of our supervisory authority over the administration of justice.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we reject each of the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The defendant first maintains that the state\u2019s attorney misrepresented the true nature of Notice\u2019s plea bargain with the state by failing to reveal that the state had promised to reduce the charges against Notice in return for her agreement to cooperate against the defendant. We conclude that the record is inadequate for our review of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. On June 1, 1993, the state filed an information charging Notice with conspiracy to commit first degree arson. On July 8, 1993, the state filed a substitute information charging Notice with four counts of arson murder, one count of first degree arson, and one count of conspiracy to commit first degree arson. On August 20, 1993, the state filed a second substitute information charging Notice with four counts of aiding and abetting arson murder, one count of first degree arson, and one count of conspiracy to commit first degree arson. Finally, on July 23, 1995, the state filed a third substitute information charging Notice with one count of aiding and abetting arson in the first degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>and one count of conspiracy to commit arson in the first degree. On August 10, 1995, Notice pleaded guilty to the arson and conspiracy charges contained in the third substitute information. Jury selection in the defendant\u2019s case commenced on January 31, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Testifying for the state against the defendant, Notice acknowledged that she had pleaded guilty to one count of aiding and abetting first degree arson and to one count of conspiracy to commit first degree arson. Notice further indicated that the state\u2019s attorney, in exchange for her agreement to testify against the defendant, had assured Notice that the state would inform the sentencing judge of her cooperation. Notice also expressed her understanding that, under the terms of her plea agreement with the state, she faced a term of imprisonment of between twenty-five and forty years. In addition, Notice recalled with some difficulty that, at one time, she had been charged with aiding and abetting arson murder, although she testified that she was not aware of the penalty for that offense. Notice also testified that she did not remember whether any charges had been dismissed as a result of her guilty plea and cooperation, nor did she know whether the charges against her for aiding and abetting arson murder had been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The defendant also sought to introduce into evidence the original information and the three substitute infor-mations that the state had filed against Notice, along with a redacted transcript of the hearing at which Notice had pleaded guilty.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The defendant claimed that this evidence was relevant because it tended to establish that Notice had agreed to cooperate with the state in return for the state\u2019s promise to dismiss the four counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>of aiding and abetting arson murder, each_ of which carried a possible maximum penalty of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, and to allow her to plead guilty to one count of aiding and abetting first degree arson and one count of conspiracy to commit first degree arson, each of which is punishable by a prison term of not less than ten years nor more than twenty-five years.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-35a. The state\u2019s attorney objected to the defendant\u2019s proffer, expressly denying that he had agreed to dismiss the aiding and abetting arson murder charges in exchange for Notice\u2019s cooperation. He represented, instead, that Notice had been allowed to plead guilty to the lesser offenses set forth in the third substitute information due to difficulties that the state would have had in proving the more serious arson murder charges.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The trial court, however, overruled the state\u2019s objection, and the original information, the three substitute infor-mations, and the redacted transcript of Notice\u2019s guilty plea all were introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The defendant also presented the testimony of Walter Scanlon, a retired former criminal defense attorney and assistant state\u2019s attorney, who explained that a prosecutor retains discretion with respect to which charge or charges to file against a defendant. Scanlon confirmed that arson murder carries a maximum term of imprisonment of life without the possibility of parole. On cross-examination by the state\u2019s attorney, Scanlon testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>that substitute informations are filed in many, \u201cmaybe even most,\u201d cases, and for a variety of reasons. Scanlon indicated that, among other reasons, a prosecutor may file a substitute information deleting a particular charge or charges when it has been determined, after further investigation by the state, that the original charge or charges are not legally or factually supportable.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The state\u2019s attorney, in his closing argument to the jury, reminded the jurors of Scanlon\u2019s testimony concerning the multitude of factors that may motivate a prosecutor to file a substitute information, and suggested that Notice\u2019s confusion over the charges that originally had been filed against her most likely was attributable to language difficulties. Defense counsel, in his closing argument, countered by questioning Notice\u2019s motivation for testifying. In particular, he suggested that Notice had agreed to testify against the defendant because the state had agreed to dismiss the four counts of aiding and abetting arson murder.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In his rebuttal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>argument, the state\u2019s attorney again indicated that the state\u2019s decision to dismiss those counts had not been part of any \u201cdeal\u201d between the state and Notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">On appeal, the defendant contends that the state, notwithstanding the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s representations to the contrary, had entered into an improper secret deal with Notice pursuant to which the state\u2019s attorney had agreed to reduce the charges against Notice in exchange for her cooperation against the defendant. The defendant further claims that, in light of the alleged secret agreement, the state\u2019s attorney improperly: (1) failed to contradict Notice\u2019s testimony concerning the terms of her plea agreement; and (2) argued to the jury that the evidence failed to establish that the aiding and abetting arson murder charges were dismissed as part of Notice\u2019s plea agreement with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">\u201cThe defendant asserts that [this] scenario results in constitutional error under <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 92 S. Ct. 763, 31 L. Ed. 2d 104 (1972), and <em>Napue </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>360 U.S. 264, 79 S. Ct. 1173, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1217 (1959), since the knowing presentation of false evidence by the state is incompatible with the rudimentary demands of justice. <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 153 .... Furthermore, due process is similarly offended if the state, although not soliciting false evidence, allows it to go uncorrected when it appears. <em>Napue </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 269. If a government witness falsely denies having struck a bargain with the state, or substantially mischaracterizes the nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>inducement, the state is obliged to correct the misconception. <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra [153]; <em>Napue </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 269-70. Regardless of the lack of intent to lie on the part of the witness, <em>Giglio </em>and <em>Napue </em>require that the prosecutor apprise the court when he knows that his witness is giving testimony that is substantially misleading. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>498 F.2d 1164, 1169 (3d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Young </em>v. <em>United States, </em>419 U.S. 1069, 95 S. Ct. 655, 42 L. Ed. 2d 665 (1974). A new trial is required if the false testimony could ... in any reasonable likelihood have affected the judgment of the jury. <em>Napue </em>[v. <em>Illinois], </em>supra, 271. <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 154; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 678-80, 105 S. Ct. 3375, 87 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1985).\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>213 Conn. 388, 399-400, 567 A.2d 1221 (1990); see <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Scully, </em>826 F.2d 1192, 1195-96 (2d Cir. 1987); <em>DuBose </em>v. <em>Lefevre, </em>619 F.2d 973, 978 (2d Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The defendant, however, has failed to establish the necessary factual predicate to his claim, namely, that the state\u2019s attorney did, in fact, promise to dismiss the aiding and abetting arson murder charges against Notice as part of the plea agreement between Notice and the state. Cf. <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 405 U.S. 153 (prosecutor who had promised witness he would not be prosecuted if he testified improperly failed to correct witness\u2019 contradictory trial testimony and, during closing argument, improperly denied that any promises had been made to witness); <em>Napue </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 360 U.S. 270-71 (prosecutor who had promised witness he would recommend sentence reduction as consideration for agreement to testify improperly failed to correct witness\u2019 contradictory trial testimony). Although the defendant presented evidence from which <em>the jury </em>might have inferred the existence of the alleged secret promise, the defendant, for reasons of strategy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>or otherwise, never sought a determination by the <em>court </em>regarding the existence of such a promise.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Because it is the function of the trial court, not this court, to resolve disputed factual issues; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>234 Conn. 735, 750, 663 A.2d 948 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>199 Conn. 399, 415, 508 A.2d 1 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lafferty, </em>189 Conn. 360, 363, 456 A.2d 272 (1983); the defendant was required to seek a determination by the trial court of his fact-based claim of an undisclosed agreement between Notice and the state. Since the defendant never did so, the record contains no findings to support his assertion. The record, therefore, is inadequate for our review of the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The defendant nevertheless contends that the only inference plausibly to be drawn from the record is that the state agreed to dismiss the aiding and abetting arson murder charges against Notice in exchange for her testimony. In particular, the defendant challenges as unfounded the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s assertion that he had dismissed those charges because the state would have had difficulty in proving them. The defendant claims that, because the crime of aiding and abetting arson murder contains only one element that is not also an element of the crime of first degree arson, namely, that a death resulted from the arson, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s reason for dismissing the aiding and abetting arson murder charges must be viewed as pretextual.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>Although we agree with the defendant\u2019s analysis of the elements of the crimes of arson murder and first degree arson, we will not lightly presume that the state\u2019s attorney misrepresented the true nature of the state\u2019s agreement with Notice. In view of the inadequacy of the record, we are unable to determine precisely what facts or circumstances, wholly apart from any agreement with Notice, may have prompted the state\u2019s attorney to dismiss the four charges of aiding and abetting arson murder against Notice. Nor will we speculate as to what factors the state\u2019s attorney legitimately may have considered in reaching his decision to dismiss those charges. We therefore reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the record compels a conclusion that the state\u2019s attorney secretly promised Notice that he would reduce the charges against her in return for her cooperation against the defendant.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">The defendant next claims that the state\u2019s attorney improperly vouched for Notice\u2019s credibility on two separate occasions during his rebuttal closing argument, thereby entitling the defendant to a new trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">The following additional facts are necessary to our resolution of this claim. At the beginning of his rebuttal closing argument, the state\u2019s attorney, in addressing the defendant\u2019s argument that Notice had received favorable treatment from the state in return for her cooperation against the defendant, made reference to \u201c[t]his big conspiracy, I guess, between me and Esmay Notice.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>The trial court sustained the defendant\u2019s objection to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s comment, but the defendant did not seek a curative instruction. Later, toward the end of his rebuttal argument, the state\u2019s attorney stated: \u201c[Defense counsel] wants you to believe that I made a deal with the murderers \u2014 with the murderer of Clarence Winston [Sr.], Barbara Winston, Jostin Winston and Tiana Winston. He wants you to believe that I made a deal with the murderer of Clarence, Tarley and Tiana\u2019s parents. He wants you to think that I made a deal with the murderer of Tiana and Jostin Winston. He wants you to believe that I made a deal with the murderer of those people\u2019s parents and that woman\u2019s children. No way. No way.\u201d Defense counsel failed to object to these remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">\u201cWe have previously acknowledged that prosecu-torial misconduct can occur in the course of closing argument.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>235 Conn. 748, 768-69, 670 A.2d 276 (1996). Furthermore, it is improper for a prosecutor to express his or her own opinion, either directly or indirectly, as to the credibility of witnesses. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>221 Conn. 264, 289, 604 A.2d 793 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 541, 529 A.2d 653 (1987). It is well settled, however, that a defendant may not prevail under <em>Golding </em>or the plain error doctrine unless the prosecutorial impropriety was so pervasive or egregious as to constitute an infringement of the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, nor will we invoke our supervisory authority to reverse an otherwise lawful criminal conviction absent a showing that the conduct of the prosecutor was so offensive to the judicial process that a new trial is necessary to deter such misconduct in the future. See footnotes 12 and 13 of this opinion. Finally, we must review the challenged comments in the context of the entire trial, with due regard to the extent to which the objectionable remarks were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>invited by defense conduct or argument. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>231 Conn. 235, 246-47, 645 A.2d 999 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>214 Conn. 752, 759-60, 574 A.2d 182 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">With respect to the defendant\u2019s first claim of impropriety, the trial court properly sustained the defendant\u2019s objection to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s use of the term \u201cconspiracy,\u201d which was uttered only once and not repeated. In such circumstances, we are not persuaded that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s characterization of the defendant\u2019s claim so tainted the proceedings as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. Nor was the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s isolated use of the word \u201cconspiracy\u201d so inflammatory or offensive as to warrant reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction in the exercise of our supervisory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">We reach the same conclusion with respect to the defendant\u2019s second and related claim of prosecutorial misconduct, namely, that the state\u2019s attorney impermis-sibly vouched for Notice\u2019s credibility by personally denying that he had entered into a secret agreement with Notice. The state\u2019s attorney\u2019s argument denying that he secretly had promised to reduce the charges against Notice was made in response to the defendant\u2019s suggestion that the state\u2019s attorney had, in fact, entered into such an agreement. Moreover, the defendant\u2019s failure to object to the argument at the time it was made lends support to the state\u2019s contention that the remarks may be considered a fair response to the defendant\u2019s claim of a secret agreement between Notice and the state. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>227 Conn. 711, 746, 631 A.2d 288 (1993) (defendant\u2019s failure to object to prosecutor\u2019s closing argument indicated that defendant did not regard argument as seriously prejudicial). Although the state\u2019s attorney, having chosen to respond to the defendant\u2019s claim, should have done so by reference to the evidence, or lack thereof, and not via a first person denial of the existence of a secret agreement; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>see, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Modica, </em>663 F.2d 1173, 1181 (2d Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 989, 102 S. Ct. 2269, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1284 (1982) (\u201c[a] prosecutor should exercise restraint to avoid needless personal references, without sacrificing the vigor or effectiveness of his argument\u201d); we are not persuaded that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s brief comments, when viewed in the context in which they were uttered, were unduly prejudicial to the defendant. Accordingly, we reject the defendant\u2019s contention that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s remarks warrant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The defendant next claims that he is entitled to a new trial because the state\u2019s attorney, in his rebuttal closing argument, improperly referred to evidence that the trial court previously had ruled inadmissible. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to our disposition of this claim. During his case-in-chief, the defendant, over the state\u2019s objection, introduced into evidence a redacted transcript of the hearing on Notice\u2019s guilty plea for the puipose of establishing the terms and conditions of Notice\u2019s plea agreement with the state.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The state\u2019s attorney objected to the admission of the redacted plea transcript on relevancy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>grounds. The state\u2019s attorney further argued that if the trial court were to overrule his objection to the transcript, then an unredacted transcript of the entire plea proceeding should be introduced into evidence. The trial court overruled the state\u2019s objection and allowed the defendant to introduce the redacted transcript into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">During his rebuttal closing argument, the state\u2019s attorney made the following statement: \u201cYou know, [defense counsel] said \u2018well, read the transcript, read the transcript [of Notice\u2019s guilty plea proceeding].\u2019 I wish you could read the transcript. But you\u2019re not going to read what happened on August 10 when that plea was taken because [defense counsel] edited nine pages of that transcript. It was nine or eight or seven whatever, nine pages of that transcript he wants to give you. That doesn\u2019t have in there what I said.\u201d The trial court sustained the defendant\u2019s objection to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s remarks and issued an immediate curative instruction.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The state\u2019s attorney then stated as follows: \u201cI apologize. The last thing I meant to do or attempted to do was say [that defense counsel] did anything wrong. The point I was trying to make is that is an edited transcript. You heard when I cross-examined the court reporter regarding the contents of that transcript. The state\u2019s case has no excerpts, no evidence left out. That\u2019s right. There\u2019s one hundred . . . something pieces of evidence in [this case]. We didn\u2019t edit anything. We [gave] you all the witnesses who could give you any information about this case.\u201d The defendant did not object to the remarks made by the state\u2019s attorney in connection with his apology.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>The defendant claims that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s comments regarding the redacted transcript improperly suggested that the defendant had withheld important evidence from the jury. The defendant also maintains that the state\u2019s attorney implicitly vouched for Notice\u2019s credibility by implying that the redacted transcript pages would have supported her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">\u201cIt is well established that [a] prosecutor is not an ordinary advocate. His [or her] duty is to see that justice is done and to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce prejudice and wrongful decisions by the jury. . . . [B]y reason of his [or her] office, [a prosecutor] usually exercises great influence upon jurors. His [or her] conduct and language in the trial of cases in which human fife or liberty are at stake should be forceful, but fair, because [a prosecutor] represents the public interest, which demands no victim and asks no conviction through the aid of passion, prejudice, or resentment. ...\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pouncey, </em>241 Conn. 802, 810-11, 699 A.2d 901 (1997). Thus, \u201cthe privilege of counsel in addressing the jury . . . must never be used as a license to state, or to comment upon, or even to suggest an inference from, facts not in evidence, or to present matters which the jury have no right to consider.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 811; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>235 Conn. 274, 320, 664 A.2d 743 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">We agree with the defendant that the challenged references to the redacted transcript pages were inappropriate. Moreover, the impropriety arguably was exacerbated when, in connection with his apology for his remarks, the state\u2019s attorney noted that the state, in contrast to the defendant, had provided the jury with all of the evidence relevant to its case. Having failed to persuade the trial court that the redacted portion of the transcript also should have been introduced into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>evidence, the state was not free to suggest that the redacted transcript pages contained information that was relevant to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The defendant, however, promptly objected to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s remarks, and the trial court immediately instructed the jury to disregard them. The defendant made no claim at trial, and he makes no claim on appeal, that the cautionary instruction given to the jury was incomplete or otherwise defective. \u201c[W]e have previously recognized that a prompt cautionary instruction to the jury regarding improper prosecutorial remarks or questions can obviate any possible harm to the defendant.\u201d St<em>ate </em>v. <em>Cruz, 212 </em>Conn. 351, 365, 562 A.2d 1071 (1989); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>190 Conn. 559, 563,462 A.2d 1001, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 916, 104 S. Ct. 280, 78 L. Ed. 2d 259 (1983). Moreover, the state\u2019s attorney promptly apologized for his comments, which apparently were not of sufficient concern to the defendant to cause him to seek a mistrial. Finally, the brief reference to the edited transcript made by the state\u2019s attorney in connection with his apology was not sufficiently provocative to prompt either an objection from the defendant or any further comment by the trial court. Under all of the circumstances, therefore, we are satisfied that the challenged remarks did not adversely affect the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. Furthermore, the defendant has failed to establish that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s comments were so offensive to the judicial process as to require reversal of the defendant\u2019s convictions, nor has he demonstrated that the remarks were part of a pattern of prosecutorial misconduct for which a new trial is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">Finally, the defendant claims that the state\u2019s attorney, during his rebuttal closing argument, improperly commented on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. We reject this claim also.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>The following additional facts are relevant to our consideration of this issue. As discussed in part I C of this opinion, the state\u2019s attorney, in connection with his apology for suggesting that the defendant improperly had redacted the transcript of Notice\u2019s plea proceedings, stated, \u201cWe didn\u2019t edit anything. We [gave] you all the witnesses who could give you any information about this case.\u201d Shortly thereafter, the state\u2019s attorney, in seeking to underscore the state\u2019s difficulty in producing eyewitnesses to the crime of arson, stated as follows: \u201cArsons aren\u2019t committed at twelve o\u2019clock in the afternoon on the green in Waterbury. Arsons are committed at three o\u2019clock in the morning with helpless people who are sleeping. That\u2019s the kind of crime arson is. Arson is the crime of a coward. I can\u2019t tell you \u2014 I can\u2019t bring [Joanne] Slavin<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> here and say she saw [the defendant] run away because she was in her bed sleeping. I can\u2019t bring [Joseph] Daly<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> in. I can\u2019t bring the Winstons in. <em>I gave you everything I had. I didn\u2019t excerpt anything.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Although the defendant failed to object to any of these statements, he now claims that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s argument improperly focused the jury\u2019s attention on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify in violation of his rights under the fifth amendment to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">We recently have reiterated the legal principles relevant to our review of such a claim. \u201cIt is well settled that comment by the prosecuting attorney ... on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify is prohibited by the fifth amendment to the United States constitution. <em>Griffin </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>v. <em>California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 615, 85 S. Ct. 1229, 14 L. Ed. 2d 106, reh. denied, 381 U.S. 957, 85 S. Ct. 1797, 14 L. Ed. 2d 730 (1965). . . . Our legislature has given statutory recognition to this right by virtue of its enactment of General Statutes \u00a7 54-84.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In determining whether a prosecutor\u2019s comments have encroached upon a defendant\u2019s right to remain silent, we ask: Was the language used manifestly intended to be, or was it of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify? . . . Further, in applying this test, we must look to the context in which the statement was made in order to determine the manifest intention which prompted it and its natural and necessary impact upon the jury. . . . Finally, [w]e also recognize that the limits of legitimate argument and fair comment cannot be determined precisely by rule and line, and something must be allowed for the zeal of counsel in the heat of argument.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Haase, </em>243 Conn. 324, 332-33, 702 A.2d 1187 (1997). With these principles in mind, we turn to the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">We conclude that the first challenged comment, namely, \u201cWe didn\u2019t edit anything. We [gave] you all the witnesses who could give you any information about this case,\u201d did not implicate the defendant\u2019s right to refrain from testifying, but, rather, represented an attempt by the state\u2019s attorney to draw a distinction between the state\u2019s evidence, on the one hand, and the redacted transcript of Notice\u2019s guilty plea, on the other. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Although the comment improperly highlighted the fact that several pages of the transcript had been withheld from the jury; see part I C of this opinion; it is clear that the remark served only to underscore that fact, and not the defendant\u2019s failure to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">We also conclude that the statements \u201cI gave you everything I had. I didn\u2019t excerpt anything\u201d reasonably cannot be construed as a comment on the defendant\u2019s silence. Those remarks immediately followed the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s observation that, as in most cases of arson, the fire in this case had been set at night, a point made by the state\u2019s attorney to explain why the state had been unable to produce an eyewitness to the crime. Viewed in the context in which it was spoken, the statement \u201cI gave you everything I had\u201d served to emphasize that fact, and nothing more. Moreover, although the assertion \u201cI didn\u2019t excerpt anything\u201d may be construed as an oblique reference to the fact that the defendant had submitted an excerpted transcript of Notice\u2019s guilty plea, the statement reasonably cannot be construed as one that the jury \u201cnaturally and necessarily\u201d would have interpreted as a comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. Finally, because the defendant made no objection to the statements at trial, we may presume that he did not consider the comments to be seriously prejudicial at the time they were made. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 746. We therefore reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s argument encroached upon the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to refrain from testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly allowed the state to introduce into evidence a videotape of the fire and six slide photographs of the deceased victims. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claims. The state sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>to introduce into evidence a fifteen minute videotape of the fire that had been taken by neighbors of the victims. The state claimed that, because the videotape tended to establish the cause of the fire and its place of origin, it was relevant to demonstrate that the fire had been set intentionally. In addition, the state offered the videotape to show the structure of the duplex.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The defendant did not object to having the jury view the first two to three minutes of the videotape. He did object, however, to any further showing of the videotape on the ground that it was not necessary to show more than the first several minutes of the film in order to establish the facts for which it had been offered and, further, that allowing the jury to view the entire videotape was likely to incite the jury\u2019s passions. After viewing the videotape, the trial court concluded that it was relevant<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and that it contained nothing that was likely to inflame the emotions of the jury.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Consequently, the trial court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection, and the videotape was played in its entirety for the jury, accompanied by a narrative description of the events by Anthony Ramonas, a former member of the Waterbury fire department.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">The state also sought to introduce into evidence twenty-two color photographs that had been converted to slides of the deceased victims. Twelve of the photographs had been taken at the medical examiner\u2019s office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>and ten had been taken at the scene of the fire. In support of its claim of admissibility, the state argued that the photographs tended to establish that: (1) the fire had progressed from the front to the rear of the duplex; (2) the person who had set the fire intended to destroy the building; and (3) the building was inhabited. The defendant objected to the introduction of the photographs, claiming that their graphic nature was likely to inflame the emotions of the jury. The defendant also claimed that the state did not need the photographs in light of other evidence introduced by the state that tended to prove the elements of the crime of arson murder. The trial court upheld the defendant\u2019s objection as to sixteen of the photographs, concluding that their prejudicial impact outweighed their probative value. The court, however, overruled the defendant\u2019s objection to the remaining six photographs, each of which had been taken at the scene of the arson, after determining that they were not unduly inflammatory and that their probative value outweighed their prejudicial effect.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Before addressing the merits of the defendant\u2019s claims, we first set forth the well established principles that govern our analysis of those claims. \u201cThis court has consistently held that photographic evidence is admissible where the photograph has a reasonable tendency to prove or disprove a material fact in issue or shed some light upon some material inquiry. . . . [Moreover] [t]here is no requirement . . . that a potentially inflammatory photograph be essential to the state\u2019s case in order for it to be admissible; rather, the test for determining the admissibility of the challenged evidence is relevancy and not necessity.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Deleon, </em>230 Conn. 351, 368-69, 645 A.2d 518 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>227 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Conn. 101, 111, 629 A.2d 402 (1993). Thus, although irrelevant evidence of a gruesome character is inadmissible, \u201c[t]he prosecution, with its burden of establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, is not to be denied the right to prove every essential element of the crime by the most convincing evidence it is able to produce.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 111-12; <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>194 Conn. 376, 385, 481 A.2d 1277 (1984). Accordingly, \u201c \u2018[a] potentially inflammatory photograph may be admitted if the court, in its discretion, determines that the probative value of the photograph outweighs the prejudicial effect it might have on the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Deleon, </em>supra, 369; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 277, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1165, 115 S. Ct. 1133, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1095 (1995) (even gruesome photographs maybe admissible if they tend to prove or disprove material fact in issue). Furthermore, \u201ca trial court has broad discretion in weighing the potential prejudicial effect of a photograph against its probative value. . . . On appeal, we may not disturb . . . [the trial court\u2019s] finding absent a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Doehrer, </em>200 Conn. 642, 651, 513 A.2d 58 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Upon application of these principles, we conclude, after reviewing the videotape, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the state to play the entire videotape for the jury. As the trial court stated, the videotape, along with other evidence presented by the state, tended to establish the cause and severity of the fire. Although it may not have been essential to the state\u2019s case that the jury be shown the entire videotape, the criterion for its admissibility was relevancy, not absolute necessity. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Deleon, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 369. Moreover, in light of the fact that the videotape contained no images of any of the victims or other occupants of the duplex, the trial court reasonably determined that the film contained nothing prejudicial to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>We reach the same conclusion with respect to the photographic evidence. First, we note that the trial court carefully scrutinized each photograph, bearing in mind that the state bore the burden of proving that the four victims had died in and as a result of the fire, and rejected all but six of the twenty-two photographs that the state had sought to introduce into evidence.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In contrast to the graphic photographs that the trial court rejected, five of the six photographs that the court allowed into evidence depicted bodies that were barely discernible amidst the debris of the fire. Although the sixth photograph depicted the body of three year old Tiana Winston with some greater clarity than did the photographs of the other victims, the trial court reasonably determined that none of the six photographs was particularly graphic or gruesome.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Because, \u201c[i]n general, photographs of a corpse have been held properly admissible in prosecutions for homicide as against objections on the ground of prejudicial gruesomeness ... or on the ground that they constituted merely cumulative evidence\u201d; (citation omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hanna, </em>150 Conn. 457, 461, 191 A.2d 124 (1963); and in accordance with the principle that the trial court is afforded broad leeway in determining whether the probative value of such evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the state to introduce the six photographs into evidence.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">In this opinion BORDEN, MCDONALD and PETERS, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b569-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54d provides: \u201cArson murder.

In discharging his most important duties, he deserves and receives in peculiar degree the support of the court and the respect of the citizens of the county. By reason of his office, he usually exercises great influence upon jurors. His conduct and language in the trial of cases in which human life or liberty are at stake should be forceful, but fair, because he represents the public interest, which demands no victim and asks no conviction through the aid of passion, prejudice, or resentment. If the accused be guilty, he should nonetheless be convicted only after a fair trial, conducted strictly according to the sound and well-established rules which the laws prescribe. While the privilege of counsel in addressing the jury should not be too closely narrowed or unduly hampered, it must never be used as a license to state, or to comment upon, or to suggest an inference from, facts not in evidence, or to present matters which the jury have no right to consider.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrone, </em>96 Conn. 160, 168-69, 113 A. 452 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>The defendant in the present case claims that the prosecutorial misconduct dining the state\u2019s closing argument to the jury was so egregious that it deprived him of his constitutional right to a fair trial under the due process clause of both the state and federal constitutions. In analyzing the defendant\u2019s claim, the issue is whether the prosecutor\u2019s conduct \u201c \u2018so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Darden </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 168, 181, 106 S.

We do not focus alone, however, on the conduct of the prosecutor. \u201c \u2018The fairness of the trial and not the culpability of the prosecutor is the standard for analyzing the constitutional due process claims of criminal defendants alleging prosecutorial misconduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>196 Conn. 157, 163, 491 A.2d 1075 (1985), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>190 Conn. 559, 562, 462 A.2d 1001, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 916, 104 S.

Included among those factors are the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument; <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcone, </em>191 Conn. 12, 23, 463 A.2d 558 (1983); the severity of the misconduct; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Modica, </em>663 F.2d 1173, 1181 (2d Cir. 1981) [cert. denied, 456 U.S. 989, 102 S.

The prosecutor may not express his own opinion, directly or indirectly, as to the credibility of the witnesses. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Modica, </em>supra, 663 F.2d 1179; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Drummond, </em>481 F.2d 62 (2d Cir. 1973); 1 A.B.A., Standards for Criminal Justice (2d Ed. 1980) c. 3, standard 3-5.8 (b), p. 3.87. Nor should a prosecutor express his opinion, directly or indirectly, as to the guilt of the defendant. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 402 U.S. 658; 1 A.B.A., supra, standard 3-5.8 (b), p. 3.87. Such expressions of personal opinion are a form of unsworn and unchecked testimony, and are particularly difficult for the jury to ignore because of the prosecutor\u2019s special position. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrone, </em>supra, 96 Conn. 168-69. Moreover, because the jury is aware that the prosecutor has prepared and presented the case and consequently, may have access to matters not in evidence; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Modica, </em>supra, 1178-79; it is likely to infer that such matters precipitated the personal opinions. Finally, in fulfilling his duties, the prosecutor must confine the arguments to the evidence in the record. <em>State </em>v. <em>Binet, </em>192 Conn. 618, 631, 473 A.2d 1200 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrone, </em>supra, 169. Statements as to facts that have not been proven amount to unsworn testimony that is not the subject of proper closing argument. 1 A.B.A., supra, standard 3-5.8 (a), p. 3.87.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Nevertheless, during closing argument the state\u2019s attorney in this case impermissibly vouched for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>credibility of the prosecution witness, Esmay Notice, by personally denying that he had entered into a secret agreement with her. In response to the defendant\u2019s argument that the jury reasonably could infer that the state had struck a deal with Notice to dismiss the aiding and abetting arson murder charges against her in exchange for her testimony, the state\u2019s attorney first referred to the claim as \u201c[t]his big conspiracy I guess between me and Esmay Notice\u201d and then denied the existence of a plea bargain, thereby testifying without affording the defendant the benefit of cross-examination. \u201c[Defense counsel] wants you to believe that I made a deal with the murderers \u2014 with the murderer of Clarence Winston, Barbara Winston, Jostin Winston and Tiana Winston. He wants you to believe that I made a deal with the murderer of Clarence, Tarley and Tiana\u2019s parents. He wants you to think that I made a deal with the murderer of Tiana and Jostin Winston. He wants you to believe that I made a deal with the murderer of those people\u2019s parents and that woman\u2019s children. No way. No way.\u201d This response constituted a form of unsworn and unchecked testimony. The state\u2019s attorney, in effect, impermissibly testified without affording the defendant the opportunity to cross-examine him regarding the absence of a plea agreement, expressed his personal opinion that Notice was a credible witness for the prosecution, and suggested to the jury that to acquit the defendant, it must first \u201cabandon confidence in the integrity of the government.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Goff, </em>847 F.2d 149, 164 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 932, 109 S. Ct. 324, 102 L. Ed. 2d 341 (1988). This \u201cimplied \u2018voucher\u2019 for [Notice\u2019s] credibility invited the jury to view its verdict as a vindication of the prosecutor\u2019s integrity rather than as an assessment of guilt or innocence based upon the evidence presented at trial.\u201d <em>Floyd </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>907 F.2d 347, 354 (2d Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">A few moments later, the state\u2019s attorney referred to certain evidence that the trial court previously had ruled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>inadmissible and then in his so-called apology exacerbated the problem. The state\u2019s attorney argued to the jury as follows: \u201cYou know, [defense counsel] said \u2018well, read the transcript, read the transcript [of Notice\u2019s guilty pleas].\u2019 I wish you could read the transcript. But you\u2019re not going to read what happened on August 10 when that plea was taken because [defense counsel] edited nine pages of that transcript. It was nine or eight or seven or whatever, nine pages of that transcript he wants to give you. That doesn\u2019t have in there what I said.\u201d Following the defendant\u2019s objection, which the court sustained, the state\u2019s attorney \u201capologized.\u201d \u201cThe last thing I meant to do or attempted to do was say [defense counsel] did anything wrong. The point I was trying to make is that is an edited transcript. You heard when I cross-examined the court reporter regarding the contents of that transcript. The state\u2019s case has no excerpts, no evidence left out. That\u2019s right. There\u2019s one hundred \u2014 [defense counsel] read you the thing. It\u2019s one hundred something pieces of evidence in. We didn\u2019t edit anything. We give you all the witnesses who could give you any information about this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">These remarks improperly referred to evidence that had been excluded by the court. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vaglica, </em>720 F.2d 388, 395 (5th Cir. 1983) (improper to \u201csuggest to the jury that inadmissible evidence exists that bears against the defendant\u2019s case\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Narciso, </em>446 F. Sup. 252, 321-22 (E.D. Mich. 1977) (prosecutor\u2019s complaint to jury that \u201c \u2018 [t]he Government hasn\u2019t even been allowed to present [certain] evidence\u2019 . . . implied strongly that evidence of the defendants\u2019 guilt existed which was not presented\u201d); <em>People </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>97 Ill. 487, 497, 455 N.E.2d 41 (1983) (improper \u201cto suggest that evidence of guilt existed which, because of defendant\u2019s objection, cannot be brought before the jury\u201d); 88 C.J.S. 354-55 and nn. 56-58, Trial \u00a7 181 (a) (1955) (\u201cimproper for counsel to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>argue or comment on excluded evidence, or to express regret that the court should have excluded certain evidence from the jury, or state that the excluded evidence was admissible\u201d). Additionally, these remarks improperly criticized defense counsel for making objections that prevented admission of the redacted portions of the transcript; J. Stein, Closing Arguments (1996) \u00a7 16, p. 52 andn.2; and improperly vouched for Notice\u2019s credibility by \u201cindicat[ing] that information not presented to the jury supported] [her] testimony.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>618 F.2d 530, 533 (9th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Despite the impropriety of these remarks, the defense counsel objected only once, apparently not finding the other comments sufficiently provocative or harmful. When the objection was made to the remarks on the excluded evidence, the trial court provided curative instructions, which were sufficient to obviate the harm caused by <em>those </em>comments. Although the other remarks deserved responses by defense counsel and the trial court; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 402 F.2d 657 n.1; I nonetheless agree with the majority that, in the context of the entire trial, the conduct was not so frequent or its impact so offensive to the judicial process as to require reversal of the defendant\u2019s convictions, nor were the remarks part of a pattern of prosecutorial misconduct requiring a new trial. Contra <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 539-48. The fact that the error does not rise to the level of impropriety required to reverse a criminal conviction should not serve, however, as a sign that such patently impermissible behavior is to be tolerated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
