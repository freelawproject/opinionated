The plaintiff alleged that, upon information and belief, the application consisted of a neglect petition with accompanying affidavits. On the basis of these documents, the court granted the temporary custody order, scheduled a \u201cten day hearing\u201d on the continued need for temporary emergency care, as required by \u00a7 46b-129 (b), for August 21, 1995, and caused a notice of that hearing to be served on the plaintiff. Following her receipt of the notice of the hearing, the plaintiff, along with counsel, appeared in court on August 21, 1995, intending to contest the custody order. Over the plaintiffs objection, and without requiring or permitting any testimony, the court extended the custody order and scheduled an evidentiary hearing on the order to be combined with a hearing on the underlying neglect petition for March 4 and March 18,1996, the next available trial dates. Under the court\u2019s order, the temporary custody order would remain in effect based upon the ex parte application until the underlying neglect petition could be adjudicated fully.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">According to the complaint, the practice of continuing orders of temporary custody for a period of up to several months, without requiring or permitting testimony and based solely upon hearsay statements contained in affidavits and other documents, is common in the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters in Hartford. The practice of consolidating temporary custody orders and neglect hearings, thereby effectively eliminating any separate custody order hearing, is also commonplace. These practices are also alleged to be widespread in juvenile matter districts throughout the state. Furthermore, as a consequence of a dramatic increase in the number of temporary custody order applications brought by the department and the defendants\u2019 failure appropriately to perform their official duties, resulting in unreasonably crowded juvenile matters dockets, insufficient staffing in the Superior Court for Juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Matters and inadequate allocation of judicial resources, the following practices are also allegedly widespread throughout the state: (1) beginning presentation of evidence at a ten day hearing, allowing one witness to testify in whole or in part, and continuing the hearing for several weeks or months while extending the temporary custody order in the interim; (2) extending the temporary custody order \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d indefinitely, without obtaining the parent\u2019s knowing and voluntary waiver of her statutory and constitutional rights when the parent appears at the ten day hearing unrepresented by counsel; and (3) failing to convene an evidentiary hearing promptly when an attorney appointed at a ten day hearing subsequently requests one.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The plaintiff claimed that she and the other potential class members and their children have a constitutionally protected right to family integrity and that the defendants, by denying them a fundamentally fair process, have improperly interfered with that right, in violation of their rights under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 10, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment that the defendants\u2019 practices violate \u00a7 46b-129, as well as the state and federal constitutions, temporary and permanent injunctive or other equitable relief as needed to enforce compliance with state and federal law, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>such other relief as justice may require. Following the defendants\u2019 request to revise, the plaintiff filed a revised complaint that added to paragraph two of the demand for relief a request for specific injunctive relief including: (a) an order directing Ment to establish procedures for all cases in which a temporary custody order is issued ex parte, including, but not limited to, the immediate appointment of counsel for parents; (b) an order directing Ment to allocate sufficient resources to the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters to eliminate the unlawful practices described in the complaint; (c) an order directing Rossi to restore parental custody of any child whose parents have been subjected to the unlawful practices described in the complaint; and (d) such other remedial orders as may be appropriate based on the evidence adduced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Thereafter, the defendants moved to strike the complaint in its entirety on the ground that it did not make out an appropriate case for a declaratory judgment. Additionally, they moved to strike the relief requested in paragraphs 2 (a) and (b) of the complaint on the grounds that Ment does not have the authority to establish new procedures and that any order by the court would necessarily interfere with his functions and discretion and is therefore barred by sovereign immunity. Finally, they moved to strike the third prayer for relief, paragraph 2 (c), on the ground that a court order directing a blanket termination of temporary custody orders would unduly interfere with Rossi\u2019s discretion and is therefore barred by sovereign immunity. Although the trial court, <em>Hon. Jerry Wagner, </em>judge trial referee, took no action regarding the motion challenging the declaratory relief, the court agreed with the defendants and granted the motion to strike the relief requested in paragraphs 2 (a), (b) and (c). The defendants then moved to dismiss and/or strike the complaint claiming that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>over the complaint because the complaint did not state an appropriate case for a declaratory judgment. The trial court, <em>Sullivan, J., </em>disagreed with the defendants and, in an oral decision, determined that the court had jurisdiction over the case, which presented a narrow issue that was appropriate for a declaratory ruling. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-265a,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the defendants sought certification to appeal the denial of their motion to dismiss and/or strike and the plaintiff similarly sought certification to appeal the decision striking her claim for injunctive relief. The Chief Justice granted certification to both parties and these appeals followed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendants raise in essence a two part claim, each part of which has subparts. First, the defendants claim that because the trial court correctly struck the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>request for injunctive relief, the court cannot grant any practical relief and, therefore, the case is nonjusticiable. This claim is based on two assertions: (1) what the plaintiff wants Ment to do procedurally would supersede the rule-making power of the judges of the Superior Court; and (2) what the plaintiff wants Ment to do administratively, by way of allocation of resources, would violate sovereign immunity. Second, according to the defendants, the trial court improperly refused to strike the plaintiffs prayer for a declaratory judgment because: (1) the case is nonjusticiable; and (2) what the plaintiff wants can, and indeed, should be done on a case-by-case basis, which would be an alternate and effective, appropriate and complete remedy, rendering declaratory relief unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The plaintiff, in her cross appeal, claims that the trial court should not have struck her claims for injunctive relief but that it properly refused to strike her claim for declaratory relief. Her arguments mirror the defendants\u2019 arguments \u2014 whether the case is justiciable, and whether declaratory relief is appropriate. Thus, these claims will be addressed in this opinion together with the defendants\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">We begin with a brief discussion of certain fundamental principles regarding the standard of review that are applicable to the issues in this appeal. In an appeal from a judgment granting a motion to strike, we operate in accordance with well established rules. \u201cBecause a motion to strike challenges the legal sufficiency of a pleading and, consequently, requires no factual findings by the trial court, our review of the court\u2019s ruling on the defendants\u2019 motions is plenary. See <em>Napoletano </em>v. <em>CIGNA Healthcare of Connecticut, Inc., </em>238 Conn. 216, 232-33, 680 A.2d 127 (1996) [cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1103, 117 S. Ct. 1106, 137 L. Ed. 2d 308 (1997)]. . . . [W]e <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint that has been stricken and we construe the complaint in the manner most favorable to sustaining its legal sufficiency. <em>Bohan </em>v. <em>Last, </em>236 Conn. 670, 674, 674 A.2d 839 (1996); see also <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 91, 108-109, 491 A.2d 368 (1985). Thus, [i]f facts provable in the complaint would support a cause of action, the motion to strike must be denied. <em>Waters </em>v. <em>Autuori, </em>236 Conn. 820, 826, 676 A.2d 357 (1996). Moreover, we note that [w]hat is necessarily implied [in an allegation] need not be expressly alleged. <em>Clohessy </em>v. <em>Bachelor, </em>237 Conn. 31, 33 n.4, 675 A.2d 852 (1996).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Knight </em>v. <em>F. L. Roberts &amp; Co., </em>241 Conn. 466, 470-71, 696 A.2d 1249 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">The standard of review of a motion to dismiss is equally well established. In ruling upon whether a complaint survives a motion to dismiss, a court must take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint, including those facts necessarily implied from the allegations, construing them in a manner most favorable to the pleader. <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>213 Conn. 548, 567, 569 A.2d 518 (1990), and cases cited therein. Accepting as true the allegations in the complaint and all facts provable thereunder, in deciding whether a declaratory judgment action in a given case is appropriate, we allow \u201cthe trial court wide discretion to render a declaratory judgment unless another form of action clearly affords a speedy remedy as effective, convenient, appropriate and complete.\u201d <em>England </em>v. <em>Coventry, </em>183 Conn. 362, 365, 439 A.2d 372 (1981). \u201cFurthermore, [if] the plaintiffs\u2019 prayer for relief seeks not only a declaratory judgment but also general equitable relief, the plaintiffs are entitled to invoke the long arm of equity to receive whatever relief the court may from the nature of the case deem proper. Any relief can be granted under the general prayer which is consistent with the case stated in the complaint and is supported by the proof provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>the defendant will not be surprised or prejudiced thereby. <em>Cottrell </em>v. Cottrell, 106 Conn. 411, 419-20, 138 A. 458 (1927), quoting 1 Whitehouse, Equity Practice (1915 Ed.) \u00a7 119, p. 223; <em>Balzano </em>v. <em>Balzano, </em>135 Conn. 584, 590, 67 A.2d 409 (1949). In sum, at least when there is a prayer for general equitable relief, it is the law in our courts, as it is in the federal courts, that [a] court may dismiss a complaint only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations. <em>Hishon </em>v. <em>King &amp; Spalding, </em>467 U.S. 69, 73-74, 104 S. Ct. 2229, 81 L. Ed. 2d 59 (1984).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pellegrino </em>v. <em>O'Neill, </em>193 Conn. 670, 692, 480 A.2d 476, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 875, 105 S. Ct. 236, 83 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">At issue in this case is the right to family integrity, a right that this court has recognized to be of constitutional significance; <em>McGaffin </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>193 Conn. 393, 400, 479 A.2d 176 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1050, 105 S. Ct. 1747, 84 L. Ed. 2d 813 (1985); and has elevated to its proper status. <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-CD), </em>189 Conn. 276, 284, 455 A.2d 1313 (1983). The United States Supreme Court has also consistently emphasized the constitutional importance of family integrity. \u201cThe rights to conceive and to raise one\u2019s children have been deemed essential . . . basic civil rights of man . . . and [r]ights far more precious . . . than property rights . . . . It is cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder. . . . The integrity of the family unit has found protection in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . . . the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . . . and the Ninth Amendment . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>marks omitted.) <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S. Ct. 1208, 31 L. Ed. 2d 551 (1972). This right to family integrity does not, however, belong only to the parents. Rather, it \u201cencompasses the reciprocal rights of both parent and children. It is the interest of the parent in the companionship, care, custody and management of his or her children, [id.], and of the children in not being dislocated from the emotional attachments that derive from the intimacy of daily association, with the parent, <em>[Smith </em>v. <em>Organization of Foster Families for Equality &amp; Reform, </em>431 U.S. 816, 844, 97 S. Ct. 2094, 53 L. Ed. 2d 14 (1977)].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Duchesne </em>v. <em>Sugarman, </em>566 F.2d 817, 825 (2d Cir. 1977). \u201c[T]he most essential and basic aspect of familial privacy [is] the right of the family to remain together without the coercive interference of the awesome power of the state.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Alexander V., </em>223 Conn. 557, 561, 613 A.2d 780 (1992). There is little doubt that breaches in the familial bond will be detrimental to a child\u2019s well-being. <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-CD), </em>supra, 286 and n.ll.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Although the state has a substantial interest in protecting minor children; <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 405 U.S. 649; we have long recognized that intervention in family matters by the state is justified only when such intervention is actually \u201cin the best interest of the child. \u201d See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17a-112 and 46b-129 (e); <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous, </em>179 Conn. 155, 165, 425 A.2d 939 (1979). Courts and state agencies, therefore, must keep in mind the constitutional limitations imposed on a state that undertakes any form of coercive intervention in family affairs. Some of the same constraints have been imposed upon the state by the legislature, recognizing the importance of the prompt adjudication of cases in which the state has interfered with the family unit. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (b). The defendants\u2019 challenge to the plaintiffs complaint must be addressed in light of these considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Against this background, we begin our examination of the fundamental question underlying this appeal: Can a court provide the plaintiff any practical relief or is the present action nonjusticiable, i.e., not capable of resolution on the merits by judicial action?<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">\u201cJusticiability requires (1) that there be an actual controversy between or among the parties to the dispute ... (2) that the interests of the parties be adverse ... (3) that the matter in controversy be capable of being adjudicated by judicial power . . . and (4) that the determination of the controversy will result in practical relief to the complainant.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>187 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Conn. 109, 111-12, 445 A.2d 304 (1982). The defendants make no claim that this case does not meet the first and second of these requirements for justiciability, actuality of the controversy or adversity of the interests of the parties. They focus on the third and fourth criteria, arguing that the adequacy of judicial resources for the courts is an issue that cannot be adjudicated by judicial authority without violating the principle of sovereign immunity. Specifically, the defendants claim that the injunctive relief requested will cause \u201cundue interference with governmental functions\u201d that are solely within Ment\u2019s discretionary duties, and that Ment does not have the authority to order trial judges to alter court procedures to streamline the time involved in juvenile matters.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> They contend that because there is no practical relief available to the plaintiff, the trial court should have dismissed the action. We are not persuaded.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Although the defendants raise the specter of difficulties in crafting \u201cpractical relief,\u201d the need for creativity and ingenuity on the defendants\u2019 part in implementing an appropriate remedy cannot bar the court\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction, particularly when the defendants are in the best position to determine what changes are appropriate. Constitutional violations impheating the courts must be susceptible of a judicial remedy. Otherwise, we insulate the judiciary from constitutional challenges and effectively ignore our constitutional obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The plaintiff has alleged that overcrowded court conditions have had and continue to have an adverse impact upon hundreds of children in Connecticut. She relies in part on a report commissioned by the state judicial department, which concluded that in 1996, nearly two thirds of the 3432 neglect petitions filed in the state involved temporary custody orders. State of Connecticut Court Improvement Project Report (Edmund S. Muskie Institute, University of Southern Maine, 1996) p. 18. There can be no doubt that, if proven to exist, the prolonged delays resulting in disruption to families, in the absence of careful and exacting judicial oversight, substantially interfere with the constitutional right of family integrity. Therefore, while the initial disruption may in fact be justified, long delays are not, and indeed they are dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Although a child\u2019s physical and emotional well-being outweighs the interest in preserving the family integrity, the disruption of a child\u2019s family environment should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>not be extended beyond what is unequivocally needed to safeguard and preserve the child\u2019s best interests. There is a critical need \u201cto act quickly to maximize [the] child\u2019s opportunity either to restore stability to an existing relationship or to facilitate the establishment of new relationships.\u201d J. Goldstein, A. Solnit, S. Goldstein &amp; A. Freud, The Best Interests of the Child: The Least Detrimental Alternative (1996) p. 41. We have been properly forewarned of the well recognized harm to children caused by delayed hearings. \u201cChildren cannot wait for years for a determination that they should be returned to their natural parents [or] placed permanently in an adoptive home .... The delays-that are annoying and frustrating to adults . . . can permanently damage children and their families .... [Courts] should give highest priority to, and set rapid hearing schedules for, cases where delays will harm children irreparably . . . .\u201d American Bar Association Presidential Working Group on the Unmet Legal Needs of Children and Their Families, America\u2019s Children at Risk: A National Agenda for Legal Action (1993) p. 56. It is thus imperative that parents be given a prompt and meaningful opportunity to challenge an order of temporary custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">It is precisely because state intervention can cause irrevocable consequences for both children and parents that \u201cfundamentally fair\u201d procedures provided in a <em>timely </em>manner must be afforded the parties. <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 753-54, 102 S. Ct. 1388, 71 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1982).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In short, there must in effect be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>congruence of rights and remedies. The duty imposed upon the courts to provide a constitutionally adequate system of justice capable of securing the rights and liberties of the people is well recognized. The constitutional obligations to provide justice without undue delay and to afford due process of law must be taken to empower the courts charged with that responsibility to make rules necessary for that purpose. Avenues must be kept free of impediments to open access to the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Our assessment of remedial rights is informed by the nature of substantive rights being vindicated. \u201cOnce a right and a violation have been shown, the scope of a . . . court\u2019s equitable powers to remedy past wrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable remedies.\u201d <em>Swann </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>402 U.S. 1, 15, 91 S. Ct. 1267, 28 L. Ed. 2d 554 (1971). Historically, this court has not been hesitant to insist that \u201cthe decisive factor must be the vindication of [the plaintiffs] constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Gaines </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>194 Conn. 510, 529, 481 A.2d 1084 (1984). Whether the remedy is framed as equity \u201cto provide effective, convenient, direct, and complete relief\u2019; <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>187 Conn. 476, 482, 447 A.2d 1 (1982); or a declaratory judgment that is \u201cpeculiarly well adapted to the judicial determination of controversies concerning constitutional rights\u201d; <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 626, 376 A.2d 359 (1977); a trial court cannot abdicate its responsibility to enforce constitutional mandates merely because remedial solutions may be far reaching or time consuming.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Although we consider the vindication of constitutional rights to be paramount, we recognize that the judiciary must have the power to remedy the unconstitutional delay in order for the case to be justiciable. <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>supra, 187 Conn. 112. Recognition of the inherent power of the judicial branch to operate an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>effective system of justice in this state may be found in several statutes. See General Statutes \u00a7 51-51v (judges of Superior Court to appoint clerks as well as such administrative and clerical assistants as business of court requires); General Statutes \u00a7 51-27 (a) (state required to provide such suitable quarters and furniture as necessary for holding court when there is no suitable location available and to bear expense thereof; General Statutes \u00a7 51-27b (\u201c[tjhere shall be sufficient offices of the Superior Court for the efficient operation of the court\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 51-27d (a) (\u201cobligation to furnish convenient places for the holding of the Superior Court\u201d imposed on commissioner of public works); see also General Statutes \u00a7 4-84 (increased appropriation available for necessary emergency expenditures).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The plaintiff asserts that the complaint in this case does <em>not </em>raise a nonjusticiable political question, and the relief requested herein does <em>not </em>result in an impermissible intrusion upon the prerogatives and functions of a coordinate branch of government. Contra <em>Pelle-grino </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>supra, 193 Conn. 678 (court lacks power to direct legislature to appoint additional judges); <em>Nielsen </em>v. <em>State, </em>236 Conn. 1, 9, 670 A.2d 1288 (1996) (court lacks power to compel legislature to define terms of state constitutional spending cap). In <em>Pellegrino, </em>this court scoured the complaint for a remedy that would <em>not </em>require legislative action but found no allegation that \u201ceven suggests that existing judicial resources have not been properly allocated.\u201d <em>Pellegrino </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>supra, 684. In the absence of any allegation of improper allocation of judicial resources, we declared that the case involved solely a question that was textually committed to the legislative branch. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">This action involves no issue that is constitutionally committed to the legislature, and, therefore, presents no separation of powers obstacles. Rather, the present case seeks to compel the defendants to take steps to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>remedy the constitutional and statutory violations plaguing temporary custody order hearings using <em>existing judicial resources and administrative authority. </em>We have expressly held that \u201c[ijnthe absence of ... a textual reservation ... it is the role and the duty of the judiciary to determine whether the [defendants have] fulfilled [their] affirmative obligations within constitutional principles.\u201d <em>Sheff </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>238 Conn. 1, 13, 678 A.2d 1267 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">This case implicates the affirmative obligations imposed on Ment by statute as well as the inherent power of the judicial branch to manage its resources to accomplish its mission of administering justice. Ment\u2019s statutory obligations and powers can be found in several statutory provisions. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 51-5a, 51-5b, 51-8, 51-9, 51-10, 51-10b, 51-11, 51-182 and 51-193Z. Furthermore, as the agent and appointee of the Chief Justice, who is ultimately responsible for the administration of the judicial branch; see General Statutes \u00a7 51-lb; Ment acts from the top of a hierarchical administrative structure and is \u201cresponsible for the efficient operation of the department, the prompt disposition of cases and the prompt and proper administration of judicial business . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 5 l-5a (a) (1). Thus, as a general matter, only he has the perspective to view the entire system and to make the required allocation of resources of the judicial branch. Moreover, because those resources are hydraulic, in the sense that pushing down on or drawing up from one part of them may affect other parts, Ment has very broad discretion to allocate those resources and to provide procedures for the administration of justice within the branch. Generally speaking, it would be incompatible with this statutory scheme to subject his discretion regarding those resources and procedures to the judgment of one Superior Court judge adjudicating an individual or class claim of the violation of constitutional rights. Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>a claim that Ment should reallocate resources and amend or institute certain administrative procedures in order to remedy that violation, would not ordinarily be the appropriate subject of judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Ment\u2019s discretion, however, although broad, is not unbridled, and when that allocation results in a systemic violation of a group of litigants\u2019 constitutional rights, or in a pattern or practice that has such a result, a reviewing court may be called upon to consider whether his allocation of resources and governance of administrative practices is constitutionally proper. In <em>that </em>instance, the court, affording a heavy presumption of propriety to Ment\u2019s administrative allocations, must determine whether that systemic violation may be remedied,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> for all practical purposes, by a reallocation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>resources and the amendment of administrative procedures, without, at the same time, creating a significant risk of other constitutional violations within the judicial department.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Therefore, in this case, it may well be that Ment, by reallocating resources and instituting new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>administrative procedures, <em>could </em>remedy the systemic constitutional violations alleged by the plaintiff, without significantly risking those other rights. Only a full evi-dentiary proceeding will disclose whether that can be accomplished. The plaintiffs claim is, therefore, justi-ciable.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Finally, the defendants argue that the complaint is inappropriate for a declaratory judgment action and that individual respondents subject to temporary custody orders should raise their claims in their underlying juvenile court cases. See Practice Book \u00a7 390, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 17-55.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This argument ignores the realities of the juvenile system in general and the specific record in this case. The trial court represented to the parties in this case that while the court shared counsel\u2019s concerns regarding the delay, it was overwhelmed with cases and that \u201cconditions and circumstances entirely outside of\u2019 its control dictated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>scheduling. Based upon these representations, it is not reasonable to assume that any individual parent could effectively challenge the denial of a meaningful and timely hearing or that any timely relief would be forthcoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">First, under the circumstances present in this case, by the time an individual parent can appeal, no remedy will be available.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> When the temporary custody order is continued and combined with a neglect petition six months after the initial temporary custody order, as it was in this case, one of two things is virtually certain to happen. Either custody reverts back to the parent and the fight to have the issue resolved and the child returned sooner is lost, or the petition results in an adjudication of neglect and a commitment of the child to the department, which commitment legally supersedes the temporary custody order. See <em>In re Carl </em>O., 10 Conn. App. 428, 434, 523 A.2d 1339, cert. denied, 204 Conn. 802, 525 A.2d 964 (1987) (issues involving temporary custody order are moot once child is adjudicated neglected and committed to department).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Second, even if a given case were not moot, because it is unrealistic to assume that an appellate court would return the child to the parent after a judge, although in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>an ex parte proceeding, had found probable cause for immediate removal, the reviewing court would likely remand the case to the trial court for an immediate custody hearing. This, of course, would only result in further delay and, therefore, further harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Third, as a practical matter, there are substantial incentives for parents to settle their underlying neglect cases once a temporary custody order is. in place. If the ten day hearing does not take place and the custody order is extended as a consequence, the parent is left with a Hobson\u2019s choice. Should the parent consent to a commitment to allow the formal expectations for achieving reunification to commence; see <em>In re Michael M., </em>29 Conn. App. 112, 125, 614 A.2d 832 (1992); or should the parent continue to contest the case and wait for the hearing date, often months away, in order to contest the removal in order not to have an adverse adjudication in the record? Although the plaintiff in this case chose to litigate the matter, her decision to do so, which could be a function of her particular situation vis-a-vis her child, does not negate the fact that the allegations in this case are more effectively challenged in a declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The defendants have acknowledged that there are many cases in which parents are not getting prompt hearings. The studies conducted by the state reflect that is also the case. See State of Connecticut Court Improvement Project Report, supra, pp. 38-39. At the same time, the relief sought by the plaintiff does not require a case-by-case examination. She has withdrawn her claim that the trial court improperly struck paragraph 2 (c) of her demand for relief, which requested an order directing Rossi to restore parental custody of any child whose parents had been subjected to the alleged unlawful practices. The remaining relief sought is institutional in nature and does not depend on establishing that a parent in any given case was subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>an unconstitutional violation. Establishing liability in this case, therefore, does not depend on a case-by-case determination. Accordingly, we disagree with the defendants\u2019 claim that there are more viable avenues available to parents in the plaintiffs situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">We note, however, that in a case such as the present one, the experience of each member of the class is relevant in enabling the trial court to determine the scope of the remedy. In the exercise of its power under Practice Book \u00a7 390, \u201cthe trial court . . . has considerable discretion to frame a remedy, so long as that remedy is commensurate with the scope of the constitutional violations which have been established. . . . [At trial] [t]he parties should be afforded the opportunity to offer suggestions for an appropriate remedial order. . . . Just as the judiciary has inherent power to remedy unconstitutional delays in the disposition of civil jury cases ... so too there is inherent power to remedy unconstitutional delays in [custodial interference cases instituted by the state].\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Gaines </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 528-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">In conclusion, \u201c[w]hile the declaratory judgment procedure may not be utilized merely to secure advice on the law; <em>Tellier </em>v. <em>Zamowski, </em>157 Conn. 370, 373, 254 A.2d 568 [1969]; or to establish abstract principles of law; <em>Norwalk Teachers\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>138 Conn. 269, 272, 83 A.2d 482 [1951]; or to secure the construction of a statute if the effect of that construction will not affect a plaintiffs personal rights; <em>Gannon </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>157 Conn. 1, 9, 244 A.2d 397 [1968]; it may be employed in a justiciable controversy where the interests are adverse, where there is an actual bona fide and substantial question or issue in dispute or substantial uncertainty of legal relations which requires settlement, and where all persons having an interest in the subject matter of the complaint are parties to the action or have reasonable notice thereof. Practice Book <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>\u00a7 390 [now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 17-55]. The procedure has the distinct advantage of affording to the court in granting any relief consequential to its determination of rights the opportunity of tailoring that relief to the particular circumstances.\u201d <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskitt, </em>supra, 172 Conn. 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">This brings us to the last issue, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly struck her claims for injunctive relief. We note that declaratory relief controls state activity no less completely than injunctive relief. The issuance of a declaratory judgment in this action would have the practical effect, even in the absence of a request for injunctive relief, of prompting the defendants to comply with the statute. Moreover, because \u201cdeclaratory relief controls state activity no less completely than injunctive relief\u2019; <em>Sentner </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>184 Conn. 339, 344, 439 A.2d 1033 (1981); there is no prerequisite that there be a request for injunctive relief, which, indeed, might be redundant. <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Papandrea, </em>222 Conn. 414, 424, 610 A.2d 637 (1992). There is clear authority for granting a declaratory judgment without specifically identifying the injunctive relief that might subsequently be ordered should it become necessary. <em>Sheff v. O\u2019Neill, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 45-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">This authority does not, however, address the issue of whether the trial court properly granted the defendants\u2019 motion to strike the plaintiffs two requests for injunc-tive relief.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The trial court also struck the plaintiffs request for an order directing Ment \u201cto establish procedures for all cases in which [a temporary custody order] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>is issued ex parte, including but not limited to immediate appointment of counsel for parents\u201d because it would require him \u201cto create new rules of practice or modify existing rules, and this he does not have the power to do.\u201d The trial court also struck the plaintiffs request for an order directing Ment to allocate sufficient resources to the juvenile courts to eliminate the unlawful practices complained of because such an order would violate sovereign immunity. We disagree as to both determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">We begin with some fundamental principles. First, the court must accept as true the facts alleged in the complaint. <em>Waters </em>v. <em>Autuori, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 822. Second, Practice Book \u00a7 152, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 10-39, allows for a claim for relief to be stricken only if the relief sought could not be legally awarded.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The issue then is whether the trial court <em>could </em>have ordered Ment to implement procedures to protect constitutional rights and to remedy the alleged violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">It is undisputed that Ment, as the chief court administrator, has the authority to make rules \u201crelating to the management of the internal institutional machinery of the court system.\u201d <em>Rules Committee of the Superior Court of Connecticut </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>192 Conn. 234, 243, 472 A.2d 9 (1984). As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>\u201cadministrative director of the Judicial Department,\u201d Ment, may issue such orders as he deems necessary to ensure \u201cthe efficient operation of the department, the prompt disposition of cases and the prompt and proper administration of judicial business . . . General Statutes \u00a7 51-5a (a) (1). We specifically have recognized the power of the chief court administrator to make rules \u201crelating to the management of the internal institutional machinery of the court system.\u201d <em>Rules Committee of the Superior Court of Connecticut </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 243. The plaintiff acknowledges that Ment cannot formulate or interfere with rules of practice and procedure that directly control the conduct of particular litigation. In this case, however, Ment is being asked to manage the internal institutional organization of the courts and to implement, if necessary, an administrative overhaul to improve the temporary custody order process. Such administrative tasks do not purport to extend delegation of authority to Ment as to the adjudication of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Given Ment\u2019s powers, there is a broad spectrum of available procedures that he could employ as part of the effort to remedy the temporary custody order process. The plaintiff suggests that Ment could \u201cdirect juvenile court clerks to allocate more time to [such orders]. He could arrange for additional hours of operation for juvenile courts. He could arrange for the appointment of attorney trial referees to hear contested [temporary custody orders] with the consent of the parties.\u201d Furthermore, Ment could order the appointment of counsel for parents immediately upon the issuing of the temporary custody orders. Although Practice Book \u00a7 1048.1, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 34-1, currently requires that counsel be appointed for both child and parent, it is silent as to the timing of such appointments. According to the plaintiff, counsel for the child is routinely appointed immediately upon the signing of a temporary custody order. We see no impediment to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>immediate appointment of counsel for parents, and, indeed, it would be consistent with the existing guidelines instituted by Ment\u2019s office.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Promulgation of these guidelines reflects recognition by Ment that the scope of his authority includes the power to institute procedures governing the conduct of court-appointed counsel in juvenile court cases.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The defendants do not suggest that this recent promulgation of guidelines was an improper exercise of Ment\u2019s discretion, nor do they distinguish between these actions and the ones proposed by the plaintiff. Therefore, we are unconvinced that the plaintiffs first claim for relief <em>necessarily </em>would result in or be tantamount to an impermissible encroaching by Ment upon judicial rule-making authority. Accordingly, at trial if the court were to conclude that the plaintiff had established her allegations, the court could then explore these options to determine whether they would solve the problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">In her second claim for relief, the plaintiff requests an order directing Ment to allocate sufficient resources to the juvenile courts to eliminate the alleged unlawful practices. The defendants claimed and the trial court concluded that such an order would violate sovereign immunity. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Sovereign immunity rests on the principle and on the hazard \u201cthat the subjection of the state and federal governments to private litigation might constitute a serious interference with the performance of their functions and with their control over their respective instrumentalities, funds and property.\u201d J. Block, \u201cSuits against Government Officers and the Sovereign Immunity Doctrine,\u201d 59 Harv. L. Rev. 1060, 1061 (1946). \u201cIn a constitutional democracy sovereign immunity must relax its bar when suits against the government complain of unconstitutional acts.\u201d <em>Sentner </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>supra, 184 Conn. 343. When a state official\u2019s acts are in excess of legal authority or constitute an erroneous exercise of that authority, \u201cthe interest in the protection of the plaintiff\u2019s right to be free from the consequences of such action outweighs the interest served by the sovereign immunity doctrine.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>supra, 172 Conn. 624. Therefore, \u201c[t]he state is subject to suit without consent ... in a suit for injunctive relief when the action does not defeat the purpose of the doctrine of sovereign immunity by undue interference with governmental functions.\u201d <em>Duguay </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>191 Conn. 222, 227 n.4, 464 A.2d 45 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The defendants argue nevertheless that sovereign immunity bars specific injunctive relief in this case because <em>any </em>ordered reallocation of resources would unduly interfere with the governmental functions of the office of the chief court administrator. The defendants rely in large part on General Statutes \u00a7 51-164t (b) which gives Ment authority to assign judges \u201cas he deems advisable . . . .\u201d Although we recognize that certain forms of relief could perhaps constitute \u201cradical surgery\u201d by the trial court upon the judicial department and that a court should tread lightly when crafting a specific order of relief, the procedural posture of this case is such that the trial court never made specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>findings of fact regarding the particular resources in question or the level of intrusion on Ment\u2019s authority to allocate those resources that would be necessary to remedy the situation. We examine this issue, then, in the context of what is effectively a wholesale attack on the trial court\u2019s ability to address the allocation of resources by Ment. We decline the defendants\u2019 invitation to issue a blanket prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">There can be no doubt that the judiciary is ultimately responsible for the enforcement of the court rules governing juvenile proceedings and that it must use its power over these matters to prevent action that undermines the spirit of the law and the undue infringement of constitutional rights. Viewing the complaint in its most favorable light, it is evident that the plaintiff claims that by failing to allocate sufficient resources to the juvenile courts, Ment has contributed to the constitutional and statutory violations. When the nonfeasance of a state officer is alleged to violate constitutional rights, the trial court must have the authority to address the situation. See <em>Savage </em>v. <em>Aronson, </em>214 Conn. 256, 265, 571 A.2d 696 (1990). To allow that officer to invoke the mantle of sovereign immunity, particularly when the trial court and the offending actor are from the same branch of government, would effectively insulate the defendants from review, render the plaintiffs rights meaningless and \u201cforeclose proper judicial determination of a significant and substantial constitutional question the determination of which is manifestly in the public interest.\u201d <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>supra, 172 Conn. 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">We recognize that there are many competing constraints upon the resources the judicial department has available with which to satisfy other constitutional mandates. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-46a (b) and 54-56d (e); Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 635 and 650, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7\u00a7 37-1 and 37-12. Such competition does not, however, mean that any court order pertaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>to judicial resources would necessarily hamper Ment\u2019s ability to meet those demands or significantly encroach on Ment\u2019s authority to manage the affairs of the courts. Whether an order by the court affecting the judicial department\u2019s resources to ensure the proper and necessary safeguards in cases of custodial interference would indeed unduly interfere with the judicial department\u2019s ability to function or effectively disable another area of the judicial system depends on the particular facts of a given case. In the absence of an evidentiary hearing to establish the existence of a constitutional violation and to explore the parameters of the specific injunctive relief necessary to vindicate the constitutional rights at issue, the defendants\u2019 claim must fail. \u201cWe have excepted declaratory and injunctive relief from the sovereign immunity doctrine on the ground that a court may fashion these remedies in such a manner as to minimize disruption of government and to afford an opportunity for voluntary compliance with the judgment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Savage </em>v. <em>Aronson, </em>supra, 214 Conn. 266. \u201cFurthermore, trial courts can avoid undue interference with governmental functions by tailoring injunctive relief and scrupulously weighing the equities.\u201d <em>Sentner </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>supra, 184 Conn. 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Because we agree with the plaintiff that the trial court had the authority to grant both claims for injunctive relief, we conclude that the trial court improperly granted the defendants\u2019 motion to strike. We reiterate, however, that whether any specific injunctive relief ultimately granted in this case will conform to these principles or will infringe upon powers reserved to Ment is extraneous to whether the corut should render judgment for the plaintiff. In addition to injunctive relief, the complaint sought a declaratory judgment that does not transgress the limitations we have imposed on remedies against the sovereign.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>In conclusion, the allegations of a deluge of cases, combined with the complaints of inadequate resources with which to process them, work together to deprive aggrieved parents and children of meaningful review of the department\u2019s conduct resulting in significant interference with their constitutional rights to family integrity. When we identify a statutory or constitutional violation, it is presumed that the state agency responsible for the violation will act to remedy the problem in accordance with our decision. <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Papandrea, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 424. Regardless of whether the trial court deems it preferable to render a declaratory judgment and await the defendants\u2019 response before acting upon the claims for equitable relief, the court currently has jurisdiction to hear the case and render appropriate relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">The trial court\u2019s decision denying the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss based upon their claim of nonjusticia-bilify is affirmed; the decision striking paragraphs 2 (a) and (b) of the plaintiffs prayer for relief is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">In this opinion NORCOTT and PALMER, Js., concurred, BORDEN, J., concurred with respect to the justi-ciability of the claims as to Ment, and BERDON, J., concurred in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b319-10\"> The plaintiff withdrew the action against Governor Rowland on March 8,1996.

The Chief Justice clearly had the authority to act pursuant to \u00a7 52-265a despite the plaintiffs delay in seeking review of the decision striking her request for relief. See <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg.

They do, however, acknowledge that problems exist, that the spirit of \u00a7 46b-129 (b) is often defeated and that the situation is serious. The judicial department commissioned a study, in 1996, which concluded that \u201c[t]he increase in emergency orders requested and the time to receive a ten-day emergency hearing has reached a critical point in Connecticut.\u201d State of Connecticut Court Improvement Project Report (Edmund S. Muskie Institute, University of Southern Maine, 1996) p. 38. According to the study, (here exists \u201cwidespread evidence that the 10 day hearing requirement is an issue of great difficulty in the courts due to crowded court calendars. We found evidence in interviews, focus groups, and a docket review of a widespread practice of convening the initial 10 day hearing within the statutory guidelines, introducing the parties into the record to formally initiate the hearing, and then continuing the hearing at a later date. The range of time for the completion of 10 day hearings spanned from 10 days to six months. This is a disturbing instance of compliance with the \u2018letter\u2019 rather than the \u2018spirit\u2019 of the law regarding temporary custody hearings.\u201d Id., p. 39. By the time the report was issued, according to representations at oral argument, there have been improvements in expediting these hearings. What declaratory relief, if any, is appropriate is to be determined after a trial based on the facts as they exist at that time and will, of course, depend upon what, if any, constitutional and statutory violations have been proven.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b332-6\"> The defendants also argue that any order to restore custody of children to parents who have been subjected to the alleged unlawful practices would similarly interfere with Rossi\u2019s functions. The plaintiff withdrew her claim that the trial court improperly struck her request for an order directing Rossi to restore parental custody of any child whose parents are subjected to the alleged unlawful practices. Therefore, we need not address the defendants\u2019 argument as to that claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Despite the decision by the plaintiff to withdraw her challenge to the trial court order striking her request for injunctive relief directed at Rossi, the defendants have not claimed that the trial court improperly refused to strike the plaintiff\u2019s prayer for declaratory relief. In other words, the defendants have not raised the issue of whether, in the absence of the third claim for relief, the one specifically directed at Rossi, the trial court improperly refused to strike the plaintiffs claim for a declaratory judgment that the defendants\u2019 practices violate \u00a7 46b-129 as well as the state and federal constitutions. Taking it upon himself to make arguments that the defendants <em>could, </em>have made, but did not, Justice Borden concludes, in his concurring and dissenting opinion, that this case is not justiciable as to Rossi. We are loath to reach and decide issues neither raised nor briefed, particularly when we are remanding the case for an evidentiary hearing to establish the existence of a constitutional violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b332-8\"> We note at the outset what this case is <em>not </em>about. The solution to the problem of delay that the plaintiff apparently seeks is <em>not </em>the creation of additional judgeships. \u201cIncreases in the number of judges, as well as appointments to the additional positions created, are not within the province <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>of the judiciary. [See Conn. Const., amend. XX, \u00a7 2.] Nor are the defendants, individually or collectively, empowered to add one judgeship to those authorized by General Statutes \u00a7 51-165 or to appoint anyone to fill such a position. Those are prerogatives reserved exclusively to the legislature.\u201d <em>Pellegrino </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>supra, 193 Conn. 678. Because the plaintiff is not claiming the creation of additional resources as a means of relief or a basis for justiciability, this case does not require us to revisit <em>Pellegrino.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b334-7\"> Although not previously faced with the precise issue currently before us, we have recognized the potential impact of an ex parte temporary custody order on the subsequent course of proceedings. See <em>Madigan </em>v. <em>Madigan, </em>224 Conn. 749, 756-57, 620 A.2d 1276 (1993) (temporary custody order may have significant impact on subsequent custody decision); <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (8S-CD), </em>supra, 189 Conn. 285-86 (stability and continuity militate in favor of maintaining status quo). We further appreciate the snowball effect that an initial custody determination can have on the ultimate resolution of a case. See <em>In re Valerie D., </em>223 Conn. 492, 531-32, 613 A.2d 748 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b338-7\"> By the use of the term \u201cremedied\u201d we do not mean that, in order for the case to be justiciable, it must be established that Ment can, by reallocating resources and instituting new procedures, <em>completely solve </em>the current problem plaguing temporary custody orders. That would be an unrealistic limitation, which would place the question of justiciability unduly beyond attainment. We also do not mean that it would be sufficient for justiciability to establish that a reallocation of resources and new procedures will simply <em>improve </em>the situation. Because a trial court does not sit as a kind of super court administrator, it is not within its powers to order Ment to reallocate resources simply because the court deems its judgment as to that allocation to be preferable to Ment\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">We mean, instead, by \u201cremedied\u201d that Ment can <em>substantially eradicate </em>the systemic causes of individual constitutional violations. The inquiry for the trial court in this respect will be whether the reallocation of resources, plus administrative and procedural mechanisms, will render the operation of the judicial system free from <em>systemic, </em>as opposed to occasional and numerically insignificant, violations of the litigants\u2019 rights to a prompt hearing. While the measure of success of the aggregate remedial methods chosen by Ment will be the number and magnitude of constitutional violations still arising subsequent to the implementation of those methods, the existence of individual violations within the judicial department does not necessarily mean that the systemic constitutional violations alleged in the complaint have not been remedied or that a systemic violation has been created elsewhere. We recognize that, given the procedural posture of this case, the defendants have not had to address these issues. It is precisely because we do not yet know what remedial measures are possible or appropriate, or what effect such measures would have on the judicial department as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>whole, that we cannot conclude at this time, as the defendants would have us do, that this case is nonjusticiable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b339-7\"> This limitation is important because it is axiomatic that a trial court cannot be put in the position of vindicating one litigant\u2019s constitutional rights by violating the rights of another. Those other constitutional rights might include, for example, the rights of criminal defendants to a speedy trial, the right to a civil jury trial, and the rights of citizens generally to access to the courts. If the trial court were to determine that the systemic violations alleged by the plaintiff could be remedied only by creating a significant risk of these other systemic constitutional violations, the case would then involve, not the reallocation of resources, but the requirement of additional resources. Under that scenario, the case would not be justiciable, because the plaintiff specifically disclaims the creation of additional resources as a basis for justiciability in this case. Despite the frustrations with the plaintiffs claims expressed by Justice Berdon in his concurrence that Ment alter court procedures and allocate sufficient resources to eliminate the alleged unlawful practices described in the complaint and the plaintiffs express disclaimers to any right to additional resources, we do not decide cases irrespective of the pleadings and arguments of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">In his concurring opinion, Justice Berdon conflates the issue of whether we are faced with a type of claim that is appropriate for declaratory relief with the issue of redressability. As this opinion makes clear, we agree with him as to the significance of the constitutional rights at issue that make this case well adapted to judicial determination by way of a declaratory judgment. We are also mindful of our constitutional obligation to provide justice. See, e.g., <em>Sheff </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 13-16; <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>supra, 172 Conn. 623-28. What courts cannot enforce, however, they cannot decree. <em>Clarke\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>70 Conn. 195, 209, 39 A. 155 (1898). The reliance by Justice Berdon in his concurrence on <em>Gaines </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 510, is misplaced. Unlike in this case, in <em>Gaines, </em>the court had the explicit authority, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-293 (a) (2), to grant the remedy requested by the petitioner appointing special public defenders and the respondent made no claim that the relief requested would violate the separation of powers doctrine. Id., 519-20; see footnote 13 of this opinion. Furthermore, the respondent in <em>Gaines </em>made no claim that this relief would be detrimental to the constitutional rights of others. The plaintiff in this case may have to contend with the question of competing constitutional claims if Ment, in order to comply with \u00a7 46b-129 (b), reallocates judicial resources and alters administrative procedures as requested. In that event, the plaintiff will have to decide whether to seek: (1) immediate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>release of her child, a claim she has expressly withdrawn; see footnote 12 of this opinion; (2) additional resources to eliminate the systemic problem at issue, a claim she has expressly withdrawn; see footnote 13 of this opinion; or (3) permission to renew her claims against Governor Rowland, a party she has expressly chosen to eliminate; see footnote 2 of this opinion; and the trial court will then be faced with a cadre of issues. Until then, the trial court first must decide whether the plaintiff can prevail within the existing framework of her complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b340-9\"> Practice Book \u00a7 390, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 17-55, provides: \u201c[Declaratory Judgments] \u2014 Conditions</p>\n<p id=\"ADg\">\u201cThe court will not render declaratory judgments upon the complaint of any person:</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">\u201c(a) unless the party has an interest, legal or equitable, by reason of danger of loss or of uncertainty as to the party\u2019s rights or other jural relations; or</p>\n<p id=\"APJ\">\u201c(b) unless there is an actual bona fide and substantial question or issue in dispute or substantial uncertainty of legal relations which requires settlement between the parties; or</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">\u201c(c) where the court shall be of the opinion that the parties should be left to seek redress by some other form of procedure; or</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">\u201c(d) until all persons having an interest in the subject matter of the complaint are parties to the action or have reasonable notice thereof.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b341-8\"> In his dissent, Justice McDonald asserts that the plaintiff in this case had a speedy remedy available \u2014 to appeal from the continuance of the temporary custody order.

I fully agree with and join the majority opinion regarding the defendant Aaron Ment, the chief court administrator.

They are not. As the complaint now stands, there are no allegations that, taken as true, would support a justiciable claim against the commissioner. Moreover, there is nothing in the majority opinion that suggests either a violation of any litigant\u2019s constitutional or statutory rights by the commissioner or a remedy that is within the power of a court to order the commissioner to effectuate.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The plaintiffs complaint originally sought \u201can order directing [the commissioner] to restore to parental custody any child whose parents are subjected to the unlawful practices described in this complaint . . . .\u201d As the majority notes, however, the plaintiff has eliminated that claim for relief from this case. The only other demands for relief that arguably could apply to the commissioner are: (1) \u201cA declaratory judgment that the [commissioner\u2019s] practices described herein violate [General Statutes] \u00a7 46b-129 as well as the state and federal constitutions\u201d; and (2) the general claim for \u201csuch other remedial orders as may be appropriate based on the evidence adduced at trial.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">There are, however, no allegations in the complaint that involve either conduct, or the failure to engage in conduct, by the commissioner resulting in the claimed statutory and constitutional violations of the plaintiffs right to a prompt hearing after issuance of an order of temporary custody \u2014 at least no such allegations that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>could support a justiciable claim. All of the plaintiffs allegations involve the purported failure of the judicial system to afford her such a hearing. It should go without saying that the commissioner has no authority over the operation of the judicial system.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The only allegations that <em>might </em>be read as directed at the commissioner are that: (1) \u201cUpon information and belief, these practices [namely, continuing orders of temporary custody for months without taking evidence, and combining the hearings under \u00a7 46b-129 with the final hearings] are the result of a dramatic increase in the number of [temporary custody order] applications sought by [the department of children and families]\u201d; and (2) \u201cThe conditions described [namely, a dramatic increase in the number of applications for orders of temporary custody sought by the department of children and families, unreasonably crowded juvenile matters dockets, insufficient staffing of the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters, and inadequate allocation of judicial resources] result from the defendants\u2019 failure to appropriately perform their official duties.\u201d As applied to the commissioner, these allegations amount to a claim that, by bringing more petitions for orders of temporary custody to the court than is justified, she has failed to perform appropriately her official duties. I can discern no other interpretation of these allegations, and the plaintiff has supplied none. In my view, such a claim is nonjusticiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">The commissioner has the statutory responsibility to file applications for orders of temporary custody when the facts available to her justify such a course of action, in order to protect the health and safety of children. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101g (c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The commissioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>discretionary decision to file such applications is at the core of her executive function. In the absence of allegations that she is systematically exercising this responsibility in an arbitrary, malicious or discriminatory fashion \u2014 which allegations the plaintiff has not made \u2014 a court does not have the power to engage in second-guessing of that function.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Doing so simply because the commissioner\u2019s decisions regarding filing applications has resulted in an overload on the judicial system would violate the principle of the separation of powers. Nothing in the majority opinion suggests why a court would have the power to engage in such a process of executive oversight. As to the commissioner, therefore, I would affirm the judgment of the trial court, <em>Wagner, J., </em>striking certain of the plaintiffs demands for relief, and I would reverse the judgment of the trial court, <em>Sullivan, J., </em>denying the commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b351-7\"> Rossi was the commissioner at the time that the plaintiff commenced this action and has been succeeded in that position by Kristine D. Ragaglia. I refer herein to Rossi as the commissioner because she is a defendant only in her representative capacity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b352-8\"> The other two demands for relief are specifically aimed only at the chief court administrator. They are for injunctive or other equitable relief granting: \u201c(a) an order directing [the chief court administrator] to establish procedures for all cases in which an [order of temporary custody] is issued ex parte, including but not limited to immediate appointment of counsel for parents; and (b) an order directing [the chief court administrator] to allocate sufficient resources to the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters to eliminate the unlawful practices described in this complaint . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b353-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101g (c) provides: \u201cIf the Commissioner of Children and Families, or his designee, has probable cause to believe that the child or any other child in the household is in imminent risk of physical harm from his surroundings and that immediate removal from such surroundings is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>necessary to ensure the child\u2019s safety, the commissioner, or his designee, shall authorize any employee of the department or any law enforcement officer to remove the child and any other child similarly situated from such surroundings without the consent of the child\u2019s parent or guardian. The commissioner shall record in writing the reasons for such removal and include such record with the report of the investigation conducted under subsection (b) of this section.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b354-10\"> Indeed, at oral argument before this court the plaintiff clarified her allegations by asserting that the commissioner is \u201cabusing her discretion\u201d by seeking too many orders of temporary custody. In my view, this clarification adds nothing to the justiciability of the claim against the commissioner. Whether to seek such an order in any given case is a uniquely fact-bound, discretionary decision. As I indicate in the text of this opinion, the exercise of that discretion lies at the core of her executive power. I see no basis for a court to go beyond its judicial function of determining whether a petition is based on probable cause, by reviewing, on an abuse of discretion basis, the commissioner\u2019s decision to bring the petition in the first place. Oversight of that discretionary decision is no more a judicial function than oversight of a state\u2019s attorney\u2019s decision to prosecute \u201ctoo many crimes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b354-6\">BERDON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ANq\">concurring in the result. I agree with the result reached by the majority.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nevertheless, I have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>substantial disagreement with the reasoning of the majority with respect to the issue of justiciability. I write separately to explain why I believe that, pursuant to the federal constitution,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the action brought against the named defendant, Aaron Ment, the chief court administrator, and the defendant Linda D\u2019Amario Rossi, commissioner of the department of children and families (department), jointly referred to as the state,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is justiciable. And to make my position perfectly clear, to the extent that the majority seems to separate the justiciability of the action from the justiciability of the remedy in its unusual analysis in footnote 15 and the accompanying text of its opinion, it is my view that this action is justiciable with respect to both.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Identification of the basic issue in this case not only answers the issue of justiciability, but also, based on the undisputed facts, the merits of the plaintiffs action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>The issue is whether, after a child is removed from the care and custody of his parent on allegations of neglect, the parent is entitled to a timely hearing, at least within the statutorily mandated ten day period,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> wherein the state must prove neglect and that the child\u2019s best interests require that he remain in foster care. The answer is obvious \u2014 due process of law requires such a hearing in a timely manner. Accordingly, in my view, not only is this case justiciable, but on remand, after the class is certified, it is a classic case for summary judgment for the plaintiff and the class with respect to their claim that their constitutional rights have been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">I begin by setting forth the undisputed facts underlying the plaintiffs action. On August 8,1995, social workers from the department seized Jonathan B., the nineteen month old child of the plaintiff Pamela B., pursuant to the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 17a-lOlg (c), which authorizes the removal of a child for ninety-six hours upon probable cause to believe the child is in imminent risk of physical harm.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>On August 11, 1995, three days after the department seized Jonathan B. from his mother, the department filed a petition in the Superior Court seeking to commit Jonathan B. as a neglected child. The department also sought a ten day order of temporary custody pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (b). The trial court, without notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>to the plaintiff and in the confines of his chambers, on an ex parte basis, granted the temporary custody order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">On the tenth day after Jonathan B.\u2019s removal, the plaintiff appeared before the trial court with her attorney prepared to challenge the allegations of neglect, only to be told by the trial judge that the matter could not be heard that day, that the hearing had to be continued for approximately six months during which period the temporary custody order would be continued and the child would remain in foster care. The trial judge also told the plaintiff that he shared her concerns about being deprived of the custody of her child but he was \u201coverwhelmed\u201d with other cases and \u201cthat conditions and circumstances entirely outside his control dictated the scheduling.\u201d The plaintiff duly objected to the delay of this hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">At oral argument before this court, the state conceded that the failure to grant hearings on the tenth day \u2014 the focus of this action \u2014 is common among juvenile court judges. Indeed, a 1996 report commissioned by the state judicial department \u201cfound evidence in interviews, focus groups, and a docket review of a widespread <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>practice of convening the initial 10 day hearing within the statutory guidelines, introducing the parties into the record to formally initiate the hearing [in order to technically comply with the temporary custody order], and then continuing the hearing at a later date. The range of time for the completion of 10 day hearings spanned from 10 days to six months.\u201d State of Connecticut Court Improvement Project Report (Edmund S. Muskie Institute, University of Southern Maine, 1996) p. 39.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The plaintiff filed this action and sought certification as a class action, seeking (1) a judgment declaring that the state\u2019s failure to conduct temporary custody order hearings within ten days after children are removed from their parents violates \u00a7 46b-129 and the plaintiffs fundamental federal and state constitutional due process rights, and (2) equitable relief by way of an injunction compelling the state to conduct timely temporary custody order hearings. The state moved to dismiss the plaintiffs action on the ground that it is not justiciable, which motion the trial court denied. The trial court, however, granted the state\u2019s motion to strike the plaintiffs equitable claims for an injunction. Both rulings are before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Let me first put the issues raised in this case in their proper perspective. This case involves the plaintiffs fundamental federal constitutional liberty interests in the companionship, care, custody and management of her child. <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 758, 102 S. Ct. 1388, 71 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1982); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Organization of Foster Families for Equality &amp; Reform, </em>431 U.S. 816, 843, 97 S. Ct. 2094, 53 L. Ed. 2d 14 (1977); <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S. Ct. 1208, 31 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>L. Ed. 2d 551 (1972). \u201cThis right to family integrity [which is shared by the parent as well as the child, <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>supra, 760], includes the most essential and basic aspect of familial privacy \u2014 the right of the family to remain together without the coercive interference of the awesome power of the state.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-CD), </em>189 Conn. 276, 284, 455 A.2d 1313 (1983). \u201c]F]ew consequences of judicial action are so grave as the severance of natural family ties. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>M. L. B. </em>v. <em>S. L. J., </em>519 U.S. 102, 119, 117 S. Ct. 555, 136 L. Ed. 2d 473 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">This court recognized in <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-CD) </em>that: \u201cStudies indicate that the best interests of the child are usually served by keeping the child in the home with his or her parents. \u2018Virtually all experts, from many different professional disciplines, agree that children need and benefit from continuous, stable home environments.\u2019 Institute of Judicial Administration\u2014 American Bar Association, Juvenile Justice Standards Project, Standards Relating to Abuse and Neglect, p. 45 (Tentative draft, 1977) .... The love and attention not only of parents, but also of siblings, which is available in the home environment, cannot be provided by the state. Unfortunately, an order of temporary custody often results in the children of one family being separated and scattered to different foster homes with little opportunity to see each other. Even where the parent-child relationship is \u2018marginal,\u2019 it is usually in the best interests of the child to remain at home and still benefit from a family environment.\u201d <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-CD), </em>supra, 189 Conn. 285-86.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We have made it clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>that this \u201cfundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care, custody, and management of their child does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents or have lost temporary custody of their child to the State. Even when blood relationships are strained, parents retain a vital interest in preventing the irretrievable destruction of their family life.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Baby Girl B., </em>224 Conn. 263, 279-80, 618 A.2d 1 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The amici curiae, a group of social scientists, legal advocates and other groups concerned with the rights and welfare of children,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> point out the critical importance of stability for the appropriate development of the child. \u201cContinuity of relationships is essential for a child\u2019s healthy development. . . . Since continuity may not play as significant a role in later life, its importance may be underrated by adult decision-makers. [A child\u2019s] growth may be disrupted when upheavals and changes in the external world are added to the inevitable internal ones . . . because emotional attachments are tenuous and vulnerable in early life, and children need stability of relationships for growth and development.\u201d J. Goldstein, A. Solnit, S. Goldstein &amp; A. Freud, The Best Interests of the Child; The Least Detrimental Alternative (1996) pp. 19-20. Indeed, as the amici point out by quoting from the American Bar Association Presidential Working Group on the Unmet Legal Needs of Children and Their Families, America\u2019s Children at Risk: A National Agenda for Legal Action (1993) p. 56: \u201cChildren cannot wait for years for a determination that they should be returned to their natural parents [or] placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>permanently in an adoptive home .... The delays that are annoying and frustrating to adults . . . can permanently damage children and their families . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">With this background in mind, I agree with the majority that the plaintiffs action is justiciable. The difference between our views, if I correctly understand the majority opinion, is that, in my view, the plaintiffs action is justiciable and should be decided on the merits; and in the majority\u2019s view, the action is presumptively justicia-ble at this time, but it may not be justiciable after the trial court conducts a full evidentiary hearing. The majority\u2019s presumption that this case is justiciable with respect to Ment, however, hangs on a thin thread. According to the majority\u2019s unprecedented theory of constitutional \u201chydraulics,\u201d \u201c[i]f the trial court were to determine that the systemic violations alleged by the plaintiff could be remedied only by creating a significant risk\u201d of other constitutional violations within the judicial department, the case would be nonjusticiable. The majority goes further and holds that the trial court, in applying this theory of constitutional \u201chydraulics,\u201d must grant \u201ca heavy presumption of propriety to Ment\u2019s administrative allocations\u201d of resources when it conducts its evidentiary hearing. Under those circumstances, it is highly unlikely the trial court will find that Ment can remedy the systemic violations. In other words, the majority would have us believe that the state could remove a child from a parent\u2019s custody on the ground of neglect and then deny that parent a timely hearing if Ment could prove insufficient resources caused the delay. This reasoning is fundamentally flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The plaintiff, to a certain degree, invited this constitutional \u201chydraulics\u201d argument. As a result of the state\u2019s request for a more specific statement, the plaintiff amended her prayer for relief by indicating that Ment should be required to \u201callocate sufficient resources to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters to eliminate the unlawful practices described in her complaint.\u201d By amending the complaint in this manner, the plaintiff allowed the state to focus its defense on the alleged unconstitutionality of a court ordering Ment to allocate more judicial resources. It was a good ploy by the state and the majority of this court has swallowed it \u2014 hook, line and sinker. In doing so, the majority not only loses sight of the plaintiffs request for declaratory relief, but also, our decisions in <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 376 A.2d 359 (1977), and <em>Sheff v. O\u2019Neill, </em>238 Conn. 1, 678 A.2d 1267 (1996). The majority, however, undermines the very foundation of cases like <em>Sheff </em>and <em>Horton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">In today\u2019s confusing opinion, the majority holds that the trial court cannot grant declaratory relief if the state can prove that the specific injunctive relief demanded by the plaintiff will infringe upon the constitutional rights of other litigants. Both <em>Horton </em>and <em>Sheff </em>however, make it clear that for federal and state constitutional violations, the trial court may grant a judgment declaring the conduct to be unconstitutional without specifically identifying the injunctive relief that might subsequently be ordered should it become necessary. <em>Sheff v. O\u2019Neill, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 1 (holding by declaratory judgment that disparities in access to unsegregated educational environment infringed upon plaintiffs\u2019 fundamental state constitutional right to substantially equal educational opportunity); <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>supra, 172 Conn. 615 (holding by declaratory judgment that state system of financing public elementary and secondary education violates plaintiffs\u2019 fundamental state constitutional right to education). Moreover, we have made it crystal clear that \u201c[i]n the event that a declaratory judgment action should decide that certain acts of state officials violated the constitution, we presume that the official would accede to that decision.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number><em>Sentner </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>184 Conn. 339, 344, 439 A.2d 1033 (1981); <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Popandrea, </em>222 Conn. 414, 424, 610 A.2d 637 (1992). Thus, in this case, we may presume that the state, once ordered by the trial court, will take the necessary action to correct the unconstitutional delays in temporary custody order hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Any suggestion that this unusual theory of constitutional \u201chydraulics\u201d can dissipate the fundamental federal constitutional rights of the plaintiff class \u2014 rights that do not depend upon the state\u2019s resources, Ment\u2019s discretion or any other such state consideration \u2014 is also unavailing. The majority cites to no law, and I doubt that any could be found, that would suggest that the violation of the federal procedural and substantive due process rights of the plaintiff can be trumped if the state cannot remedy these violations of individual constitutional rights without, at the same time, causing other constitutional violations to occur. In my view, it would be appropriate for the trial court in this case to grant the plaintiffs request for general injunctive relief, leaving it up to the state, Ment and the department, to figure out how to remedy the due process violations. Therefore, whether the remedy can be accomplished administratively by the department assigning more caseworkers to determine whether there is probable cause that a child has been abused, by making more social services available to the parent, rather than removing children on a wholesale basis, by Ment administratively assigning more judges to the juvenile courts, or by some other appropriate remedy,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> should have no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>bearing on this court\u2019s determination of the justiciability of the plaintiffs action. In fact, this court recognized in <em>Gaines </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>194 Conn. 510, 529 n.18, 481 A.2d 1084 (1984), that \u201c \u2018[inadequate resources no longer can excuse the denial of constitutional rights.\u2019 <em>Todaro </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>565 F.2d 48, 54 n.8 (2d Cir. 1977); <em>Milliken </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>433 U.S. 267, 289-90, S. Ct. 2749, 53 L. Ed. 2d 745 (1977); <em>Ruiz </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>679 F.2d 1115, 1146-47 (5th Cir. 1982), cert.. denied, 460 U.S. 1042, 103 S. Ct. 1438, 75 L. Ed. 2d 795 (1983); <em>Finney </em>v. <em>Arkansas Board of Correction, </em>505 F.2d 194, 201 (8th Cir. 1974).\u201d See <em>Swann </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>402 U.S. 1, 15, 91 S. Ct. 1267, 28 L. Ed. 2d 554 (1971) (\u201c[o]nce a right and a violation have been shown, the scope of a . . . court\u2019s equitable powers to remedy past wrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable remedies\u201d); <em>Detainees of Brooklyn House of Detention for Men </em>v. <em>Malcolm, </em>520 F.2d 392, 399 (2d Cir. 1975) (\u201c[inadequate resources of finances can never be an excuse for depriving detainees of their constitutional rights\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Nevertheless, the majority would have us believe, based upon its theory of justiciability, that Ment could give priority to protecting mere property rights over that of the familial privacy rights in one\u2019s child when allocating judicial resources. In other words, Ment, according to the majority, in exercising his discretion, could give priority to the assignment of judicial resources to assure that there is probable cause before a nonpossessory hen attaches to real estate over the assignment of judicial resources to protect parental rights with respect to the custody of children. See, e.g., <em>Connecticut </em>v. <em>Doehr, </em>501 U.S. 1, 16-18, 111 S. Ct. 2105, 115 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1991) (holding that ex parte determination of probable cause is insufficient under due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>clause for nonpossessory lien such as attachment); <em>General Electric Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>185 Conn. 583, 591, 441 A.2d 581 (1981) C\u2018[i]t is well established that deprivation of the use and possession of property without a hearing violates the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment\u201d). I strongly disagree with this suggestion. The liberty interests in the companionship, care, custody and management of one\u2019s child can never be subordinated to the due process rights of another in order to protect interests in mere property.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Although the formal record of this appeal will indicate that the denial of the state\u2019s motion to dismiss is affirmed and the striking of the injunctive relief sought by the plaintiff is reversed, the majority\u2019s blueprint for the future of this litigation is dismal for the plaintiff and her child, as well as others similarly situated. I am dismayed over the fact that the majority, by conferring on Ment the broad discretion of determining that the plaintiffs constitutional rights can be displaced \u201chydraulically\u201d by the rights of others, not only demeans fundamental constitutional rights of poor persons, like the plaintiff here,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but also comes close to sending those rights into oblivion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b354-11\"> I agree that the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to dismiss should be sustained and that the striking of the injunctive relief claims should be reversed, and those claims of relief reinstated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b355-7\"> This action was brought under both the federal and state constitutions. Because the federal constitution sets the floor below which the states are not free to go; <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>216 Conn. 150, 160, 579 A.2d 58 (1990); for the purposes of this opinion, I focus solely on the plaintiffs federal constitutional rights. Accordingly, I need go no further than determining that the case is justiciable under the federal constitution. I find the majority opinion confusing when it relies on cases that involve only the state constitution as being determinative of the justiciability issue. <em>Pellegrino </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>193 Conn. 670, 678, 480 A.2d 476, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 875, 105 S.

As the majority points out, however, the commissioner never made the argument in favor of nonjusticiability that Justice Borden finds persuasive; consequently, the plaintiff never has had the opportunity to address that argument. In such circumstances, I, like the majority, am reluctant to decide the question. If, however, Justice Borden is correct that the plaintiffs claims against the commissioner are nonjusticiable, then we do not have subject matter jurisdiction over those claims. Accordingly, I would order the parties to submit supplemental briefs on the issue so that we properly may decide it. Because my colleagues do not share the view that supplemental briefs are appropriate, however, and because I am not absolutely certain, absent any input from the plaintiff, that Justice Borden is correct in his conclusion that the plaintiffs claims against the commissioner are nonjusticiable, I concur with the majority that we should not decide this issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-6\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b366-7\">MCDONALD, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aeo\">dissenting. I concur with Justice Borden that the action as to the defendant Linda D\u2019Amario Rossi, commissioner of children and families, is not justiciable and should be dismissed. I also believe the action as to the named defendant, Aaron Ment, chief court administrator, should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>I agree it is unjust, as alleged, to deprive a parent of the custody of his or her child and to misadminister the judicial branch so as to create a system wide delay in child custody healings. Here, however, the court should not be engaged in policy matters left to the legislature and the governor. The plaintiff also failed to bring an action against the parties from whom she could obtain practical and real relief. Finally, the plaintiff had an effective remedy that she abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">It could be said that this case is not justiciable because it involves a policy decision to allocate resources that is reserved to the legislature. <em>Pellegrino </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>193 Conn. 670, 480 A.2d 476, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 875, 105 S. Ct. 236, 83 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1984). Judges are not appointed to be social engineers. <em>Claremont School District </em>v. <em>Governor, </em>142 N.H. 462, 477, 703 A.2d 1353 (1997) (Horton, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">It could also be said that the named defendant, the chief court administrator, is not the policy maker for the judicial branch. The policy makers, the judges of the Superior Court, headed by the chief justice, are the necessary parties in whose absence no effective relief can be granted. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 51-la, 51-lb; <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>187 Conn. 109, 111-12, 445 A.2d 304 (1982). Nevertheless, the majority orders a trial to determine if the plaintiffs case is justiciable. It directs a trial judge to determine if \u201csubstantial\u201d steps can be taken to avoid these delays in child custody hearings. If such steps cannot be taken using the present available resources without affecting the constitutional rights of other litigants, the case will be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">To allow this case to continue in this manner does a disservice to children and parents where charges of child abuse are made. The plaintiff had a speedy, effective, convenient, appropriate and complete remedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>available by way of appellate review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 52-265a; <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983). Those are grounds to dismiss this independent injunctive and declaratory judgment action. See Practice Book \u00a7 390 (c), now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 17-55 (3); <em>England </em>v. <em>Coventry, </em>183 Conn. 362, 439 A.2d 372 (1981). Had such an appeal been taken in 1995 from Judge Lavine\u2019s continuance of the ten day hearing and had the plaintiff prevailed, a decision would have been rendered long ago promptly vindicating her rights to the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">This case brought, instead, only further trial court proceedings protracted into 1997. While the action was pending, the plaintiff voluntarily relinquished her rights to her child and that issue is not before us. She nonetheless claims to pursue other parents\u2019 rights. This may mislead those parents to forgo effective appellate relief and to join this futile case<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> inching its way through the overcrowded civil dockets. If this case were dismissed, those other parents would seek this effective speedy relief and avoid the \u201cdismal\u201d prospects for this case, which \u201ccomes close to sending [their] rights into oblivion.\u201d See concurring opinion of Justice Berdon.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">I would affirm the decision of Judge Wagner granting the motion to strike the claim for injunctive relief and reverse the decision of Judge Sullivan denying the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-8\"> Judge Lavine\u2019s order directly affected the plaintiffs custody rights, suspending them without a hearing for six months. Precisely because of that suspension we undertook to review the otherwise interlocutory orders in this case that only indirectly affected the plaintiffs rights. An appeal from Judge Lavine\u2019s order could have been taken in the same manner as in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b368-9\"> Indeed, where the plaintiff must overcome a heavy presumption that the chief court administrator acted properly and in view of the reality of mounting juvenile and adult criminal cases and ever increasing family and civil dockets, the failure of the plaintiffs case appears preordained.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
