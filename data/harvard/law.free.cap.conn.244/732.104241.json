J.</author>\n<p id=\"aaq-dedup-0\">The principal issue in this appeal is whether the parties\u2019 contracts provide that disputes regarding timeliness of claims arising under the contracts are to be resolved by arbitrators in accordance with the rules of the arbitrating body, or by a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the relevant statutes of limitation. The plaintiffs<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brought this action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>in the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-410<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> seeking an order directing the defendant, Advest, Inc., to proceed with the arbitration of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims regarding six investment accounts that were maintained with the defendant. The plaintiffs moved for summary judgment maintaining that the arbitration clauses contained in the contracts that governed the six investment accounts entitled them to such an order as a matter of law. The defendant, in turn, moved for partial summary judgment claiming that all but one of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were not arbitrable because they were time barred by statutes of limitation. The trial court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and granted partial summary judgment in favor of the defendant. The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court claiming that the trial court had ruled improperly on the summary judgment motions. We transferred the appeal to ourselves pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 65-1, and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We reverse both of the trial court\u2019s rulings on the parties\u2019 motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">By way of background, in September, 1986, the named plaintiff, Gabriel Levine, opened a personal investment account with the defendant and also made arrangements to open investment accounts for Gale Investments, a Connecticut partnership of which he was a member, and the Yeshiva University-Levine Trust, a charitable trust that had been established for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>purpose of providing unrestricted funds to Yeshiva University. Anna V. Levine, Gabriel Levine\u2019s wife, subsequently opened a personal account and, together with her husband, established a joint account with the defendant. In May, 1987, Gabriel Levine opened an account for the Yeshiva University-Gabriel and Anna V. Levine Scholarship Fund, a fund that had been established in 1979 for the purpose of providing Yeshiva University with funds to be used solely to enable \u201cneedy and deserving young men and women to obtain [a] Torah education . . . .\u201d We refer herein to those six investment accounts collectively as the Advest accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Written contracts governed each of the Advest accounts. Gabriel Levine executed the contracts related to his personal account, the Gabriel Levine and Anna V. Levine joint account, the Gale Investments account and the Yeshiva University-Gabriel and Anna V. Levine Scholarship Fund account. Anna V. Levine signed the contracts that governed her personal account and the Gabriel Levine and Anna V. Levine joint account. Robert E. Berman, trustee of the Yeshiva University-Levine Trust, executed the contracts related to the Yeshiva University-Levine Trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">All of the contracts that governed the Advest accounts contain identical arbitration and choice of law clauses. The arbitration clauses provide in relevant part that \u201c[i]t is understood that the following agreement to arbitrate does not constitute a waiver of the right to seek a judicial forum where such a waiver [of the right to seek a judicial forum] would be void under the federal securities laws. The [parties agree] . . . that except as inconsistent with the foregoing sentence, <em>all controversies which may arise . . . </em>concerning any transaction or the construction, performance or breach of this . . . agreement . . . <em>shall be determined by arbitration </em>in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>accordance with the rules then prevailing of the Arbitration Committee of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., the American Arbitration Association, the Board of Arbitration of the New York Stock Exchange or the Board of Arbitration of the American Stock Exchange . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The choice of law clauses provide in relevant part that \u201c[t]his [agreement and its enforcement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York.\u201d The arbitration and choice of law clauses are the only provisions of the parties\u2019 contracts that are relevant to this appeal. Within this opinion we refer to the arbitration clauses and the choice of law clauses collectively as the parties\u2019 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">On September 22, 1987, the plaintiffs executed the documents necessary to transfer the assets held in the Advest accounts to accounts that the plaintiffs had established with PaineWebber, Inc. (PaineWebber).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The assets were transferred from Advest to PaineWebber in early October, 1987. The plaintiffs assert that at the time of the transfer, the Advest accounts contained cash and fully paid securities with a combined value of more than $30,000,000, as well as stock option contracts exposing the accounts to liabilities in excess of $100,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">In mid-October, 1987, after the transfer but before any significant trading activity had taken place in the accounts that had been transferred to PaineWebber, the stock market fell 769 points. The precipitous market <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>decline caused margin calls<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to take place in the accounts that had been transferred to PaineWebber. Because the plaintiffs were unable to meet the resulting demands for cash, their accounts\u2019 assets were liquidated by PaineWebber. The plaintiffs allege that due to the stock option contracts, four of the six accounts that had been transferred to PaineWebber sustained not only 100 percent losses, but also a combined deficit of more than $4,000,000, and that the two remaining accounts declined in value to only $150,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">On September 21, 1993, the plaintiffs brought suit in the Superior Court alleging that the Advest accounts had been mishandled by the defendant and its former employee, Charles Badain. See <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Advest, Inc., </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, Docket No. CV-93-0529887-S.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Specifically, the plaintiffs asserted claims against the defendant for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, fraudulent misrepresentation, fraudulent nondisclosure of material facts, negligence and breach of professional standards of conduct. On the basis of those same claims, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>the plaintiffs simultaneously initiated arbitration proceedings against the defendant before the Board of Arbitration of the New York Stock Exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Citing the Federal Arbitration Act (arbitration act); see 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1 through 16; and General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-409<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 52-410,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion in the trial court for a stay of the court proceedings they had initiated and an order directing the defendant to proceed with arbitration before the Board of Arbitration of the New York Stock Exchange. The defendant objected to the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to stay the court proceedings and to compel arbitration. After briefing and oral argument, the trial court found that in the six years immediately prior to the initiation of arbitration proceedings, only one transaction had occurred in the Advest accounts. Citing rule 603 of the New York Stock Exchange, which provides in relevant part that \u201c[n]o dispute . . . shall be eligible for submission to arbitration under this Code where six (6) years shall have elapsed from the occurrence or event giving rise to the act or the dispute, claim or controversy,\u201d the trial court concluded that the plaintiffs were not eligible, under the rules of the Board of Arbitration of the New York Stock Exchange, to bring arbitration proceedings before that body regarding any transaction other than the one transaction that had occurred in the six years immediately prior to the initiation of arbitration proceedings in September, 1993. Except as to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>one transaction, the court consequently denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to stay court proceedings and compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">Subsequent to the trial court\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to stay court proceedings and to compel arbitration, the plaintiffs became aware that their motion to compel arbitration might have been procedurally defective because even if a party seeking to compel arbitration has filed a motion, pursuant to \u00a7 52-409, to stay legal proceedings in the court in which such proceedings are pending, \u00a7 52-410 arguably requires the party to institute an entirely distinct legal action, by separate writ of summons and complaint, in order to obtain an order directing the opposing party to proceed with arbitration. <em>See Success Centers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Huntington Learning Centers, Inc., </em>223 Conn. 761, 764-65 nn. 4 and 5, 613 A.2d 1320 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The plaintiffs, therefore, did not file a motion for reconsideration of, or an appeal from, the order of the trial court denying their motion to compel the defendant to submit to arbitration before the Board of Arbitration of the New York Stock Exchange. Instead, pursuant to \u00a7 52-410, the plaintiffs instituted this action, by way of separate complaint, seeking an order directing the defendant to proceed with arbitration before the American Arbitration Association.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">The plaintiffs subsequently moved for summary judgment as to their application for an order compelling arbitration before the American Arbitration Association, maintaining, inter alia, that the parties\u2019 agreement, which required them to arbitrate \u201call controversies which may arise,\u201d entitled them, as a matter of law, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>such an order. The defendant simultaneously moved for partial summary judgment, claiming that all but one of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were time barred by statutes of limitation and, therefore, not arbitrable. The trial court interpreted the parties\u2019 agreement and concluded that the language of the choice of law clauses had incorporated into their agreement New York Civil Practice Law and Rules \u00a7 7502 (b) (McKinney 1980), which provides in relevant part that if \u201cthe claim sought to be arbitrated would have been barred by limitation of time had it been asserted in a court of the state, a party may assert the limitation as a bar to the arbitration on an application to the court . . . .\u201d Noting that, although \u00a7 7502 (b) applied, it was preferable to apply the same statutes of limitation with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 application for an order compelling arbitration as would apply in the Connecticut legal proceedings that the plaintiffs theretofore had initiated against the defendant, the trial court determined that Connecticut\u2019s statutes of limitation, rather than New York\u2019s, should govern the plaintiffs\u2019 application for an order compelling arbitration. The parties agreed with the court\u2019s ruling. Because the Connecticut statutes of limitation time periods for contract claims and tort claims are six years and three years, respectively,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the trial court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and granted summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>judgment in favor of the defendant as to all of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, except the breach of contract claim with respect to any transactions that had been executed within the six year period immediately prior to September 21, 1993, the date on which the plaintiffs first instituted legal proceedings against the defendant. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. Specifically, the plaintiffs maintain that the trial court incorrectly concluded that the language of the choice of law portion of the parties\u2019 agreement had incorporated New York Civil Practice Law and Rules \u00a7 7502 (b) into that agreement, thereby improperly permitting the defendant to raise the statutes of limitation as a special defense to arbitrability in the \u00a7 52-410 court proceeding to compel arbitration.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The plaintiffs further claim that the trial court improperly failed to grant their motion for summary judgment. Specifically, the plaintiffs maintain that their motion for summary judgment was denied improperly because, as a matter of federal arbitration law and state contract law, the parties\u2019 agreement must be construed to provide that disputes regarding timeliness of claims are to be resolved by arbitration. The defendant disagrees and also maintains that, even if we decide that the parties\u2019 agreement did not permit the defendant to raise the statutes of limitation as a special defense to arbitrability in a court proceeding to compel arbitration, the plaintiffs\u2019 motion should not be granted in all respects. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>defendant maintains that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether one plaintiff, Yeshiva University, has standing to compel arbitration, and that, consequently, the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment was properly denied as to Yeshiva University\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">\u201cThe standard of review for summary judgment is well established. Summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter oflaw. . . . In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Maffucci </em>v. <em>Royal Park Ltd.

When a dispute that is covered by an arbitration agreement arises, and a party to the arbitration agreement fails, neglects or refuses to submit to arbitration, the party seeking arbitration may petition a federal or state court for an order compelling arbitration. See 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4; General Statutes \u00a7 52-410. Section 4 of the arbitration act provides that the court shall hear the parties, and, upon being satisfied that neither the making of a covered arbitration agreement, i.e., a written arbitration agreement pertaining to a contract involving interstate commerce, nor the defendant\u2019s failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>comply with that agreement is in dispute, the court shall issue an order directing the parties to proceed to arbitration in accordance with the terms of their arbitration agreement. 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4; accord General Statutes \u00a7 52-410.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The arbitration act, therefore, directs state and federal courts in which an application for an order compelling arbitration has been made to determine whether: (1) the litigants executed a written arbitration agreement regarding a contract involving interstate commerce; and (2) if so, whether the issue in dispute is arbitrable, i.e., within the scope of that agreement. <em>Prima Paint Corp. </em>v. <em>Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co., </em>388 U.S. 395, 403-404, 87 S. Ct. 1801, 18 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1967); <em>PaineWebber, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bybyk, </em>supra, 81 F.3d 1198. In other words, having concluded that the arbitration act applies to the litigants\u2019 arbitration agreement, the court ordinarily then interprets the arbitration agreement to determine whether the issue in dispute falls within the scope of the litigants\u2019 agreement to arbitrate. <em>AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Communications Workers of America, </em>supra, 475 U.S. 649; <em>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>376 U.S. 543, 546-47, 84 S. Ct. 909, 11 L. Ed. 2d 898 (1964). Moreover, if the arbitration agreement is ambiguous as to whether the issue in dispute is arbitrable, the arbitration act requires the court to resolve the ambiguity in favor of arbitration of the issue. <em>First Options of Chicago, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>supra, 514 U.S. 945; <em>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital </em>v. <em>Mercury Construction Corp., </em>supra, 460 U.S. 24 \u2014 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">In some cases, however, the arbitration act provides for more limited judicial analysis of an arbitration agreement. Parties to an arbitration agreement may provide in their agreement that the arbitrating body, rather than a court, shall interpret the arbitration agreement to determine whether the issue in dispute is within the purview of the parties\u2019 undertaking to arbitrate. <em>First </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number><em>Options of Chicago, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>supra, 514 U.S. 943; <em>AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc. </em>v. <em>Communications Workers of America, </em>supra, 475 U.S. 649; see also <em>PaineWebber, Inc. vBybyk, </em>supra, 81 F.3d 1198 (\u201c \u2018[j]ust as the arbitra-bility of the merits of a dispute depends upon whether the parties agreed to arbitrate that dispute, so the question \u201cwho has the primary power to decide arbitrability\u201d turns upon what the parties agreed about that matter\u2019 \u201d). When an arbitration agreement so provides, the arbitration act requires the court, upon ascertaining that the agreement is written and pertains to a contract involving interstate commerce, to issue an order compelling arbitration without further consideration of the scope of the agreement to arbitrate. In cases in which an arbitration agreement is ambiguous as to <em>who, </em>i.e., the arbitrating body or the court, is to interpret the arbitration agreement to determine whether the agreement provides for arbitration of the issue in dispute, however, the court, not the arbitrating body, initially interprets the arbitration agreement to make that determination. <em>First Options of Chicago, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>supra, 944; <em>PaineWebber, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bybyk, </em>supra, 1198-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">In this case, none of the parties claims that the parties\u2019 agreement explicitly provided that an arbitrating body, not a court, must interpret their agreement to determine whether timeliness is an arbitrable issue. With the above relevant principles of federal arbitration law and state contract law in mind, therefore, we turn our attention to the language of the parties\u2019 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">There are two possible interpretations of the language of the parties\u2019 agreement. The first is that the language of the choice of law portion of the agreement encompasses New York arbitration law. Under this construction, which was adopted by the trial court and is advocated by the defendant, New York arbitration law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>specifically New York Civil Practice Law and Rules \u00a7 7502 (b) (party may assert statute of limitations as bar to order compelling arbitration), operates as a limitation on the parties\u2019 agreement, memorialized in the arbitration provision, that, \u201cexcept as inconsistent with [federal securities law], <em>all controversies . . . </em>shall be determined by arbitration . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Consequently, under this interpretation, although it is undisputed that arbitration of a controversy regarding timeliness of a claim would not be inconsistent with federal securities law, such a controversy is not necessarily arbitrable. Instead, if the defendant so desires, the timeliness of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims must be determined by the court in accordance with the relevant statutes of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The second possible interpretation of the language of the parties\u2019 agreement is that the choice of law portion does not limit the arbitration portion. Under this construction, which is espoused by the plaintiffs, despite the parties\u2019 agreement in the choice of law provision that \u201c[their] [agreement <em>and its enforcement </em>shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York\u201d; (emphasis added); a controversy as to the timeliness of a claim is both arbitrable and governed by the timeliness rules of the arbitrating body, and the defendant does not have the option of raising a statute of limitations defense to arbitrability in a court proceeding to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">The defendant maintains that the language of the choice of law portion of the parties\u2019 agreement rules out, as a matter of law, the second possibility. In so arguing, the defendant relies primarily on <em>Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Luckie, </em>supra, 85 N.Y.2d 202, in which the New York Court of Appeals concluded that the parties in <em>Luckie, </em>by specifying that their agreement <em>and its enforcement </em>would be governed by New York law, intended to incorporate into that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>agreement New York Civil Practice Law and Rules \u00a7 7502 (b), the provision at issue in this appeal. We agree with the defendant that if the case before us involved a written arbitration agreement that contained arbitration and choice of law clauses identical to those at issue in <em>Luckie, </em>under that case, as a matter of New York contract law,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> we would have to construe the agreement to indicate that the contracting parties intended to incoiporate \u00a7 7502 (b) into their agreement. For the reasons that follow, however, we do not agree that the holding in <em>Luckie </em>is dispositive of this appeal. See <em>Smith Barney Shearson, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sacharow, </em>91 N.Y.2d 39, 48, 689 N.E.2d 884, 666 N.Y.S.2d 990 (1997) (choice of law clause specifying that contracting parties\u2019 <em>agreement and its enforcement </em>is to be governed by New York law does not necessarily trump broad arbitration clause; <em>\u201cLuckie </em>was narrowly tailored to the specific framework presented by that case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">We begin by noting that the choice of law portion of the parties\u2019 agreement contains the very phrase, namely, \u201cand its enforcement,\u201d that the New York Court of Appeals found to be dispositive in <em>Luckie. </em>See <em>Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Luckie, </em>supra, 85 N.Y.2d 202. Indeed, we acknowledge that, on its face, the language of the choice of law portion of the parties\u2019 agreement indicates that, like the litigants in <em>Luckie, </em>the parties intended to incorporate New York arbitration law, and therefore New York Civil Practice Law and Rules \u00a7 7502 (b), into their agreement, thereby giving the defendant the option of raising statutes of limitation as a defense to arbitrability in a court proceeding to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>The individual clauses of a contract, however, cannot be construed by taking them out of context and giving them an interpretation apart from the contract of which they are a part. <em>Barrow </em>v. <em>Lawrence United Corp., </em>146 App. Div. 2d 15, 18, 538 N.Y.S.2d 363 (1989), later proceeding, 155 App. Div. 2d 806, 548 N.Y.S.2d 82 (1989); accord <em>White </em>v. <em>Kampner, </em>229 Conn. 465, 473-74, 641 A.2d 1381 (1994); 2 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 202 (2) (1979) (written contract is to be interpreted as whole). \u201cA contract should be construed so as to give full meaning and effect to <em>all of its provisions </em>. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) <em>American Express Bank Ltd. </em>v. <em>Uniroyal, Inc., </em>supra, 164 App. Div. 2d 277; <em>Trump-Equitable Fifth Avenue Co. </em>v. <em>H.R.H. Construction Corp., </em>106 App. Div. 2d 242, 244, 485 N.Y.S.2d 65 (1985), aff'd, 66 N.Y.2d 779, 488 N.E.2d 115, 497 N.Y.S.2d 369 (1985); accord <em>Tomlinson </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>226 Conn. 704, 722, 629 A.2d 333 (1993); <em>Hatcho Corp. </em>v. <em>Della Pietra, </em>supra, 195 Conn. 20; see also <em>Thomas Crimmins Contracting Co. </em>v. <em>New York, </em>74 N.Y.2d 166, 172-73, 542 N.E.2d 1097, 544 N.Y.S.2d 580 (1989). Thus, the language of the choice of law portion of the parties\u2019 agreement cannot be read in isolation, but instead must be considered in light of the language of the arbitration portion. See <em>Smith Barney, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hause, </em>238 App. Div. 2d 104, 107, 655 N.Y.S.2d 489, aff'd, 91 N.Y.2d 39, 689 N.E.2d 884, 666 N.Y.S.2d 990 (1997) (interpreting choice of law clause in conjunction with arbitration clause); <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. </em>v. <em>Adler, </em>234 App. Div. 2d 139-40, 651 N.Y.S.2d 38 (1996) (same); see also <em>Mastrobuono </em>v. <em>Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., </em>supra, 514 U.S. 63 (same); accord <em>White </em>v. <em>Kampner, </em>supra, 473-74 (interpreting mandatory negotiation clause in conjunction with arbitration clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>The arbitration portion of the parties\u2019 agreement provides in relevant part that <em>\u201cexcept as inconsistent with the [federal securities law], all controversies </em>. . . concerning any transaction, or the construction, performance or breach of this or any other agreement . . . shall be determined by arbitration . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The phrase \u201call controversies . . . concerning . . . construction, performance or breach of this . . . agreement\u201d is not only broad enough to encompass disputes over whether the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are timely; see <em>Smith Barney, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hause, </em>supra, 238 App. Div. 106; see also <em>PaineWebber, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bybyk, </em>supra, 81 F.3d 1199; it is also unqualified by any language explicitly carving out disputes regarding eligibility for arbitration, such as timeliness, for resolution by the courts. In addition, the fact that the parties explicitly specified in the arbitration portion of their agreement that certain claims related to federal securities law were to be the only disputes excepted from their agreement to arbitrate strongly suggests that the parties intended that eligibility controversies, including timeliness, would be resolved by arbitration. The language of the arbitration portion of the parties\u2019 agreement, therefore, reasonably may be construed to indicate that if the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are untimely, the defendant\u2019s remedy is to defend the plaintiffs\u2019 <em>arbitration action </em>on timeliness grounds, rather than to avoid the arbitration altogether. See <em>PaineWebber, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bybyk, </em>supra, 1200.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Moreover, the language of the arbitration portion of the parties\u2019 agreement is not the same as that contained in the arbitration clauses of <em>the Luckie </em>contracts. Unlike the arbitration portion of the agreement in this case, the arbitration clauses of the <em>Luckie </em>contracts did not contain any language suggesting that the parties intended that the exclusion from arbitration of disputes related to federal securities law would be <em>the only exception </em>to the scope of the <em>Luckie </em>arbitration clause. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>See <em>Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Luckie, </em>supra, 85 N.Y.2d 198; <em>Luckie </em>v. <em>Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., </em>999 F.2d 509, 510 (11th Cir. 1993); <em>Luckie </em>v. <em>Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., </em>766 F. Sup. 1116, 1119 (M.D. Fla. 1991). Consequently, we conclude that the language of the arbitration portion of the parties\u2019 agreement creates an ambiguity, not present in the <em>Luckie </em>contracts, as to whether the parties intended the choice of law portion of the agreement to incorporate New York Civil Practice Law and Rules \u00a7 7502 (b) into that agreement and thereby permit the defendant to raise statutes of limitation as a defense to arbitrability in a court proceeding to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Furthermore, the arbitration act requires that due regard must be given to the federal policy favoring arbitration, and that in interpreting the parties\u2019 agreement, we must resolve any ambiguity regarding whether an issue in dispute is within the scope of their agreement to arbitrate in favor of arbitration. <em>Mastrobuono </em>v. <em>Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., </em>supra, 514 U.S. 62; <em>Volt Information Sciences, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior University, </em>supra, 489 U.S. 476; <em>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital </em>v. <em>Mercury Construction Corp., </em>supra, 460 U.S. 24 \u2014 25; <em>Thomas James Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Jameson, </em>supra, 102 F.3d 65; see also <em>White </em>v. <em>Kampner, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 473-74; <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. </em>v. <em>Adler, </em>supra, 234 App. Div. 140. We conclude, therefore, that, as a matter of federal arbitration law, the parties\u2019 agreement must be construed to indicate that controversies as to the timeliness of claims are to be resolved by arbitrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">Finally, we note that our conclusion that the parties\u2019 agreement must be construed in favor of arbitration of disputes regarding timeliness is consistent with the common-law principle that ambiguous contractual language should be construed against the interest of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>party that drafted it. See <em>Graff v. Billet, </em>64 N.Y.2d 899, 902, 487 N.E.2d 212, 487 N.Y.S.2d 733 (1985) (any doubt as to meaning of language of brokerage agreement must be resolved against broker who prepared agreement); accord <em>Streitweiser </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>219 Conn. 371, 375, 593 A.2d 498 (1991); see also <em>Mastrobuono </em>v. <em>Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., </em>supra, 514 U.S. 62; 2 Restatement (Second), supra, Contracts \u00a7 206. The plaintiffs did not draft, edit or alter the parties\u2019 agreement, and consequently, to the extent that the defendant drafted ambiguous contracts, it cannot now claim the benefit of the doubt regarding the ambiguity. See <em>Mastrobuono </em>v. <em>Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., </em>supra, 63; <em>PaineWebber, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bybyk, </em>supra, 81 F.3d 1199.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">We conclude that the parties\u2019 agreement did not permit the defendant to raise statutes of limitation as a defense to arbitrability in a court proceeding to compel arbitration. The defendant\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, therefore, was granted improperly.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">THE PLAINTIFFS\u2019 MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">We note at the outset that a trial court\u2019s ruling denying a party summary judgment is not a final judgment, and that such rulings ordinarily are not appealable. See Practice Book \u00a7 4000, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 61-1. We previously have held, however, that a party may obtain review of a trial court\u2019s ruling denying summary judgment in the context of an appeal from a subsequent final judgment. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>220 Conn. 285, 295 n.12, 596 A.2d 414 (1991). The plaintiffs are before this court on appeal from a final judgment rendered in favor of the defendant on a motion for summary judgment. Consequently, the claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>of the plaintiffs that the trial court improperly denied their motion for summary judgment is reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">The plaintiffs claim that they were entitled, as matter of law, to an order directing the defendant to proceed with arbitration and that, consequently, the trial court improperly denied their motion for summary judgment. The defendant, however, maintains that the plaintiffs are not entitled to such an order because: (1) the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are time barred by statutes of limitation and, therefore, not arbitrable; and (2) there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether one plaintiff, Yeshiva University, has standing to compel the defendant to proceed with arbitration. Because we have concluded that the parties\u2019 agreement did not permit the defendant to raise statutes of limitation as a special defense to arbitrability in the \u00a7 52-410 court proceeding, and because there is no dispute as to whether the plaintiffs, other than Yeshiva University, have standing to compel arbitration of claims arising from their respective accounts, we conclude that the trial court improperly determined that those plaintiffs, concerning whom there was no question of standing, were not entitled, as a matter of law, to an order compelling arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">We turn now to the defendant\u2019s claim that Yeshiva University was not entitled to an order compelling arbitration. The defendant maintains that because Yeshiva University was not a signatory to any of the contracts that governed the Advest accounts, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Yeshiva University has standing to compel the defendant to proceed with arbitration.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> To support their position that Yeshiva University has standing to compel the defendant to proceed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>with arbitration, the plaintiffs rely on the following undisputed evidence: (1) the written agreement by which the Yeshiva University-Gabriel and Anna V. Levine Scholarship Fund was established in 1979; (2) the affidavit of Sheldon E. Socol, vice president of business affairs for Yeshiva University; (3) a client account statement prepared in 1979 by Shearson Hayden Stone, Inc., for the Yeshiva University-Gabriel and Anna Y. Levine Scholarship Fund; and (4) an annual statement prepared in 1987 by the defendant for the Yeshiva University-Gabriel and Anna V. Levine Scholarship Fund account. The written agreement by which the scholarship fund was established provides that contributions by check to the fund shall be made payable to Yeshiva University and shall be deposited to an account specifically designated as the Yeshiva University-Gabriel and Anna V. Levine Scholarship Fund. The agreement further provides that Yeshiva University shall \u201chold, manage, invest and reinvest the funds received in perpetuity, and shall collect the income therefrom, and . . . award the said income as scholarships . . . .\u201d The agreement, which is dated June 12, 1979, was signed by Norman Lamm, president of Yeshiva University, and was duly notarized. Socol\u2019s affidavit states that Yeshiva University vested Gabriel Levine with the responsibility of investing the assets held in the scholarship fund, and the 1979 client statement prepared by Shearson Hayden Stone, Inc., was addressed to Gabriel Levine A/C Yeshiva University-Gabriel and Anna V. Levine Scholarship Fund. Moreover, the statement that the defendant itself prepared for the scholarship fund account in 1987 was addressed to Socol, and both the 1979 Shearson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>Hayden Stone, Inc., statement and the 1987 Advest statement listed Yeshiva University\u2019s tax identification number as the account holder\u2019s tax identification number.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Those uncontroverted facts are sufficient to establish that when Gabriel Levine executed the contracts governing the Yeshiva University-Gabriel and Anna V. Levine Scholarship Fund account, he did so not in his individual capacity, but on behalf of Yeshiva University.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The defendant nevertheless argues that Yeshiva University was neither the owner nor an intended beneficiary of the Yeshiva University-Gabriel and Anna V. Levine Scholarship Fund account. To support its position, the defendant relies entirely on the affidavit of Daniel F. McAuliffe, director of compliance for Advest, Inc. In his affidavit, McAuliffe states that for purposes of the defendant\u2019s \u201cobligations under New York Stock Exchange Rule 405, often called \u2018the know your customer rule,\u2019 \u201d the defendant treated Gabriel Levine as its customer with respect to the Yeshiva University-Gabriel and Anna V. Levine Scholarship Fund account.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">\u201cAlthough the party seeking summary judgment has the burden of showing the nonexistence of any material fact ... it [is nevertheless] incumbent upon the party opposing summary judgment to establish a factual predicate from which it can be determined, as a matter of law, that a genuine issue of material fact exists.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wadia Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hirschfeld, </em>224 Conn. 240, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>247, 618 A.2d 506 (1992); <em>Connell </em>v. <em>Colwell, </em>214 Conn. 242, 251, 571 A.2d 116 (1990). The mere presence of an adverse claim will not in itself defeat the motion. <em>Wadia Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hirschfeld, </em>supra, 247; <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>Farrell, </em>182 Conn. 34, 39, 438 A.2d 415 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The defendant did not furnish any affidavits or documents establishing a factual dispute concerning the ownership of the assets held in the Yeshiva University-Gabriel and Anna V. Levine Scholarship Fund account. An assertion that the defendant treated Gabriel Levine as its customer for purposes of \u201cthe \u2018know your customer rule\u2019 \u201d does not create an issue of material fact as to whether Gabriel Levine was acting on behalf of Yeshiva University when he executed the contracts governing the Yeshiva University-Gabriel and Anna V. Levine Scholarship Fund account. The defendant consequently failed to establish the factual predicate necessary for a determination of the existence of a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Yeshiva University had standing to compel arbitration of claims related to the Yeshiva University-Gabriel and Anna V. Levine Scholarship Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">To summarize, we conclude that the language of the arbitration portion of the parties\u2019 agreement created an ambiguity as to whether the parties intended that disputes regarding timeliness of claims arising under the contracts that governed the Advest accounts would be resolved by arbitration, and that, consequently, as a matter of federal arbitration law; see <em>First Options of Chicago, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>supra, 514 U.S. 945; <em>Moses H.

We also conclude that Yeshiva University did not lack standing to compel arbitration of claims arising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>under the contract that governed the Yeshiva University-Gabriel and Anna V. Levine Scholarship Fund account, and that the arbitration act consequently entitled the plaintiffs to an order directing the defendant to proceed with arbitration of all claims the plaintiffs raised regarding the Advest accounts. The plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment, therefore, should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment granting the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denying the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b754-8\"> The named plaintiff, Gabriel Levine, brought suit as owner of his individual brokerage account, as representative of the estate of his deceased wife, Anna V. Levine, in connection with her individual brokerage account, and as owner of an account he had established jointly with his wife. Gabriel Levine died in 1992. Blanche R. Rosenzweig Levine, representative of the estate of Gabriel Levine, has been substituted in that capacity for Gabriel Levine as a plaintiff in connection with Gabriel Levine\u2019s individual account and the joint account. Arnold Slotkin, successor to Gabriel Levine as representative of the estate of Anna V. Levine, has been substituted in that capacity for Gabriel Levine as a plaintiff in connection with Anna Levine\u2019s individual account.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-9\">Robert E. Berman, acting in his capacity as trustee of the Levine-Yeshiva University Trust, brought suit in connection with the Levine-Yeshiva University Trust account. Yeshiva University brought suit in connection with the Yeshiva University-Gabriel and Anna V. Levine Scholarship Fund, and Gale Investments, a Connecticut partnership, brought suit as owner of the Gale Investments account.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b755-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-410 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A party to a written agreement for arbitration claiming the neglect or refusal of another to proceed with an arbitration thereunder may make application to the superior court for the judicial district in which one of the parties resides or, in a controversy concerning land, for the judicial district in which the land is situated or, when the court is not in session, to any judge thereof, for an order directing the parties to proceed with the arbitration in compliance with their agreement.
