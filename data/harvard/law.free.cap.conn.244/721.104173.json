Accordingly, we reverse that portion of the trial court\u2019s judgment holding that the deposition was improperly admitted. The issue in the defendant\u2019s cross appeal is whether the trial court correctly determined that the plaintiff had neither breached its contract nor violated the Home Improvement Act. General Statutes \u00a7 20-418 et seq. We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment as to the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">The following facts are not in dispute. The plaintiff, SFP Tisca (Tisca), is a French company whose principal place of business is France. Tisca sells custom handmade carpeting. The defendant, Robin Hill Farm, Inc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>(Robin Hill), is a corporation organized to enable its principal, Magnus Lindholm, to purchase real estate in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">In 1989, while in Paris, Lindholm hired a Parisian decorator to assist him with the interior design of his home in Greenwich, Connecticut. The interior decorator recommended that Tisca provide the carpeting for this home, and Robin Hill subsequently contracted with Tisca for the carpeting. Robin Hill paid Tisca 75,000 French francs in partial payment on a total invoice of 215,376.53 francs, but refused to pay the remaining 140,376.53 francs because Lindholm alleged that the carpet in one room of his home, approximately 15 to 20 percent of the entire order, had a tear nearly two feet long.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Tisca commenced this action against Robin Hill in December, 1992, claiming damages for breach of contract and unjust enrichment. Robin Hill admitted receipt of the carpet, partial payment and the existence of a contract, but denied liability on the remainder of the contract payments. Robin Hill filed a counterclaim alleging breach of contract by the plaintiff and violation of the Home Improvement Act; General Statutes \u00a7 20-418 et seq.; which, Robin Hill claimed, constituted a per se violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA). General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">When it became apparent that Tisca would be unable to have one of its officers or employees present in the United States at the trial scheduled for September 29, 1995, it moved, unopposed, for a continuance. Robin Hill did not dispute Tisca\u2019s claim that Tisca had tried to schedule the trial for the end of October to mid-November when an employee was to be in the United States. The trial date, however, was set for December 12, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>In preparation for the absence at trial of a company representative, Tisca, on November 13, 1995, in Stamford, Connecticut, deposed Pierre-Louis Juillet. Juillet, who is from France, described himself as the export sales manager of Tisca. Lindholm and the attorney for Robin Hill were present at the deposition and Robin Hill\u2019s attorney engaged in extensive cross-examination and recross-examination of Juillet. Tisca then moved pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 248 (1) (d) (2), now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 13-31 (a) (4) (B), that Juillet\u2019s deposition be admitted into evidence at the trial scheduled for December 12, 1995. The trial court ordered that a hearing be held on the motion on December 12, and referred the matter to an attorney trial referee (attorney referee) for trial on the same day, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-434 (a) and Practice Book \u00a7 428 et seq., now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 19-1 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Robin Hill argued before the attorney referee that the deposition was inadmissible because Tisca had procured the absence from trial of its own witness, contrary to the requirements for admissibility set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 248 (1) (d) (2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Robin Hill claimed that, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, Tisca\u2019s business-related decision to forgo the presence of a company representative precluded the deposition\u2019s admission into evidence. Tisca argued that it did not procure the absence of its own witness. The attorney referee granted Tisca\u2019s motion to admit the deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">After a hearing, the attorney referee recommended that the trial court render judgment for Tisca as to the complaint for the balance of the contract, 140,376.53 francs. At the time the trial court rendered judgment, this amounted to approximately $26,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Robin Hill also presented evidence at the hearing on its counterclaim before the attorney referee, claiming, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>in the first count, that Tisca breached its contract by providing tom carpet and, in the second count, that Tisca violated the Home Improvement Act. The attorney referee found that there was no credible evidence of such a tear and recommended judgment for Tisca as to the breach of contract count of the counterclaim. The attorney referee also found that the contract for the sale of this carpeting did not include its installation. Because the Home Improvement Act exempts sales of goods not installed by the seller,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the attorney referee recommended that judgment be rendered for Tisca as to the second count of the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Robin Hill moved to correct the attorney referee\u2019s report and filed exceptions to the factual findings and objections to the acceptance of the report. The trial court rejected the attorney referee\u2019s report as to Tisca\u2019s breach of contract claim. The trial court held that the deposition had been improperly admitted because Tis-ca\u2019s voluntary business decision to forgo the appearance at trial of a company representative was tantamount to procuring the absence of its own witness. The trial court then rendered judgment for Robin Hill as to the complaint because Tisca had introduced no other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">The trial court accepted the attorney referee\u2019s report as to both counts of the counterclaim and rendered judgment for Tisca as to the counterclaim on the basis of the attorney referee\u2019s findings of fact. Tisca appealed and Robin Hill cross appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>\u00a7 4023, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 65-1, and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The central issue in Tisca\u2019s appeal is whether Juillet\u2019s deposition was properly admissible under Practice Book \u00a7 248 (1) (d) (2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Robin Hill argues that the attorney referee\u2019s application of \u00a7 248 was a matter of law. Tisca claims that the attorney referee\u2019s finding that Tisca did not procure the absence from trial of its own witness is a finding of fact that the trial court cannot reject except in rare circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">The admissibility of a deposition into evidence under \u00a7 248 is a ruling on evidence that may be reviewed by the trial judge on an objection to the acceptance of the report. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 440 and 443, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7\u00a7 19-14 and 19-17. The trial court in such an instance is the effective arbiter of the law. <em>Seal </em>Audio, <em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>199 Conn. 496, 510, 508 A.2d 415 (1986). If the attorney referee\u2019s ruling was not \u201clegally and logically correct,\u201d the trial court may reject the report. <em>Elgar </em>v. <em>Elgar, </em>238 Conn. 839, 845, 679 A.2d 937 (1996); see Practice Book \u00a7 443, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 19-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">We conclude that the trial court improperly reversed the attorney referee\u2019s granting of the motion to admit the deposition because it applied an incorrect definition of \u201cprocure.\u201d A party does not procure the absence of its own witness merely by failing to produce the witness at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">Although our case law contains no definition of \u201cprocure\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 248, \u201c[wjhere a state rule is similar to a federal rule we review the federal case law to assist our interpretation of our rule. <em>Arduini </em>v. <em>Automobile Ins. Co. of Hartford, </em>23 Conn. App. 585, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>589, 583 A.2d 152 (1990).\u201d <em>Pelarinos </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>34 Conn. App. 726, 730, 643 A. 2d 894, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 909, 648 A.2d 155 (1994). Rule 32 (a) (3) (B) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a deposition is admissible if a deponent is more than 100 miles away \u201cunless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition.\u201d Federal case law supports Tisca\u2019s position in this case, and we adopt the view of the federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The federal courts have consistently held that a party\u2019s offer of his or her own deposition does not in itself indicate that the party had procured his or her own absence. See generally 7 J. Moore, Federal Practice (3d Ed. 1997) \u00a7 32.24 [4] and [5].<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>227 F.2d 490, 492-93 (2d Cir. 1955), the Second Circuit Court of Appeals held that the plaintiffs deposition, her sole proof at trial, should be admissible. In that case, Judge Clark, who played a major role in the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, observed that then rule 26 would not require a plaintiff to \u201clive in [an expensive jurisdiction] . . . awaiting the uncertain call of a case for trial . . . .\u201d Id., 493. He pointed to <em>Hyam </em>v. <em>American Export Lines, Inc., </em>213 F.2d 221, 223 (2d Cir. 1954), where Judge Harlan, later to become Justice Harlan, stated: \u201cThe federal courts are open to foreign suitors as to others, and procedural rules are not to be construed in such fashion as to impose conditions on litigants which in their practical effect amount to a denial of jurisdiction.\u201d In <em>Weiss </em>v. <em>Weiner, </em>10 F.R.D. 387,389 (D. Md. 1950), the District Court for the District of Maryland admitted the defendant\u2019s deposition in his absence. The court interpreted the word \u201cprocured\u201d to mean that \u201ca party had collusively instigated or induced a witness to remove himself from being subjected to a subpoena to testify at the trial, or at least had unfairly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>and for an improper purpose deliberately absented himself shortly before the trial from the jurisdiction so he could not be examined.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Id. In <em>Houser </em>v. <em>Snap-On Tools Corp., </em>202 F. Sup. 181, 189 (D. Md. 1962), the court held that \u201c[a] corporate party may take the depositions of its officers as witnesses, and use these at trial.\u201d The court stated that \u201cprocuring absence and doing nothing to facilitate presence are quite different things . . . .\u201d Id. In <em>Glaverbel Societe Anonyme </em>v. <em>Northlake Marketing &amp; Supply, Inc., </em>139 F.R.D. 368, 369-70 (N.D. Ind. 1991), the court used a totality of the circumstances test in holding that a corporate party may use depositions of its overseas employees in lieu of the employees\u2019 appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The federal courts have consistently held that the absence alone from trial of a plaintiffs own employee does not indicate procurement. \u201cThere is a distinction between procuring the absence of a witness and doing nothing to facilitate his or her presence.\u201d 7 J. Moore, supra, \u00a7 32.24 [4] [a]. We therefore hold that the word \u201cprocured\u201d in the context of Practice Book \u00a7 248 \u201cconnotes that a party has collusively instigated or induced a witness to remove himself or herself from being amenable to testify at trial, or at least has unfairly and for an improper purpose deliberately arranged for the witness to absent himself or herself from the jurisdiction to preclude being examined.\u201d Id., \u00a7 32.24 [4] [b]. We conclude that the circumstances of this case and the subordinate findings of fact support the attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>referee\u2019s ruling. Tisca neither \u201ccollusively instigated\u201d nor \u201cinduced a witness to remove himself\u2019 from the jurisdiction to preclude being examined. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Tisca is a French company, and Juillet is from France. Juillet testified at his deposition that none of the people, other than himself, who could testify at trial on Tisca\u2019s behalf were available. He stated that his father, the former proprietor of Tisca, was retired and that B. Gres-sard, Tisca\u2019s business manager, spoke poor English, thereby making it impossible for Tisca to send an employee other than Juillet who could testify in English. Juillet was to be in Europe on business at the time of trial, and Tisca had attempted without success to obtain a trial date when Juillet would be in the United States. Robin Hill neither made nor attempted to make a showing of Tisca\u2019s bad faith or Tisca\u2019s efforts to avoid cross-examination of Juillet. Here, a deposition was held, during Juillet\u2019s visit to the United States, in the presence of Lindholm and counsel for Robin Hill, who subjected Juillet to extensive cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Juillet\u2019s deposition testimony was offered mainly to identify and admit as a business record Tisca\u2019s file containing its documents relating to Robin Hill. He also testified that Tisca did not install carpets. Robin Hill suggests that the attorney referee should have heard Juillet testify personally in order to judge his credibility. Robin Hill, however, never made this argument before the attorney referee. Instead, it attacked only Juillet\u2019s lack of personal knowledge of Tisca\u2019s file on the basis that Juillet had not been employed by Tisca at the time the parties entered into the contract. The attorney referee found that Juillet was sufficiently familiar with Tisca\u2019s file to testify about its contents. The attorney referee could properly determine the extent of Juillet\u2019s personal knowledge from his testimony from the deposition, during which Juillet was extensively cross-examined on precisely this issue. This single ground for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>attacking credibility is insufficient to mandate Juillet\u2019s presence before the attorney referee. Under these circumstances, the trial court incorrectly determined that Juillet\u2019s deposition should have been excluded from evidence. Because Robin Hill raised other claims in its objection to the attorney referee\u2019s report, the case must be remanded for consideration of those remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">We must also determine whether the trial court correctly rendered judgment for Tisca as to Robin Hill\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">The attorney referee\u2019s findings amply support her conclusion regarding the first count of the counterclaim that Robin Hill failed to satisfy the burden of proving a breach of contract. Lindholm claimed that although the carpet installers notified him of a gash in the carpet, he nevertheless ordered them to install it. Tisca made repeated attempts to obtain payment of its invoice from October, 1989, to March, 1990. When Lindholm finally contacted Tisca about the alleged tear, it was eight months after Tisca had sent the company\u2019s first invoice. Tisca offered a 10 percent reduction of the price, which Lindholm rejected. Tisca also offered to send a qualified inspector to the site. Although Lindholm was contacted by someone from New York concerning evaluation of the damage, this evaluation never took place. Finally, Lindholm was to have provided photographs of the damage to Tisca, but he never did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">At trial, Robin Hill did not offer into evidence any photographs of the damage or testimony from other persons who might have obseived the damage. The attorney referee found that Lindholm\u2019s testimony, in and of itself, lacked sufficient credibility to establish his claim of damage to the goods. It properly belongs to the finder of fact to assess the credibility of witnesses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number><em>Vesce </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>185 Conn. 328, 335, 441 A.2d 556 (1981). The attorney referee\u2019s findings of fact were not clearly erroneous and amply support a finding for Tisca as to the breach of contract count of Robin Hill\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">With regard to the second count of the counterclaim, the attorney referee\u2019s finding that the contract for carpet did not include installation is amply supported in the record. Tisca\u2019s estimate for and description of the goods does not mention any installation, nor was the installation charged or noted on the invoice. Juillet testified that Tisca is not in the business of installation of its goods. Nothing in Tisca\u2019s file indicates that Tisca was to perform the installation or that it did perform the installation. Lindholm testified that he believed that installation was included in the purchase price, but the attorney referee found that there was \u201cabsolutely no documentary evidence\u201d to support such a belief and that Lindholm \u201cwas not convincing\u201d on this issue. Since the Home Improvement Act exempts from its purview sellers who do not install the goods, the judgment of the trial court as to the second count of the counterclaim is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">The judgment is reversed only as to the complaint and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion; the judgment is affirmed as to the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b743-10\"> Practice Book \u00a7 248 (1) (d), now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 13-31 (a) (4), provides in relevant part: \u201cThe deposition of a witness other than a person falling within the scope of (b) hereof, whether or not a party, may be used by any party for any purpose if the court finds ... 2. that the witness is at a greater distance than thirty miles from the place of trial or hearing, or is out of the state and will not return before the termination of the trial or hearing, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b745-8\"> See footnote 1 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b746-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 20-419 (4) provides in relevant part: \u201c \u2018Home improvement\u2019 does not include . . .
