The defendants successfully moved to strike the plaintiffs complaint on the ground that the plaintiffs contractual right of first refusal did not carry over to its current holdover month-to-month tenancy. We reverse the judgment of the trial court striking the plaintiffs complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">\u201cThe purpose of a motion to strike is to contest . . . the legal sufficiency of the allegations of any complaints ... to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Faulkner </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>240 Conn. 576, 580, 693 A.2d 293 (1997). \u201cIn an appeal from a judgment granting amotion to strike, we operate in accordance with well established principles.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Skuzinski </em>v. <em>Bouchard Fuels, Inc., </em>240 Conn. 694, 696, 694 A.2d 788 (1997). \u201c[W]e must take as true the facts alleged in the plaintiffs complaint and must construe the complaint in the manner most favorable to sustaining its legal sufficiency. <em>Sassone </em>v. <em>Lepore, </em>226 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Conn. 773, 780, 629 A.2d 357 (1993); <em>Michaud </em>v. <em>Waw-ruck, </em>209 Conn. 407, 408, 551 A.2d 738 (1988). <em>Waters </em>v. <em>Autuori, </em>236 Conn. 820, 822, 676 A.2d 357 (1996).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>243 Conn. 66, 68, 700 A.2d 655 (1997). \u201cIf facts provable in the complaint would support a cause of action, the motion to strike must be denied.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Faulkner </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>supra, 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">We assume as true the following facts as alleged in the plaintiffs complaint. On March 31,1981, the plaintiff entered into a written lease agreement with Hadknight Associates, the predecessor in title to Sea Shell, for certain real property located in Cheshire, consisting of a movie theater and six stores. The lease agreement defined the term of the lease as a period of five years, beginning April 1,1981, and ending March 31,1986. The lease provided that the plaintiff had the option to extend the term of the lease for an additional five year period. If the plaintiff remained in possession of the premises after that time, the lessor could elect to treat the tenancy as a month-to-month tenancy. Specifically, paragraph twenty, which governed the month-to-month tenancy, provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]n the event that the Tenant shall remain in the demised premises after the expiration of the term of this lease without having executed a new written lease with the Landlord, such holding over shall not constitute a renewal or extension of this lease. . . . [T]he Landlord may elect, at its option, to construe such holding over as a tenancy from month to month, <em>subject to all the terms and conditions of this lease, except as to duration thereof </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The lease also contained a provision that, upon receipt by the lessor of a bona fide offer from a third party, the plaintiff had a right of first refusal to purchase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>the property on the same terms and conditions. Specifically, paragraph A-6 of the lease addendum<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]n the event that, at any time <em>during the lease term, </em>Landlord shall receive a bona fide offer from any person to purchase the [leased] premises . . . Landlord shall give Tenant notice of the price and terms of such an offer and of the intention of the Landlord to accept the same. Tenant shall have the right for 15 days thereafter to purchase the leased premises in its own name . . . for the purchase price and on the terms specified in Landlord\u2019s notice. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) During the first five year term, Had-knight Associates sold the premises to Sea Shell. The plaintiff exercised its option to extend the lease for an additional five year period from April 1, 1986, through March 31, 1991. Upon expiration of this second five year term in 1991, Sea Shell elected to treat the plaintiff as a month-to-month tenant in accordance with the terms of the lease. On March 29, 1996, Sea Shell sold the property to Sand Dollar. The plaintiff was neither notified of the terms of Sand Dollar\u2019s offer nor given an opportunity to purchase the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Thereafter, the plaintiff brought this complaint seeking specific performance of the contract and damages for breach of the contract.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendants moved to strike the plaintiffs complaint for failure to state a cause of action upon which relief could be granted asserting that, as a matter of law, the right of first refusal was limited to the additional five year lease term, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>ended on March 31, 1991. Accordingly, the defendants maintained that the plaintiff did not have a right of first refusal when Sea Shell sold the property to Sand Dollar in 1996. The trial court agreed and granted the defendants\u2019 motions to strike the plaintiffs complaint.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The trial court focused exclusively on paragraph twenty of the lease and paragraph A-6 of the lease addendum in its analysis of whether the plaintiffs right of first refusal existed at the time that Sea Shell had sold the property to Sand Dollar in 1996. The court reasoned that paragraph A-6 \u201cexpressly conditioned\u201d the plaintiffs right of first refusal \u201cupon the landlord\u2019s receiving a bona fide offer to purchase \u2018at any time during the <em>lease term.\u2019\u2019 </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court then determined that the \u201clease term\u201d was limited to the original five year period and the extension of the lease by the plaintiff for an additional five year term, and thus expired in 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The trial court then examined paragraph twenty to determine the status of the month-to-month tenancy. In reconciling paragraphs A-6 and twenty, the court construed the word \u201cterm\u201d used in paragraph A-6 as synonymous with the word \u201cduration\u201d used in paragraph twenty. On the basis of this construction, the court reasoned that because the \u201coffer of purchase did not occur until the termination of the lease and its replacement by a holdover month-to-month tenancy that did not incorporate the duration of the original lease into its terms and conditions, the plaintiff did not have a right of first refusal with respect to any offer of purchase made after March 31, 1991.\u201d In addition, the trial court noted that \u201ca number of other courts have suggested that a purchase option<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or right of first refusal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>does not survive the expiration of the formal lease term and conversion into a holdover month-to-month tenancy.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The plaintiff argues that the trial court improperly granted the defendants\u2019 motion to strike because a factual determination should have been made as to whether the parties intended the right of first refusal to extend to the month-to-month tenancy. The plaintiff claims that the month-to-month tenancy reasonably could be construed as an extension of the lease because it was subject to all the terms and conditions of the lease. The plaintiff asserts that the text of the terms and conditions that applied to the month-to-month tenancy supports a conclusion that the holdover period constituted an extension of the lease, or at the very least, constitutes evidence that the lease is ambiguous. Under the plaintiffs construction, the complaint states a cause of action because the March 31,1996 sale of the property occurred within the \u201clease term\u201d and, accordingly, was subject to the plaintiffs right of first refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The defendants argue that the trial court properly granted the motion to strike because the \u201cclear and unambiguous language\u201d of the lease establishes that the \u201clease term\u201d does not encompass the holdover tenancy and, accordingly, the plaintiffs right of first refusal expired in 1991. The defendants contend that, despite the continuation of the terms and conditions of the lease, the month-to-month tenancy cannot be construed as an extension falling within the \u201clease term,\u201d because paragraph twenty expressly states that \u201csuch holding over shall not constitute a renewal or extension of this lease . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>In construing a written lease, which constitutes a written contract, \u201cthree elementary principles must be kept constantly in mind: (1) The intention of the parties is controlling and must be gathered from the language of the lease in the light of the circumstances surrounding the parties at the execution of the instrument; (2) the language must be given its ordinary meaning unless a technical or special meaning is clearly intended; (3) the lease must be construed as a whole and in such a manner as to give effect to every provision, if reasonably possible. <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Eagle Lock Co., </em>118 Conn. 658, 663, 174 A. 77 [1934], <em>Ingalls </em>v. <em>Roger Smith Hotels Corporation, </em>143 Conn. 1, 6, 118 A.2d 463 (1955); <em>Lonergan </em>v. <em>Connecticut Food Store, Inc., </em>168 Conn. 122, 128, 357 A.2d 910 (1975); <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>164 Conn. 369, 373-74, 321 A.2d 444 (1973); <em>Perruccio </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>156 Conn. 282, 285, 240 A.2d 912 (1968).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Central New Haven Development Corp. </em>v. <em>La Crepe, Inc., </em>177 Conn. 212, 214-15, 413 A.2d 840 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">We recognize that \u201c \u2018[t]he question whether an option to purchase contained in a lease can be exercised by a tenant during an additional term provided for in the lease, has been productive of much difficulty, and has produced many decisions which cannot be reconciled.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ardito </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>29 Del. Ch. 467, 471, 51 A.2d 859 (1947). \u201cLanguage in leases making the option applicable \u2018during the term\u2019 or \u2018during the existence\u2019 of the lease is not helpful for this purpose because \u2018term\u2019 may be used with reference to both the original term and to extensions and renewals.\u201d 2 M. Friedman, Leases (4th Ed. 1997) \u00a7 15.4, p. 973. \u201c \u2018It seems to be generally agreed that it depends upon the intention of the parties to be gathered from the lease itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ardito </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>supra, 471. \u201cIntent is a question of fact.\u201d <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Costello, </em>139 Conn. 690, 695, 96 A.2d 755 (1953); see <em>Didriksen </em>v. <em>Havens, </em>136 Conn. 41, 48, 68 A.2d 163 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>(1949). \u201c[I]ntention is to be determined from the language used, the circumstances, the motives of the parties and the purposes which they sought to accomplish.\u201d <em>Klein v. Chatfield, </em>166 Conn. 76, 80, 347 A.2d 58 (1974). A determination of contractual intent ordinarily presents a question of fact for the ultimate fact finder, although where the language is clear and unambiguous, it becomes a question of law for the court. <em>Water &amp; Way Properties </em>v. <em>Colt\u2019s Mfg. Co., </em>230 Conn. 660, 667, 646 A.2d 143 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Mindful of these principles, we examine the relevant lease provisions in the present case. Paragraph twenty provides in pertinent part that the month-to-month tenancy is \u201csubject to all the terms and conditions of this lease, except as to duration thereof . . . .\u201d Paragraph A-6 provides that the right of first refusal is triggered by a bona fide offer made \u201cat any time during the lease term <em>. . . .\u201d </em>Although paragraph twenty states that the holdover tenancy does not constitute an extension, it also states that during this period the plaintiff is subject to all the terms and conditions of the lease, including the obligations to pay rent, make necessary repairs and replacements, and maintain liability and property insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The defendants argue that had the parties intended that the holdover tenancy be an extension of the lease that incorporated the right of first refusal, they could have so drafted. They point to the text of paragraph A-1 as support for this proposition. Paragraph A-l, which the defendants concede applies to the holdover period, states that the tenant shall pay as additional rent 50 percent of any increase in real estate taxes and fire and extended coverage insurance \u201c[djuring the term of this lease <em>and any extension or renewal period . . . .\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>The terms of a lease may not be conclusive as to whether an extension exists and in that case, \u201cdisregarding labels and relying on the expectations of the parties ... is the proper approach.\u201d 49 Am. Jur. 2d 156, Landlord and Tenant \u00a7 143 (1995); see <em>Carrano </em>v. <em>Shoor, </em>118 Conn. 86, 93, 171 A. 17 (1934); <em>Blanch </em>v. <em>Kimland Realty Co., </em>122 Conn. 317, 318-19, 189 A. 176 (1937) (provision may be construed as extension of lease although it is called renewal). The text of paragraph A-l, to which the defendants direct our attention, does not necessarily support their argument that the month-to-month tenancy was not an extension. By its own terms, paragraph A-l applies to an extension of the lease, and arguably was intended to apply to the holdover period.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">We turn next to the text of the other terms and conditions contained in the lease to ascertain the language used to indicate their possible applicability to the holdover tenancy. Unlike paragraph A-l, paragraphs A-4, A-5 and A-8 do not contain the phrase \u201cany extension or renewal period\u201d nor were they consistently drafted, yet all were susceptible of an intention by both parties to apply to the month-to-month tenancy. Paragraph A-4 provides that the \u201c[tjenant will, at all times <em>during the </em>term\u201d provide liability insurance for the leased premises. (Emphasis added.) Paragraph A-5 provides that the tenant must maintain fire insurance \u201c[f]or as long as <em>this Lease shall continue in effect. . . </em>.\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.) Paragraph A-8 provides that the landlord will repair if the premises are partially damaged by fire <em>\u201cduring said term </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Our review of the language of these other provisions that the defendants admit might apply to the holdover tenancy leads us to conclude that the language is not definitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Finally, we are unpersuaded by the case law cited by the defendants.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although these cases do conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>that a right of first refusal does not extend to a holdover tenancy, in general they were not decided in the same procedural posture as was the present case in which the sole issue was whether the complaint stated a legally sufficient cause of action. The only exception is <em>Andreula </em>v. <em>Slovak Gymnastic Union Sokol Assembly No. 223, </em>140 N.J. Eq. 171, 53 A.2d 191 (1947), which was decided in a procedural posture similar to the present case without a determination of the parties\u2019 intent. In <em>Andreula, </em>the Court of Errors and Appeals of New Jersey affirmed the dismissal of the plaintiffs action seeking the enforcement of a right of first refusal. Id., 174. The court reasoned that the purchase option could not be enforced because \u201c[t]here [was] no criterion or standard [in the lease] establishing] by which the price may be determined with certainty . . . .\u201d Id., 173. As further justification for the dismissal of the complaint, the court stated that as a matter of law, \u201c[a]n option to purchase contained in a written lease cannot be exercised after the expiration of the written lease by a tenant holding over since it is a collateral contract, independent of the lease.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Id., 174. That conclusion, however, is inconsistent with <em>Didriksen </em>v. <em>Havens, </em>supra, 136 Conn. 41, in which this court considered whether an option to purchase continued as an extension of the lease. The court recognized \u201cthat the weight of authority and the Connecticut rule favor the continuance of the option to purchase\u201d; id., 45; and concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>that the option to purchase was an integral part of a lease, inseparably connected to the lease, and supported by \u201c \u2018common and indivisible consideration.\u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">In view of the equivocal language of the provisions applicable to the month-to-month tenancy and the absence of definitive language excluding the right of first refusal during the holdover tenancy, we are persuaded that the lease is ambiguous with respect to the parties\u2019 intent to limit the right of first refusal to the five year lease periods.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cBearing in mind our responsibility to construe the complaint \u2018in the manner most favorable to sustaining its legal sufficiency\u2019 <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Konover, </em>210 Conn. 150, 156, 553 A.2d 1138 (1989); we conclude that the plaintiffs allegations that the defendants failed to provide it with a right of first refusal state a cause of action that is legally sufficient to have survived a motion to strike. See <em>Gressitt </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>187 Md. 586, 591-92, 51 A.2d 159 (1947) (complaint alleging option to purchase carried over to holdover tenancy not demurrable).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-9\"> The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 65-1, and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b292-6\"> The addendum was executed as part of the lease.
