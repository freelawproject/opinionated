We conclude that, in the circumstances of this case, such an injury is compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">The claimant, Czeslaw Herman, filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits for injuries that he allegedly had received, immediately after his discharge from employment, as a result of retrieving a box containing his personal tools from the loading dock of his former employer, the respondent Sherwood Industries, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Inc. (Sherwood).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ruling on the basis of stipulated facts, the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the sixth district (commissioner) decided that, at the time of the claimant\u2019s injury, he was on Sherwood\u2019s premises \u201cwithin the course of his employment.\u201d On appeal, however, the compensation review board (board) reversed, concluding that the claimant was ineligible for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The claimant appealed to the Appellate Court and we transferred his appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 65-1, and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We reverse the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">There is no factual dispute. For nine years, Sherwood had employed the claimant as a machinist. During his employment, the claimant kept some of his own tools at Sherwood\u2019s place of business to supplement those supplied by Sherwood.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">On July 8, 1994, Sherwood terminated the claimant\u2019s employment. On the afternoon of the same day, the claimant attended a termination meeting at Sherwood\u2019s personnel office. At that meeting, Sherwood\u2019s personnel officer conducted an exit interview and gave the claimant a layoff slip and a copy of an exit interview check list. Also at the termination meeting, the personnel officer informed the claimant that he could retrieve his personal tool box from the Sherwood loading dock, where it had been placed by Sherwood\u2019s foreman. Thereafter, in order to retrieve his tool box, the claimant was escorted from the personnel office to the loading dock, which stands about four to five feet high. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>claimant alleges that he suffered a lumbar spine injury while he was lifting his tool box off the loading dock.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">On appeal to this court, the claimant challenges, on two grounds, the board\u2019s determination of his ineligibility for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. He argues that: (1) his injury arose in the course of his employment with Sherwood as that term is defined by \u00a7 31-275 (1) and our case law; and (2) that his case is factually distinguishable from the decision of the Appellate Court in <em>Fulco </em>v. <em>Norwich Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>27 Conn. App. 800, 609 A.2d 1034 (1992), appeal dismissed, 226 Conn. 404, 627 A.2d 931 (1993). Sherwood disputes these contentions and urges us to recognize and implement a general legislative policy, manifested specifically by the 1993 enactment of \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (i) and (iii),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that the definition of \u201cscope of employment\u201d must be construed narrowly. We agree with the arguments presented by the claimant and are unpersuaded by Sherwood\u2019s policy argument in the present context.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The parties do not contest the underlying principle of workers\u2019 compensation law that we must apply to the facts of this case. A claimant who asserts that he or she is entitled to workers\u2019 compensation bears the burden of proving that the injury: (1) arose out of the employment; and (2) occurred in the course of the employment within the meaning of \u00a7 31-275 (1). <em>McNamara </em>v. <em>Hamden, </em>176 Conn. 547, 550, 398 A.2d 1161 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>(1979);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> see also <em>Mazzone </em>v. <em>Connecticut Transit Co., </em>240 Conn. 788, 792, 694 A.2d 1230 (1997). \u201cThe former requirement relates to the origin and cause of the accident, while the latter requirement \u2018relates to the time, place and [circumstance] of the accident.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mazzone </em>v. <em>Connecticut Transit Co., </em>supra, 792-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">In this case, as in both <em>McNamara </em>and <em>Mazzone, </em>the claimant, Sherwood and the board have focused on the second part of the test. \u201cAlthough the parties repeatedly recite both parts of the test in support of their respective arguments, their unelaborated references to the \u2018arising out of language are merely incidental to the issue that lies at the crux of their dispute, and at the heart of the commissioner\u2019s and the board\u2019s decisions, namely, whether the claimant was \u2018in the course of his employment\u2019 at the time of his injury. \u2018Thus, we will confine our discussion and review to that element in deciding this case.\u2019 \u201d Id., 793.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">An injury occurs in the course of the employment if it takes place: (1) within the period of the employment; (2) at a place the employee reasonably may be; and (3) while the employee reasonably is fulfilling the duties of the employment or doing something incidental to it. Id., 791. Only the first and third factors of the \u201ccourse of employment\u201d test are at issue in this case. The second prong of the test is satisfied by the undisputed fact that Sherwood\u2019s loading dock was a place where Sherwood reasonably could expect to find its employees.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, we need decide only the remaining issues, namely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>whether: (1) the claimant\u2019s alleged posttermination injury occurred within the period of his employment with Sherwood; and (2) the claimant\u2019s removal of his tool box was an activity incidental to his employment with Sherwood. Contrary to the board, we conclude that, in the circumstances of this case, both of these issues should be decided in favor of the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The first issue that we must resolve is whether the claimant\u2019s alleged injury occurred within the period of his employment by Sherwood. In determining that it did not do so, the board relied principally on a decision of the Appellate Court. <em>Fulco </em>v. <em>Norwich Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>supra, 27 Conn. App. 800. In addition, it concluded that the enactment of \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (iii) manifested a legislative policy favoring a narrow construction of the \u201cscope of employment\u201d period. Finally, it observed that ineligibility for workers\u2019 compensation did not leave the claimant without a remedy because he could seek damages by filing a personal injury action sounding in negligence. We are persuaded that <em>Fulco </em>v. <em>Norwich Roman Catholic Diocesan </em>Corp., supra, 800, does not control this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\"><em>Fulco </em>v. <em>Norwich Roman Catholic Diocesan </em>Corp., supra, 27 Conn. App. 800, arose in the context of a plaintiffs tort action claiming negligent infliction of emotional distress arising from the manner in which his employment had been terminated by the defendant. The Appellate Court determined that the plaintiffs tort claim could proceed because it was not barred by the exclusivity provision of the act. Id., 807. The court noted that \u201cthe plaintiff alleged that his emotional distress arose out of his discharge, not out of the conditions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>his employment. Thus, the earliest time that the plaintiffs injury could have arisen was immediately after his discharge. It is impossible for the injury to have arisen during the period of his employment because his employment necessarily terminated before the alleged injury arose.\u201d Id., 808.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The factual circumstances of the physical injury allegedly sustained by the claimant distinguish it from the circumstances of <em>Fulco. </em>We are not adjudicating the validity of a claim for compensation because of a delayed psychological reaction to the fact of discharge from employment. The claimant in this case was retrieving tools used on the job from the employer\u2019s work site at a time that was in close temporal proximity to the termination of his employment. If we were to conclude that \u201cthe period of employment\u201d ends abruptly and categorically at the instant of discharge from employment, we would be doing violence to the humanitarian purpose of the act. See <em>Gil </em>v. <em>Courthouse One, </em>239 Conn. 676, 682, 687 A.2d 146 (1997); <em>Weinberg </em>v. <em>ARA Vending Co., </em>223 Conn. 336, 341, 612 A.2d 1203 (1992); <em>Dubois </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>222 Conn. 62, 67, 607 A.2d 431 (1992). Pursuant to the act and our decisions, the period of time during which the claimant allegedly was injured does not deprive him of the protection of his workers\u2019 compensation safety net.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Authority from other jurisdictions supports the conclusion that we have reached. Courts around the country have held that \u201can employee who has been discharged and sustains injury while in the process of leaving the job site is still an employee for the purpose of compensation coverage.\u201d <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Hizer, </em>73 Cal. App. 3d 499, 504-505, 140 Cal. Rptr. 790 (1977). In the case of a roofer who was injured falling off of a plank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>walkway, immediately after he had been discharged, the Oklahoma Supreme Court concluded that the roofer was entitled to workers\u2019 compensation. The court noted that \u201cthe employee generally is held to be within the course of employment for a reasonable period while he finishes his affairs and leaves the premises.\u201d <em>Leonhardt Enterprises </em>v. <em>Houseman, </em>562 P.2d 515, 518 (Okla. 1977). Similarly, the Oregon Court of Appeals held that an employee was entitled to compensation for an injury incurred when he slipped and fell in the employer\u2019s parking lot while leaving the premises after he had been <em>discharged. Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>97 Or. App. 500, 502, 776 P.2d 588 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Professor Arthur Larson has discussed the rationale for the rule adopted by these courts. He writes that \u201c[c]ompensation coverage is not automatically and instantaneously terminated by the firing or quitting of the employee.\u201d 2 A. Larson &amp; L. Larson, Workers\u2019 Compensation (1997) \u00a7 26.10, p. 5-329. Rather, \u201c[h]e or she is deemed to be within the course of employment for a reasonable period while winding up his or her affairs and leaving the premises.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Accordingly, we are persuaded that a claimant is entitled to workers\u2019 compensation for an injury that was incurred while leaving the job site immediately after the termination of his or her employment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>facts of this case, this claimant\u2019s injury occurred during the period of his employment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">We next consider whether the claimant\u2019s alleged injury occurred in the course of an activity incidental to his employment. In <em>Mazzone </em>v. <em>Connecticut Transit Co., </em>supra, 240 Conn. 791,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we stated that employer-sanctioned activities are incidental to employment if they occur on the employer\u2019s premises and if they contribute to the benefit and convenience of both the employer and the employee. Id., 795. Thus, we concluded that an employee eating lunch was engaged in a compensable activity incidental to his employment. Id. We reasoned that \u201c[a]cts of ministration by a servant to himself, such as . . . relieving his hunger . . . performance of which while at work are reasonably necessary to his health and comfort, are incidents to his employment . . . though they are only indirectly conducive to the purpose of the employment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. In particular, we noted that the mutually beneficial activity at issue had been <em>permitted </em>by the employer. Id., 795 n.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">In light of this authority, the claimant has demonstrated factually that he was engaged in an activity incidental to his employment. With Sherwood\u2019s acquiescence, he kept his tools at Sherwood\u2019s premises for the mutual benefit of both parties, but principally in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>to perform work for Sherwood. In accordance with instructions from Sheiwood\u2019s personnel officer, he undertook to retrieve these tools from the Sherwood loading dock. Sherwood has not argued and the record does not indicate that Sherwood presented him with any other alternative for regaining his tools, such as having them delivered to his home at Sherwood\u2019s expense. On this factual record, we conclude that the claimant\u2019s retrieval of his tools was an activity incidental to his employment within the meaning of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Finally, we address briefly Sherwood\u2019s contention that, in construing \u201cin the course of his employment,\u201d we must consider the policy implications of the 1993 legislative amendments of the act. Sherwood points specifically to \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (i), which bars compensation for injuries incurred during an employee\u2019s voluntary participation in a social or recreational activity, and to \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (iii), which bars compensation for mental or emotional impairment sustained as a result of demotion or termination. Public Acts 1993, No. 93-228, \u00a7 1. These enactments, it contends, demonstrate the legislature\u2019s intent that a worker\u2019s eligibility for compensation should now be construed narrowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">We disagree with Sherwood\u2019s contention for two reasons. First, as a general matter, the humanitarian and remedial purposes of the act counsel against an overly narrow construction that unduly limits eligibility for workers\u2019 compensation. <em>Gil </em>v. <em>Courthouse </em>One, supra, 239 Conn. 682; <em>Weinberg </em>v. <em>ARA Vending Co., </em>supra, 223 Conn. 341; <em>Dubois </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>supra, 222 Conn. 67. Second, \u201c[a]lthough the parties have called our attention to the public policy implications of this case, the issue presented is, at bottom, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>matter of statutory construction.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>241 Conn. 692, 697, 699 A.2d 52 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The legislative history of Public Acts 1993, No. 93-228 does not illuminate the dispute before us.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The very specificity of the amendments that the legislature chose to adopt counsels against drawing wide-ranging implications from their text. It is telling that, in \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (iii), the legislature excluded only specified kinds of injuries from the category of a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d allegedly resulting from an adverse personnel action, such as dismissal. Although the legislature excluded coverage for \u201ca mental or emotional impairment\u201d resulting from dismissals, it did not address physical injuries arising in the context of an employer\u2019s personnel action. Furthermore, in enacting \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B), the legislature did not narrow the broad definition of \u201cpersonal injury\u201d that is contained in \u00a7 31-275 (16) (A). Accordingly, we adhere to our previous holdings that we do not construe the act to impose limitations on benefits that the act itself does not specify clearly. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 698; <em>Misenti </em>v. <em>International Silver Co., </em>215 Conn. 206, 210, 575 A.2d 690 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">In summation, we conclude that the claimant in this case sustained his alleged injury in the coruse of his employment within the meaning of \u00a7 31-275 (1). Despite Sherwood\u2019s formal termination of his employment, at the time of his accident, he was still within the period of his employment and his conduct in retrieving his tools from Sherwood\u2019s loading dock was incidental to his employment. In light of the facts, the applicable statutory language and our recent decision in <em>Mazzone </em>v. <em>Connecticut Transit Co., </em>supra, 240 Conn. 791, we are unpersuaded by the contrary decision of the board or by Sherwood\u2019s arguments to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>The judgment of the board is reversed and the case is remanded to the board with direction to affirm the decision of the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (1) provides in relevant part: \u201c \u2018Arising out of and in the course of his employment\u2019 means an accidental injury happening to an employee or an occupational disease of an employee originating while he has been engaged in the line of his duty in the business or affairs of the employer upon the employer\u2019s premises, or while engaged elsewhere upon the employer\u2019s business or affairs by the direction, express or implied, of the employer . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b524-7\"> In all the relevant proceedings, the respondents included not only Sherwood but also The Hartford Insurance Group.

Nevertheless, the general principles outlined in that opinion are still applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b526-8\"> At oral argument, Sherwood\u2019s counsel conceded that, following his discharge, the claimant remained on Sherwood\u2019s premises with the status of licensee, and perhaps even had the status of a business invitee.
