J. A. D.,</author>\n<p id=\"A2L\">Retired (temporarily assigned). Defendant was indicted with Primas Johnson, Mildred Commandatore and Anthony Commandatore for various violations of the criminal statutes pertaining to the operation of a lottery. The Commandatores pleaded guilty immediately prior to the beginning of the trial of Bellucci and Johnson under circumstances material to the determination of this appeal, later to be recounted. Bellucci and Johnson were both convicted of working for a lottery and possession of lottery paraphernalia. Bellucci appeals on various grounds of which only two have merit. One is conflict of interest on the part of his trial counsel, and it will compel a reversal and new trial. We deal with the other grounds first.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">On December 13, 1973 a raiding party of undercover detectives attached to the New Jersey State Police Gambling Unit converged on 16-18 Beacon Avenue in Jersey City. The premises were suspected of housing an illegal lottery operation and had been under surveillance for some time.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">At approximately 4:30 p.m. the detectives observed Mildred Commandatore and Primas Johnson in the driveway of 18 Beacon Avenue. They were apprehended after police observed Johnson passing a paper bag to Commandatore. The bag contained lottery slips and $1280.50 in cash. Immediately thereafter, pursuant to a search warrant, the officers entered the kitchen of the premises at 18 Beacon Avenue. Defendant was observed seated at the kitchen table with slips of paper in front of him and a red pen in his hand. In close proximity to defendant on the table was an adding machine, a cellophane bag containing slips <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>of paper and scattered slips of paper with names and amounts of money written on them.. Sixteen slips of paper containing numbers and initials were seized from the table at which defendant was sitting. Seized from the table was $4-50, and $4fi6 was taken from defendant\u2019s person. The police placed defendant under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">An expert witness for the State testified that much of the evidence seized in the raid on 18 Beacon Street was unlawful lottery paraphernalia. The witness opined that 18 Beacon Avenue was \u201cbeing used as an office in the illegal lottery operation\u201d and that defendant was \u201can employee of the illegal lottery operation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">At trial defendant disclaimed any connection with the lottery operation, although he was familiar with it, explaining he was present at the time of the raid only as a visitor to Mrs. Commandatore preliminary to an intended call on his friend, Mrs. Commandatore\u2019s brother, who was a patient at a nearby hospital. She had been sitting with him at the table, but had excused herself momentarily just before the police entered the room. There was copious evidence of Johnson\u2019s participation in the operation of the lottery along with the Commandatores.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Defendant urges that the prosecutor made improper and prejudicial remarks in his summation which deprived him of a fair trial. The comments here objected to concern (1) the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the \u201cclassic Hudson County defense\u201d and (2) his observations respecting the trial tactics of counsel for codefendant Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">In summation, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-10\">The defense in this case when you look at it is really in two parts * * * \u2014 wu can call the first part your basic and your classic Hudson County defense. It consists of this: <em>* </em>* * it consists of this as being brought out with regard to each of the Defendants, with regard to Mr. Bellueei that he lived in Hudson County his entire life <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>but for two days, * * Sympathy or belief that these people are from Hudson Oounty; these are our buddies. He pointed out I\u2019m from Hudson Oounty, I live in Jersey City. We\u2019re all Hudson Oounty people here. It\u2019s a certain image, a certain view that a lot of people do like to have about Hudson County and maybe you believe it. Maybe you believe the view that because these people are from Hudson Oounty and the State Troopers are not, therefore, three people can go on violating the law. * *' *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Later in his summation the prosecutor again referred to Hudson County. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">I asked you as people who have taken an oath to make a determination on the facts, to have the intelligence to be able to see what\u2019s going on in this courtroom, to have the pride in your county not to believe that simply because people come from Hudson Oounty that they can go around committing crimes and that is an image you want and to have the self respect for yourselves and for the oath you took to make a proper determination on the facts of whether a crime was actually committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Counsel for the defendant objected to these comments at side bar and demanded either a mistrial or a curative instruction. The court denied defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial but indicated that it would \u201ctake care of the Hudson County crack.\u201d Although the court said nothing to the jury in reference to' these allusions beyond remarking \u201cthere\u2019s only two people on trial here and not Hudson County,\u201d we do not regard the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, although inappropriate, as warranting reversal. In effect, he was saying nothing more than that the jury should not acquit defendants merely because they and the jurors were fellow citizens of Hudson County. <em>Cf. State v. </em>Kenny, 138 <em>N. J. Super. </em>94 (App. Div. 1974), aff\u2019d 68 <em>N. J. </em>17 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"A55\">Complaint is also registered to the prosecutor\u2019s references to the \u201ctheatrical\u201d defense of the co defendant Johnson by his counsel Mr. McAlevy. Again, we find the comments not exemplary, but also not prejudicial, particularly since they did not concern this defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Defendant objects to interjections by the court and the prosecutor during his cross-examination of the State\u2019s investigating officer which he claims left the implication that defendant was involved in a similar offense on a subsequent occasion. The assertion is ill-founded. The interjections were appropriate, being prompted by defendant\u2019s examining the officer as to whether he had \u201cever in [his] life\u201d seen defendant write or take a numbers bet, receive money, etc. The episode did not remotely warrant a mistrial, as requested by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">During the cross-examination of a state trooper testifying for the State regarding the undercover surveillance of codefendant Johnson, the latter\u2019s counsel requested permission for all counsel and the witness to visit one of the surveillance sites in Jersey City in order to take photographs. The request was unopposed by the State and joined in by counsel for defendant. Absent an objection by the State, the court permitted this \u201cnovel\u201d procedure and excused the jury for the weekend. Defendant now contends that the court\u2019s sanction of this procedure was plain error in that it distracted the jury from the central issue in the case, <em>i. e,., </em>the guilt or innocence of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">lYe discern no error whatsoever, plain or otherwise, especially since defendant\u2019s counsel joined in the request and must have thought the procedure would be helpful to defendant at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">Prior to trial defendant moved pursuant to <em>B. </em>3:15-2(b) for severence of his trial from that of his coindictees. It was contended that the surveillance evidence, which would be highly probative of the guilt of defendant\u2019s coindictees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>would prejudice Ms defense as he was not involved in the surveillance. The State countered with the fact that defendant was found at the time of the raid seated at the Mtchen table surrounded by assorted lottery paraphernalia. It argued that in the interest of economy and efficiency these jointly indicted defendants should be tried together. The court agreed and held that the particular circumstances of this case did not warrant a severance. Defendant now contends that the denial of severance constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"> It is well settled that the grant or denial of a motion for severance is entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>R. </em>3:15-2; <em>State v. Manney, </em>26 <em>N. J. </em>362, 368 (1958); <em>State v. Whipple, </em>156 <em>N. J. Super. </em>46, 51 (App. Div. 1978). Denial of such a motion will not result in a reversal unless there is a showing of prejudice or a mistaken exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>State v. Morales, </em>138 <em>N. J. Super. </em>225, 229 (App. Div. 1975); <em>State v. Moriarty, </em>133 <em>N. J. Super. </em>563, 569 (App. Div. 1975), certif. den. 68 <em>N. J. </em>172 (1975). Here the substantive offenses charged against the codefendants all arose out of the same criminal transaction and the initial joinder was proper. <em>State v. Tapia, </em>113 <em>N. J. Super. </em>322, 328 (App. Div. 1971); <em>State v. Kropke, </em>123 <em>N. J. Super. </em>413, 418 (Law Div. 1973). The issue therefore is whether defendant was prejudiced by the joinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">It has been recognized that where a significant portion of evidence to be adduced at a joint trial is admissible only as to one defendant, the probability of harm to the other may be so great that the trial judge should, as a matter of fair practice, exercise Ms discretion in favor of a severance. <em>State v. Hall, </em>55 <em>N. J. Super. </em>441, 451 (App. Div. 1959). In the present case there was considerable testimony concerning the undercover surveillance conducted by the State Police which had no probative weight as to defendant\u2019s guilt, thus raising the possibility of the jurors inferring defendant\u2019s guilt by association. However, this is a hazard inhering in all joint trials and is therefore not in itself sufficient to justify a sev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>erance, provided that by proper instructions to the jury the separate status of the codefendants can be maintained. <em>State v. Freeman, </em>61 <em>N. J. </em>66, 68 (1973). Here the trial court repeatedly instructed the jurors to consider the evidence as to defendant separately in passing upon guilt. There is no reason to believe the jury did not comply with these instructions. Moreover, the potential harm to defendant was substantially reduced by the elimination of the Commandatores as defendants at trial by virtue of their pleas of guilty. See <em>State v. Mayberry, </em>52 <em>N. J. </em>413, 421-423 (1968), <em>cert. </em>den. <em>sub nom. Mayberry v. New Jersey, </em>393 <em>U. S. </em>1043, 89 <em>S. Ct. </em>673, 21 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 593 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">We find no basis to conclude that the denial of the motion to sever was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Defendant now asserts, for the first time, that his conviction of possession of lottery memoranda (count three) merged with the conviction of working for an illegal lottery .(count two), and that it was error for the trial judge to sentence defendant separately on both convictions. He asks this court to vacate the judgment of conviction and sentence on count three. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">In <em>State v. Snow, </em>77 <em>N. J. </em>459, 466 (1978), it was held that when \u201cthe very same lottery slips as [support]\u201d a charge of possession of lottery slips \u201c[form] the basis\u201d for a charge of working for a lottery, a conviction of the former is to be merged into a conviction of the latter. We regard the principle of the <em>Snow </em>decision as applicable here. When apprehended, defendant was found in constructive possession of lottery slips and memoranda as well as other implements of an ordinary lottery enterprise. Conviction of working for a lottery obviously depended to a substantial degree upon the evidence of possession of the lottery papers. Consequently the lottery possession offense should be regarded as \u201can integral part\u201d of the scheme of conducting, or \u201cworking for,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>a lottery, and should merge into the latter offense. <em>Cf. State v. </em>Best, 70 <em>N. J. </em>56, 63 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">For purposes of any further prosecution of defendant after the reversal ordered hereinafter, defendant may be convicted of only one of the offenses (working for a lottery or possession of lottery slips) if the proofs at a new trial are as presented at this trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">YI</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Defendant contends that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel in that his trial attorney and the trial attorney for codefendant Johnson were partners in the practice of law. On our own motion, we have expanded this point to consider the effect of the circumstance that John P. Russell, Esq., defendant\u2019s attorney, was also.the attorney for the coindictees Anthony and Mildred Oommandatore immediately prior to their entering pleas of guilty and had advised them with respect to that step (although substituted counsel appeared for them at the taking of the pleas). Counsel have been afforded an opportunity to argue to the point. We conclude that all of these circumstances, taken together, amount to a ease of conflict of interest on the part of Mr. Russell which requires the reversal of defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">At the trial herein the codefendant Johnson was represented by Dennis McAlevy, Esq., law partner -of Mr. Russell. The fact of the partnership of the lawyers was mentioned before the jury in the course of colloquy over an objection to evidence being offered by the State. As indicated above, there was plenary evidence of Johnson\u2019s guilt. In defendant\u2019s case there was only his presence at the table in the kitchen on the isolated occasion of the raid. The jury might well have surmised, to defendant\u2019s detriment, that he would not have engaged a partner of the lawyer who was representing the apparently guilty codefendant Johnson if defendant were innocent of criminal association with the latter. While this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>circumstance alone might not warrant a reversal, taken in combination with the other aspect of conflict of interest on the part of Mr. Eussell, it produces an aggregate of potentiality of prejudice to defendant which commands reversal. <em>State v. Land, </em>73 <em>N. J. </em>24 (1977); <em>State v. Boone, </em>154 <em>N. J. Super. </em>36, 39 (App. Div. 1977); <em>State v. Ebinger, </em>97 <em>N. J. Super. </em>23 (App. Div. 1967). Although he was represented on the plea proceedings by James A. Galdieri, Esq., the latter referred to a conference preceding the plea proceedings he had had with Mr. Eussell whom he identified \u201cas Mr. Commandatore\u2019s attorney.\u201d It was made clear that Mr. Eussell had reprepresented and advised Mr. Commandatore in reference to attempted plea negotiations and generally as to the advisability of pleading guilty. On Eebruary 1, 1977 Mildred Commandatore, the other coindictee, also pleaded guilty, being also then represented on the record by Mr. Galdieri. Again, it was brought out that this indictee had consulted with and been advised by Mr. Eussell in reference to the matter of pleading guilty. Neither of the Commandatores was sentenced prior to the conclusion of the instant trial. Nor did either testify at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The potentiality for less than thoroughly faithful and undivided attention to defendant\u2019s interests at the trial on the part of Mr. Eussell is obvious. Defendant\u2019s explanation of his presence at the Commandatore home on the incriminating occasion (which for present purposes must be assumed to have been truthful) could have been supported by calling Mrs. Commandatore, and his innocence of any connection with the lottery operation by calling both Commandatores, as witnesses. But Mr. Eussell, as their prior attorney, had a conflicting interest in not calling them, as such testimony, favorable to this defendant, might have been deemed harmful to their interests in relation to their impending sentencing. Compare the closely analogous situation which impelled a reversal of a conviction in <em>State v. Ebinger, supra </em>(opinion by Justice, then Judge, Sullivan). <em>Cf. In re Cipriano, </em>68 <em>N. J. </em>398 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>There is nothing in this record to indicate, or any claim by the State, that defendant was advised before trial of the conflicting interests of himself and defendant Johnson and of himself and coindictees Oommandatore, and, in consequence, of the conflict of interest on the part of Mr. Russell and its potential for prejudicing his defense. See <em>State v. Land, supra, </em>73 <em>N. J. </em>at 34, 35; <em>State v. Green, </em>129 <em>N. J. Super. </em>157, 164 (App. Div. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">The rule now clearly established in this State, and adumbrated as long ago as 1967 in the <em>Lbinger </em>case, <em>supra, </em>97 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 27, is that in the absence of waiver, if a potential conflict of interest exists, prejudice will be presumed resulting in a determination of violation of the State constitutional provision guaranteeing the assistance of counsel. <em>N. J. Const. </em>(1947), Art. I, par. 10. <em>State v. Land, supra, </em>73 <em>N. J. </em>at 35. If there is to be a retrial in this case, either defendant must be advised by counsel and the trial court of the hazards of representation by Mr. Russell and consent thereto obtained or he must be represented by by different counsel. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
