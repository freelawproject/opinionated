J. Super. 331 </em>(1976).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-6\">We note that in the trial judge\u2019s illustration of the method he established for computing the interim corpus commission in the D-7 trust there is an arithmetic error. The total interim corpus commission allowed for the first 25 years of administration is $33,776.28 and the total allowed for the next 13 years is $31,725. The sum total of these two figures is $65,501 and not $65,601 as appears in the illustration in the court\u2019s opinion, <em>In re Bessemer Trust Company, </em>147 <em>N. J. Super. </em>331, 394 (Ch. Div. 1976). However, the figure of $65,601 is correct, nevertheless, because there is an offsetting mathematical error in the same illustration. The trial court allowed an interim corpus commission of 2% of the amount of the corpus in excess of $1,000,000 for the first 25 years of administration. Two per cent of $318,819 is $6,376.38 and not $6,276.28. The $6,376.38 added to the commissions allowed on the first million dollars resulted in a total interim corpus commission for the first 25 years of $33,876.38, not the $33,776.28 shown in the illustration. Hence the correct amount allowed for the total interim corpus commission in the D-7 trust is $65,601, which amount was incorporated in the supplemental judgment, dated December 21, 1976, entered in the matter entitled <em>Winston Frederick Churchill Guest and Bessemer Trust Company, as Trustees under the Trust Indenture dated August </em>7, <em>1935 made by Diana Guest Sevastopoulo (now Diana Guest Manning) for the benefit of Diana Guest Manning and others, said Trust being known as Trust No. D-7, </em>Plaintiffs, v. <em>Diana Guest Manning, et al., </em>Defendants (Docket No. 02005-49).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
