Relying on the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Philpott v. Essex Cty. Welfare Bd., </em>409 <em>U. S. </em>413, 93 <em>S. Ct. </em>590, 34 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 608 (1973)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, representatives of the Essex County Welfare Board, apparently in accord with the request of Mrs. Gilfone\u2019s daughter, recommended that the proceeds of the Social Security check be set aside and held for Mrs. Gilfone\u2019s burial expenses. The Chief of the Bureau of Claims and Accounts in the Division was of an opposite opinion, maintaining that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-4\">Although this is not considered as unexpended personal incidental funds in excess of $100.00, it is my opinion that this money is income which must be applied towards the patient\u2019s cost of stay while under the Medicaid Program. I do not feel that this can be treated as resources available at the time of determining eligibility, which incidentally can not exceed $1,500.002 in cash, nor do I feel it can be set aside for the patient\u2019s burial expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Following the fair hearing in the Division requested by-Mrs. Gilfone\u2019s daughter, the hearing officer filed his report in which he stated, among other things, that he \u201cdoes not consider the <em>Philpott </em>decision to be applicable to this case.\u201d He reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">First, in <em>Philpott, </em>the recipient was living in the community, not in an institutional setting such as Lena Gilfone. Second, the Welfare Board was prevented from recovering the money because the filing of the Agreement to Reimburse placed them in a creditor status. Once the Welfare Board achieved creditor status, they had the same limitations placed on them as other creditors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">He concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">Since the Commissioner (of Human Services) is required to do all things necessary to secure maximum Federal participation (New Jersey Statutes Annotated, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>30:4D-7), the Hearing Officer considers the Federal law and regulations to require the State to collect all income over the PIE [personal incidental expense] allowance [of S25 per month] and apply it to the cost of nursing home care. To rule otherwise would be contrary to the Hearing Officer\u2019s understanding of the law as it applies to Title XIX.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">And, he affirmed \u201cthe decision of the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services to recover Lena Gilfone\u2019s social security check.\u201d The Acting Director of the Division agreed \u201cwith the Findings of Fact and Conclusions and Recommendations contained in the Hearing Officer\u2019s Report,\u201d and adopted the report in full. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">We reverse. We find no sound basis for the Division\u2019s decision. <em>Philpott </em>is dispositive of the dominant issue raised on this appeal, <em>viz., </em>whether the State is, in the circumstances, entitled to Mrs. Gilfone\u2019s lump sum Social Security check. It is clear that the broad bar imposed by 42 <em>U. S. G. A. </em>\u00a7 407 \u201cagainst the use of any legal process to reach all social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>security -benefits * * * is broad enough to include all claimants, including [as here] a State.\u201d It follows that Mrs. Gilfone and not the Division is entitled to the proceeds of the check. Accordingly, the Division is to make delivery of these funds to her forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">As we previously noted, there is a resource maximum of $1,500 applicable \u201cto individuals in long-term care facilities.\u201d <em>N. J. A. C. </em>10:94-4.42. We also note that participation in the Medicaid program must be \u201cdenied or terminated if the total value of an individual\u2019s countable resources * * * exceeds $1,500.\u201d <em>N. J. A. C. </em>10:9A-4.19. Accordingly, whatever funds remain from the proceeds of Mrs. Gilfone\u2019s lump sum Social Security cheek, after she pays her bills for the month in which the money is paid to her, will become a \u201cresource.\u201d If her total assets then exceed $1,500, she will, while in that posture, either become ineligible for continued Medicaid assistance or apply the excess to the cost of her medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The final agency decision under review is reversed and the matter is remanded to the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The Social Security Act, in \u00a7 407 (42 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7 407), provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">The right of any person to any future payment under this sub-chapter shall not be transferable or assignable, at law or in equity, and none of the moneys paid or payable or rights existing under this subchapter shall be subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process, or to the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">In his opinion for the Court in <em>Philpott </em>Justice Douglas pointed out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-8\">* * * \u00a7 407 does not refer to any \u201cclaim of creditors\u201d; it imposes a broad bar against the use of any legal process to reach all social security benefits. That is broad enough to include all claimants, including a State. [409 <em>U. S. </em>416-417, 93 <em>S. Ct. </em>592, 34 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 611-612]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-9\"><em>2N. J. A. C. </em>10:94-4.42 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-10\">The resource maximum of $1,500 applies to individuals in long-term care facilities. Countable resources held in the institution (for example, trust funds, personal needs accounts) and/or elsewhere are to be applied toward the resource maximum. If the $1,500 resource maximum is exceeded, Medicaid eligibility will cease or the amount of such excess applied toward reimbursement. In the event of such reimbursement, Medicaid eligibility shall con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>tinue so long as all other eligibility criteria are met. The benefits of continued Medicaid eligibility shall be explained to the patient and/or next of kin in such situations.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
