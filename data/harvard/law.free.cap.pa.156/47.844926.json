The respondents filed an answer denying the averments of the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-15\">The answer was sworn to, but, by mistake, the prothonotary did not sign the jurat. Subsequently the court made the following order:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-16\">\u201c And now, Feb. 29, 1892, at the argument of above ease, it appearing to the court that the answer of respondents was duly sworn to and filed, as required by the rules of court and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>within the time fixed by said rules, but that the prothonotary, who administered the oath, had by mistake omitted to affix his signature to the jurat at the time the oath was administered to the respondents, he is now permitted to affix his signature thereto.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-5\">The petitioner excepted to the order.

The property was sold as it was advertised, and there is nothing in the testimony showing any fraud or collusion on the part of the purchaser and other bidders, nor any misconduct on the part of the purchaser and plaintiffs in the writ. The sale was regular and fairly conducted, and the property struck down to the highest bidder.] [1] [There was no impropriety in giving notice of the existence of the mortgage on the property, as it was nothing more than what the record showed. The allegation of the inadequacy of the price, in itself, is insufficient to set aside the sale, as long as the sale is in all respects regular and no fraud is shown to have been practiced.] [2] For these reasons the rule to set aside the sheriff\u2019s sale is discharged at the costs of petitioner.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-8\">No exception was filed to this opinion at this time. After an unsuccessful attempt to control the application of the fund, the following exception is noted for appellant by indorsement on the above opinion: \u201c April 5, 1893, an exception is allowed to the foregoing opinion and order of court nunc pro tunc and bill sealed as of the date of the filing of the opinion.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-9\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1, 2) portions of opinion as above, and (3) order permitting prothonotary to affix his signature to jurat.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b70-10\"><em>J.
