J., it appeared that defendant leased to plaintiff and Edward A. Walker certain premises for the term of five years from August 1,1876. Defendant claimed that after the expiration of the lease the term of the tenancy had been changed. He offered to prove that in 1876 the parties went into possession of the premises in question, under the lease; that they remained in possession under the lease until sometime about the first of October, 1885, when, with the consent of Mrs. Githens, there was a division of the property, and a division of the rent, by which each took one half of the property \u2014 $25.00 per month each \u2014 and that that continued up until September, 1890, and Edward Walker having moved out this lady refused to take the share due by this plaintiff, and asked for the whole.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-6\">The Court: Do you contend that she agreed to take one half of the rent from each in lieu of the other arrangements ?

This was entirely competent. The term under the lease had admittedly expired, but appellant had continued in possession, and the presumption therefore was that he was a tenant from year to year under all the terms of the lease that were aj^plicable. But it was entirely competent for the parties to make a different agreement at any time, and of course for either to prove such new agreement by any proper evidence. The appellant alleged that the lessor had released the joint and several liability of the two tenants for the rent of the whole house, and accepted in place thereof the separate tenancy of each for one half. Even if it be conceded that such an arrangement made during the running of any year would not be binding on the lessor for that year without some new consideration, there can be no question that it would be valid for any subsequent year, and the continuance of the tenant in possession paying the agreed rent would be sufficient consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Appellee\u2019s argument is that as the agreement was not binding at the time it was alleged to be made, for want of consideration, it could not be ratified or renewed subsequently. But this argument overlooks the principle that the agreement was not required to be express. It could be made by tacit understanding, and implied as in any other case from the acts of the parties. And even if an express agreement was made, which was not binding in law, but was supposed to be so by the parties and was carried out by them, and then a new year entered upon under the supposition and intention that it was and should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>be mutually binding, it would be entirely valid. And the jury would be entitled to find that intent from the payment and receipt of rent for one half the house in full of appellant\u2019s debt, and other similar acts. All of the offers of appellant tended to prove the defence set up and should have been admitted. Of course it will be competent for the lessor to show that such receipts if given were for convenience only, but that will raise the issue for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Judgment reversed and venire de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
