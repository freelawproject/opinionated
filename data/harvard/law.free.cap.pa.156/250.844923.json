Greenfield. Defendant\u2019s father, James Corr, furnished building stone, lime and sand for the houses and had a lien for the materials furnished, and also for mason work done by him. Prior to the sale of the houses to plaintiff, defendant, without authority from his father, signed a release of liens, and this release was shown to plaintiff, who, relying upon it, bought the houses. Subsequently James Corr filed a mechanic\u2019s lien and issued a scire facias upon it. At the trial of the scire facias it appeared that defendant had no authority to sign the release. Plaintiff was accordingly compelled to pay the lien, amounting to $256.38. See 134 Pa. 503.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-5\">The court charged in part as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-6\">\u201c The plaintiff\u2019s case here rests upon the allegation that at the time of the settlement for these properties he paid the whole amount of the purchase money upon the faith of the release of liens. That release was signed, as far as we are concerned with it here, \u2018 James Corr, per C. J. Corr.\u2019 Charles J. Corr, who is the defendant in this action, no doubt acted innocently in the matter; that is, he had no intention to deceive or wrong anyone by what he did. He signed the release at the request of Mr. Greenfield; [he did, however, an unauthorized act; he had no authority to sign it, and, if by that act a third party had been misled to his injury, he is liable.] [1] [If one signs a paper in this way, holding himself out as having authority when he has not, he is liable to a party who has been misled by his act.] [2] [If Mr. Lane is entitled to recover in this case, it is because he made a settlement for the property upon the faith of the signature to the release.] [3] If he acted outside of that, if he acted upon the statement of Mr. Greenfield, or if he paid the money in any way without acting upon the faith of the signature, then, of course, he has no cause of action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-7\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff.
