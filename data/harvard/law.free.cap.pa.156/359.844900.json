There was in force at that time an ordinance, approved March 30,1888, fixing the compensation of his office at $3.00 per day.

York, 150 Pa. 208. One of the plaintiff\u2019s points on that trial was, that \u201c the ordinance of March 30, 1888 was valid, and being unrepealed at the time of plaintiff\u2019s election as one of the city\u2019s assessors, the compensation therein fixed at three dollars a day could not be lawfully increased or diminished during the term for which he was elected,\u201d and in reversing the judgment we said of the ordinance that \u201c it fixed the appellant\u2019s compensation, and this could not be changed during his term: Act of May 23,1889, art. V. sec. 3, cl. 13, P. L. 289.\u201d The main contention in that case was upon the validity of the ordinance, and the present point therefore was not elaborated, but it was necessarily considered and determined. We are asked now to reconsider and decide it differently, mainly upon argument drawn from the form of the clause, and its position in a long act. We see no sufficient reason why we should do so. The proviso refers in terms to officers elected as well as appointed under ordinances, and presumably is of general application. That view of it is in accordance with the policy indicated by the constitution as to the compensation of public officers, and with the terms of much of the legislation upon kindred subjects. We are not required to be astute in making a departure in this one class of officers from the line of general policy. While the position of a proviso in a statute, has a great and sometimes controlling influence upon the extent of its applicability, yet the inference from its position cannot override its plain general intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
