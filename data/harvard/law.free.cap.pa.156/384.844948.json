At the date of the sale he owed his landlord $1,195.83, under a lease providing for the payment of rent at the rate of $125 per month. After the levy, the landlord, W. M.

Weaver, the landlord, owned a few articles which were on the premises ; these articles, except such of them as were in the private part of the hotel, were all levied upon by the sheriff under the first levy, but notices of ownership of the respective articles by the respective owners were given to the sheriff on Feb. 24,1892, the morning of the sale. The sheriff did not sell them. On Feb. 27, 1892, after the sale had been concluded, it having continued from the 24th to the 27th of February, 1892, a second levy was made by the sheriff upon the personal property of Mrs. Alice Metz and of Ellen B.

Even had they not been shown to have been upon, used and necessary in the hotel premises and business of the defendant, as required in the first section of the act of 1872, and in amendments of 1883 and 1891, in a case of this kind where it .is shown and admitted that the defendant had no other estate and property and was insolvent, the third section of the act of 1872 extends the claims to every property of the defendant, and his personal estate generally would be liable for their claims.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-5\">\u201c The execution issued in: this case is such as is named and intended in the 3d section of the act of 1872. It is against the employer for the collection of his own proper debt and must be regarded as denoting a condition of actual insolvency. Hart\" man\u2019s Ap., 107 Pa. 335. The amendments to the act of 1872 and the recent decisions of both our lower and higher courts go to show that too much strictness and detail have been exacted towards laborers in their endeavor to collect their claims for preferred wages, contrary to the intention and requirements of the statute and subversive of the rights of the classes named and intended to be protected. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-6\">\u201c Judge Handley, in Bennett\u2019s Case, 7 Luz. Leg. Reg. 2, held that the only notice required to be given by the parties entitled to the benefit of the act of 1872 is a notice in the words of the act itself. It says simply that they shall before actual sale give notice of their claim and the amount thereof. The requirements of the notice in the case of Peiffer\u2019s Estate, 6 Luz. Leg. Reg. 101, are altogether too specific. The Supreme Court has, in Allison v. Johnson, 92 Pa. 316, fixed and determined upon four requisites of a notice, which ruling liberally applied has been followed in subsequent cases decided by said court, viz.: (1) It must be in writing and delivered to the officer in charge of the writ before the day of sale or before the avails leave his hands. (2) It must state the sum due and that the labor was performed within the time limited, six months of the date of levy, and the kind of services. (3) It must name in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>and about a business defined in the statue. (4) It must set forth that the property levied upon is subject to lien for said services or claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-5\">\u201c It is not material in what form these requisites appear. As we understand the decisions, and interpret the law, we hold the notices in this case to come within the rigors of the rule adopted by the Supreme Court of our state. (1) They are in writing and were delivered to the proper officer in the proper time. (2) They name the sum due and set forth that the labor was performed within six months immediately preceding the date of the levy. (3) They defined the kind, alleging that it was performed as a clerk and servant girl in and about the business of keeping a hotel in the place and on the premises where the goods and property were seized by the sheriff, and where it was being carried on by their employer, the defendant in the execution. (4) The amounts given are claimed as a lien upon all the goods and chattels taken in execution and from which the proceeds came. The judgment and writ of fieri facias are correctly and particularly referred to in the notices, and they contain all the information required. All the goods and chattels of the defendant and all that was seized by the sheriff in and upon the premises and about the hotel kept by him and which were used in conducting and carrying on the identical hotel named and described in the notices, were therein mentioned^ and the sheriff and other parties interested could not be mistaken or misled in any particular in regard to the matter. As stated by counsel for the labor claimants, the first four lines of the notices contain the statement that \u2018 all the goods, chattels,\u2019 etc., of the defendant are under levy by the writ referred to, and the fifth and sixth lines from the bottom of the first page aver that \u2018 said property \u2019 is designated as being subject to the lien claimed, directly connecting the property levied on and the lien which is claimed together, not only by inference but by direct averment, for if the levy is a complete one and embraces all the property of the defendant it must plainly, by its comprehensiveness, embrace the property on which the lien is claimed, on the simple principle that the whole is equal to the sum of all its parts. In brief, we believe that every requisite of a notice, in such cases, is set forth therein, \u2018 with certainty to a reasonable intent,\u2019 and are forced to the conclusion that the learned audit- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>or erred in disallowing the labor claims of David Griffiths and Ellen B. Weaver. These should have been allowed and paid out of the fund, before the landlord\u2019s claim of rent to William M. Weaver of $1,195.83.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-5\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were that the auditor and court erred (1) in distributing any part of the money in court to William M. Weaver for rent claimed to be due; (2) in not holding as a matter of law that Wm. M. Weaver, the landlord, was bound to proceed and distrain the personal property of Ellen B. Weaver, after notice by the plaintiff in the execution, which was on the premises and liable to distress, but could not be reached by the execution creditor; (3, 4) in awarding any part of the money in court to Ellen B.

The act is silent as to notice. The practice appears to be that a demand be made of the sheriff, or a rule upon the sheriff or other officer executing the writ and making the sale to pay the amount of rent due out of the proceeds. Then it becomes the duty of the officer to make inquiry, or some investigation, to satisfy himself before paying out the money, otherwise to pay it into court for distribution: Ege v.

Metz and Ellen B. Weaver.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A7hs\">July 19, 1893:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AWp\">Mr. Justice Thompson,</author>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">The fund arising from the sale under the execution in this case was claimed by the plaintiff in the writ, the landlord whose tenant defendant was, and by several persons who were employed by him. Defendant was engaged in the hotel business, and for the hotel paid rent at the rate of $125 per month, but had paid no rent from May 1,1891. There was actually due at the time of the levy $1,168.88. The sale under the execution was completed February 24,1892, and at the expiration of that month there would have been due to the landlord rent to the amount of $1,250. He gave notice that this sum was the amount of rent in arrear and due him. As the month had not expired this sum was $54.17 in excess of that actually due. His right to payment out of the fund to an amount not exceeding one year\u2019s rent is clearly fixed by the act of June 16, 1836, and the fact that by mistake or accident he gave notice of a small sum in excess of the amount then due should not destroy this right. The act requires no specific form of notice. It provides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>the goods and chattels shall be liable for the payment of any sum of money due at the time of taking such goods in execution, and makes it the duty of the officer to pay, out of the proceeds of the sale, the rent due, limiting the amount to one year\u2019s rent. As the landlord is entitled to be paid from the proceeds of the sale it is manifestly proper that he should give notice of his claim to the officer, but such notice is not necessarily required to contain every element of precision.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The appellant himself recognizes the sufficient accuracy of this notice of the landlord. In bis notice to him he says, \u201c You notified the said sheriff in writing that the said defendant was indebted to you in the sum of $1,250 for rent accrued and unpaid by said defendant as tenant under you within one year immediately preceding said levy.\u201d This knowledge of the extent, nature and character of the landlord\u2019s claim, as derived by the appellant himself from the landlord\u2019s notice, is a negation of his claim of its insufficiency. In this notice of appellant to the landlord he says, \u201cthat there was at and before the levy and still is upon the premises certain goods liable to distress, that they are claimed by certain persons, that unless he proceeds to distrain he will hold liable to the value, and that it shall be deducted from the amount claimed by him out of the proceeds of the sale.\u201d As the landlord disregarded this notice it was contended that the value of these goods should be deducted from his claim and the court below was guilty of error in not doing so. This notice was served twelve days after the sale and sufficient money had at that time been realized from it to pay the rent due. The landlord was entitled to be paid from such proceeds and was under no obligation to proceed to distrain because requested by appellant, the execution creditor. In his argument he admits that there is no case to be found which warrants this claim, and seeks refuge, however, in the analogy, where one creditor has two funds and another has one, the former is required to exhaust the one upon which the latter has no claim; but this analogy is not well founded when it is considered that, in this case, the one fund amply secured him, and there was no reason or necessity for seeking another. When the levy is made upon personal property and the sheriff has notice of a claim for rent, he has no right to stay the writ without the consent of the landlord, because his right to distrain is interfered with by the levy : <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Borlin v. Commonwealth, 110 Pa. 454. With his rent thus secured and to be paid out of the proceeds of the sale, it would be anomalous to deprive him of it because he declined to do an unnecessary act at the request of an execution creditor. The position of the appellant has neither equity, authority, nor analogy to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">While this notice of the landlord was thus sufficient, such was also the case with those of the claimants for labor and services. They set forth that all the goods, chattels, rights and credits of the defendant were under execution, the nature of the labor and services to defendant in his business of hotel keeping, that the time when the same was done or rendered was within six months, that the amount of each was not in excess of $200, and that the respective amounts were liens upon the property levied upon, made so by the acts of assembly relating to wages. The act of 1872 made its provisions applicable to miners, mechanics, laborers, etc., while the act of 1883 amendatory of it, increased to a very large extent the class to be protected, and included clerks and servants about hotels. After \u25a0providing that the money due for labor and services shall be preferred and first paid out of the proceeds, it is enacted that it shall be lawful for them before the sale to give to the officer executing the writ notice in writing of their claim or claims, and the amounts of the same. The limit of the period of work to be paid for is six months and the amount $200. The purpose of these acts is to protect from loss, in case financial disaster occurs to employers, a large class of persons whose dependence upon their earnings for their support and maintenance renders their lpss even for a short period of time a matter of serious import. With the struggle for livelihood intensified by the progressive movements of civilized life, such legislation necessarily has its foundation in a humanity that would aid the weak, and consequently should not be restricted in its operation by requiring the highest degree of precision in the notice to be given to secure its benefits. These notices therefore should be such as would indicate to the officer and those interested the sum due before sale, the limit of time as to work done, the business defined by the acts, and the property subject to the lien: Allison v. Johnson, 92 Pa. 316 ; Adamson\u2019s Ap., 110 Pa. 462. As the notice in this case set forfh a levy upon all the goods and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>chattels of defendant, his business of hotel keeping, the char* acter of the labor and services, the times when they were done or rendered, and their lien upon the propertjr in execution under the acts of assembly, it is manifest that they are sufficiently particular, and contain all the requisites of proper notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The further objection to the claim of Ellen Weaver, based upon the ground that there is no evidence of contract, cannot be sustained. Both she and defendant Metz testified that a contract was made for her employment, that she was to be paid what her services were worth, and that they were worth $3.50 per week. The auditor finds that she was employed by defendant, and that her services were worth that amount per week. The act of assembly in its provision making the preference provides \u201c that all moneys that may be due or may hereafter become due for labor or services rendered (by persons named), whether at so much per diem or otherwise,\u201d clearly was intended to reach all classes of employment. In this case, the claimant was employed under an express promise to pay, and having performed her work and earned her wages she is entitled to have them paid out of the fund. Moyer\u2019s Ap., 112 Pa. 290; Ranninger\u2019s Ap., 118 Pa. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">As the assignments of error are not sustained, the decree of the court below is affirmed, and this appeal is dismissed at the cost of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
