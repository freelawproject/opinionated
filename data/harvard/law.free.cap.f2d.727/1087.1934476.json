We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-4\">Appellant, the International Order of Job\u2019s Daughters (Job\u2019s Daughters), describes itself as a \u201cyoung women\u2019s fraternal organization\u201d. Soon after its establishment in 1921, the organization adopted an emblem depicting three young women, carrying a cornucopia, a dove, and an urn. The name JOB\u2019S DAUGHTERS or IYOB FIL-LIAE (the Latin equivalent) appears at the base of the emblem. Since 1921, Job\u2019s Daughters has licensed at least one jeweler and/or supplier to sell jewelry and other merchandise bearing the Job\u2019s Daughters emblem.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">In 1975, Job\u2019s Daughters brought a civil action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that appellee Lindeburg and Company (Lindeburg) had infringed Job\u2019s Daughters\u2019 then common law trademark rights and had engaged in unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-6\">The District Court found that Lindeburg had begun manufacturing and selling merchandise with the Job\u2019s Daughters emblem sometime between 1952 and 1954. It also found that members of the Board of Trustees of Job\u2019s Daughters had known of Lindeburg\u2019s activities for many years, but that the organization had failed to take any action to enforce its rights until 1975 when it filed the case before the court. Although the District Court concluded that Lindeburg had infringed Job\u2019s Daughters common law trademarks and enjoined Lindeburg from further use of those marks, the court held that Job\u2019s Daughters\u2019 long delay in seeking to enforce its rights constituted laches and barred the organization from recovering damages. <em>See International Order of Job\u2019s Daughters v. Lindeburg and Company, </em>196 USPQ 461 (N.D.Cal.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-7\">On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the trial court\u2019s decision on the grounds that Job\u2019s Daughters had failed to prove that buyers of Lindeburg\u2019s jewelry (with the Job\u2019s Daughters emblem) would think that the jewelry was produced or endorsed by Job\u2019s Daughters. Observing that the trial court had found that many American jewelers sold unlicensed Job\u2019s Daughters jewelry, the Court of Appeals concluded: \u201cthe name and emblem were functional aesthetic components of the product, not trademarks. There could be, therefore, no infringement\u201d. <em>International Order of Job\u2019s Daughters v. Lindeburg and Company, </em>633 F.2d 912, 208 USPQ 718 (9th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>452 U.S. 941, 101 S.Ct. 3086, 69 L.Ed.2d 956, 213 USPQ 1056 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-9\">On September 11,1979, following the decision by the District Court and prior to the decision by the Court of Appeals, the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) issued a federal trademark registration for the Job\u2019s Daughters emblem for use on jewelry and paper products (scrapbooks, napkins, stationery, etc.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-10\">In April 1981, after the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision, Lindeburg filed a petition with the PTO asking that Job\u2019s Daughters\u2019 recent registration be cancelled because its emblem was not capable of functioning as a trademark. Lindeburg alleged that the widespread use of the Job\u2019s Daughters emblem on merchandise manufactured and sold by business entities independent of Job\u2019s Daughters had rendered it incapable of indicating origin with Job\u2019s Daughters or any other organization. In September 1981, Lindeburg filed a motion for summary judgment on its petition for cancellation, claiming that the judgment of the Ninth Circuit was determinative of the petition for cancellation and should be accorded collateral estoppel effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-11\">On February 10,1982, the TTAB granted Lindeburg\u2019s motion for summary judgment and cancelled Job\u2019s Daughters\u2019 trademark registration for jewelry. Lindeburg later filed a second motion for summary judgment, requesting that Job\u2019s Daughters\u2019 registration be cancelled for all goods. The Board granted that motion in March 1983, in light of a stipulation filed by the parties in which they agreed that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision applies to all items covered by the registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-12\">The appeal to this court concerns two questions: first, whether appellee has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>standing to seek cancellation of the registration of appellant\u2019s mark; and, second, whether the TTAB correctly granted summary judgment to appellee on the basis of the doctrine of former adjudication. For convenience, we discuss the latter issue first.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">The TTAB gave preclusive effect to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s determination that the Job\u2019s Daughters name and emblem were merely \u201cfunctional aesthetic components of the product, not trademarks\u201d, primarily as a result of the widespread merchandising of Job\u2019s Daughters jewelry by many American retail jewelers (including Lindeburg) who are independent of Job\u2019s Daughters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-6\">In its opinion of February 10, 1982, the TTAB quoted, in full, the concluding paragraph of the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion and gave preclusive effect to the determinations found within it. That paragraph reads (633 F.2d at 920):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkE\">We conclude from our examination of the trial judge\u2019s findings and of the underlying evidence that Lindeburg was not using the Job\u2019s Daughters name and emblem as trademarks. The insignia were a prominent feature of each item so as to be visible to others when worn, allowing the wearer to publicly express her allegiance to the organization. Lindeburg never designated the merchandise as \u201cofficial\u201d Job\u2019s Daughters\u2019 merchandise or otherwise affirmatively indicated sponsorship. Job\u2019s Daughters did not show a single instance in which a customer was misled about the origin, sponsorship, or endorsement of Lindeburg\u2019s jewelry, nor that it received any complaints about Lindeburg\u2019s wares. Finally, there was evidence that many other jewelers sold unlicensed Job\u2019s Daughters jewelry, implying that consumers did not ordinarily purchase their fraternal jewelry from only \u201cofficial\u201d sources. We conclude that Job\u2019s Daughters did not meet its burden of proving that a typical buyer of Linde-burg\u2019s merchandise would think that the jewelry was produced, sponsored, or endorsed by the organization. The name and emblem were functional aesthetic components of the product, not trademarks. There could be, therefore, no infringement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1178-10\">In a previous portion of its opinion, the Court of Appeals said (633 F.2d at 914):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-11\">* * * Since its inception Job\u2019s Daughters has licensed at least one jeweler to produce jewelry for it. Job\u2019s Daughters sells some of the licensed jewelry directly to its members. Jewelry bearing the name or emblem is also sold by approximately 31,000 retailers across the nation. Most of these retailers presumably had no connection with the Job\u2019s Daughters organization. Some sell jewelry manufactured by Job\u2019s Daughters\u2019 licensees; others sell jewelry manufactured by jewelers not licensed by the organization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1178-12\">And at another point, the court said (633 F.2d at 918):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-13\"><em>* * * </em>But in the context of this case, the name and emblem are functional aesthetic components of the jewelry, in that they are being merchandised on the basis of their intrinsic value, not as a designation of origin or sponsorship.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1178-14\">Under the doctrine of issue preclusion, traditionally called \u201ccollateral estoppel\u201d, issues which are actually and necessarily determined by a court of competent jurisdiction are normally conclusive in a subsequent suit involving the parties to the prior litigation. <em>Mother\u2019s Restaurants Incorporated v. Mama\u2019s Pizza, Inc., </em>723 F.2d 1566 at 1569 (Fed.Cir.1983); <em>see also United States v. </em>Mendoza, -- U.S. --, 104 S.Ct. 568, 571, 78 L.Ed.2d 379 (1984); Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-17\">Job\u2019s Daughters first contends here that the determinations of the Ninth Circuit are not entitled to preclusive effect because the causes of action before that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>court and before the TTAB were not identical. We are faced, however, with an application of issue preclusion (or collateral es-toppel), not with claim preclusion (or <em>res </em>judicata). Issue preclusion, as distinguished from claim preclusion, does not include any requirement that the claim (or cause of action) be the same: \u201c[w]hen an issue of fact or law is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, and the determination is essential to the judgment, the determination is conclusive in a subsequent action between the parties, <em>whether in the same or a different claim\u201d. </em>(Emphasis added) Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27 (1980). <em>See also Mother\u2019s Restaurants, supra, </em>at 1569.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-4\">Aside from this mistaken contention, Job\u2019s Daughters\u2019 challenge to the Board\u2019s decision appears to be based on the argument that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s determinations are not, in and of themselves, a sufficient basis for the Board\u2019s granting of Lindeburg\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the cancellation petition. We hold, on the contrary, that the Board had valid grounds for cancellation on the basis of the factual determinations accepted by the Ninth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">The TTAB may properly cancel a trademark registration when (1) there is a valid ground why the trademark should not continue to be registered and (2) the party petitioning for cancellation has standing. <em>Lipton Industries, Inc. v. Ralston Purina Company, </em>670 F.2d 1024, 1026, 213 USPQ 185, 187 (CCPA 1982); 1 J. McCarthy, <em>Trademarks and Unfair Competition </em>\u00a7 20.-12 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-6\"><em>Grounds for Cancellation: </em>The legal issue in a cancellation proceeding is the right to register a mark. <em>Flavor Corp. of America v. Kemin Industries, </em>493 F.2d 275, 279, 181 USPQ 289, 292 (8th Cir.1974). For Principal Register registrations less than five years old (like that of Job\u2019s Daughters), cancellation may be based upon any ground which would have prevented registration initially. 1 J. McCarthy, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 20.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-12\">One criterion for federal trademark registration is that the mark for which registration is sought has become distinctive of the applicant\u2019s goods in commerce. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(f). The Lanham Act defines a trademark as any \u201cword, name, symbol, or device ... used by a manufacturer or merchant to identify his goods and distinguish them from those manufactured or sold by others\u201d. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127. Conversely, a configuration which does not fulfill the functions of a trademark, but, rather, serves essentially a utilitarian or functional purpose cannot be registered as a trademark.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Application of Hollaender Manufacturing Co., </em>511 F.2d 1186, 1187, 185 USPQ 101, 102 (CCPA 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-13\">The Ninth Circuit held that the Job\u2019s Daughters name and emblem \u2014 mainly as a result of its widespread use by nonlicensed jewelers and lack of control by appellant\u2014 fulfilled a functional, aesthetic purpose and did not serve as a trademark.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This issue, as well as the facts underlying the Ninth Circuit\u2019s conclusion, were actively contested by the parties to that suit and were directly necessary to that court\u2019s holding in the infringement action. The court was indisputedly a court of competent jurisdiction. Under the principles applying to issue preclusion, those determinations are binding on the TTAB and on us, and are sufficient to call for cancellation of the registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-14\"><em>Standing: </em>Section 14 of the Lanham Act provides that a petition to cancel a trademark may be filed by any person \u201cwho believes that he is or will be damaged by the registration of a mark ...\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1064. Appellant contends that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>TTAB\u2019s grant of summary judgment was improper because Lindeburg had not yet proved that it would be \u201cdamaged\u201d by continued registration of the Job\u2019s Daughters\u2019 mark. In recent cases, this court has explicitly said that there is no requirement that damage be proved in order to establish standing or to prevail in a cancellation proceeding. <em>See Rosso and Mastracco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Giant Food, Inc., </em>720 F.2d 1263, 1265, 219 USPQ 1050, 1052 (Fed.Cir.1983); <em>Selva &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Nina Footwear, Inc., </em>705 F.2d 1316, 1324-26, 217 USPQ 641, 647-48 (Fed. Cir.1983). All the Lanham Act requires is that the cancellation petitioner plead and prove facts showing a \u201creal interest\u201d in the proceeding in order to establish standing. <em>Rosso and Mastracco, supra; Nina Footwear, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">Lindeburg has clearly demonstrated a \u201creal interest\u201d in this cancellation proceeding. The allegations which Lindeburg made in its petition for cancellation regarding its longtime production and sale of merchandise with the Job\u2019s Daughters emblem are fully supported by the Ninth Circuit\u2019s recital of the facts found by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">In addition, by virtue of that Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in its favor, Lindeburg has an equal right with that of Job\u2019s Daughters-approved-jewelers to use the Job\u2019s Daughters emblem on its jewelry. Continued federal registration of the mark is inconsistent with that right. Registration accords Job\u2019s Daughters, should it file another infringement suit against Linde-burg, <em>prima facie </em>proof of an exclusive right to use the Job\u2019s Daughters emblem in commerce, a right which it should not have. <em>See DeWalt, Inc. v. Magna Power Tool Corp., </em>289 F.2d 656, 661, 129 USPQ 275, 280 (CCPA 1961).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In these circumstances, Lindeburg cannot be considered a \u201cmere intermeddler\u201d whom the standing requirements would bar from initiating cancellation proceedings. <em>See Lipton Industries, Inc. v. Ralston Purina Co., supra, </em>670 F.2d at 1028-29, 213 USPQ at 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-8\">For these reasons, the decision of the TTAB, granting Lindeburg\u2019s motion for summary judgment on its petition for cancellation of Job\u2019s Daughters\u2019 registration, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1178-8\">. The Court of Appeals determinations all rested on the District Court\u2019s findings of fact, <em>see </em>196 USPQ at 461-463.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1179-7\">. We do not mean to suggest that a configuration which has an incidental utility may never be registered. <em>See Application of Penthouse International Ltd., </em>565 F.2d 679, 195 USPQ 698 (CCPA 1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1179-15\">. We disagree with Job\u2019s Daughters\u2019 contention that the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision was limited to the extremely narrow holding that Linde-burg, and only Lindeburg, did not use the Job\u2019s Daughters emblem as a trademark. In our view, the correct interpretation of the court\u2019s holding is stated in the text, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1180-6\">. Though Lindeburg prevailed in the Ninth Circuit infringement action against it brought by Job\u2019s Daughters, we believe that it should not have to rely solely on the doctrine of former adjudication to bar appellant\u2019s use of its registration against Lindeburg in another suit. There are enough exceptions to the doctrine of issue preclusion (see Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 28 (1980)) to render it impossible to say that former adjudication is an all-sufficient remedy, in itself, to preclude any attempt to use the registration against Lindeburg. Even though appellee might prevail in its defense of former adjudication, it should not have to litigate that defense in order to be free of appellant\u2019s registration advantage.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
