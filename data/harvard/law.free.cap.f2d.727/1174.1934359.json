ROBINSON, III.</p>\n<author id=\"b1264-8\">SPOTTSWOOD W. ROBINSON, III, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1264-9\">This appeal marks the second occasion upon which Anand Prakash has appeared before this court to litigate questions emanating from the termination of his appointment as a professor in the Physics Department of The American University.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Still maintaining that the University breached a contract to employ him permanently, Pra-kash asserts entitlement to minimum and overtime wages under the Fair Labor Standards Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and damages under local law, which allegedly the University has wrongfully withheld from him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The District Court entered a summary judgment dismissing Prakash\u2019s action, ruling that he was outside the coverage of the Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that no jurisdictional basis for consideration of his nonfederal claims existed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We find that Prakash made out a colorable case of inclusion within the Act, and resultantly that the District Court has pendent jurisdiction to entertain his local-law contentions. Accordingly, we reverse the District Court\u2019s judgment and remand for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-20\">It cannot be said at this point in the litigation that Prakash necessarily lacks the protection of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Section 13(a)(1) of the Act exempts from coverage of the minimum wage and overtime provisions<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> anyone employed in a \u201cbona fide ... professional capacity,\u201d as defined in regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The regulations prescribe five conditions to a finding of em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>ployment in that capacity,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> each of which must be met to establish the exemption.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In applying these regulatory standards, the District Court apparently concluded that Prakash, an academic physicist, satisfied the first four conditions,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> but the court declined to determine whether, in fulfillment of the fifth, Prakash was paid at or above the rate of $170 per week.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Instead, the court held the requirement of a threshold weekly wage invalid as \u201can \u2018arbitrary and fanciful classification of professional status\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and inconsistent with the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of the Act.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1265-5\">We do not agree. Congress expressly authorized the Secretary to \u201cdefin[e] and delimit\u201d the term \u201cbona fide ... professional.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and, acting pursuant to this delegation, the Secretary conducted hearings in 1940 to assist his response.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> A minimum-wage requirement in the regulatory definition was applauded by employers participating in the hearings as \u201ca valuable and easily applied index to the \u2018bona fide\u2019 character for which exemption is claimed.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Employers felt, and the Secretary agreed, that the salary paid the employee was \u201cthe best single test of the employer\u2019s good faith in characterizing the employment.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We thus conclude that the Secretary, in imposing the minimum-wage condition, \u201cacted within the statutory bounds of his authority, and that his choice among possible alternative standards ... is one which a rational person could have made.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>we hold, in common with many other courts,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> that this requirement is valid.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\">We must, then, return the case to the District Court for consideration of Pra-kash\u2019s minimum-wage and overtime claims under the provisions of the Act. On remand, the University will have the burden of proving that Prakash was employed in a bona fide professional capacity, and therefore was exempted from the Act\u2019s coverage.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We caution that this exemption is to be construed narrowly,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and that the University must demonstrate that Prakash\u2019s employment met each of its five demands; <footnotemark>23</footnotemark> perhaps most importantly, the University must show that Prakash was compensated at the rate of at least $170 per week. The District Court must, of course, make such additional findings as may be necessary for full resolution of Prakash\u2019s claims on the record as it exists or as it may be augmented by evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-11\">Prakash\u2019s common-law bases for relief include breach of contract, interference with contractual relations, conversion, deceit and defamation. He presses these theories of recovery against the University, which is operated in the District of Columbia, and individually against two officers of the University who are domiciliaries of Maryland. Since, from the beginning of the litigation, Prakash has acknowledged a residence in Maryland,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> diversity of citizenship as a basis for federal jurisdiction has been uncertain.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Prakash more fully describes himself, however, as \u201ca citizen of the United States with a temporary resi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>dence in the State of Maryland and a permanent domicile in the State of Pennsylvania.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1267-4\">Following our earlier remand, Prakash, in support of diversity jurisdiction, submitted numerous documents<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> to the District Court in an effort to establish a Pennsylvania domicile at the time he sued.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Without any sort of hearing on the issue, the District Court held that Prakash planned to remain in Maryland indefinitely.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The court stated that \u201c[t]he entire scenario of this case is, on its face, inconsistent with an intent to return to Pennsylvania,\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and that \u201c[ajpart from [Prakash\u2019s] bald allegations of intent to return to Pennsylvania ... there is no manifest pattern in his movements indicating that he treated Pittsburgh as his home base at the time of suit.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The court felt also that Prakash\u2019s original litigative objective undercut his assertion of a Pennsylvania domicile. His</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-13\">insistence that the University had dishonored a contract of permanent employment, and his effort to gain reinstatement at the University in a tenured position, were taken as indications that he did not intend to return to Pennsylvania.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The court thus concluded, simply on the paper record before it, that Prakash had not made out a Pennsylvania domicile, and therefore could not demonstrate diversity of citizenship.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1267-14\">We are unable to sustain the court\u2019s ruling on the diversity issue. In the first place, we cannot subscribe to the procedures the court utilized in determining that diversity was lacking. When subject-matter jurisdiction is questioned, the court must, of course, satisfy itself of its authority to hear the case,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and in so doing, it may resolve factual disputes.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The court has considerable latitude in devising the procedures it will follow to ferret out the facts pertinent to jurisdiction,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> and normally it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>may rely upon either written or oral evidence.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The court must, however, afford the nonmoving party \u201can ample opportunity to secure and present evidence relevant to the existence of jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> That, we believe, was not fully done here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">When diversity of citizenship is the issue, the relevant evidence is that relating to the domiciles of the parties.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Domicile is determined by two factors: physical presence in a state, and intent to remain there for an unspecified or indefinite period of time.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> In many instances, and perhaps in most, a party\u2019s intent will appear, at least in part, from facts established by documents. When, however, as here, a party expressly declares his intent, and the opposing written submissions do not demonstrate the falsity of the declaration with reasonable certainty, the issue necessarily becomes one of the declarant\u2019s credibility. In that event, the court cannot rest its decision simply on the paper record, but must hold a hearing in order to adequately assess credibility.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Only in that way is a sound decision on intent possible.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>As we mentioned earlier,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> the District Court did not conduct an evidentiary hearing; instead, it relied solely upon documents submitted by the parties in finding that Prakash lacked the intent essential to domicile in Pennsylvania. The court noted two factors that convinced it that Prakash did not plan to return to Pennsylvania. The first was that Prakash, \u201ca renowned physics professor, [had] moved from one university town to the next and lived in several states.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> It does not strike us as unusual, however, for a professor, particularly one who is recognized as a scholar, to spend time during the course of his career at academic institutions variously located about the country. The mere fact of the academician\u2019s movement from one institution to another thus cannot provide reliable evidence of a determination not to return to a particular place and remain there for an indeterminate period of time. The second factor influencing the District Court was that Prakash in his complaint sought both reinstatement and tenure at American University.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Again, Prakash\u2019s desire for a tenured position at the University, while warranting consideration in determinations on intent, is hardly potent evidence that he did not mean eventually to return to and remain in Pennsylvania indefinitely. At the very least, each of the two factors relied upon by the court had to be weighed against Prakash\u2019s unequivocal declaration of the intent that makes for domicile in Pennsylvania, and with that the issue necessarily became one of Prakash\u2019s credibility. An evidentiary hearing, therefore, was necessary to resolve suitably the question of Prakash\u2019s intent, and the District Court should not have undertaken to settle that question on the documents alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-11\">We encounter another problem deserving comment. Even if the District Court had proceeded properly in finding diversity of citizenship wanting, it still should not have granted summary judgment on that account. Lack of diverse citizenship is not ground for an award of summary judgment.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> If a court finds that diversity does not exist, it must, absent another basis for federal jurisdiction, dismiss the case under Civil Rule 12(b)(1)<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> rather than award summary judgment under Rule 56.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> A summary judgment is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>ruling on the merits of the case<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> predicated upon a determination that there are no material issues of fact that necessitate trial.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> As a decision on the merits, a summary judgment merges or bars the action for res judicata purposes.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> A dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, on the other hand, is not a disposition on the merits<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> and consequently does not have res judicata effect.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> A litigant whose action is dismissed for lack of diversity, therefore, subsequently may refile the action in an appropriate forum.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Thus, even if the District Court had proceeded correctly in finding an absence of diversity, it should have dismissed the case in lieu of a grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-5\">We must, then, reverse the District Court\u2019s ruling on diversity, and ordinarily we would direct reconsideration of the matter. There is, however, an alternative course open to the court as a byproduct of our holding that Prakash is entitled to litigate his minimum-wage and overtime claims. Those claims \u201caris[e] under the ... laws ... of the United States\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> \u2014 the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act\u2014 the District Court clearly has jurisdiction to consider them.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> It follows that the court also has power to entertain Prakash\u2019s local-law claims as a matter of pendent jurisdiction. It follows, too, that should the court decide to exercise pendent jurisdiction over the latter claims, the diversity issue would become academic.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-12\">The doctrine of pendent jurisdiction enables a district court, incidentally to its authority to adjudicate federal claims properly before it, to also pass on related non-federal claims of which it could not take cognizance were they presented alone.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> When federal and nonfederal claims arise from a \u201ccommon nucleus of operative fact\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> and the federal claim has \u201csubstance,\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> the court may decide the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number>nonfederal claims, without need for an independent basis of federal jurisdiction.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> To say, however, that there is <em>power </em>to hear the pendent claim is not to say that the court <em>must </em>hear it. On the contrary, \u201c[i]t has consistently been recognized that pendent jurisdiction is a doctrine of discretion, not of plaintiffs right. Its justification lies in considerations of judicial economy, convenience and fairness to litigants.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1271-5\">The case at bar calls for serious consideration in light of these principles.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> The federal and nonfederal claims Prakash advances \u201cderive from a common nucleus of operative fact\u201d \u2014 Prakash\u2019s contract dispute with the University \u2014 and we have already found that the federal claims \u2014 those predicated on the Pair Labor Standards Act\u2014 have \u201csubstance.\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Convenience and economy may well favor an exercise of pendent jurisdiction; any discovery conducted on the federal issues might aid a gathering of facts relevant to local-law issues, and perhaps enough could comfortably be tried in a single proceeding to enable a just disposition of the entire controversy. We are mindful that expediency must be juxtaposed against possibilities of unfairness to a party or unnecessary decisionmaking on matters of local law.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> But, upon careful evaluation of all factors, it might be concluded that no party would be deprived of any procedural or substantive right, and that the local law applicable is neither novel nor unsettled. On remand of this case, the District Court will have the opportunity to determine initially whether the policies underlying the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction would better be served by adjudication of Prakash\u2019s local-law claims along with his federal claims.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1271-12\">The judgment appealed from is reversed, and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-13\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1264-11\">. On his first appeal, we affirmed the District Court\u2019s dismissal of claims asserted by him pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 (1976) and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000(e) <em>et seq. </em>(1976), and remanded his federally-based wage and locally-based damage claims to the District Court for further consideration. <em>Prakash v. American Univ., </em>652 F.2d 196 (D.C.Cir.1981) (judgment and memorandum).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1264-12\">. Pub.L. No. 85-231 (1957), 52 Stat. 1060 (1938), codified as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201 <em>et seq. </em>(Supp. V 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1264-13\">. Prakash alleges that in 1976 he performed regular work for 1,192 hours and overtime work for 1,036 hours, and thereby accumulated regular minimum wages of $2,622.40 and overtime wages of $3,315.20 \u2014 a total of $5,937.60, of which the University paid him only $18.90, leaving an unpaid balance of $5,918.70 for 1976. First Amended Complaint (following remand), filed May 19, 1981, 19-22 at 5, <em>Pra-kash v. American Univ., </em>Civ. No. 78-2294 (D.D.C.), Record on Appeal (R.) 88 [hereinafter cited as Amended Complaint]. Prakash further alleges that in 1977 he worked for the University for 1,200 regular hours and 1,120 overtime hours, by reason of which he became entitled to $2,760 in regular minimum wages and $3,864 in overtime wages, for a total of an additional $6,624. Amended Complaint, <em>supra, </em>][ 23 at 5, R. 88. The University states that it paid Prakash $2,520 for his 1977 efforts, leaving in dispute a balance of $4,104 in unpaid wages for that year. Amended Complaint, <em>supra, </em>j| 24 at 5, R. 88. Thus, the total of the unpaid wages assertedly due Prakash for 1976 and 1977 is $10,022.70. In addition to these federally-based wage claims, Prakash presses, as we have said, several common-law causes of action for damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1264-22\">. <em>Prakash v.

Baltimore, </em>216 U.S. 285, 288, 30 S.Ct. 326, 327, 54 L.Ed. 482, 483 (1910).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"60\">\n<p id=\"b1271-7\">. \u201cPendent jurisdiction, in the sense of judicial <em>power, </em>exists whenever there is a [federal] claim ... and the relationship between that claim and the state law claim permits the conclusion that the entire action before the court comprises but one constitutional \u2018case\u2019. The federal claim must have substance sufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction on the court____ The state and federal claims must derive from a common nucleus of operative fact. But if, considered without regard to their federal or state character, a plaintiffs claims are such that he would ordinarily be expected to try them all in one judicial proceeding, then, assuming substantiality of the federal issues, there is <em>power </em>in federal courts to hear the whole.\u201d <em>UMW v.
