His previous experience in the practice of administrative law was limited. But, he believed he could qualify by showing sufficient trial experience. The Office of Personnel Manage\u2022ment, in its statement of requirements for the ALJ position, says applicants may count towards the seven necessary years of qualifying experience their \u201cexperience in preparation of cases for <em>and </em>their presentation at trial in courts of record of unlimited and original jurisdiction.\u201d It adds that the applicant must show that he spent at least two years \u201cin the actual preparation and trial of cases\u201d; and, to do so, he should list <em>\u201cin chronological order ... </em>court cases which he <em>has prepared and tried </em>... to demonstrate <em>2 full years </em>(400 workdays) within the 7-year period immediately preceding the date of the application.\u201d Office of Personnel Management, Administrative Law Judge, Announcement No. 318, October 1979, pp. 4, 5, 11 (emphasis in original). Dugan had practiced as a trial lawyer with Neighborhood Legal Services in Washington, D.C. from 1965 to 1969; he had served as Deputy Director and Director of Rhode Island Legal Services from 1970 to 1977; he practiced privately as a trial lawyer from 1977 to 1980. He estimates that he devoted to the preparation of cases for trial and their trial about 95 percent of his time in the first period, about 60 percent in the second period, and 100 percent in the third period. He had other relevant experience as well. Thus he sent to OPM a lengthy application detailing this experience, as required, with case titles, citations, descriptions, dates, names and addresses of courts, judges, counsel, and the number of workdays spent on each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">In early December Dugan received a printed form from OPM stating that OPM would not process this application further because, among other things, he had shown only 188 days, not 400 days, of acceptable case work. After considerable effort to find out which cases OPM did not count and why, Dugan concluded (and parties here agree) that OPM based its rejection, in relevant part, on its practice of counting towards the necessary two years of trial experience only those trial preparation days belonging to cases actually tried. It will not count a trial preparation day belonging to a case that settles, even if it settles on the eve of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-13\">Dugan attacked this practice as arbitrary, (and also unconstitutional). The AU Rating Appeals Panel, within OPM, rejected his argument. The federal district court also seems to have rejected it, although it dismissed Dugan\u2019s action for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies \u2014 a point that the court raised <em>sua sponte. </em>Dugan now appeals, claiming that the district court, 560 F.Supp. 1230, erred in believing it lacked jurisdiction and that OPM\u2019s practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>must be set aside as \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion,\u201d under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). We agree with Dugan on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of this case for failure to \u201cexhaust remedies\u201d rests upon its view that the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 provides Dugan with an administrative remedy that he failed to invoke, namely, the right to petition OPM\u2019s Special Counsel for redress. The statute says the Special Counsel can look into allegations of a \u201cprohibited personnel practice,\u201d report his findings or recommendations, and, if necessary, petition the Merit System Protection Board to consider the matter. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1206. Dugan did not bring his problem to the attention of the Special Counsel. The district court, however, was wrong in believing that \u201cexhaustion law\u201d required him to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">For one thing, exhaustion of remedies requirements are normally waivable. <em>Mathews v. Diaz, </em>426 U.S. 67, 76-77, 96 S.Ct. 1883, 1889-1890, 48 L.Ed.2d 478 (1976); <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 328, 96 S.Ct. 893, 899, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976). And the government here \u201cwaives\u201d (to the extent permitted by statute), for it specifically says that Dugan need not petition the Special Counsel. For another thing, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has held that the Special Counsel provisions do not provide employees (or applicants) with an exhaustable avenue for further agency review. <em>Frazier v. Merit Systems Protection Board, </em>672 F.2d 150, 162-63 (D.C.Cir.1982). Rather, the Special Counsel is a type of agency ombudsman. \u201cCorrective action petitions\u201d sent to the Special Counsel are not like individual appeals. Rather, they are \u201ccomparable to criminal prosecutions designed to vindicate the public interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The government, responding to our request at oral argument that it tell us whether it thinks the district court was right or wrong on the \u201cexhaustion\u201d point, has filed a supplementary brief agreeing with <em>Frazier </em>(and with Dugan) and disagreeing with the district court\u2019s opinion that \u201cappeal to the [Special Counsel] ... is mandatory in these circumstances.\u201d In its view, the \u201ccorrective action authority of the Special Counsel does not have \u2018anything to do\u2019 with [the] appeal right of individual employees for grievances .... \u201d Given the government\u2019s concession, we see no reason not to follow <em>Frazier </em>here.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">The district court\u2019s discussion suggests, however, that, in referring to \u201cexhaustion,\u201d it may have had a deeper problem in mind. The Administrative Procedure Act makes clear that \u201cfinal agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court [is] ... subject to judicial review.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704. But, there are two exceptions. A court cannot review an agency action under the APA \u201cto the extent that (1) statutes preclude judicial review; or (2) agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701. The district court seems to have felt that one or the other of these exceptions may apply here. And, the government\u2019s supplementary brief appears to make a similar argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">We are not aware, however, of any statute that precludes review of the \u201cfinal\u201d agency action here at issue. The government\u2019s suggestion to the contrary seems to depend upon <em>implying </em>a congressional intent to deny review from the Civil Service Reform Act itself. That Act provides for review of most personnel actions (but not this one) by the Merit Systems Protection Board. It goes on to create two channels for court review of MSPB decisions \u2014 one (for most cases) leading to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1), and the other (for special cases involving, for example, claims of discrimination) leading to federal district court, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(2). The government would imply, from the fact that Congress wished to unify much court review of MSPB decisions in the Federal Circuit, a congressional prohibition against court review of final personnel decisions that do not find their way to the MSPB. This conclusion, however, does not follow logically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>from the premise. It runs counter to the strong presumption in the law that favors reviewability and almost never implies statutory preclusion of review from congressional silence. <em>See Johnson v. Robinson, </em>415 U.S. 361, 373-74, 94 S.Ct. 1160, 1168-69, 39 L.Ed.2d 389 (1974) (\u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence of congressional intent is required to preclude review); <em>Barlow v. Collins, </em>397 U.S. 159, 167, 90 S.Ct. 832, 838, 25 L.Ed.2d 192 (1970) (same); <em>San Juan Legal Services, Inc. v. Legal Services Corp., </em>655 F.2d 434, 438 (1st Cir.1981) (similar); <em>Virginia ex rel. Commissioner v. Marshall, </em>599 F.2d 588, 592 (4th Cir.1979) (same). It runs counter to a history of court review (as presented here by the government) both before and after the enactment of the CSRA. <em>Friedman v. Devine, </em>No. 81-756 (D.D.C. Feb. 25, 1982) (review by district court of decision of ALJ Rating Appeals Panel); <em>Bromberg v. Civil Service Commission, </em>No. 73 C 537 (N.D.Ill. March 25, 1977) (review by district court of decision of Civil Service Commission), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>No. 75-1485 (7th Cir. Dec. 19, 1975). And, it strikes us as implausible to believe that Congress wished to withdraw court review of even egregious agency behavior in the area\u2014 even if, for example, an agency were to discard applications as a result of bribery or the roll of the dice. We therefore reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">The district court also suggested that the second exception, \u201cagency action committed to agency discretion,\u201d might bar review. But, that suggestion also seems wrong. Of course, when agencies hire personnel, their discretion is broad and courts must be reluctant to interfere. <em>American Federation of Government Employees v. Hoffman, </em>543 F.2d 930, 938 (D.C.Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 965, 97 S.Ct. 1645, 52 L.Ed.2d 356 (1977); <em>Bielec v. United States, </em>456 F.2d 690, 695, 197 Ct.Cl. 550 (1972); <em>cf. Borsari v. Federal Aviation Administration, </em>699 F.2d 106, 109 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied, -- U.S. --, 104 S.Ct. 115, 78 L.Ed.2d 115 (1983) (\u201c[A] smooth functioning government requires that public officials be afforded broad discretion to make employment decisions based on their view of the agency\u2019s best interest.\u201d). But, the fact that an agency enjoys broad discretionary powers does not mean judicial review is forbidden; it simply means that the reviewing court is unlikely to find against the agency, for the agency is unlikely to have acted unlawfully. <em>See generally </em>Berger, <em>Administrative Arbitrariness and Judicial Review, </em>65 Colum.L.Rev. 55 (1965); 4 K. Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise, </em>\u00a7 28.16 (1958) and <em>Administrative Law of the Seventies, </em>\u00a7 28.16 (1976). To have bite, the \u201ccommitted to agency discretion,\u201d exemption must forbid the court to review even those decisions in which the agency may have acted unlawfully \u2014 where it may have exceeded its broad powers. Sometimes courts will find that Congress intended to preclude such review, typically when review involves foreign affairs, the military, or other areas in which the very act of reviewing may impede the agency\u2019s ability to carry out its functions. <em>See, e.g., Chicago &amp; Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman Steamship Corp., </em>333 U.S. 103, 68 S.Ct. 431, 92 L.Ed. 568 (1948); <em>Braniff Airways, Inc. v. CAB, </em>581 F.2d 846 (D.C.Cir.1978); <em>Langevin v. Chenango Court, Inc., </em>447 F.2d 296 (2d Cir.1971); <em>Hahn v. Gottlieb, </em>430 F.2d 1243 (1st Cir.1970); Saferstein, <em>Nonreviewability: A Functional Analysis of \u201cCommitted to Agency Discretion,\u201d </em>82 Harv.L.Rev. 367 (1968). But here, as previously mentioned, there is no reason to believe that Congress wished or needed to preclude review of unlawful action in order to carry out a statutory objective. To the contrary, Congress has specifically <em>provided </em>for judicial review of many related actions affecting not only employed civil servants but also \u201cjob applicants.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703. In sum, we believe that OPM\u2019s discretionary powers to accept or to reject job applications are broad. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1302. But, court review of a \u201cfinal agency decision,\u201d to determine whether the agency\u2019s action was lawful, is nonetheless appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">In reviewing for arbitrariness, we recognize the broad authority that the relevant statutes grant OPM to develop, and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>administer, ALJ hiring criteria. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1305, 3105, 5372. Moreover, the agency practice here challenged consists of an administrative interpretation of its own regulations. An agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations is rarely set aside. <em>United States v. Larionoff, </em>431 U.S. 864, 872-73, 97 S.Ct. 2150, 2155-56, 53 L.Ed.2d 48 (1977); <em>Bowles v. Seminole Rock Co., </em>325 U.S. 410, 413-14, 65 S.Ct. 1215, 1217, 89 L.Ed. 1700 (1945). <em>But see Jicarilla Apache Tribe v. FERC, </em>578 F.2d 289, 292-93 (10th Cir.1978). Still, we believe that the agency interpretation here at issue is so totally unreasonable as to be without support in the authorizing statute. Or to put the matter in APA terms, it is unreasonable to the point that it constitutes an \u201cabuse\u201d of the agency\u2019s discretionary powers. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">First, the distinction between a day of trial preparation for a case that reaches trial and one that settles prior to that trial is often a distinction without a difference. The legal work involved will often be identical. Indeed a trial lawyer who tends to settle cases may be a better trial lawyer than one who does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Second, the agency\u2019s refusal to take this fact of \u201cpreparation time equivalence\u201d into account is not the minor sort of irrationality that typically accompanies any administrative effort to shape rules and practices. Rather, it is a serious irrationality that likely thwarts the very purpose of the basic regulation, namely, to allow lawyers with trial experience to qualify to become ALJ\u2019s. Dugan alleges and supports with affidavits from experienced practitioners the well known fact that between 75 percent and 90 percent of all cases filed in court eventually settle. Thus, if the agency insists upon 400 days of \u201ctrial practice\u201d and counts only those days related to cases actually tried, the typical trial lawyer would have to engage in 1600 to 4000 days of trial case work to qualify. And 1600 to 4000 days amounts to more workdays than likely exist in the seven year period that OPM allows the applicant to canvass for relevant experience. Of course, these numbers may not be exactly right; and some lawyers will qualify regardless. But, the numbers do show that Dugan has pointed out something seriously, not trivially, wrong with OPM\u2019s system.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Third, OPM cannot claim that its interpretation is necessary to prevent applicants from resting upon experience that is all \u201cpreparation\u201d and no \u201ctrial,\u201d for there is a perfectly obvious way to guarantee that the applicant has actual trial experience, namely, to require that the applicant have spent a certain number of days in court trying cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">Fourth, OPM cannot easily claim that its practice is administratively necessary to help it segregate \u201creal\u201d trial preparation experience from work not truly related to trial preparation. All that is at issue here is whether OPM will proceed to its next stage of selection when it <em>writes </em>to opposing counsel and the trial judge to determine in some detail what happened in the particular case. OPM remains free to separate \u201cersatz\u201d from \u201creal\u201d in light not only of the applicant\u2019s description but also of what it learns through its correspondence (which it routinely undertakes anyway once past the threshold). This is to say that OPM cannot rest upon a \u201cneed for mechanical rule\u201d justification in an area where it makes subjective, qualitative judgments regardless.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">Fifth, in any event, OPM did not even advance the justifications we have just mentioned. Rather, we might take its justifications to consist of those we have gleaned from the record, prior proceedings, and its briefs in this court. <em>Cf. Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the United States </em>v. <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>-- U.S. --, --, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 2870, 77 L.Ed.2d 443, 462 (1983) (\u201c[A]n agency\u2019s action must be upheld, if at all, on the basis articulated by the agency itself.\u201d). They consist of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">a. OPM points to language in its qualification announcement stating that trial lawyers, relying on trial, rather than administrative law, experience, must show \u201cactual participation in the preparation <em>and </em>trial\u201d of cases. This, and other similar language in the announcement interpreted in a com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>monsense manner, however, says that the agency wants lawyers with (1) experience preparing cases for trial and (2) experience trying cases; it does not rigidly insist that all preparation experience must involve a case that actually goes to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">b. OPM points to language at page 11 of its announcement that says the applicant relying upon trial experience must prepare \u201ca list ... of ... court cases which he or she has prepared and tried ... to demonstrate 2 full years (400 workdays).\u201d We doubt that even this language has to be read literally, as OPM has done, to make irrelevant all preparatory experience that is not followed by at least a day of trial. But, even if it did say just that, the existence of the language would merely show that OPM <em>has </em>the practice; it would not justify it.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">c. OPM states that a group of experts, including representatives of the American Bar Association and the federal regulatory agencies, decided on these selection criteria. There is every reason to believe that these experts wanted trial lawyers to have experience trying eases as well as preparing cases for trial. But the record reveals no reason to believe that these experts hoped for, intended, or knew about OPM\u2019s apparently unnecessarily rigid interpretation of this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">d. OPM\u2019s appeals panel added that \u201cit has always been necessary for an applicant to have prepared <em>and </em>presented a case in court in order to receive credit for it as qualifying experience.\u201d This argument is based upon administrative history. But, there is no evidence of a relevant longstanding administrative practice. <em>Cf. NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., </em>416 U.S. 267, 274-75, 94 S.Ct. 1757, 1761-62, 40 L.Ed.2d 134 (1975) (\u201ca court may accord great weight to the longstanding interpretation placed on a statute by an agency charged with its administration\u201d); <em>Massachusetts Trustees of Eastern Gas &amp; Fuel Associates v. United States, </em>377 U.S. 235, 241, 84 S.Ct. 1236, 1241, 12 L.Ed.2d 268 (1964) (\u201cSome weight is due to the consistent interpretation of the Maritime Commission: the agency entrusted with administration of the statute.\u201d). There is nothing in the record to indicate that OPM has hired many trial lawyers in the past or any suggestion that anyone previously challenged the practice here at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">e. A memorandum written by Administrative Law Judge Irving Sommer states that Dugan\u2019s allegation that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-10\">requirements are arbitrary, whimsical, etc. does not merit serious concern. The record of the Office of Administrative Law Judges, Office of Personnel Management, fashioned throughout the years and acknowledged by all knowing members of the bar and bench as one that has seen the appointment of a group of ALJ\u2019s who are fair, intelligent and learned in all facets of the law and procedure is full testimony to the merits of the examination process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">Dugan, however, is not directly attacking the quality of the existing group of Administrative Law Judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">f. We have searched the record for any additional justification for OPM\u2019s practice. We have found nothing except frequent references to the broad discretion that OPM enjoys in selecting ALJs. The government places particular weight upon two such cases, <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Devine, supra, </em>and <em>Bromberg v. Civil Service Commission, supra. </em>The first of these upheld OPM\u2019s decision not to count as litigation experience the applicant\u2019s work in the Advice Division of the Office of General Counsel, where his contact with \u201cformal cases\u201d consisted primarily of preparing Memoranda advising NLRB regional offices to issue complaints or to dismiss cases. The second case upheld the Civil Service Commission\u2019s determination that an applicant who practiced as an Assistant Attorney General in Illinois where he dealt almost exclusively with state revenue matters should receive less credit for experience than a federal lawyer in grade GS15. The OPM decisions and practices in these two cases seem better grounded in reason that the practice at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-13\">Sixth, the record reveals that those OPM officials who specifically focused on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>problem that Dugan raised were skeptical about the value of OPM\u2019s practice. At one point Senator John Chafee, to whom Dugan had sent a letter of complaint, wrote to OPM noting that many of Dugan\u2019s points \u201cappear to be right on target.\u201d In reply, Mr. Arch Ramsay, the acting Director of OPM, stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-4\">I am informed that OALJ, ..., is considering asking applicants to differentiate in describing trial experience as to whether cases that fell short of trial on the merits involved participation in pretrial procedures in court so as to demonstrate experience other than office practice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">In a similar vein, Edward T. Rhodes, the Chairman of the ALJ Appeals Panel wrote that Dugan</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">\u201craises an interesting point ..., that is his concern of how a practicing lawyer in the private arena ... might be eligible to become an Administrative Law Judge in view of their type of practice and settlement percentages.... [I]t would be an interesting statistic to determine how many active ALJ\u2019s qualify from the private sector as opposed to the government sector .... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The record does not reveal the answer to Judge Rhodes\u2019 question.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">In sum, OPM\u2019s practice of counting as relevant experience trial preparation work related to cases that are actually tried, but refusing to count as relevant likely identical experience related to cases that settle, strikes us as unreasonable. It threatens to hinder significantly, rather than to help, achieve the purpose of the regulation that it purports to interpret. OPM has provided no sensible justification for the practice. And, the practice, on its face, does not appear a reasonably necessary adjunct for practical administration of \u25a0 OPM\u2019s ALJ qualifications. Under these circumstances, it seems \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion\u201d within the meaning of the APA. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">We add, lest this case be taken incorrectly as a precedent authorizing strict judicial scrutiny of agency decisions not to hire applicants, that such is not our intent. OPM has not yet evaluated Dugan\u2019s application; it has refused to do so on the basis of a \u201cscreening rule.\u201d We find only that the particular screening criterion that OPM used is, for the reasons set out, unlawful. OPM\u2019s evaluation of a candidate\u2019s qualifications is not here in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">We wish to mention one final matter. The record in this case gives us some reason to fear that OPM may not handle the matter expeditiously. In December 1980 as soon as OPM turned him down, Mr. Dugan wrote OPM asking which cases it had not accepted and why. It took OPM nine months and many letters before it purported to provide a serious answer to this question. That answer, when it finally came, still did not explain which cases were rejected for which reasons. It listed some reasons that are trivial (for example, it says that a major case that Dugan had listed as tried in the Rhode Island federal district court would not count because Dugan had not provided the address of Chief Judge Pettine). It also listed several reasons that are not at issue on this appeal. The lack of clarity in the administrative record, our consequent uncertainty as to whether there are other \u201cthreshold\u201d matters that might lead OPM not to consider Dugan\u2019s application, and the history of delay, lead us to suggest that the district court determine the future course of these proceedings with an eye towards expeditious resolution of the case, keeping in mind its power to \u201ccompel agency action ... [that is] unreasonably delayed.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">\n<em>The district court\u2019s order of dismissal is reversed. The case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b286-13\">In light of the delay appellant has suffered, the fact that his allegations and arguments on appeal proved correct and the fact that the government failed to provide an initial full briefing of the relevant issues, we award double costs to appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
