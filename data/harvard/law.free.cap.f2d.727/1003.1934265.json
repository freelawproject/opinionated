Jonathan Garrett and Christopher Garrett, </em>No. 81-6205, slip op. at 1352 (11th Cir. Jan. 23, 1984), and substitutes the following in its stead:</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-27\">Appellants, Jonathan Garrett and Christopher Garrett, were convicted of violating the federal narcotics laws in' connection with a large drug importation and distribution scheme. They were sentenced to pris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>on terms and fined. In addition, the district court entered an order forfeiting Jonathan Garrett\u2019s yacht. In this appeal, Jonathan Garrett asserts (1) that the district court\u2019s disqualification of retained counsel violated his right to the counsel of his choice; (2) that his prosecution for engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause; (3) that the court erred in denying his motion for a bill of particulars; (4) that the court\u2019s restricting the cross-examination of a government witness violated his right of confrontation; and (5) that his right to a jury trial on the forfeiture issue was not properly waived. Christopher Garrett argues (1) that the admission of a non-testifying codefendant\u2019s confessions deprived him of his right of confrontation and (2) that his joint trial with a defendant against whom the bulk of the evidence was offered did not satisfy the constitutional requirement of a fair trial. We remand for further proceedings with respect to the forfeiture order and affirm in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">Between 1976 and 1981, Jonathan Garrett and his brother, Christopher, were involved in an extensive marijuana importation and distribution operation. Directed primarily by Jonathan, this scheme entailed off-loading, transport and storage, as well as meetings and telephone calls, in several states, including Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Texas and Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-6\">In March 1981, Jonathan Garrett was charged in Washington with importing marijuana, aiding and abetting the possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, and traveling in interstate commerce for the purpose of facilitating the importation of marijuana. He pleaded guilty to the importation charge and was sentenced to five years.imprisonment and fined $15,000. In July 1981, appellants and four others were indicted in Florida for violating the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952, and various sections of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1094-7\">When Jonathan Garrett was arraigned in August 1981, the government moved the district court to disqualify the attorney whom he had hired, one Marger, stating that the attorney was a target of the investigation and had been identified as a participant in the scheme, and suggesting that he was a potential defendant and a potential witness. Marger denied any impropriety, attempted to explain why the allegations were false and requested a hearing. The court nevertheless granted the government\u2019s motion. Having appointed another attorney to represent Garrett, the court denied subsequent motions to allow Marger to serve as counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-8\">In September 1981, Jonathan Garrett filed a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds, asserting that his conviction in Washington on a marijuana importation charge barred prosecution on a continuing criminal enterprise charge which encompassed, <em>inter alia, </em>the Washington importation operation. He also filed a motion for a bill of particulars, requesting that the government provide the details of each incident relied upon to establish \u201ca continuing series of violations\u201d in connection with the continuing criminal enterprise charge. Both motions were denied as was Christopher Garrett\u2019s motion for severance. Appellants and their codefendants were tried jointly by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-9\">Jonathan Garrett was convicted of conspiracy to import marijuana (21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952, 960, 963) (Count I), conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute (21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841, 846) (Count II), use of telephone to facilitate illicit drug activity (21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 963, 846, 843(b)) (Count VII), and engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848) (Count XI); he was acquitted on another telephone misuse charge (Count VIII). Christopher Garrett was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute (Count II), but was acquitted on the conspiracy to import charge (Count I) and on a telephone misuse charge (Count VI). On Counts I, II and VII, Jonathan was sentenced to consecutive prison terms totaling fourteen years and was fined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>$45,000. With regard to Count XI, he was sentenced to forty years imprisonment, to run concurrently with the other prison terms, and was fined $100,000. Christopher was sentenced to five years imprisonment and was fined $15,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">Finally, the district court ordered that Jonathan Garrett\u2019s interest in a yacht, the <em>Sun Chaser III, </em>be forfeited. Count XI of the indictment, charging Garrett with engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, had alleged that as a result of such activity, he had derived substantial resources subject to forfeiture, including the <em>Sun Chaser III. </em>During a conference conducted in chambers by the court with counsel, Garrett\u2019s attorney had stated that he had no objection to the forfeiture issue being resolved by the judge after the jury returned a verdict on the issue of guilt. After trial, the court determined that forfeiture was warranted notwithstanding evidence indicating that others also had an interest in the vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"A37\">II. JONATHAN GARRETT\u2019S CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"AD2\">A. Disqualification of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">Jonathan Garrett asserts that the disqualification of Marger, whom he had retained as counsel, violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Specifically, he claims that he had an absolute right to the counsel of his choice irrespective of any potential infirmities.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This case, however, falls squarely within our decision in <em>United States v. Hobson, </em>672 F.2d 825 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 906, 103 S.Ct. 208, 74 L.Ed.2d 166 (1982), in which we stated, \u201c[t]he right to counsel of choice is not absolute ... and must give way where its vindication would create a serious risk of undermining public confidence in the integrity of our legal system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 828. In <em>Hobson, </em>the defendant was charged with violating the federal narcotics laws. Relying upon the affidavits of two witnesses implicating one of the defendant\u2019s attorneys in the criminal operation, the district court entered a disqualification order. In so doing, the court concluded that evidence of the attorney\u2019s involvement might be offered and, if so, would possibly create the appearance of impropriety on the attorney\u2019s part and would bring before the jury an issue of the attorney\u2019s credibility which would operate to the defendant\u2019s detriment. On appeal, the court applied the two-pronged test for disqualification of an attorney under Canon 9 of Florida\u2019s Code of Professional Responsibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-9\">First, although there need not be proof of actual wrongdoing, \u201cthere must be at least a reasonable possibility that some specifically identifiable impropriety did in fact occur.\u201d Second, \u201ca court must also find that the likelihood of public suspicion or obloquy outweighs the social interest which will be served by a lawyer\u2019s continued participation in a particular case.\u201d \u201cUnder Canon 9, an attorney should be disqualified only when both of these standards have been satisfied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1095-10\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted) (quoting <em>Woods v. Covington County Bank, </em>537 F.2d 804, 813 (5th Cir.1976)). Concluding that the district court\u2019s findings of fact were not clearly erroneous and that the court properly applied the relevant ethical standards, the court affirmed the order disqualifying retained counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1095-11\">In this case, the two-pronged test was also satisfied. First, the prosecutor informed the district court that the government expected to show \u201cpositive potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>testimony against Mr. Marger,\u201d and testimony at trial described \u201cspecifically identifiable impropriety\u201d on Marger\u2019s part and established a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that the impropriety occurred. In particular, Norman Vick, a participant in the drug operation, testified that Marger recovered Garrett\u2019s purchase money after an aborted attempt to buy a 70-foot shrimp trawler for smuggling purposes. Vick and another participant in the drug operation, Joel Knowles, testified that Marger was involved in an aborted effort to steal a 160-foot oil field supply boat again for smuggling purposes. Knowles also testified that he used Marger\u2019s office to contact Garrett in connection with the operation. Although these allegations may be false, this evidence no doubt would have raised the possibility of misconduct in the jurors\u2019 minds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">With respect to the second prong of the test, we conclude that the likelihood of public suspicion outweighed the social interests in Marger\u2019s continued representation of Garrett. Although Marger\u2019s familiarity with Garrett\u2019s situation was valuable, he was not irreplaceable. Moreover, the testimony of Vick and Knowles portrayed Garrett\u2019s attorney as having engaged in unlawful activities and thus would have undermined his credibility before the jury. Because this testimony was not inherently or facially incredible, Marger\u2019s continued representation of Garrett probably would have resulted in the erosion of public confidence in the integrity of the bar and of the legal system. We therefore hold that the district court\u2019s disqualification of retained counsel did not violate Garrett\u2019s rights under the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">Our closing remarks in <em>Hobson </em>are equally appropriate in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1096-6\">We are aware that [the defendant] has indicated that he would be willing to waive any ethical problems in order to have the benefit of his attorney\u2019s continued representation in this case. The defendant is not free to waive the problem presented here, however, because the [alleged] ethical violation involves public perception of the lawyer and the legal system rather than some difficulty in the attorney\u2019s effective representation of [the defendant].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1096-9\">672 F.2d at 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-10\">While we hold that Garrett\u2019s rights were not violated, we are disturbed by the district court\u2019s failure to conduct a hearing or require affidavits confirming that accusations against Garrett\u2019s attorney would likely be elicited at trial, or that the attorney was a probable defendant or witness. Such steps would have made it clear in advance of the disqualification at trial that there was a reasonable possibility that impropriety did occur and that the likelihood of public suspicion outweighed the social interests in continued representation. Accordingly, this procedure would remove what might be viewed as prosecutorial discretion from the disqualification determination, would eliminate the incentive for the government to offer evidence at trial against a non-defendant attorney, and would avoid reversal on appeal on Sixth Amendment grounds where the evidence at trial fails to support the disqualification. That notwithstanding, we uphold the disqualification in this case since the evidence adduced at trial plainly satisfied the two-pronged test.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1096-11\">B. Double Jeopardy</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-12\">Invoking the Double Jeopardy Clause, Garrett contends that his conviction in Washington for importing marijuana barred the subsequent prosecution in Florida for engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848. Relying on the former Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>664 F.2d 971 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>457 U.S. 1136, 102 S.Ct. 2965, 73 L.Ed.2d 1354, 459 U.S. 906, 103 S.Ct. 208, 74 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>166 (1982), we hold that Garrett\u2019s prosecution in Florida under section 848 after his conviction in Washington for importation did not violate the guarantee against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">The appellant in <em>Phillips </em>claimed that his conviction for aiding and abetting the importation of marijuana precluded a later prosecution for engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise encompassing the same activity. Citing <em>United States v. Ruigomez, </em>576 F.2d 1149 (5th Cir.1978), he argued that the aiding and abetting offense was a transaction within a larger unified conspiracy, the continuing criminal enterprise, and that the government was barred from proceeding with multiple prosecutions, even for substantive offenses, if there was a unified conspiracy. Noting that <em>Ruigomez </em>merely prohibits the government from carving up a single conspiracy into multiple conspiracy prosecutions, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1097-6\">[The defendant] asserts that in the situation in which a defendant is charged under \u00a7 848, the perpetration of constituent substantive offenses is \u201cpart and parcel\u201d of the large conspiracy-type offense. Indeed, this is true. Underlying violations are the very matters that trigger the applicability of \u00a7 848. <em>Jeffers v. United States, supra, </em>432 U.S. 137, 97 S.Ct. 2207, 53 L.Ed.2d 168 [ (1977) ], does not support [the defendant\u2019s] claim that a prior substantive narcotics charge which is committed in the operation of a continuing criminal enterprise precludes a later \u00a7 848 prosecution. <em>Jeffers </em>indicates that a prosecution for conspiracy to distribute narcotics in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 is a lesser included offense of \u00a7 848 because \u00a7 848 requires proof of an agreement among the persons participating in the continuing criminal enterprise and thus requires proof of every fact necessary to show a violation under \u00a7 848 as well as proof of several additional elements. <em>Jeffers </em>does not stand for the proposition that a prior prosecution for a <em>substantive </em>offense bars a later continuing criminal enterprise prosecution under \u00a7 848.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1097-9\">664 F.2d at 1009 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-10\">Although the <em>Phillips </em>court focused largely on the concept of a unified conspiracy, the case is most fairly read as holding that a substantive predicate offense under Title 21 does not constitute a lesser-included offense of \u00a7 848 and thus double jeopardy does not attach to the underlying offense so as to bar a subsequent \u00a7 848 prosecution. In rejecting the appellant\u2019s claim, the court essentially held that the substantive constituent offense and the continuing criminal enterprise, even if parts of a single large conspiracy, were distinct for double jeopardy purposes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because the present case is indistinguishable from <em>Phillips, </em>we conclude that Garrett\u2019s successive conviction for marijuana importation and prosecution under \u00a7 848 comported with the requirements of the Double Jeopardy Clause. <em>See also United States v. Smith, </em>690 F.2d 748, 750 (9th Cir.1982), <em>cert. </em>denied, -- U.S. --, 103 S.Ct. 1435, 75 L.Ed.2d 793 (1983) (reversing conspiracy conviction as lesser-included offense of \u00a7 848, but affirming without discussion conviction on substantive counts); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>575 F.2d 1347, 1354 (5th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 907, 99 S.Ct. 1214, 59 L.Ed.2d 454 (1979) (same); <em>cf. United States v. Barnes, </em>604 F.2d 121, 155-56 (2nd Cir.1979), <em>cert. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number><em>denied, </em>446 U.S. 907, 100 S.Ct. 1833, 64 L.Ed.2d 260 (1980) (affirming additional sentence for substantive violations imposed on defendant given maximum sentence for \u00a7 848 conviction).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-4\">C. Denial of Bill of Particulars</p>\n<p id=\"A5JT\">Garrett argues that the district court erred in denying the motion for a bill of particulars in which he requested the government to \u201c[s]tate specifically what violations are referred to, and their dates and participants, for each incident relied upon to prove \u2018a continuing series of violations\u2019 \u201d with respect to Count XI. In its response to Garrett\u2019s motion, the government asserted that \u201c[t]he indictment in this case is a thorough and complete statement of the charges against the Defendant\u201d and that together with other government submissions, the indictment \u201csufficiently apprises the Defendant of the charges against him to allow him to prepare his defense....\u201d On appeal, the government points out that the discovery documents produced at trial provided Garrett with adequate notice of the incidents relied upon to prove the continuing criminal enterprise charge and that Garrett was at no time unable to cross-examine a government witness because of unfamiliarity with the circumstances elicited on direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-5\">The standard of review with respect to a motion for a bill of particulars was articulated in <em>United States v. Colson, </em>662 F.2d 1389 (11th Cir.1981). There this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1098-6\">The purpose of a bill of particulars is to inform the defendant of the charge in sufficient detail to enable adequate defense preparation and to minimize surprise at trial. Grant or denial of such a motion lies within the sound discretion of the trial court and may be challenged only for abuse of that discretion. Proof of abuse requires a showing of actual surprise at trial and prejudice to the defendant\u2019s substantial rights by the denial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"anq-dedup-0\"><em>Id. </em>at 1391 (citations omitted). We note that Garrett offers only the general assertion that he was not given adequate notice of the predicate offenses and that he fails to specify any evidence adduced by the government with which he was not already acquainted. Insofar as Garrett makes no \u201cshowing of actual surprise at trial and prejudice,\u201d we find no abuse of discretion in the denial of Garrett\u2019s motion for a bill of particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-9\">D. Restriction of Cross-Examination</p>\n<p id=\"AP49\">Garrett claims that in restricting defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Thomas Ruth, a participant in the drug operation, the district court deprived him of his Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him. After testifying for the government, Ruth was subjected to extensive cross-examination by defense lawyers. He testified that he had been arrested while trying to sell marijuana in an unrelated incident; that he had been told by law enforcement officers that he might receive a prison term of at least five years; that upon receipt of immunity from prosecution, he had cooperated by detailing his participation in drug smuggling activities; that he had subsequently received funds from the government; and that he had testified for the government in an unrelated case. He also stated on cross-examination that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>had once overseen an off-loading operation. At that point, defense counsel sought to ask whether Ruth had been advised by the government that because of his supervisory role, he could be charged with engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-5\">At the bench conference following the government\u2019s objection, defense counsel said that he intended to show that Ruth\u2019s motive for cooperating with the government was to avoid being sentenced to a minimum of ten years and a maximum of life under section 848. Counsel for the government responded that the jury should not be made aware of the range of sentences which could be imposed if the defendant were convicted. In open court, the district judge asked Ruth, \u201c[h]as anybody with the government ever advised you of the possibility or that you could be indicted for what is known as a continuing criminal enterprise?\u201d Ruth replied, \u201c[n]o, sir.\u201d As the cross-examination continued, Ruth related that he had never discussed with his attorney the types of federal crimes for which he could have been prosecuted absent the grant of immunity and that he had not been advised of the possibility of the government\u2019s securing forfeiture of his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-6\">In <em>United States v. Tolliver, </em>665 F.2d 1005 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 935, 102 S.Ct. 1991, 72 L.Ed.2d 455 (1982), this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1099-7\">The extent of cross-examination with respect to an appropriate subject of inquiry is generally within the sound discretion of the trial court, and the trial court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed on review unless an abuse of discretion is present. There is, however, a sphere which a trial judge may not impinge, for the \u201cdiscretionary authority to limit cross-examination comes into play only after there has been permitted as a matter of right sufficient cross-examination to satisfied the Sixth Amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1099-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1008 (citations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Sonntag, </em>684 F.2d 781, 788 (11th Cir.1981) (\u201cas long as the limitation [of cross-examination] does not interfere with the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation, this ruling is also discretionary with the trial court.\u201d); <em>United States v. Varella, </em>692 F.2d 1352, 1355 (11th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>-- U.S. --, 103 S.Ct. 3542, 77 L.Ed.2d 1392 (1983) (right to confront \u201cis not unlimited, and the extent of cross-examination is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court\u201d). We recognize that where a prosecution witness has been threatened with a criminal charge or actually charged with a criminal offense, the defendant is entitled to explore those circumstances on cross-examination in order to bring to the jury\u2019s attention the witness\u2019 possible motive or self-interest with respect to the testimony given. <em>See Greene v. Wainwright, </em>634 F.2d 272, 274 (5th Cir.1981). In this case, however, we conclude that the district court\u2019s limited interference with the cross-examination of Ruth constituted neither an infringement of Garrett\u2019s confrontation right nor an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-12\">The scope of the cross-examination allowed with respect to Ruth was quite broad. Defense lawyers were permitted to inquire into the circumstances of his arrest, the fact that he struck a deal with the government whereby he would cooperate in exchange for immunity from a crime carrying a five-year minimum prison term, his status as a paid government witness, and the extent of his understanding of the various crimes with which he could have been charged. Indeed, the trial judge ruled out but a single line of questioning, and did so only after ascertaining that the witness had no knowledge of the subject. Both the judge\u2019s colloquy with the witness and defense counsel\u2019s subsequent cross-examination confirm that there was no basis in fact for the proposed line of questioning. Although the judge\u2019s questioning could have been more thorough, the record supports his implicit finding that further interrogation regarding a possible continuing criminal enterprise charge would not have exposed a source of bias on the witness\u2019 part. We therefore conclude that Garrett was afforded sufficient cross-examination to satisfy the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>We note also that pursuit of the proposed line of questioning would have revealed to the jury the severity of the sentence to which Garrett, if convicted, would have been subjected. Because such information would have been extrinsic and prejudicial, the trial court was certainly justified in preventing defense counsel from eliciting it. Hence we conclude that the court acted well within the exercise of its discretion in restricting the cross-examination of Ruth.</p>\n<p id=\"A6b\">E. Improper Waiver of Jury Right</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">Jonathan Garrett\u2019s final objection is that his Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury at the forfeiture stage was not properly waived inasmuch as there was only an oral waiver by counsel, not a written waiver by Garrett himself. First, we must determine whether there is a right to a trial by jury at the forfeiture stage of a proceeding under section 848 and, if so, whether a defendant\u2019s waiver of that right must be in writing. A forfeiture pursuant to the provisions of section 848 is plainly a criminal, as opposed to civil, matter. As the Third Circuit has observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-5\">Unlike the traditional <em>in rem </em>forfeiture proceeding against contraband or articles put to use in criminal activities, <em>see, e.g., </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881 (1976), criminal forfeiture proceedings of Sections 848(a)(2) are <em>in personam. Cf. </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1968 (1976) (the <em>in personam </em>criminal forfeiture provisions of RICO).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1100-6\"><em>United States v. Long, </em>654 F.2d 911, 914 (3d Cir.1981). It follows that under the Sixth Amendment, a criminal defendant is entitled to a jury trial on the issue whether a particular asset is forfeitable. Accordingly, Rule 31 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides, \u201c[i]f the indictment or the information alleges that an interest or property is subject to criminal forfeiture, a special verdict shall be returned as to the extent of the interest or property subject to forfeiture, if any.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 31(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-7\">It is equally evident that waiver of a defendant\u2019s jury right in a section 848 forfeiture proceeding must be in writing. Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure explicitly states, \u201c[c]ases required to be tried by jury shall be so tried unless the defendant waives a jury trial in writing with the approval of the court and the consent of the government.\u201d Fed.R. Crim.P. 23(a). We see no reason to hold this rule inapplicable to those stages of a section 848 proceeding which follow a guilty verdict.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1100-10\">Next, we must determine whether Garrett has made out a valid claim of improper waiver. We begin with the observation that the purpose of Rule 23(a) is to ensure that a criminal defendant is aware of his jury right before waiving it and that any waiver is personal and unequivocal. In order to maintain its effectiveness in protecting the underlying constitutional guarantee, we require strict compliance with the rule. Thus reversal is warranted where there is no written waiver signed by the defendant in the record and the defendant asserts either that he was unaware of his jury right or that he did not consent to its waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-11\">This is not to say that the court will invariably grant relief for purely technical violations of the rule, as where a defendant knowingly acquiesced in a waiver which was never reduced to writing. If the defendant admits, or the government plainly demonstrates, that at the time of the waiver the defendant was not ignorant of his jury right and consented to the waiver, reversal would not be in order, for the defendant cannot complain on appeal of an alleged error invited or induced by himself. <em>See United States v. Page, </em>661 F.2d 1080, 1082-83 (5th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 1018, 102 S.Ct. 1713, 72 L.Ed.2d 136 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-12\">It is unclear from Garrett\u2019s appellate briefs whether he presents us with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>purely technical claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, the record is silent as to whether Garrett was in fact cognizant of his jury right and agreed to counsel\u2019s oral waiver, hence inviting error by remaining silent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We therefore remand to the district court for an evidentia-ry hearing on this issue. Unless the government succeeds in proving Garrett\u2019s knowledge and consent, express or implied, Garrett must be afforded a new trial, before a jury, on the forfeiture issue; only if the augmented record firmly establishes Garrett\u2019s knowledge and consent will the forfeiture order stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-4\">In concluding, we note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APE\">that it would have been better to do as the rule directs and that much could be said for enforcing it strictly as to such an entire waiver of jury trial. The right involved is a precious one; and a mechanical application of the express, bright-line provision of Rule 23(a) safeguarding it would not be wholly amiss: no written waiver signed by the defendant, no bench trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\"><em>Page, </em>661 F.2d at 1081 (footnote omitted). Although we recognize the invited error exception introduced in <em>Page </em>and, in this case, remand for an evidentiary hearing, we emphasize that the exception is a narrow one and that under Rule 23(a) the primary responsibility for protecting the right to trial by jury rests on trial judges and prosecutors. Having explicitly held that the Sixth Amendment and Rule 23(a) apply to forfeiture proceedings under section 848, we will uphold a bench trial on the forfeiture issue conducted without a signed waiver only in an extraordinary case such as <em>Page.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-7\">III. CHRISTOPHER GARRETT\u2019S CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-8\">A. <em>Bruton </em>Violation</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-9\">Christopher Garrett argues that admission of the incriminating confession of a non-testifying codefendant, Jonathan Garrett, abridged his Sixth Amendment right of cross-examination. In <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), the Supreme Court held that where there is a substantial risk that the jury, despite instructions to the contrary, will look to the incriminating extrajudicial statements of one codefendant in determining the guilt of another codefendant, admission of the former\u2019s confession in a joint trial violates the latter\u2019s confrontation right. Subsequent decisions establish that in order to invoke the <em>Bruton </em>doctrine, the confession in question must directly, rather than indirectly, implicate the complaining defendant. <em>See United States v. Castro, </em>596 F.2d 674, 676 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 963, 100 S.Ct. 448, 62 L.Ed.2d 375 (1979); <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>579 F.2d 356, 359 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 936, 99 S.Ct. 332, 58 L.Ed.2d 332 (1978); <em>United States v. Hicks, </em>524 F.2d 1001, 1003 (5th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 956, 96 S.Ct. 1417, 47 L.Ed.2d 353 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-10\">In this case, government witnesses related out-of-court statements in which Jonathan Garrett, who did not take the stand, referred to \u201cunderlings\u201d and \u201ccharges\u201d in connection with his drug smuggling scheme. These isolated references to anonymous subordinates by no means directly implicated Christopher Garrett. Given the extensiveness of the activities to which Jonathan confessed, it was obvious, without his say<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>ing so, that others were involved. In confirming that he received the assistance of others, however, he did not provide the slightest hint as to their particular identities. Here, unlike in <em>Serio v. United States, </em>401 F.2d 989 (D.C.Cir.1968), which Christopher cites in support of his claim, there was not \u201cthe well-nigh inevitable association of [the defendant] as the \u2018other man\u2019 referred to in [his codefendant\u2019s] confession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 990.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\">In view of the non-inculpatory nature of the confession, as well as the cautionary instruction given by the trial court, we conclude that there was no substantial risk that the jury looked to Jonathan\u2019s confession as bearing on Christopher\u2019s guilt. We therefore hold that admission of the confession did not infringe Christopher Garrett\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">B. Transference of Guilt</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-6\">Finally, Christopher Garrett asserts that the trial court\u2019s instructions were insufficient to prevent the jury from confusing him with his brother and that severance was required to prevent the prejudicial effect of the charges and evidence against his brother from \u201cspilling over\u201d onto him. We conclude that the safeguards employed or available adequately dealt with any potential confusion and that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to sever appellants\u2019 trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-7\">The dangers of confusion and \u201cspillover\u201d were directly addressed by the trial court\u2019s specific instruction that \u201c[e]ach offense and the evidence pertaining to it should be considered separately. Also, the case of each Defendant should be considered separately and individually.\u201d In addition, the availability of cross-examination provided defense counsel with the opportunity to dispell any confusion occasioned by the vague or erroneous testimony of prosecution witnesses. As for the possibility that the jury was influenced by the abundant evidence against Jonathan in passing on Christopher\u2019s guilt, the numerous questions posed by the jury to the court during deliberations and the fact that the jury acquitted Christopher on all but one count (of which the evidence of guilt was compelling) indicate that the jury carefully considered the evidence supporting each charge against each of the defendants. <em>See United States v. Phillips, </em>664 F.2d 971, 1017 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>457 U.S. 1136, 102 S.Ct. 2965, 73 L.Ed.2d 1354, 459 U.S. 906, 103 S.Ct. 208, 74 L.Ed.2d 166 (1982); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>661 F.2d 436, 453 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 991, 102 S.Ct. 2274, 73 L.Ed.2d 1287, 457 U.S. 1137, 102 S.Ct. 2967, 73 L.Ed.2d 1355, 459 U.S. 832, 103 S.Ct. 72, 74 L.Ed.2d 71 (1982); <em>United States v. Zicree, </em>605 F.2d 1381, 1389 (5th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 966, 100 S.Ct. 1656, 64 L.Ed.2d 242 (1980); <em>Tillman v. United States, </em>406 F.2d 930, 936 (5th Cir.), <em>vacated in part on other grounds, </em>395 U.S. 830, 89 S.Ct. 2143, 23 L.Ed.2d 742 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-9\">As the former Fifth Circuit pointed out in <em>Phillips:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1102-10\">Denial of a motion for severance is reversible only for an abuse of discretion and a showing of compelling prejudice must be made before a trial court\u2019s ruling will constitute an abuse of discretion .... The remedy of severance is justified only if the prejudice flowing from a joint trial is clearly beyond the curative powers of a cautionary instruction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1102-11\">664 F.2d at 1016-17 (citations omitted). This court has repeatedly stated that \u201c[i]n order to demonstrate an abuse of discretion, the defendant must establish that the joint trial subjected him not just to some prejudice, but to compelling prejudice against which the district court could not afford protection.\u201d <em>United States v. Harper, </em>680 F.2d 731, 733 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied, -- U.S. --, 103 S.Ct. 229, 74 L.Ed.2d 182 (1982); <em>see also United States v. Kabbaby, </em>672 F.2d 857, 861 (11th Cir.1982) (\u201cdefendant bears a heavy burden in demonstrating clear and compelling prejudice\u201d); <em>United States v. Tombrello, </em>666 F.2d 485, 492 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 994, 102 S.Ct. 2279, 73 L.Ed.2d 1291 (1982) (\u201cdefendant ... must demonstrate compelling prejudice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>against which the trial court will be unable to afford protection\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">We conclude that in this case the jury could \u201ccollate and appraise the independent evidence against each defendant solely upon that defendant\u2019s own acts, statements and conduct,\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>664 F.2d at 1017, and that the problem of the jury\u2019s confounding the two Garretts was minimized. Since Christopher Garrett is unable to demonstrate compelling prejudice, we hold that the denial of his motion for severance did not render his trial unfair and was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">AFFIRMED in part and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1095-7\">. At the trial level, Garrett objected to the disqualification, but did not specifically argue that the right to counsel of choice is absolute. In response to the government\u2019s motion for disqualification, Marger denied involvement in the drug scheme and sought to explain the allegations against him. And in moving to allow Marger to represent Garrett, appointed counsel attempted to prove that the potential problem of Marger\u2019s being called as a defense witness would be obviated by the stipulation of all defense counsel. Garrett argues for the first time on appeal that he had the right to choose Marger as his counsel regardless of the accusations against him and his potential status as a defendant or witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1095-13\">. Although the opinion in <em>Hobson </em>was not unanimous, <em>see </em>672 F.2d at 829 (Kravitch, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part), we are, of course, bound by this precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1096-7\">. Before the trial court and on appeal, Marger and Garrett have intimated that <em>Marger </em>was entitled to a hearing prior to disqualification. Insofar as Marger is not a party to this appeal and there is no indication that Garrett has standing to assert Marger\u2019s rights, we decline to address the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1098-7\">. We realize that there is not unanimity among the circuits on this issue. <em>See United States v. Samuelson, </em>697 F.2d 255, 260 (8th Cir.1983) (because substantive offenses actually relied on in establishing a continuing criminal enterprise may be considered lesser-included offenses of \u00a7 848, double jeopardy bars conviction and sentence on both substantive and continuing criminal enterprises charges); <em>United States v. Middleton, </em>673 F.2d 31, 33 (1st Cir.1982) (same); <em>cf. United States v. Gomberg, </em>715 F.2d 843, 851 (3d Cir.1983) (double jeopardy bars cumulative sentences for substantive predicate offense and continuing criminal enterprise); <em>United States v. Jefferson, </em>714 F.2d 689, 703 (7th Cir.1983) (same). Because we are bound by the <em>Phillips </em>decision, <em>see Stein v. Reynolds Securities, Inc., </em>667 F.2d 33, 34 (11th Cir.1982), however, we have not independently compared the elements of the offenses, <em>see Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), or inquired into legislative intent, <em>see Missouri v. </em>Hunter, -- U.S. --, 103 S.Ct. 673, 74 L.Ed.2d 535, 542 (1983); <em>Albernaz v. United States, </em>450 U.S. 333, 344, 101 S.Ct. 1137, 1145, 67 L.Ed.2d 275 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1097-7\">. It is arguable that <em>Phillips could </em>have been decided on the ground that because the jury found several other offenses which could have been used as predicates for the \u00a7 848 conviction, the aiding and abetting offense was not <em>necessarily </em>used as a predicate offense and therefore could not be regarded as a lesser-included offense of \u00a7 848. After reexamining the opinion, however, we conclude that <em>Phillips </em>was not in fact decided on this more narrow ground. There is certainly no language in the opinion clearly stating that a conviction for a substantive offense takes on double jeopardy implications when used to establish the continuing criminal enterprise in a subsequent \u00a7 848 prosecution. Moreover, even if the <em>Phillips </em>court did adopt this alternative holding, our disposition of Garrett\u2019s double jeopardy claim would be the same. To the extent that Garrett was convicted of three Title 21 violations which could have served as constituent offenses, the government did not necessarily rely on the Washington importation and thus Garrett\u2019s conviction and sentence under \u00a7 848 should not be disturbed. In any event, we express no opinion on the correctness of this approach.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1100-8\">. Thus we reject the government\u2019s distinction between the trial on the issue of guilt and subsequent determinations, and the government\u2019s characterization of forfeiture as \u201cessentially a matter of punishment\u201d indistinguishable from ordinary sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1101-6\">. In his main brief, Garrett does not assert that he was denied the right to a jury trial; rather, he urges reversal on the ground that the record contains \u201cneither a written waiver by appellant nor any indication that he was ever made aware of his rights to a jury trial on the forfeiture issue, let alone waived said right.\u201d In his reply brief, however, Garrett states that \u201chis attorney in a chambers conference, which appellant neither attended nor was he aware of, waived jury on the forfeiture. Thus, appellee is incorrect when it claims that all the \u2018relevant parties\u2019 agreed to the jury waiver. Appellant did not .... The bottom line is that Garrett was denied his constitutional as well as statutory right to a jury determination of the forfeiture issue as to the <em>Sun Chaser III.\u201d</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1101-12\">. The silence of the record may be attributed in large part to Garrett\u2019s failure to challenge the jury right waiver in his motion for a new trial or otherwise to bring this issue to the trial judge\u2019s attention.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
