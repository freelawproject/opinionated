Howard, a defendant in the pending action, sought the writ to attach property of Joseph Rascio and Mary Lou Rascio, against whom it asserts a cross-claim. This court granted an injunction pending appeal preventing the Rascios from removing from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>the district of New Jersey the property sought to be attached. The Rascios have moved before this court to dissolve that injunction. We deny that motion, and we reverse the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Agents Auto Recovery Service, a firm operated by Joseph and Mary Lou Rascio, repossesses automobiles financed by lenders such as Howard. The firm repossessed an automobile operated by John Britton. Brit-ton filed a diversity action in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey charging Howard with conversion, false imprisonment, and assault and battery in connection with that repossession. Because Agents Auto had undertaken by contract to defend and indemnify Howard, and to carry comprehensive liability insurance against claims arising out of its repossession business, Howard cross-claimed against the Rascios. Prior to the filing of Britton\u2019s diversity suit, however, Howard had already commenced suit in the Superior Court of New Jersey to enforce the terms of a settlement agreement between Britton and Howard. On January 24, 1983, the district court stayed the diversity action except for the limited purpose of discovery to ascertain the citizenship of the Rascios.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">After entry of the January 24 stay order, Howard sought unsuccessfully to serve process on the Rascios. While they were avoiding process, and avoiding negotiations with Howard\u2019s representatives, Howard became aware that it had issued four certificates of deposit in the name of Mary Lou Delesso, and that Mary Lou Delesso and Mary Lou Rascio were one and the same. Fearing that the Rascios were about to remove themselves and their property from the State of New Jersey, Howard moved on March 22, 1983 for a writ of attachment, and for an order lifting the stay of proceedings, for the limited purpose of permitting the attachment of the four certificates of deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">The district court denied these motions, expressing \u201cserious doubts\u201d about the validity of New Jersey\u2019s attachment statutes in light of <em>Shaffer v. Heitner, </em>433 U.S. 186, 97 S.Ct. 2569, 53 L.Ed.2d 683 (1977). This appeal, and the injunction pending appeal, followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">New Jersey law provides two statutory grounds for attachment pertinent to Howard\u2019s cross-claim:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-13\">a. Where the facts would entitle plaintiff to an order of arrest before judgment in a civil action ...; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-14\">b. Where the defendant absconds or is a nonresident of this state, and a summons cannot be served on him in this state ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-15\">N.J.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 2A:26-2(a), (b) (West 1952). An order of arrest (or <em>capias ad </em>respondendum) \u201cshall issue in an action founded on a contract, express or implied ... when the proof establishes ... [t]hat defendant is about to remove any of his property out of the jurisdiction of the court .. . with intent to defraud his creditors; or ... [tjhat defendant fraudulently contracted the debt or incurred the demand.\u201d N.J. StatAnn. \u00a7 2A:15-42(a), (d) (West 1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-16\">A. <em>Howard Would be Entitled to an Order of Arrest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-17\">The record on which the district court acted consisted of the pleadings and four affidavits, which establish two bases on which Howard would be entitled to a <em>capias ad respondendum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-18\">1. <em>Removal of assets with intent to defraud</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-19\">A process server employed by Howard attested that he had attempted to serve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Joseph and Mary Lou Rascio on five occasions, each time unsuccessfully, at the address identified in Howard\u2019s records as their residence. On the fifth occasion he learned that a new tenant occupied the apartment. Britton\u2019s attorney also attested to difficulties in serving Agents Auto by mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">A Howard loan officer attested that Joseph Rascio had informed him that Rascio \u201cand his wife expected to be leaving New Jersey shortly to operate their business on the west coast and in the midwest.\u201d App. at 32. The loan officer attested further that Rascio informed him that one of his employees \u201chad already left and was working in California,\u201d that Agents Auto \u201cwas no longer in the business of auto repossession,\u201d and that Agents Auto \u201chad absolutely no comprehensive liability insurance.\u201d App. at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Another Howard employee attested that Mary Lou Delesso spoke to her at the Bank \u201cand indicated that she would be withdrawing the monies upon maturity of the Certificates of Deposit.\u201d App. at 46. This same employee attested that Joseph Rascio and Mary Lou Delesso had sought a mortgage from Howard under the name Agents Auto Recovery Service, leading her to believe that Joseph Rascio and Mary Lou Delesso are the principals in the business conducted under that trade name.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Aside from these four affidavits, there was no other record evidence before the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They establish prima facie that the Rascios, faced with a lawsuit for which they should have planned by obtaining comprehensive liability insurance, sought to remove assets from New Jersey with intent to defraud Howard. N.J.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2A:15-42(a) (West 1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">2. <em>Fraudulent contract</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">There is also uncontradicted record evidence that in order to induce Howard to hire Agents Auto to repossess motor vehicles, the Rascios undertook to keep in full force and effect comprehensive general liability insurance of not less than $1 million and to indemnify and hold harmless Howard from all liability arising from the actions of Agents Auto. The contract expressly provided that the liability insurance \u201cwill include protection for the indemnity provisions of this contract.\u201d App. at 38. Prima facie, the Racios induced Howard to give Agents Auto the task of repossessing the automobile operated by Britton by virtue of Howard\u2019s reliance on the existence of insurance coverage that Agents did not obtain. Thus, Howard\u2019s moving papers also satisfied N.J.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 2A:15-42(d) (West 1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">B. <em>Howard Was Entitled to Attach Property of an Absconding Debtor</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">A separate ground for a writ of attachment is provided under New Jersey law for the property of an absconding debt- or. An \u201cabsconding debtor\u201d is one who, \u201cwith intent to defeat or delay the demands of his creditors, conceals or withdraws himself from his usual place of residence beyond the reach of process.\u201d <em>Doughnut Corp. v. Tsakirides, </em>121 N.J.L. 136, 137, 1 A.2d 467, 469 (1938), quoting <em>Stafford v. Gaiser, </em>57 N.J.L. 574, 578, 32 A. 7, 8 (1894). The debtor need not leave the state: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number><em>Stafford v. Gaiser, </em>57 N.J.L. at 578, 32 A. at 8. There is in the affidavits referred to a prima facie case of successful evasion of service of process, both of Britton and of Howard. Thus, Howard\u2019s moving papers establish its entitlement to a writ of attachment under N.J.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 2A:26-2(b) (West 1952) as well.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>It is not necessary that [the debtor] depart from the limits of the state in which he has resided.... [A]ll the law requires, in order to constitute an absconding debtor, is that he shall put himself in such a position that he can and does successfully evade the service of process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>C. <em>Howard\u2019s Moving Papers Satisfied the New Jersey Court Rules Respecting Attachments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">While the substantive grounds for attachment in New Jersey are statutory, the procedural requirements are specified in New Jersey Court Rule 4:60. In response to the decision in <em>Fuentes v. Shevin, </em>407 U.S. 67, 97, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 2002, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972), requiring an adjudication establishing the probable validity of an underlying claim before a debtor\u2019s property may be attached, the New Jersey Supreme Court amended Rule 4:60-5(a) to provide that a writ of attachment shall issue upon a court order.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">The motion shall be granted only upon the court\u2019s finding, based on the moving papers, any opposing affidavits which may have been filed, and any testimony taken ... that (1) there is a probability that final judgment will be rendered in favor of the plaintiff; (2) there are statutory grounds for issuance of the writ; and (3) there is real or personal property of the defendant at a specific location within this state which is subject to attachment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">N.J.Ct.R. 4:60-5(a). The rule contemplates three days notice, except that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">An order for issuance of writ of attachment without notice to the defendant may be entered by the court ... if the defendant is about to abscond or if the court finds from specific facts shown by affidavit or verified complaint that the giving of such notice is likely to defeat the execution of the writ.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">N.J.Ct.R. 4:60 \u2014 5(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">Howard\u2019s moving papers establish that the Rascios were about to abscond, that there are statutory grounds for issuance of the writ, and that there is property in New Jersey subject to attachment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The only remaining requirement is a showing that there is a probability that judgment will be rendered in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-14\">The contract between Howard and Agents Auto unambiguously provides that Agents Auto shall indemnify, defend, and save Howard harmless for any liability to third parties arising from the conduct of employees of Agents Auto. It unambiguously provides, further, that Agents Auto shall carry $1 million in comprehensive liability insurance \u201cwhich will include protection for the indemnity provisions of this Contract.\u201d App. at 38. Howard\u2019s affidavits establish that Agents Auto is not defending it from Britton\u2019s claim, and that Agents Auto did not obtain the liability insurance policy specified in the contract. The construction of an unambiguous written document is in New Jersey a matter of law. <em>Bedrock Foundations v. George H. Brewster &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>31 N J. 124, 133, 155 A.2d 536, 541 (1959); <em>see Suburban Transfer Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Beech Holdings, Inc., </em>716 F.2d 220, 224 n. 6 (3d Cir.1983). The contract, as a matter of law, requires that the Rascios defend Howard against the Britton claim, and to indemnify Howard against any liability which Britton might establish. The Rascios undertook to repossess the Britton vehicle knowing that Howard relied on insurance for that undertaking, which was not provided. Thus there is, as a matter of law on this record, a clear likelihood of success on the merits. Howard\u2019s moving papers satisfied both the New Jersey statutes and the New Jersey court rule respecting issuance of a writ of attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-15\">D. <em>The District Court\u2019s Reasons for Refusing to Issue the Writ are Inadequate</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-16\">The district court refused to issue the writ because of \u201cserious doubts of the validity of New Jersey\u2019s attachment stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>utes\u201d in the wake of <em>Shaffer v. Heitner, </em>433 U.S. 186, 97 S.Ct. 2569, 53 L.Ed.2d 683 (1979). In <em>Shaffer, </em>the Supreme Court held that the assertion of quasi-in-rem jurisdiction by attachment of property must as a matter of due process conform to the minimum contacts standard of <em>International Shoe Co. v. Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945). <em>See </em>433 U.S. at 212, 97 S.Ct. at 2584. New Jersey Court Rule 4:60-5(a) clearly acknowledges the <em>Shaffer </em>rule by providing, in an amendment adopted in the wake of <em>Shaffer, </em>that \u201c[a] writ of attachment shall issue only in cases where the defendant is subject to the exercise of jurisdiction by the State consistent with due process of law.\u201d Nothing in the record suggests that the exercise in New Jersey of adjudicatory authority over the dispute between Howard and the Raseios would violate due process. To the contrary, business cards and advertisements in the record reveal extensive business contacts in New Jersey on the part of the Raseios, <em>see </em>App. at 35-36, and the cross-claim grows out of a contract made in New Jersey for the performance of services on behalf of a New Jersey bank. Thus, the basis on which the district court refused to issue the writ of attachment was completely without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">This Court has Appellate Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">We have set forth a discussion of the requirements under New Jersey law for issuance of a writ of attachment before turning to the question whether the March 23, 1983 order denying the writ is appealable. We did so for two reasons. First, the appellees have not on appeal contended that we lack appellate jurisdiction. Second, an understanding of the New Jersey requirements for the issuance of a writ of attachment is required for determining our jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">In <em>Swift &amp; Co. Packers v. Compania Colombiana Del Caribe S.A., </em>339 U.S. 684, 688-89, 70 S.Ct. 861, 864-65, 94 L.Ed. 1206 (1950), the Supreme Court held that an order dissolving a writ of attachment in admiralty was appealable as a collateral order within the meaning of <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). Justice Frankfurter observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">Appellate review of the order dissolving the attachment at a later date would be an empty rite after the vessel had been released and the restoration of the attachment only theoretically possible.... Under these circumstances the provision for appeals only from final decisions in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 should not be construed so as to deny effective review of a claim fairly severable from the context of a larger litigious process.... The situation is quite different where an attachment is upheld pending determination of the principal claim.... In such a situation the rights of all the parties can be adequately protected while litigation on the main claim proceeds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">339 U.S. at 689, 70 S.Ct. at 865 (citations omitted). What motivated the court to treat the dissolution of an attachment as immediately reviewable was the immediate destruction, <em>pendente lite, </em>of the security provided by attachment of property for whatever judgment might ultimately be recovered. Loss of that security <em>pendente lite </em>could never, after final judgment, be restored. Its destruction <em>pendente lite </em>is a matter entirely distinct from the merits of the dispute, although bearing on the likelihood that a judgment will be paid. Patently, the Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Swift &amp; Co. Packers </em>is as applicable to the <em>pendente lite </em>refusal to issue a writ of attachment as it is to the dissolution of such a writ. Thus, <em>Swift </em>&amp; <em>Co. Packers </em>controls unless subsequent developments have obsoleted its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">One such development which we have considered is the amendment in 1973 of New Jersey Court Rule 4:60-5(a). That amendment, enacted in response to <em>Fuentes v. Shevin, </em>407 U.S. 67, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972), requires that before issuing a writ of attachment, the court find that there is a probability that final judgment will be rendered in the plaintiff\u2019s favor. <em>See </em>407 U.S. at 97, 92 S.Ct. at 2002. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Rule 4:60-5(a), as amended, does require a preliminary finding of probability of success on the merits, and thus to some extent requires consideration of the merits. In <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978), the Supreme Court, rejecting the \u201cdeath knell\u201d doctrine as a basis for section 1291 appeals from orders denying class-action certifications, observed that to come within the class of collaterally final orders under <em>Cohen,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">the order must conclusively determine the disputed question, resolve an important issue <em>completely separate from the merits of the action, </em>and be effectively unre-viewable on appeal from a final judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">437 U.S. at 468, 98 S.Ct. at 2458 (emphasis supplied). The March 23, 1983 order obviously determined conclusively that there would be no <em>pendente lite </em>security for any ultimate judgment. Equally obviously, the absence of <em>pendente lite </em>security will, if no attachment issues, be effectively unreviewable after final hearing, for if Howard obtains a judgment against the Raseios, an appeal by it, from the denial of the motion for an attachment, would at that point be a futile gesture, equally as ineffective as an application for a writ of execution. Thus, we consider the narrow question whether the italicized reference in the quote from <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand </em>should be construed as a bar to review because, under the New Jersey Rule and <em>Fuentes v. Shevin, </em>the trial court must give some limited degree of attention to the merits of the claim of the attaching plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">We hold that <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand </em>made no change in the <em>Swift &amp; Co. Packers </em>rule. What is \u201cseparate from the merits\u201d for purposes of the collateral order doctrine is the separate claim for security <em>pendente lite. </em>That, after all, was the nature of the claim addressed in <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949), a claim for security for costs in a shareholders\u2019 derivative action. Denying the motion for such security in <em>Cohen </em>had the same kind of effect on a statutory right to <em>pendente lite </em>security as did the denial of Howard\u2019s statutory right to <em>pendente lite </em>security in attached property. The <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand </em>Court nowhere suggests that it intended to place claims for such <em>pendente lite </em>security outside section 1291 merely because the right to such security depends in part on a preliminary determination of probable success on the merits of the underlying claim. The claim for security <em>pendente lite </em>is separate because it simply will not survive the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">This reading of the Court\u2019s language in <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand </em>is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s recent treatment of issues of finality both under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257 (1976) and under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1976). The Court has consistently emphasized that the most significant issue with respect to appealability of collateral orders is their effect on parties <em>pendente lite, </em>rather than the relationship of issues already decided to the ultimate merits. <em>See, e.g., Local No. 438 Construction &amp; General Laborers\u2019 Union v. Curry, </em>371 U.S. 542, 546, 83 S.Ct. 531, 534, 9 L.Ed. 514 (1963) (order issuing injunction prohibiting labor picketing appealable; whether injunction should have issued depended on whether complaint made out an \u201carguable violation\u201d of NLRA); <em>Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, </em>420 U.S. 469, 486, 95 S.Ct. 1029, 1041, 43 L.Ed.2d 328 (1975) (challenged state statute would affect first amendment rights <em>pendente lite; </em>determination whether federal issue had been decided \u201carguably wrongly\u201d incorporated in finality analysis); <em>National Socialist Party v. Village of Skokie, </em>432 U.S. 43, 44, 97 S.Ct. 2205, 2206, 53 L.Ed.2d 96 (1977) (per curiam) (order refusing to stay injunction would affect first amendment rights <em>pendente lite; </em>whether stay would issue incorporates consideration of likelihood of success); <em>Abney v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 651, 656-63, 97 S.Ct. 2034, 2038-42, 52 L.Ed.2d 651 (1977) (trial would subject defendant to violation of double jeopardy rights <em>pendente lite; </em>double jeopardy issue requires analysis of whether each crime requires proof of fact not required by other); <em>Helstoski v. Meanor, </em>442 U.S. 500, 506-08, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>99 S.Ct. 2445, 2448-49, 61 L.Ed.2d 30 (1979) (trial would subject Congressman to possible violation of speech and debate clause rights <em>pendente lite; </em>whether speech protected requires analysis of content of speech and circumstances surrounding its making). This court also has, in determining finality under section 1291, focused on the irrepara-bility of the loss of a claimed right <em>penden-te lite. Coastal Steel Corp. v. Tilghman Wheelabrator, Ltd., </em>709 F.2d 190, 195-96 (3d Cir.1983) (denying enforcement of forum selection clause would subject party to trial in forum other than that contracted for; factors may involve some reference to merits); <em>Chrysler Corp. v. Fedders Corp., </em>670 F.2d 1316, 1318 n. 2 (3d Cir.1982) (order vacating notice of lis pendens would be effectively unreviewable after final judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Thus we have no doubt, as the Rascios apparently concede, that Howard\u2019s appeal is within our jurisdiction under section 1291.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Since on this record Howard\u2019s motion for a writ of attachment, which satisfied the New Jersey statutes and court rules, should have been granted, the judgment appealed from will be reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b405-7\">. Fed.R.Civ.P. 64 makes these state grounds applicable in the district courts. Rule 64 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">At the commencement of and during the course of an action, all remedies providing for seizure of person or property for the purpose of securing satisfaction of the judgment ultimately to be entered in the action are available under the circumstances and in the manner provided by the law of the state in which the district court is held, existing at the time the remedy is sought....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b406-7\">. In their brief on appeal, the Rascios refer to a variety of extra-record materials purporting to support an inference that the certificates of deposit are the separate property of Mary Lou Delesso, and that Joseph Rascio is the sole principal in Agents Auto. These assertions were unsworn, and no motion has been made to supplement the record. Thus, they may not be considered in passing on the propriety of the order appealed from. <em>See Singleton v. Wulff, </em>428 U.S. 106, 120, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 2877, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1975) (matters not before district court will not be considered on appeal); <em>Hald-erman v. Pennhurst State School &amp; Hospital, </em>673 F.2d 628, 639 (3d Cir.1982) (in banc) (same); <em>United States v.

The property consists of certificates of deposit issued by Howard. That the property sought to be attached is in Howard\u2019s possession is not a reason for refusing to issue the writ. <em>United States Steel Corp. v.
