Buffalano, is a lawyer convicted under a single count indictment charging him with extracting $3,500 from another individual who was about to be sentenced. Buffalano represented that the money solicited would be used to bribe the judge and ensure that the individual receive a lenient sentence. Following a three day jury trial before the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Bartels, <em>J.), </em>appellant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503 (1982), the federal obstruction of justice statute. The attorney\u2019s actions in this case demonstrate a woeful lack of understanding of a lawyer\u2019s special responsibility as an officer of the legal system for the quality of justice and the requirement that he demonstrate respect for that legal system and those, including judges and other lawyers, who serve it.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">This appeal presents a two-fold issue: whether Buffalano\u2019s actions violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503, and, if so, whether the law was properly charged to the jury. Because the evidence permitted the jury to find a violation of the statute, we reject appellant\u2019s request that the indictment be dismissed; nonetheless, since the charge was incorrect the conviction must be reversed and the case remanded to the district court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">I. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Buffalano\u2019s background as an attorney included service as an Assistant District Attorney in Brooklyn, counsel to the Police Benevolent Association and, at the time that this January 1983 indictment was filed, law secretary for a Justice of the New York State Supreme Court. The indictment charged that Buffalano did \u201ccorruptly endeavor to influence, obstruct and impede the due administration of justice with respect to the then pending sentence of ... Thomas Conti.... in that Anthony J. Buf-falano did solicit from ... Conti ... a sum of money representing that Anthony J. Buffalano would ensure through corrupt means that Conti would receive a lenient sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">The facts as developed at the April 1983 trial are not in dispute. Six witnesses testified. The principal witness was Gaetano \u201cTommy\u201d Conti whose recorded conversations with appellant Buffalano contained the incriminating evidence which convicted appellant of obstruction of justice. Two of the witnesses, Hanley and Ryan, are FBI agents. Visokay is Conti\u2019s federal probation officer, Agulnick was Conti\u2019s attorney and Judge Platt was scheduled to be the sentencing judge in Conti\u2019s criminal case. When he learned of the payoff scheme, Judge Platt recused himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">Conti is a printer by trade whose friendship with Buffalano is one of many years standing. Conti was arrested in the summer of 1981 for counterfeiting. After his arrest he sought out his old friend Buffala-no for advice. Buffalano was unable to represent him because he was serving as a law secretary to a New York state court judge. He did arrange to have Conti see attorney Barry Agulnick, with whom Buf-falano had previously been associated in a law practice. After a meeting between the two, Conti retained Agulnick. Buffalano continued to act as a liaison between Conti and Agulnick, relaying information back and forth. In September 1981 Conti pled guilty to conspiracy before Judge Platt. About two days before his scheduled sentencing, Conti had a conversation with Buf-falano. On that occasion Buffalano told Conti that Agulnick had read his pre-sen-tence report and that \u201cit didn\u2019t look too good.\u201d At the same time Buffalano, to whom Conti owed some money, mentioned that for the sum of $3,500 he could arrange to \u201cfix\u201d the sentencing judge to ensure a lenient sentence. Conti understood this to be a reference to Judge Platt. Buffalano described how he would go about it. His method was to contact another lawyer who was a leader of the 52nd District Democratic Club and if money was forthcoming, that person could \u201cfix\u201d the case. To lend credence to his claimed ability to influence the sentencing, Buffalano related how this same political leader had handled another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>case before another United States District Judge. In that case a woman by the name of Valerie was supposed to receive a three-year sentence, but instead received only six months. Buffalano knew that Conti was aware that a former law associate of Agul-nick had represented Valerie. Buffalano\u2019s story was a trumped-up tale, cut from whole cloth.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">While pondering this proposition and without indicating whether or not he would pursue it, Conti told Buffalano that he had some information on a drug related case and asked him to contact Agulnick and relay that fact as well as the fact that Conti planned to cooperate with the Government in the counterfeiting ease charged against him. The cooperation consisted of Conti \u201csetting-up\u201d a criminal suspect in a drug related case and then contacting government agents who, in return, would make that cooperation known to the court at the time of Conti\u2019s sentence. While talking with one of the agents about this drug-related matter, Conti mentioned the conversation that Buffalano had had with him about paying off a federal judge to obtain a lenient sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Unknown to Buffalano, Conti then decided to cooperate with the government in an investigation of Buffalano\u2019s solicitation of money ostensibly to \u201cfix\u201d the sentence by bribing a federal judge. Conti was put in contact with FBI agents Hanley and Kirby who instructed him to arrange a meeting with Buffalano and to attend it wearing a body recorder. Conti was to tell Buffalano that he had been unable to arrange the \u201cset-up\u201d in the drug-related case and that since \u201ccooperation\u201d was not going to help him, he now wanted Buffalano to talk to the local political leader on his behalf. The specific meeting where this ploy was to be used was set by a telephone call for December 4th. On December 4, 1981 Conti and Buffalano met for lunch. Conti falsely explained that the case he was cooperating in was not going well and that he was nervous about his sentencing. Buffalano agreed that cooperation would not help and that Agulnick had told him the prosecutor wanted to put Conti away for five years. The pre-sentence report had actually recommended only six months. Another meeting to discuss the matter further was arranged for December 10. Prior to that date the government agents not only wired Conti with a body recorder, but also gave him $3,500 in cash. On this occasion Conti and Buffalano met in front of the Supreme Court building on Court Street in Brooklyn and then drove around together in an automobile. The recording of the conversation, though inaudible in spots, clearly reveals Buffalano assuring Conti that the \u201cfix\u201d was in. Ironically, at one point in the conversation, when Conti asked a pointed question using the word \u201cfix,\u201d Buffalano sharply rejoined \u201cwhat kind of _ talk is that?.... when you use words like that ... I figure there\u2019s a tape recorder.\u201d Failing to heed his own suspicious instincts, Buffalano accepted the $3,500 cash payoff and, undaunted, later continued to give assurances to Conti falsely relating how the money had been used to ensure his obtaining a lenient sentence. Actually, Buffalano had simply put the money in his pocket. He made no attempt to contact Judge Platt, nor was there any evidence that such contact was ever contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">The other witnesses, attorney Agulnick, probation officer Visokay, and Judge Platt, testified regarding the role of a defendant in the sentencing process who has pleaded guilty to a charge. A defendant may, for example, contact the prosecuting attorney and volunteer information in an effort to secure a favorable recommendation at sentence. The defense attorney must be given information relating to defendant\u2019s character, family life, employment record and the like to submit by way of mitigation prior to and at sentencing. The defendant also has an opportunity to speak to his probation officer and, with his attorney, to dispute the report and to address the court. The defendant\u2019s cooperation, if any, with the government is reflected in the probation report which the judge considers prior to sentencing and a judge may also be influenced by what he hears during the defendant\u2019s allocution at sentencing. The conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>sion drawn from this testimony is that a defendant who foregoes this active role of self-help risks prejudicing his own case before the sentencing court. It is in the light of this factual background that we discuss the legal issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">II. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"An\">\n<em>A. \u201cEndeavor\u201d Under \u00a7 1503</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The first issue is whether appellant\u2019s actions constitute a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">\u201cWhoever * * * corruptly * * * endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice, shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aq-dedup-0\">Buffalano argued in a motion to dismiss the indictment and at the trial prior to the submission of the case to the jury, that while his bogus \u201cfix\u201d scheme defrauded Conti, he never endeavored or intended to impede the administration of justice. Therefore, his argument concludes, he did not commit a violation of \u00a7 1503. We do not accept such a narrow reading of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">The indictment charged that Buffalano did corruptly endeavor to influence, obstruct and impede justice. The operative word is \u201cendeavor.\u201d The question then is whether defendant\u2019s action amounted to an endeavor within the meaning of the statute. In <em>United States v. Russell, </em>255 U.S. 138, 143, 41 S.Ct. 260, 261, 65 L.Ed. 553 (1921), the Supreme Court defined \u201cendeavor,\u201d while discussing the statute\u2019s predecessor, as \u201cany effort or essay to accomplish the evil purpose that the section was enacted to prevent.\u201d By using such term Congress purged from the statute the technicalities associated with distinguishing between preparation for an attempt and the attempt itself. <em>See id. </em>at 143, 41 S.Ct. at 261. The conclusion is that an \u201cendeavor\u201d under \u00a7 1503 does not require proof that would support a charge of attempt, i.e., an \u201cendeavor\u201d is less than an attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">Appellant relies on <em>Ethridge v. United States, </em>258 F.2d 234 (9th Cir.1958) for his argument that his actions did not constitute an endeavor. In that case the defendant promised another person awaiting sentencing that for $1,000 he could ensure probation. The \u201coffer\u201d was not accepted. Nonetheless, defendant was convicted under \u00a7 1503. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed after looking to an earlier decision involving a similar statute where the court had held that an endeavor required an act directed at some person \u201cwho had legal authority to do, or not to do some act which would or could affect the final outcome\u201d of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 236 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">To support its contention that Buffalano\u2019s. actions constituted an endeavor, the government points to <em>United States v. Neiswender, </em>590 F.2d 1269 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 963, 99 S.Ct. 2410, 60 L.Ed.2d 1068 (1979). In that case the Fourth Circuit upheld a conviction where appellant, claiming that he had a juror under his control, represented to an attorney that for $20,000 he could ensure a favorable outcome for the attorney\u2019s client in a criminal case. No proof was adduced that appellant ever dealt with or had contact with any juror. Appellant argued that \u00a7 1503 did not proscribe \u201cgarden variety\u201d frauds. Despite the government\u2019s concession that Neiswender\u2019s primary intent was to defraud, his conviction was affirmed. The <em>Neiswender </em>court held, unlike <em>Ethridge, </em>that \u00a7 1503 required only that the defendant have \u201cknowledge or notice that success in his fraud would have likely resulted in an obstruction of justice,\u201d and that such notice was \u201cprovided by the reasonable foreseeability of the natural and probable consequences of one\u2019s acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1273. The court also stated that \u201cthe solicitation alone constituted a proscribed \u2018endeavor\u2019 given knowledge or notice that justice would be obstructed were the scheme to succeed. Thus the solicitation was the hub of the offense, and solicitation was plainly charged in the indictment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1275.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">Further, the Supreme Court in an early case held that evil intent would be lacking were defendant not shown to have knowledge or notice that his acts would obstruct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>justice then actually being administered. <em>See Pettibone v. United States, </em>148 U.S. 197, 207, 13 S.Ct. 542, 546, 37 L.Ed. 419 (1893). And our Court in <em>United States v. Moon, </em>718 F.2d 1210 (2d Cir.1983) concluded that intent to impede the administration of justice is an essential element of a \u00a7 1503 violation, but that such intent may be inferred from defendant\u2019s knowledge of the falsity of records he submitted to a grand jury. However, in <em>Moon </em>we found that the defendant (Kamiyama) had not acted voluntarily inasmuch as he was compelled by subpoena to produce records before a grand jury investigating Reverend Moon. Hence, we held that defendant lacked the requisite intent that <em>his acts </em>would obstruct justice and consequently Kamiyama\u2019s conviction on that count was reversed. <em>Id. </em>at 1236.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Actual contact or even intent to contact a person having authority to affect the result need not be shown to prove a \u00a7 1503 violation. Instead, while the statutory term \u201ccorruptly endeavors\u201d requires intent, such intent may be inferred from proof that defendant had knowledge or notice that his corrupt actions would obstruct justice then actually being administered. <em>See Pettibone v. United States, supra, </em>148 U.S. at 207, 13 S.Ct. at 546; <em>Neiswender v. United States, supra, </em>590 F.2d at 1275. Applying that rule to the facts in this case, we conclude that Buffalano\u2019s actions clearly could constitute a violation of \u00a7 1503. His solicitation was an endeavor under the statute that had the potential to lull an \u201cinnocent victim\u201d into a false sense of security, deterring him from taking an active role himself to secure a more favorable sentence. For example, as a result of being fraudulently lulled into a false sense of security a victim might fail to volunteer information to the prosecutor, supply his own counsel or his probation officer with mitigating material drawn from his own life, dispute the pre-sentence report or address the court upon allocution. Having decided that Buffalano\u2019s activities firmly subjected him to prosecution under \u00a7 1503, we turn to the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury on the law which they were to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">\n<em>B. Charge to the Jury Under \u00a7 1503</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The problem with the charge in this case is not that it omitted a legal theory required to be included but, rather, that it included several theories. The decision to use additional language embracing several legal theories made the charge confusing\u2014 not clearer \u2014 for the jury. The trial court fell victim to an understandable desire to satisfy the differing contentions of the parties regarding the standard of law applicable to the facts of this case. That the attempt was bound to fail \u2014 since the contentions were irreconcilable \u2014 is concededly easier for us to see in retrospect.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The difficulty arose because of the varying views of what was needed for the \u201csuccess\u201d of Buffalano\u2019s endeavor. Defense counsel argued then, as he does now before us, that appellant\u2019s actions could not succeed unless directed toward a person with legal authority to affect the outcome (i.e., Judge Platt). The government thought the \u201csuccess\u201d of Buffalano\u2019s endeavor to obstruct justice was proved by \u201clulling\u201d Conti into neglecting to do those things to mitigate punishment that the law permits a defendant in the sentencing process. This was why the prosecutor produced witnesses as to the defendant\u2019s role in that process.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">The trial court accepted the \u201clulling\u201d theory advanced by the prosecutor under <em>Neis-wender. </em>Unfortunately, the court did not accept the verbiage of the <em>Neiswender </em>formulation as to \u201csuccess.\u201d Judge Bartels thought \u201csuccess\u201d meant ultimate payment of money to Judge Platt (or, in <em>Neiswender, </em>the ultimate payment to a juror). Hence, he said that \u201cif that plan was successful, it\u2019s obvious ... it would influence the administration of justice. What I\u2019m saying, if $3,500 was given to Justice Platt, it would obviously influence... . \u201d Of course, what the <em>Neiswender </em>court meant by success was not payment to the juror, but an overall reduction in the defense effort. <em>See </em>590 F.2d at 1271. In this case, when the trial judge framed his charge, he decided to use language that he thought would cover both theories of success \u2014 appellant\u2019s view that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>success meant paying money to Judge Platt and the prosecution\u2019s view that it meant lulling Conti. As he told the prosecutor, \u201cYou and I have a different concept of that ____Please read the charge. I think it covers both.\u201d And that is exactly what he did. The jury was charged on the prosecutor\u2019s theory: \u201c[Y]ou must find beyond a reasonable doubt that he acted with the specific intent to do something the law forbids, that is to corruptly endeavor to influence, obstruct, or <em>impede a defendant </em>in a pending criminal case.\u201d (emphasis added). Then, he included the defense view: \u201c[Y]ou must find, beyond a reasonable doubt ... that Mr. Buffalano knew or had notice that <em>success </em>in the corrupt endeavor would likely affect the due administration of justice.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The jury was never told exactly what was meant by \u201csuccess.\u201d Possibly the charge could be understood as referring only to the \u201clulling\u201d theory, even though the trial judge thought it covered both theories. But the prosecutor himself compounded the problem by arguing in his summation a third type of \u201csuccess.\u201d He urged the jury to believe that the defendant \u201csucceeded\u201d in interfering with justice because when the payoff plan came to light Judge Platt then had to recuse himself and ask another judge to sentence Conti. The prosecutor argued: \u201cOrdinarily Mr. Conti would have been sentenced by Judge Platt; he wasn\u2019t. This is direct interference.\u201d He even argued that Conti\u2019s actual sentence, different from what Judge Platt had in mind, was an \u201ceffect\u201d for which Buffalano was culpable. The prosecutor\u2019s argument simply added to the confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">The ultimate payment to Judge Platt was obviously not a foreseeable consequence since Buffalano knew he was never going to make that payment, nor even put in motion any action that might conceivably lead to that payment. Under the charge the jury could have convicted Buffalano if it thought, as Judge Bartels and the defense did, that \u201csuccess\u201d referred to the ultimate payment to the judge, or, if it agreed with the prosecutor, that it referred to the need to have Judge Platt recuse himself. In our view, since the only foreseeable consequence for which Buffalano could be held criminally responsible on this record was the lulling of Conti, the charge should have confined the jury\u2019s consideration to that one theory. Because it did not, the judgment of conviction must be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
