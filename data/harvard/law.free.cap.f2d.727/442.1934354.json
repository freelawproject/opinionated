Johnson contends that suspension under the multi-employer employee pension benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>plan of an employee\u2019s vested right to receive monthly pension benefit payments amounts to a statutorily prohibited forfeiture under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001 <em>et seq., </em>of pension benefits during the period of suspension. The central (but not only) issue of this appeal concerns ERI-SA\u2019s intended meaning of \u201cnormal retirement age,\u201d and arises out of the plaintiff\u2019s contention, sustained by the district court, that the plan\u2019s provision for suspension-forfeiture of his vested benefit rights for this reason is contrary to an ERISA provision that requires pension plans subject thereto to \u201cprovide that an employee\u2019s right to his normal retirement benefit is nonforfeitable upon the attainment of <em>normal retirement age.\u201d </em>\u00a7 203(a) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1053(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">We reverse the district court\u2019s determination that the \u201cnormal retirement age\u201d must under the statute be the age at which an employee\u2019s right vests to receive normal retirement benefits. We instead hold, consistently with other circuits that have approached the issue, that the statutorily intended meaning of \u201cnormal retirement age\u201d is provided by ERISA\u2019s own definitions section, which defines the meaning of terms used for purposes of that statute, \u00a7 3 of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002. Under this provision, the present plan\u2019s definition of \u201cnormal retirement age\u201d as 65 is, for the reasons set forth below, in compliance with ERISA\u2019s statutory requirements for a covered plan\u2019s \u201cnormal retirement age,\u201d \u00a7 3(24) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(24). <em>Procedural Stance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The plaintiff Johnson sues the National Maritime Union Pension Trust of the National Maritime Union Pension and Welfare Plan (the \u201cplan\u201d), and its administrator (Franco) and trustees, to recover unpaid monthly pension benefits allegedly due from June 26, 1969 (the date of Johnson\u2019s retirement from employment connected with the National Maritime Union) to December 1, 1977 (the date on which the plan began paying him pension benefits). The district court held that the plan had wrongfully denied pension benefits to Johnson from January 1, 1976, the effective date of ERISA, a holding we reverse on the plan\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">With regard to other contentions raised by Johnson, the district court held that he was not entitled to his pension benefits from June 26, 1969 to January 1, 1976 either under the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 141 <em>et seq., </em>or under applicable provisions of state law. On Johnson\u2019s cross-appeal from these rulings, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">\n<em>Context Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">The National Maritime Union (\u201cNMU\u201d) is a labor organization whose membership consists entirely of seamen unlicensed by maritime authorities. With several employers of its seamen, NMU had created a pension plan for the benefit of its members employed by them. The plaintiff Johnson was an NMU member from 1946 until his retirement on June 26, 1969 and was employed during that period as an \u201cunlicensed\u201d seaman covered by the plan. At the time of his retirement in 1969, Johnson had accumulated more than 20 NMU \u201cpension credits,\u201d which entitled him to a $250 per month \u201cService Pension\u201d under the terms of the plan, provided that he refrain from certain types of employment after his retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">At the time of his retirement, the provisions of the NMU plan prohibited pensioners from becoming reemployed in any capacity aboard an American flag vessel or any vessel covered by an NMU collective bargaining agreement. This plan restriction was in effect until May 1973, when it was modified to allow employment on an American flag vessel, provided that the vessel was not covered by an NMU collective bargaining agreement. Johnson first applied for his pension in April 1973, but was denied benefits since he was then employed aboard an NMU contract vessel \u2014 albeit as a \u201clicensed\u201d seaman.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On November 23,1977, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>the plan restrictions were again amended so as to preclude payment of vested pension benefits only for employment as an \u201cun licensed\u201d seaman on an NMU contract vessel. In 1978, Johnson again applied for pension benefits. Since Johnson was then employed as a \u201clicensed\u201d (not as an <em>\u201cun </em>licensed\u201d) seaman, the plan paid him benefits retroactively to December 1, 1977, the effective date of the amended plan restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Johnson again demanded benefits for the period between June 26, 1969 (the date his employment as an unlicensed seaman terminated) and December 1, 1977 (the date the amended plan permitted him to draw benefits despite his employment as a licensed seaman). The plan again denied benefits for this period, relying upon a provision of the plan that the \u201cnormal retirement age\u201d was 65 and upon other limitations of the plan, based upon continued maritime employment, that suspended Johnson\u2019s right to receive his service pension prior to December 1, 1977. Johnson then instituted the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">I. <em>The ERISA Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The district court granted Johnson retroactive benefits from January 1,1976 to December 1, 1977 on the ground that ERI-SA prohibited the suspension of his pension benefits by the type of reemployment restrictions imposed by the NMU plan for that period. The plan appeals this ruling. The threshold issue in this regard is whether the district court erred in determining that for purposes of ERISA-protections the \u201cnormal retirement age\u201d is not the age of 65 as expressly defined by the plan, but instead is the date (in 1969) at which the plan participant (Johnson) became eligible to receive the normal retirement benefits provided for service pensions by the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">The plaintiff Johnson relies upon an ERI-SA provision that \u201ceach pension plan shall provide that an employee\u2019s right to his normal retirement benefit is <em>nonforfeitable upon the attainment of his normal retirement age.\u201d </em>\u00a7 203 of ERISA, 29 U.S.G. \u00a7 1053 (emphasis added). Section 203 does not, however, by itself bar a plan\u2019s provision that suspends the payment of benefits <em>before </em>a pension plan participant reaches \u201cnormal retirement age.\u201d <em>Hurn v. Retirement Fund of Plumbing, Heating &amp; Piping Industry, </em>648 F.2d 1252, 1253 (9th Cir.1981); <em>Riley v. MEBA Pension Trust </em>586 F.2d 968, 969-970 (2d Cir.1978) (\u201cRiley II\u201d) (citing legislative history reference). The restriction on reemployment in the NMU plan would therefore not violate ERISA \u00a7 203 if it suspended Johnson\u2019s retirement benefits <em>before </em>he reached \u201cnormal retirement age\u201d, within the intended meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">Section 3 of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002, entitled \u201cDefinitions\u201d, provides the meaning of certain terms \u201c[f]or purposes of this subchapter [ERISA].\u201d Section 3(24), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(24), defines \u201cnormal retirement age\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-12\">(24) The term \u201cnormal retirement age\u201d means the <em>earlier </em>of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-13\">(A) the time a plan participant attains normal retirement age under the plan, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-14\">(B) the <em>later </em>of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-15\">(i) the time a plan participant attains age 65, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-16\">(ii) the 10th anniversary of the time a plan participant commenced participation in the plan. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-17\">By comparison, the present NMU pension plan defines \u201cnormal retirement age\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACm\">[T]he first day of the calendar month coincident with or immediately following a Participant\u2019s 65th birthday or if later, the first day of the calendar month following the tenth anniversary of the day the person becomes a Participant....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-18\">Under the plan\u2019s definition, Johnson will reach \u201cnormal retirement age\u201d at age 65, since that date falls later than his 10th anniversary with the plan.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Similarly, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>the definition of subparagraph B of \u00a7 3(24) of ERISA, Johnson reaches normal retirement age at 65, since that date is later than his tenth anniversary with the plan. By either definition, thus, Johnson will not reach \u201cnormal retirement age\u201d until he reaches age 65. Consequently, the NMU plan\u2019s provision for a \u201cnormal retirement age\u201d of age 65 does not contravene the ERISA-specified minimum requirement for a plan\u2019s \u201cnormal retirement age\u201d \u2014 for that reason, it does not implicate a violation of the provision of ERISA that a pension plan must provide \u201cthat an employee\u2019s right to his normal retirement benefits is nonforfei-table upon the attainment of his <em>normal </em>retirement age.\u201d \u00a7 203 of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1053 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">We are thus unable to agree with the thoughtful opinion of the district court, by which it reasoned that the \u201cnormal retirement age\u201d should be derived from the substance of the plan\u2019s provision for retirement benefits. By this reasoning, Johnson had reached the \u201cnormal retirement age\u201d, even though the plan defined that term as age 65, because in 1969 his rights vested to a full service pension, which therefore \u2014 construing the plan as a whole \u2014 as a practical matter constituted his reaching the normal retirement age. We do not find to be persuasive as applied to the present facts the reasoning and holding in an unreported decision of the District of Columbia district court, <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees of the Asbestos Workers, </em>etc., No. 79-0263 (D.D.C. Feb. 23, 1979), upon which the present trial court relied. (We pretermit its possible dis-tinguishability as involving a plan that (unlike the present) did <em>not </em>expressly provide for \u201cnormal retirement age\u201d.)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">In summary, under \u00a7 3(24) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(24), quoted <em>supra, </em>the \u201cnormal retirement age\u201d may be <em>either </em>(1) the age that a participant \u201cattains normal retirement age <em>under the plan,\u201d </em>\u00a7 3(24)(A) (emphasis added) <em>or </em>(2) \u201cthe time a plan participant attains age 65\u201d (or the 10th anniversary of his participation in the plan, if he became a participant later than age 55), \u00a7 3(24)(B), quoted above \u2014 whichever is the \u201cearlier\u201d of the two. With regard to the issue before us, the present pension plan expressly defines its \u201cnormal retirement age\u201d as age 65. Under its statutory terms, ERISA would invalidate, for forfeiture-suspension purposes, only a \u201cnormal retirement age <em>under the plan\u201d, </em>\u00a7 3(24) of ERI-SA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(24), that does not meet the statutorily prescribed minimum \u201cnormal retirement age\u201d provided by \u00a7 3(24)(B) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(24)(B). The \u201cnormal retirement age\u201d specified by the present plan \u2014 which would be controlling as to nonforfeiture were it <em>earlier </em>(as it is not) than the ERISA minimum \u2014 does indeed meet ERISA\u2019s minimum age-65 requirement. Consequently, the plan\u2019s trustees were not barred by ERI-SA\u2019s nonforfeiture provision from a plan stipulation that suspended payment of Johnson\u2019s vested pension rights following the effective date of ERISA on January 1, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Our holding is consistent with that of other circuits that the \u201cnormal retirement age\u201d provided by a pension plan controls the issue as to the date upon which a participant\u2019s pension rights become nonforfeitable under ERISA, provided the normal retirement age so provided meets ERISA\u2019s minimum requirements (as does the present). <em>Janowski v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, </em>673 F.2d 931, 937 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied, -- U.S. --, 103 S.Ct. 130, 74 L.Ed.2d 112 (1982); <em>Hernandez v. Southern Nevada Culinary &amp; Bartenders, </em>662 F.2d 617, 619-20 (9th Cir.1981); <em>see also Fine v. Semet, </em>699 F.2d 1091, 1093 (11th Cir.1983). In <em>Hernandez, </em>a case involving issues very similar to those presented here, the Ninth Circuit found that although a pensioner had a \u201c100% vested interest in his accrued pension benefits,\u201d he had \u201cno vested right <em>to receive </em>pension benefits until he reaches normal retirement age\u201d (in that case, defined by the plan as age 62). <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>662 F.2d at 618-619 (italics the court\u2019s).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Since Johnson had not reached \u201cnormal retirement age\u201d as defined either by \u00a7 3(24) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(24), or by the NMU pension plan, he was not entitled to the protection afforded by ERISA\u2019s nonforfeitability provision, \u00a7 203, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1053, for the period of January 1, 1976\u2014 September 1, 1977, during which the NMU plan suspended his benefits. Provided that post-employment restrictions, such as those that suspended Johnson\u2019s pension benefits, do not violate other provisions of ERISA, pension plans may adopt restrictions which limit or suspend the payment of vested pension benefits prior to the time the pensioner reaches \u201cnormal retirement age,\u201d such as provisions suspending payments from multi-employer funds (while the entitled employee works in the same craft or trade and in the same geographic area. <em>See e.g., </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1053(a)(3)(B)(i); <em>Thompson v. Asbestos Workers Local No. 53 Pension Fund, </em>716 F.2d 340 (5th Cir.1983)). We find, therefore, that the district court erred in ruling that the suspension of Johnson\u2019s benefits from January 1, 1976 to December I, 1977 violated the nonforfeitability provisions of ERISA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">II. <em>The Labor Management Relations Act and State Law Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">On his cross-appeal, Johnson contends that the district court erred in dismissing his pre-ERISA claim for pension benefits from 1969 to 1976, sought both on federal-law and state-law grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">For his federal-law basis, Johnson claims that he was entitled to pension benefits from June 26, 1969 until January 1, 1976 because the plan restrictions that suspended his benefits (due to his reemployment as a licensed seaman aboard NMU contract vessels) violated \u00a7 302(c)(5) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186(c)(5). Section 302(c)(5) requires that any money paid by management to a labor trust or pension fund must be \u201cfor the sole and exclusive benefit of the employees of such employer.\u201d This section has been held to prohibit the trustees of union pension funds from establishing \u201carbitrary exclusions from pension benefits.\u201d <em>Knauss v. Gorman, </em>583 F.2d 82, 88 (3rd Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">The defendant plan and its trustees contend preliminary that there is no subject-matter jurisdiction over the claim under the federal Labor Management Relations Act. In so arguing, the defendants rely upon expressions that whether a pre-ERISA eligibility requirement in a pension plan is arbitrary or capricious is primarily a question of state, not federal, substantive law, <em>Woodfork v. Marine Cooks &amp; Stewards Union, </em>642 F.2d 966, 974-75 (5th Cir.1981), and that \u201conly structural deficiencies in a plan that defeat the \u2018sole and exclusive benefit\u2019 provision of section 302(c)(5), and not simple breaches of fiduciary duty, violate that provision.\u201d <em>Iron Workers Local No. 272 v. Bowen, </em>624 F.2d 1255, 1258 n. 3 (5th Cir. 1980). These expressions concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>propriety of a \u00a7 302(c)(5) claim, however, do not raise an issue of subject matter jurisdiction, rather an issue of whether the statutory provision has created a private cause of action under non-structural-defect circumstances that would entitle a retiree to recover his pension benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Section 302(e) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186(e), clearly provides the district courts with the jurisdiction to \u201crestrain violations of this section [\u00a7 302].\u201d \u201cTo protect the rights of pensioners, courts have found it necessary to subject the conduct of pension plan trustees to judicial review and correction.\u201d <em>Bayles v. Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund, </em>602 F.2d 97, 100 (5th Cir.1979). However, \u201cthe actions of the trustees in the administration of the pension plan must be sustained unless plaintiff can prove such activities have been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The majority of the courts that have considered the issue have held, consistently with our expression in <em>Bowen, supra, </em>that a plaintiff states a claim under \u00a7 302(c)(5) if his allegations are to the effect that the plan has a \u201cstructural defect\u201d that has worked to exclude a group of retirees from benefits arbitrarily and capriciously, <em>i.e., </em>for no reasonable purpose.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The plaintiff Johnson contends that the restrictions imposed by the plan arbitrarily limited the right of many members such as himself to receive their pensions simply because of their continued maritime employment. He particularly complains of as without legitimate foundation the provision that suspended the pensions only of retirees who worked on American flag vessels or on NMU contract vessels, not of those who worked on other vessels. He claims that this distinction arbitrarily precludes the receipt of pension benefits to retirees of entitlement equal to those retirees also working as seamen, based solely upon the identity of the employer of a seaman rather than upon the type of post-retirement maritime employment obtained by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">Without detailing the plan\u2019s reasons for the maritime-employment-based suspension of payment of service pensions to otherwise qualified retirees, we think it is sufficient to note that the initial more stringent limitations upon any maritime employment arose in an effort to assure that those who collected benefits were really retired from the maritime industry and thus in need of the benefits, that the more liberalized later restrictions were designed to encourage more senior NMU members to retire and to create openings in union jobs for other younger NMU members who faced unemployment in changing economic conditions, and that some of the restrictions (later abandoned) for employment on American flag and NMU-contract vessels were designed to ensure that maritime employers contributing to the NMU plan did not simultaneously pay the same person both a union pension (through their contributions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>to the pension fund) and a salary while he was working.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">The reasons advanced for the employment-related suspension of service pensions to retirees cannot be said to be without reasonable purpose, nor can they be said to deprive arbitrarily one group of pensioners from entitlement to immediate payment of benefits, as contrasted with the treatment accorded others allegedly similarly situated. Under the limited judicial review permitted by the arbitrary and capricious standard, therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s rejection of the federal-law \u00a7 302(c)(5) claim asserted by Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">With regard to Johnson\u2019s state-law claim, it likewise at the least requires for recovery that the pension plan\u2019s denial of benefits be shown to be arbitrary and capricious. For the same reasons as those that justified as nonarbitrary under the federal-law claim the plan's suspension of the payment of pensions during maritime employment, <em>supra, </em>we likewise affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiff Johnson\u2019s state-law claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">For the reasons stated, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court that Johnson was entitled to pension benefits from January 1, 1976 to December 1, 1977 under the provisions of ERISA, and AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment that Johnson was not entitled to his pension benefits prior to January 1, 1976 under either the Labor Management Relations Act or state law. The plaintiff-appellee is to pay all costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-12\">. After his retirement from NMU-represented \u2018unlicensed\u201d employment on June 26, 1969, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Johnson worked only as a \u201clicensed\u201d seaman. Seamen become \u201clicensed\u201d by maritime authorities when found qualified to serve as officers on vessels.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b532-19\">. During the period for which Johnson claimed benefits, Johnson had been with the plan longer than 10 years, but he had not yet reached age <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>65. Johnson was born on January 31, 1928, and will not reach that age until 1993.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b534-7\">. In an additional argument not addressed by the district court, Johnson contends that under the express terms of the plan he was entitled to draw pension benefits commencing January 1, 1976, since the plan as amended and adopted on November 23, 1977, provided that, when accepted by the Internal Revenue Service as a qualified ERISA plan, the amendments then adopted would be effective January 1, 1976. Among the amendments then conditionally adopted was the one that removed employment as a licensed seaman (such as Johnson\u2019s) as a cause for suspension of payment of NMU service pensions for twenty years of covered employment as an unlicensed seaman. However, when this amended plan was adopted in 1977, the trustees reserved the right to change it to adjust to regulations and also stipulated that, if the plan were further amended before accept-anee by the Internal Revenue Service, payments would be made in accordance with the plan as further amended. R.II, pp. 489-90. In a clarification of pension regulations of September 19, 1978 (before Johnson\u2019s application of November 7, 1978, for benefits under the amended plan), the Trustees determined that the effective date of this particular amendment was intended to be November 12, 1977 (R.II, 378, 561). This clarification is not shown to be beyond the trustees\u2019 amendment powers, see <em>supra, </em>also R.II, p. 546, nor beyond the full powers granted to them by the trust agreement to determine questions of coverage and eligibility and in that respect to construe the provisions of the agreement with binding effect, R.II, p. 389, nor to be a capricious and arbitrary abuse of such powers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b535-7\">. <em>See Hurn v.

To implement section 302(c)(5)\u2019s mandate while respecting the trustees\u2019 need for discretion in conceiving a plan to maximize employee welfare, we have traditionally reviewed trust rules to ensure that they are not arbitrary and capricious, unsupported by substantial evidence, instituted in bad faith, or erroneous on a question of law. [Citations omitted]. Under the \u201cstructural defect\u201d test, an employee can show violation of these standards by establishing the exclusion of a large number of employees from benefits for no apparent reason. <em>Burroughs v.

The trustees will still prevail if they show a reasonable purpose for their rule. <em>See Miranda </em>[v. <em>Audia, </em>681 F.2d 1124], 681 F.2d at 1125-27; <em>Ponce v.
