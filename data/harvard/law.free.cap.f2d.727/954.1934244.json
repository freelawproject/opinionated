The Board found the Union to have violated Section 8(e) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(e), by enforcing, or attempting to enforce, the \u201cRepair and Maintenance Work\u201d provision of a collective bargaining agreement between the International Union and Garland Coal Company. Garland Coal is a Missouri corporation with strip mining operations at various locations, including the Rose Hill Mine in Oklahoma. The.Board\u2019s Decision and Order appears as International Union, United Mine Workers of America, et al, 258 NLRB 56 (1981). Our study of the matter convinces us that the Board\u2019s order should be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-18\">We do not propose to recite here the complete chronology of events, inasmuch as they are fully set forth in the Board\u2019s Decision and Order. Our starting point is the \u201cRepair and Maintenance Work\u201d provision in the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement of 1978, the collective bargaining agreement between Garland Coal and the International Union. Article 1(a), sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>tion (g), paragraph (2), of that agreement provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-4\">Repair and Maintenance Work \u2014 Repair and maintenance work customarily performed by Classified Employees at the mine or central shop shall not be contracted out except ... (b) where the Employer does not have available equipment or regular Employees with necessary skills available to perform the work at the mine or central shop, <em>provided, however, that the work shall be performed by UMWA members to the extent and in the manner permitted by law. </em>(Emphasis ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">The italicized portion of the \u201cRepair and Maintenance Work\u201d provision in the collective bargaining agreement between Garland Coal and the International Union is the particular language with which we are here concerned. In this court, at least, it appears that the parties agree that the italicized portion in the \u201cRepair and Maintenance Work\u201d provision violates 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(e), which seeks to prohibit so-called \u201chot cargo\u201d clauses in collective bargaining agreements whereby an employer agrees, generally at union insistence, that he will not subcontract, for example, any work to nonunion subcontractors. <em>National Woodwork Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. NLRB, </em>386 U.S. 612, 634-35, 87 S.Ct. 1250, 1262-1263, 18 L.Ed.2d 357 (1967); <em>Amax Coal Co. v. NLRB, </em>614 F.2d 872, 887-88 (3d Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-6\">In this Court, the Union\u2019s position is that at no time was it seeking to enforce the \u201chot cargo\u201d clause in the collective bargaining agreement between it and Garland Coal, but was seeking to enforce only the \u201cwork preservation\u201d clause in the \u201cRepair and Maintenance Work\u201d provision, namely, that part which provides that Garland Coal would not contract out any repair and maintenance work where it has available equipment and regular employees with necessary skills to perform the required work at the mine. Such is not our reading of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-7\">As discussed in the Board\u2019s Decision and Order, the present dispute arose when Allen McCoy, a welder at Garland\u2019s Rose Hill Mine, complained to management on several occasions that Garland was regularly contracting out routine repair and maintenance work on company equipment to nonunion shops. That was the tenor of the complaint throughout the first three steps provided for in the grievance procedure. It was only later that the Union made a slight, but somewhat ambiguous, shift in position by asserting that its complaint basically concerned what work was being subcontracted, and that it was not really concerned with whether the subcontracted work was performed by nonunion persons. Such, in our view, does not expiate any earlier violations of the Act. And our study of the record indicates that there is support for the Board\u2019s finding that the Union, in steps one through three of the grievance procedure, was complaining, in a substantial part, about the fact that repair and maintenance work was being contracted out to companies that were nonunion, and that such is a reaffirmation of the prohibited \u201chot cargo\u201d clause. <em>See Frito-Lay, Inc. v. Retail Clerks Union Local </em>7, 629 F.2d 653 (10th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-9\">The International Union, United Mine Workers of America, as distinguished from District 21 and Local 2428, argues that it is not bound by the acts of its subordinate bodies, and that, accordingly, there is no evidence that it, the International Union, violated Section 8(e) of the Act, even assuming that the District and the Local were guilty of such violations. The Board rejected this argument, as do we. The International, not the District or the Local, is the body certified as the exclusive representative of Garland\u2019s employees. Furthermore, the unlawful \u201chot cargo\u201d clause is in the master bituminous coal agreement, and is signed by the International\u2019s president. Finally, under the International\u2019s constitution the International has delegated its enforcement duties to the District and the Local. It was on this general basis that the Board concluded that the District and the Local were acting as agents for the International. Under the circumstances described, we are in accord.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>The cross-petitioners also suggest that the present controversy is, with the passage of time, moot, since the collective bargaining agreement between the International Union and Garland has now expired. We do not believe the matter is moot. Nor do we find the remedial orders overly broad. Therefore, the order should be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-4\">Order enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
