HALL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1447-18\">Bethlehem Steel Corporation (\u201cBethlehem\u201d) petitions the Court pursuant to Section 11(a) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a), for review of an order of the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d). In this order the Commission found that Bethlehem had violated the provisions of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(a)(2) and a regulation promulgated thereunder by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d), 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.-33(c)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The regulation requires employers to protect employees performing welding operations in enclosed spaces on surfaces covered with a toxic preservative coating. We conclude that the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the regulation at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1360\">*1360</page-number>issue in this case is controlling and that substantial evidence supports the Commission\u2019s finding that Bethlehem violated the regulation\u2019s standard. We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-5\">Bethlehem operates a shipyard at Key Highway in Baltimore, Maryland, where it employs approximately 1,000 workers. During March and April, 1978, some of these employees were engaged in welding operations in cargo tanks aboard the SS ESSO PHILLIPINE, a crude oil tanker that was berthed for repairs at the Key Highway shipyard. The repair work involved \u201cburning\u201d out old steel plates and welding new plates in their place. Both the old and the new steel plates were coated with Rust-Ban 191, an inorganic zinc coating used to control corrosion on steel surfaces.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-6\">The Material Safety Data Sheet, prepared by the manufacturer of Rust-Ban 191, lists the product under the heading \u201cPaints, Preservatives, and Solvents,\u201d states that it contains 80% zinc, and recommends employee protection in the form of respirators and masks. Bethlehem possessed a copy of this document.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-7\">In the course of replacing the steel plates, Bethlehem employees performed \u201chot work\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> directly on the Rust-Ban 191 coating. Tests conducted by Bethlehem\u2019s industrial hygienist revealed that, as a result of these operations, measurable concentrations of zinc oxide fumes were released into the surrounding work area. The cargo tanks were mechanically ventilated by fans and, during part of the time \u201chot work\u201d was being performed, Bethlehem provided fume-filter cartridge respirators for use by the employees. At no time, however, were air-line respirators (i.e. those having a source of air independent from the work area) made available.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-13\">After receiving a complaint that some employees claimed they had experienced flu-like symptoms while performing the welding and burning operations,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> an OSHA compliance officer conducted a workplace inspection on July 12, 1978. At the time of the inspection, repairs to the vessel had been completed and the oil tanker had already been returned to service. Several employees, however, were interviewed and based on information obtained from these interviews, the Secretary of Labor cited Bethlehem for violating Section 5(a)(2) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(a)(2),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and for failing to comply with 29 C.F.R. 1915.33(c)(1). This regulation provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1448-14\">\u00a7 1915.33 <em>Welding, cutting and heating in way of preservative coatings.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1448-15\"># * * if: sf:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1448-16\">(c) <em>Protection against toxic preservative coatings. </em>(1) In enclosed spaces all surfaces covered with toxic preservatives shall be stripped of all toxic coatings for a distance of at least 4 inches from the area of heat application or the employees shall be protected by air line respirators meeting the requirements of \u00a7 1915.82(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1448-17\">Bethlehem contested the OSHA citation and the matter was heard initially by a Commission administrative law judge (ALJ). The ALJ found that Rust-Ban 191 was a preservative coating within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.33(c), but vacated the citation on the ground that the Secretary had failed to show that Bethlehem\u2019s employees were exposed to toxic concentrations of zinc oxide under the standard set forth in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.1000(a)(2), Table Z-l.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1361\">*1361</page-number>Following the Secretary\u2019s petition to the full Commission for review of the ALJ\u2019s decision, a majority of the three-member Commission issued an order reversing the ALJ and assessing a penalty of $300.00 against Bethlehem for violation of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.33(c)(1). The Commission majority rejected Bethlehem\u2019s argument that the Secretary must show the presence of zinc oxide fumes in excess of the OSHA exposure limit in Table Z-l in order to establish a violation of \u00a7 1915.33(c). The Commission concluded that Rust-Ban 191 is a toxic preservative coating within the meaning of the cited standard and that the regulation automatically applies whenever employees weld in enclosed spaces on surfaces coated with that substance. Bethlehem petitions this Court for review of the Commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-5\">On appeal, Bethlehem contends that the Commission\u2019s decision is erroneous because Rust-Ban 191 is (1) not a preservative coating and (2) not toxic until it exceeds an eight-hour time-weighted average of 5 milligrams of zinc oxide fumes per cubic meter of air (5 mg./M3), the threshold limit value or TLV for zinc oxide. We disagree and conclude that the Commission\u2019s finding that 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.33(c) is applicable to this case is both reasonable and supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-6\">Bethlehem initially contends that it should not have been cited for a violation of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.33(c) at all, because, according to a marine chemist who testified as an expert witness before the ALJ, Rust-Ban 191 is not a \u201cpreservative\u201d coating but merely a zinc-bearing metallic coating. Consequently, Bethlehem submits that a different regulation, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.-31(c)(1),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which merely requires that adequate ventilation be provided, is controlling in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-10\">Both the ALJ and the Commission rejected Bethlehem\u2019s argument and concluded that Rust-Ban 191 is a preservative coating subject to the standard set forth at 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.33(c). The record demonstrates that the Material Safety Data Sheet specifically lists Rust-Ban 191 under the heading \u201cPaints, Preservatives, and Solvents,\u201d rather than under the heading \u201cAlloys and Metallic Coatings.\u201d As required by 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.57(b) and (c), this document was in Bethlehem\u2019s possession. Accordingly, there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the Commission\u2019s finding that Rust-Ban 191 is a preservative to which 29 C.F.R. \u00a7; 1915.-33(c)(1) applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-11\">We also sustain the Commission\u2019s decision that Rust-Ban 191 is a toxic preservative coating within the meaning of the cited standard. The Commission majority reasoned as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-12\">(1) The Material Safety Data Sheet states that Rust-Ban 191 is a preservative containing 80% zinc with a TLV of 5mg./M3. It prescribes the use of respirators, masks, and adequate ventilation whenever the product is used. OSHA\u2019s ship-repairing regulations require Bethlehem to keep informed of all information supplied in this document. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1915.57(b) and (e). Bethlehem is required to use the Material Safety Data Sheet to ascertain the potential hazards likely to be encountered in the use of Rust-Ban 191 and to take appropriate precautionary measures. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1915.57(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-13\">(2) 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.31(c)(1) defines material containing zinc as being \u201cof toxic significance.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.2(s), now codified at 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.4(v), defines \u201chazardous materials\u201d as having any of sev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>en characteristics, including \u201c... a threshold limit value ... below 500mg./M3 for fumes.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-4\">(3) OSHA\u2019s ship-repairing standards at 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.57(a) specifically incorporate the provisions of Section 1915.2(s) and put employers on notice that materials which have a TLV below 500mg./M3 are \u201chazardous:\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-5\">\u00a7 1915.57 Health <em>and </em>sanitation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay7V\">(a) No chemical product, such as a ... preservative; [and] no structural material, such as ... zinc coated steel ... which is a hazardous material within the meaning of \u00a7 1915.2(s), shall be used until the employer has ascertained the potential fire, toxic, or reactivity hazards which are likely to be encountered in the handling, application, or utilization of such a material.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1450-6\">(4) Because 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.1000(a)(2), Table Z-l lists the low TLV for zinc oxide fumes as 5mg./M3, zinc oxide falls squarely within the Secretary\u2019s definition of a hazardous material and is clearly a toxic substance within the meaning of the ship-repairing standards, whether or not the actual production of fumes exceeds the TLV. Therefore, once the material, as here, is deemed to be toxic, the employer must implement the protective measures prescribed by 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.33(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-7\">In interpreting the regulation in this case, the Commission majority thus rejected Bethlehem\u2019s contention that 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.33(c) is triggered only when the level of zinc oxide exceeds its TLV- of 5mg./M3. Under the Commission\u2019s view, the standard requires that, whenever Rust-Ban 191 is used, either the preservative coating be stripped to ensure that no zinc oxide is released at all, or that air-line respirators be utilized to protect employees from exposure to any zinc oxide fumes that may be created by the welding or burning operations. In so holding, the Commission stressed the preventive intent of the standard articulated in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.33(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-8\">We conclude that the Commission\u2019s decision is not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise contrary to law, and therefore, should be sustained by this Court. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). By its own terms the regulation does not limit its applicability to situations where the TLV has been exceeded and does not specify any level of air contaminants as necessary to trigger the worker protection requirements. The preventive intent of the regulation is compatible with the Congressional goal of assuring working men and women so far as possible safe and healthful working conditions. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 651(b). We find that the interpretation of the regulation by the Secretary and the Commission is, therefore, entitled to deference by this Court. <em>Floyd S. Pike Electrical Contractor, Inc. v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Rev. Comm\u2019n, </em>576 F.2d 72, 75-76 (5th Cir.1978); <em>Wisconsin Electric Power Co. v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Rev. Comm\u2019n, </em>567 F.2d 735, 738 (7th Cir.1977); <em>Budd Co. v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Rev. Comm\u2019n, </em>513 F.2d 201, 204-205 (3d Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-9\">Our review of the record, furthermore, indicates that there is substantial evidence to support the Commission\u2019s finding that Bethlehem violated the Act by failing to take the protective measures required by 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.33(c). It is undisputed that Bethlehem\u2019s employees were welding and burning in enclosed spaces on unstripped steel surfaces covered with Rust-Ban 191. The record demonstrates that these employees were not provided with air-line respirators. Based on these facts, there is substantial evidence to support the Commission\u2019s finding that Bethlehem violated the Act and the pertinent regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the Commission is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1447-12\">.
