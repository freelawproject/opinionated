Cadet (Cadet), Barry Saffaie (Saffaie), and Tabassom Aya-zi (Ayazi) with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1542-28\">We must decide whether the district court erred in dismissing this matter because of the government\u2019s good faith refusal to obey certain provisions of the court\u2019s discovery order. We have concluded that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1455\">*1455</page-number>was improper to dismiss the indictment since significant portions of the order were invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-6\">PERTINENT FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-7\">An indictment was returned by the grand jury on June 30,1982, charging Cadet, Saf-faie, and Ayazi with transporting, receiving, and selling documents allegedly stolen from International Business Machines Corporation (IBM).</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-8\">On July 9, 1982, the court ordered that the defendants\u2019 pretrial motions be filed by July 30, 1982. The government was ordered to file its response to such motions by August 6, 1982. Counsel for Saffaie asked the court to set a trial date outside the \u201cstatutory 70-day period because of the complexity of the case\u201d and to schedule the hearing motions \u201csometime in either October or November.\u201d The court was advised by Saffaie\u2019s attorney that the government had no objection. The court denied this request and set the matter for trial within the statutory time after stating that the alleged complexity of the case did not constitute good cause for the suggested delay. The court ordered that all pretrial motions be heard on August 13, 1982. September 7, 1982 was scheduled as the date for trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-9\">On July 30, 1982, Saffaie and Ayazi filed a joint motion for discovery and requested that a hearing be conducted on August 13, 1983. Cadet filed a separate discovery motion requesting a hearing on the same date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-10\">On July 30, 1982, counsel for Saffaie and Ayazi also filed a motion to dismiss the charges against them with prejudice \u201cdue to the government\u2019s failure to comply with formal and informal requests for discovery pursuant to Rules 12(d)(2) and 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-11\">On August 6, 1982, the government filed its response to these motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-13\">Hearing on the discovery motions was held on August 13, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-14\">The court granted Cadet\u2019s request for discovery as to the following material described in his motion filed July 30, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-15\">\u201c(1) All statements, confessions, admissions, remarks, or utterances of the defendants, made to investigating officers or to third parties, including IBM Corporation, National Semiconductor (NSC) and National Advance Systems (NAS) or employees or agents of said companies, as well as those statements, admissions, remarks, and utterances which may have been incorporated in any report, statement, memorandum, or other document or recording prepared by federal, state, or local government agents, including but not limited to investigators and/or attorneys of the FBI or the Department of Justice, or by any other persons working in conjunction with such agents, including but not limited to Richard Callaghan and/or other employees of IBM Corporation (IBM).

The court made the following comments in ruling on these matters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1550-22\">Now, with respect to the government\u2019s motion for modification of the discovery order. With respect to that the court will address each of the requests as presented to the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1550-23\">With respect to request no. 1, the court finds that the plaintiff\u2019s tactic in furnishing a statement about the FBI\u2019s relationship with IBM and Palyn is properly criticized by the defendant. It is counter to the general principles of judicial discovery for one party to define in advance what materials the other parties will need to properly prepare for trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1550-24\">Accordingly, the court denies plaintiff\u2019s motion regarding request no. 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1550-25\">With respect to request no. 2, the court finds that the plaintiff\u2019s flat assertion that their FBI-IBM agreement satisfies defendants needs is unsupported by argument or authority. Good cause appearing therefore, the court denies plaintiff\u2019s motion regarding request no. 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1463\">*1463</page-number>With respect to request no. 3, the court finds that the seven reasons advanced by defendants as to why the personnel files are material to the defense are on their face satisfactory. The plaintiff\u2019s motion, written in advance of defendants\u2019 reply, does not address those seven points. But even in spite of that, and giving all consideration to the motion brought by plaintiff, the court finds that with respect to request no. 3 it is without merit and it\u2019s therefore denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1551-5\">With respect to request no. 4, as to this request, pursuant to the dictates of <em>United States v. Walk, </em>and the provisions of the Jencks Act, I feel that I must exclude, under item no. 4, all statements made to prospective government witnesses. Other than that, the previous order will stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1551-6\">With respect to government\u2019s request no. 6, the government cites no authority for the contention that Rule 16 subsection A subsection 1 subsection C would require a showing by defendant of a particularized need, and the court finds that no such need is necessary \u2014 or no such showing is necessary; therefore, good cause appearing, the court denies the plaintiff\u2019s motion with respect to request no. 6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1551-7\">With respect to request no. 13, the court finds the government has offered no proof that the documents and information which the defendants seek are not material to the preparation of defendants\u2019 case and, therefore, within the purview of Rule 16, subsection A, subsection 1, subsection C; good causing [sic] appearing, the court denies plaintiff\u2019s motion with respect to request no. 13.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1551-8\">Now, with respect to request no. 14, the court, prior to argument, and the explanation given by Mr. Meltzer, felt that the government had a proper contention. The court is now satisfied that the defendant has shown a need for the identity of the informant, and that the identity is significant to the presentation of defendants\u2019 case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1551-9\">Now, that completes the items the government objected to with respect to the defendants Suffaie (sic) and Ayazi.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1551-10\">Now, with respect to those of the request of Mr. Cadet, which were his requests ho. 4, 5, and 6 the court finds no merit in the government\u2019s objection; and, good cause appearing therefore, those motions are denied as to requests 4, 5 and 6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1551-11\">On September 20, 1982, Saffaie and Ayazi filed a motion to dismiss the indictment based on the government\u2019s failure to comply with their \u201cformal and informal requests for discovery\u201d and the district court\u2019s discovery orders of August 13, 1982 and September 3, 1982. The district court was advised that no discovery had been received pursuant to requests 7, 9,11,10,16 and 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b1551-12\">On September 21, 1982, Cadet filed a separate motion joining in the request that the indictment be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1551-13\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1551-14\">The government filed its response to the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss on September 23, 1982. The district court was advised that there was no lack of compliance with requests 7, 9, 11, 15,16 and 18. As to these items the court\u2019s discovery order did not compel compliance until seven days before trial. The court was informed that the government had provided discovery of \u201call items which it intends to use at trial, all documents obtained from defendants, and numerous other documents which would not otherwise be discoverable under Rule 16, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1551-15\">The government declined to produce any additional statement of \u201cthe past and present relationship of IBM and Palyn Associates with all agencies, departments and entities of the United States as ordered by the court on August 13, 1982.\u201d In its written response, the government contended that the order was invalid because (1) the defendants failed to make a showing of materiality as required by Rule 16 and <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), (2) compliance would be unreasonably burdensome, and (3) production would jeopardize ongoing investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1464\">*1464</page-number>The government also notified the court that it had failed to deliver the personnel files ordered pursuant to request number 3 because of the failure of the defendants to show the materiality of any information contained in these files.</p>\n<p id=\"b1552-4\">The district court was notified that the government had complied in part with request number 6 by producing all documents it intended to use as evidence in its case in chief at trial. Further the government expressed its willingness to produce the documents referred to in sections 6(e), 6(g), 6(h) and 6(i), and to identify the employers requested in item 6(f). The court was told that the government would not comply with the remaining portions of the order because of the defendants\u2019 failure to show materiality as to those items in the government\u2019s possession. Insofar as request number 6 appears to require the production of material not in the possession of the government, the government stated it had no obligation to seek materials from third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1552-5\">The court was further informed that the \u201cnames and addresses of and statements of all witnesses\u201d the government does not intend to call would not be furnished as required by request number 10 unless such person would provide exculpatory evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1552-6\">The government also declared it would decline to produce any \u201cnon-exculpatory material\u201d which is included on request number 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1552-7\">The court was also told that it was \u201cinappropriate to provide statements of confidential informants\u201d as required by request number 14 prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1552-8\">Finally, a stay of the court\u2019s order was requested pursuant to 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.27 pending review by the Deputy Attorney General of the United States Attorney\u2019s refusal to comply with the court\u2019s discovery order, as required by 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.24(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b1552-9\">IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b1552-10\">Hearing on the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss was held on September 24, 1982. The court advised counsel at the outset that it was considering incarceration of the United States Attorney for contempt based on his refusal to comply with the court\u2019s order and for his failure to obtain a timely review of his position from the Deputy Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b1552-12\">Counsel for Saffaie, Paul B. Meltzer, urged the court not to hold the United States Attorney in contempt, but, instead, to order dismissal of the indictment because \u201c[tjhere has been a serious violation of this court\u2019s order and it grossly prejudiced the defense.\u201d Mr. Meltzer informed the court that the defense \u201cwants both workbooks that were turned over in the course of the transactions which formed the indictment, and also the later current Adirondack workbooks.\u201d The court interrupted counsel with the following observation: \u201cWell, I can\u2019t understand Mr. Meltzer and attorneys for the government, how the very subject of this indictment, the books themselves, have not been turned over.\u201d Mr. Meltzer replied: \u201cI can\u2019t either.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1552-13\">The government replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1552-14\">We have turned these over. Mr. Metzler wants us \u2014 the current I.B.M. workbooks of a similar nature which are not in our possession. I cannot go out and grab something from somebody else\u2019s possession and turn it over to defense. I don\u2019t have it. I can\u2019t turn it over.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1552-15\">The court suggested that defense counsel serve a subpoena duces tecum on I.B.M. The court thereupon took the motion to dismiss under submission and granted a stay of its discovery order until September 28, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b1552-16\">X.</p>\n<p id=\"b1552-17\">The government informed the court at the September 28, 1982 hearing that the Deputy Attorney General had concurred in the recommendation of the United States Attorney that the government would not comply with items 1, 2, 3, 6,10,13 and 14 of the district court\u2019s discovery order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1552-18\">After hearing argument, the court orally announced its decision to dismiss this case with prejudice because of the government\u2019s good faith refusal to comply with the discovery order and the government\u2019s delay in bringing defendants to trial. The court found that \u201cthe discovery ordered by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1465\">*1465</page-number>court is necessary and proper for the preparation of the defendant\u2019s case herein\u201d and that it was \u201cindispensable in the interest of justice and due process of law.\u201d On October 15, 1982 the court filed its order and opinion and entered a judgment of dismissal of the indictment. The trial judge stated that in reaching his conclusion to dismiss \u201cthe court finds that the defendants could not go to trial and present their defenses without the discovery ordered by the court. This discovery is vital to their defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1553-5\">XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1553-6\">The government has presented the following issues for our review:</p>\n<p id=\"b1553-7\">One. Did the district court abuse its discretion in directing the government <em>to prepare </em>statements describing the past and present relationships and agreements of IBM and Palyn Associates with the United States government and all of its agencies in this and all similar civil and criminal cases and <em>to obtain </em>and provide copies of all documents involving these relationships and agreements as required in the discovery requests numbered 1 and 2?</p>\n<p id=\"b1553-8\">Two. Did the district court abuse its discretion in directing the production of the entire personnel files of certain government agents for inspection by the defendants as required in discovery request 3?</p>\n<p id=\"b1553-9\">Three. Did the district court abuse its discretion in directing the government to produce for inspection by the defendants, all physical and documentary material obtained or developed during the investigation of this matter that the government does <em>not </em>intend to offer in evidence as required in discovery request number 6?</p>\n<p id=\"b1553-10\">Four. Did the district court abuse its discretion in ordering the government to provide the defendants with the names, addresses, and statements of all <em>witnesses </em>that the government did <em>not </em>intend to call as witnesses at the trial of this matter as required by request number 10?</p>\n<p id=\"b1553-11\">Five. Did the district court abuse its discretion in ordering the production of <em>all </em>documents relating to the \u201cAdirondack workbooks\u201d in the absence of a showing that <em>each </em>of these documents was material to the defense under <em>Brady v. Maryland?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1553-13\">Six. Did the district court abuse its discretion in ordering the production of any statements made by government informants including mere \u201ctipsters\u201d as required by request number 14?</p>\n<p id=\"b1553-14\">XII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1553-15\">\n<em>Creation of Discovery Material</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1553-16\">The government has partially complied with the requests numbered 1 and 2. The following statement was submitted in response to the defendants\u2019 request for information concerning the relationship between the government and IBM which would demonstrate that this prosecution was conducted \u201cat the behest of and controlled by IBM.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1553-17\">On October 29,1981, Richard A. Callahan and J.R. Rosetti, employees of IBM, met with Special Agents Jack Van Wagenen, James Sturgis and John Guido of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington, D.C. Callahan and Rosetti explained to the agents that IBM had conducted an investigation which indicated that certain confidential information had been stolen or converted from IBM and transported to Hitachi, Ltd. in Japan. It was agreed that Callahan would meet with FBI agents in San Jose to discuss further investigation to be conducted by the FBI. It was further agreed that Callahan would assist the FBI investigation by serving as interface between the FBI and IBM, which would provide whatever assistance the FBI required of them. From this date on, all decisions relating to the investigation were made by the FBI, including the decision to include Callahan as an undercover operative. IBM provided assistance during the investigation as requested by the FBI, which assistance continued up through the date of return of this indictment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1553-18\">Prior to October 29,1981, the principals of Palyn Associates, Maxwell O. Paley and Robert Domenico, cooperated with IBM\u2019s internal investigation. After this date, Paley and Domenico assisted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1466\">*1466</page-number>FBI as requested by the FBI. Callahan served as the interface between the FBI and Palyn Associates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1554-4\">As previously indicated in the government\u2019s response to defendants\u2019 motion for discovery, the government agrees to treat Callahan, Paley and Domenico as if they were law enforcement personnel for the purposes of discovery. Defendants have received all statements made by them to these persons, if any.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1554-5\">In addition, the government produced a copy of a written cooperation agreement it had entered into with IBM.</p>\n<p id=\"b1554-6\">The government declined to create a statement of the past and present relationship between the government, IBM and Palyn Associates in the investigation of <em>United States v. Hitachi, Ltd., </em>CR No. 82-372-SW (SJ) (N.D.Cal.1982), <em>United States v. Mitsubishi Electric Corp., et al., </em>CR No. 82-396 WAI (SJ) (D.C.Cal.1982), and all other federal criminal or civil cases of a similar nature. The government also refused to furnish a statement describing all written or oral agreements and all documents concerning IBM cooperation or assistance in the investigation of the <em>Hitachi </em>and the <em>Mitsubishi </em>cases, and all other federal criminal or civil cases, past or present, of a similar nature. In addition, the government also failed to produce the names and addresses of all persons involved in such relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b1554-7\">The defendants argued to the district court that if some material demonstrated that \u201ca significant relationship exists between such entities as IBM and Palyn Associates and if the conduct of their officers, agents or employers is attributable to the government, it would be helpful in proving the defenses of entrapment and outrageous governmental conduct.\u201d Fed.R. Crim.P.Rule 16(a)(1)(C) provides that the defendant shall be entitled to discovery of materials in the \u201cpossession, custody, or control of the government\u201d which are \u201cmaterial to the preparation of his defense.\u201d A showing of materiality, however, is \u201cnot satisfied by a mere conclusory allegation that the requested information is material to the preparation of the defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Conder, </em>423 F.2d 904, 910 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 958, 91 S.Ct. 357, 27 L.Ed.2d 267 (1970). While the district court is not limited in the exercise of its discretion to ordering the production of material that meets the Rule 16 standard, here there simply appears to be no justification in the record for this part of the court\u2019s order. The defendants failed to present any <em>facts </em>which would tend to show that the government was in possession of information that would be helpful to the defense. Before this court, Saffaie and Ayazi have not referred us to any facts in the record which demonstrate that the government has in its possession information material to the defense. Instead, Saffaie and Ayazi have limited their response to the government\u2019s argument on this issue to the following terse sentences: \u201cThe government contends the showing of materiality made by defendants was inadequate. Such a contention. is directly at odds with the District Court\u2019s express and implicit findings.\u201d The district court did not make any specific finding of fact concerning items 1 and 2. The trial judge\u2019s statement that \u201cthe discovery ordered by the court is necessary and proper for the preparation of the defendants case herein\u201d is wholly conclusory, unsupported by any facts in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1554-9\">In the statement submitted in response to discovery items 1 and 2, the government acknowledges that Callahan, Paley, and Domenico were acting as agents of the government at the time of their first contact with the defendants. The defendants had requested discovery so as to determine whether IBM or Palyn representatives were acting as agents of the government in order to establish entrapment, or outrageous government conduct. The government\u2019s concession that these persons were acting as governmental agents adequately responded to this concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b1554-10\">The government has acted responsively and appropriately in attempting to comply with the court\u2019s order concerning the requests numbered 1 and 2. We regret that in other respects, the government\u2019s conduct in this matter has been decidedly less conciliatory and responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1467\">*1467</page-number>The government argues that the court\u2019s order concerning requests numbered 1 and 2 were overbroad and unreasonably burdensome in that it required a \u201cmassive and unreasonable nationwide canvas of all federal agencies, civil and criminal.\u201d No evidence was offered by either side as to the actual burden which would have been imposed in responding to this request. We need not reach this contention, however, because we believe that the government\u2019s submission in response to items 1 and 2 should satisfy any possible legitimate defense need for information concerning IBM\u2019s involvement in the conduct of the government\u2019s investigation of this matter. We find that the government has substantially complied with requests 1 and 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1555-5\">B. <em>Personnel Files</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1555-6\">The court ordered the government to produce the personnel files of three agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for inspection by the defendants. The court stated that these records \u201cwere very germane to the issues before the court.\u201d In response to the discovery motions filed August 16, 1982, the government advised the district court that the request for the personnel files should be denied because no showing of materiality had been made. The government made a similar argument in <em>United States v. Deutsch, </em>475 F.2d 55 (5th Cir.1973). There, the government argued that the defendant had \u201c \u2018failed to show that the records which he sought to inspect contained anything favorable to him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 58. The Fifth Circuit replied to this assertion as follows: \u201cThis is true, but it is not the answer to <em>Brady. </em>The burden is on the government to produce, not on the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b1555-7\">In its motion for reconsideration, the government offered for the first time to review these files to determine whether they contained any information helpful to the defense. The government requested that the court \u201cmodify its order to require the prosecutor to examine the personnel files for material helpful to the defense.\u201d The district court declined <em>sub silentio </em>to modify its order as requested. We find this belated request by the government curious and disingenuous in light of the government\u2019s constitutional duty under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), to disclose exculpatory information to an accused. No order was necessary to compel the government to accord due process to these defendants. Before this court, the government again offered to examine the personnel files for <em>Brady </em>material. That duty should have been performed in August of 1982, as soon as the government was made aware of the defendant\u2019s request for the personnel files in order to assist the defendants in their trial preparation. The prosecutor\u2019s oath of office, not the command of a federal court, should have compelled the government to produce any favorable evidence in the personnel records. While we cannot condone the prosecutor\u2019s recalcitrant behavior, it is evident to us the court abused its discretion in ordering disclosure of the entire personnel file without first conducting an in camera inspection to determine whether the files contained any <em>Brady </em>material.</p>\n<p id=\"b1555-9\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>611 F.2d 770 (9th Cir.1980) we spelled out the proper procedure to follow where the government is confronted with a <em>Brady </em>question. In <em>Gardner </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1555-10\">The prosecution may not suppress exculpatory evidence that is material to the issue of guilt or punishment. <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). In a case in which a general request for exculpatory evidence is made, the test for materiality is whether the suppressed evidence \u201ccreates a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist.\u201d <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 112, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 2402, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1555-11\">In response to a request for exculpatory evidence the prosecution does not have a constitutional duty to disclose every bit of information that might affect the jury\u2019s decision; it need only disclose information favorable to the defense that meets the appropriate standard of materiality. <em>See Agurs, </em>427 U.S. at 108-112, 96 S.Ct. 2392. If the prosecution is uncertain about the materiality of informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1468\">*1468</page-number>tion within its possession, it may submit the information to the trial court for an <em>in camera </em>inspection and evaluation. <em>See id. </em>at 106, 96 S.Ct. at 2399 (prosecutor may respond to specific request by \u201csubmitting the problem to the trial judge.\u201d); <em>United States v. Ross, </em>511 F.2d 757, 765 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 836, 96 S.Ct. 62, 46 L.Ed.2d 54 (1975).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1556-4\"><em>Id. at </em>774-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b1556-5\">The district court abused its discretion in ordering that the <em>entire </em>personnel file be produced for inspection by the defendants. In view of the privacy interests involved, only that portion of the files which may contain evidence \u201cmaterial to the preparation of [a] defense\u201d pursuant to Rule 16(a)(1)(C) or exculpatory under <em>Brady </em>and <em>Agurs </em>is discoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1556-6\">C. <em>Discovery of Physical and Documentary Evidence Not Intended for Use at Trial by Government</em></p>\n<p id=\"ars-dedup-1\">The government claims that the district court abused its discretion in requiring the government to produce all physical and documentary evidence \u201cwhich the government does not intend to use at trial but is deemed material to the preparation of the defense\u201d as requested by Saffaie and Ayazi in item number 6. The government also challenges that portion of the court\u2019s order which granted Cadet\u2019s discovery request number 6 requiring the preparation of \u201c[a]n inventory of all physical and documentary evidence relevant to the case ... which the government does not intend to offer as evidence at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1556-7\">The government asks us to find that these orders are invalid because the defendants failed to make a showing that these items were material to the preparation of the defense as required by Rule 16(a)(1)(C). We recognize that the trial court has broad discretion in deciding what items are material to the preparation of the defense. In this instance, however, we agree that the discovery request was so far ranging and potentially burdensome that it was an abuse of discretion to grant the portions of the request opposed by the government here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1556-8\">To obtain discovery under Rule 16(a)(1)(C), a defendant must make a prima facie showing of materiality. <em>United States v. United States District Court, Central District of California, </em>717 F.2d 478, 480 (9th Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Buckley, </em>586 F.2d 498, 506 (5th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 982, 99 S.Ct. 1792, 60 L.Ed.2d 242 (1979). A general description <em>of </em>the materials sought or a conclusory argument as to their materiality is insufficient to satisfy the requirements of Rule 16(a)(1)(C). <em>See United States v. Marshall, </em>532 F.2d 1279, 1285 (9th Cir.1976) (general description and conclusory arguments are insufficient to show materiality under former Rule 16(b)). Cadet\u2019s request for all \u201crelevant\u201d evidence is equally inadequate to meet the requirements of Rule 16(a)(1) (C). <em>United States v. Cafaro, </em>480 F.Supp. 511, 519 (S.D.N.Y.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1556-9\">Defendants therefore have failed to make a showing of materiality sufficient to entitle them to discovery as of right under Rule 16(a)(1)(C). It is not necessary for them to make as strong a showing of materiality to uphold a trial court\u2019s discretionary granting of discovery as it would to overturn a trial court\u2019s denial of discovery. In this instance, however, the wholly conclusory showing and the great breadth of the discovery request convince us that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to grant the portions of item 6 disputed by the government before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1556-10\">D. <em>Names, Addresses and Statements of Witnesses the Prosecution Does Not Intend to Use</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1556-11\">The district court ordered the government to produce for Cadet\u2019s inspection the names and addresses of all \u201cwitnesses to the actions described in the indictment\u201d whom the government does not intend to call at trial. The court also ordered the government to disclose the names and addresses of \u201call witnesses to the offenses charged in the indictment whom the government does not intend to call as witnesses in this case\u201d as requested by Saffaie and Ayazi.</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1469\">*1469</page-number>The government contends that \u201cthe identity of non-witnesses is not discoverable absent [a] showing of materiality.\u201d Appellants did not request the identity of <em>non-witnesses. </em>They sought the names and addresses of <em>witnesses </em>to the \u201cactions\u201d or \u201coffenses\u201d charged in the indictment. A person who has actually witnessed a crime through any of his senses can either provide evidence which is favorable to the defense or which may tend to raise a reasonable possibility that the accused is guilty. Thus, it was quite appropriate for the district court to conclude from the fact that the government did not intend to call a witness to the crime that there was a reasonable possibility that such person would be able to provide evidence favorable to the defense. No further showing of materiality was required. The government offered no evidence to rebut this logical inference. No legitimate governmental interest has been suggested which would justify denying to the accused the identity of a witness to a crime whose testimony may be exculpatory. \u201cWitnesses, particularly eye witnesses, to a crime are the property of neither the prosecution nor the defense. Both sides have an equal right, and should have an equal opportunity, to interview them.\u201d <em>Gregory v. United States, </em>369 F.2d 185, 188 (D.C.Cir.1966). Thus, the district court\u2019s order compelling disclosure of the names and addresses of such witnesses did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-4\">The court also compelled production of the <em>statements </em>of witnesses the prosecution did not intend to call. This portion of the court\u2019s order was contrary to the law of this circuit. In <em>United States v. Mills, </em>641 F.2d 785 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 902, 102 S.Ct. 409, 70 L.Ed.2d 221 (1981), we held that Rule 16(a)(2) precludes the court from ordering the government to produce statements of prospective witnesses whom the government subsequently decides not to call at trial. 641 F.2d 789-90. The court abused its discretion in ordering the government to produce the statements of witnesses it did not intend to call at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-5\">F. <em>Adirondack Hardware Design Workbooks</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1557-6\">The government\u2019s objection to item 13 is not clear. On August 13, 1983 the government advised the district court that \u201c13 is basically a request for <em>Brady </em>material, and <em>the government certainly has no objection to that.\u201d </em>(emphasis added). In its opening brief before this court, the government again characterizes item 13 as a request for \u201cexculpatory material under <em>Brady.\u201d </em>The government appears to object to the specific request for \u201call documents which discuss the information contained in the Adirondack Hardware Design Workbooks.\u201d The government advises us that not all of these documents will contain <em>Brady </em>material. The government states that it will \u201cprovide all <em>Brady </em>material, if any, concerning these workbooks.\u201d Instead of defying the authority of the district court, the government advised the district court that it would produce all <em>Brady </em>material as soon as it became available. Any doubt concerning the applicability of <em>Brady </em>to any specific document referred to in item 13 should have been submitted to the court for an in camera review. The government has chosen instead to deny all discovery to the defendants, and suffer a dismissal, because the district court denied its request that item number 13 should be expressly limited to <em>Brady </em>material.</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-7\">E. <em>Identity and Statements of Confidential Informants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1557-8\">Before the trial court the government took the position that the statements of confidential informants were not discoverable before trial. During oral argument the government advised this court that there are no undisclosed confidential informants. The government has not explained its failure to advise the trial court that the order was inappropriate because all the names of all informants had been revealed. The government\u2019s dissembling on this issue has been burdensome to both court systems. As appellate judges we are not in a position to decide questions of historical fact or credibility. Upon remand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1470\">*1470</page-number>of this matter, the district court should reexamine the government\u2019s duty to disclose the identity of its informants consistent with the requirements of <em>Roviaro v. United States, </em>353 U.S. 53, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957). The court should determine whether there are any undisclosed informers whose testimony would be helpful to the defense. Request number 14, as submitted to the court, may be in conflict with <em>Roviaro. </em>We need not decide the validity of request number 14 at this time, however, because that issue may have become moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-5\">Because we have determined that the court abused its discretion in ordering the government to comply with an order which is partially invalid, we must vacate the judgment dismissing this action as a disproportionate sanction for the lack of good faith compliance by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-6\">We close our review of this matter, however, with the strong sense that this unfortunate contretemps could have been avoided had the United States Attorney\u2019s Office been willing to produce all <em>Brady </em>and Rule 16 material in a timely manner and to submit material as to which there was any doubt for in camera review. While the discovery order was overbroad in some respects, it appears to us that the United States Attorney was more concerned with forcing an appellate confrontation in this matter than attempting to effect a reasonable accommodation with the district court\u2019s earnest efforts to protect each defendant\u2019s right to inspect discoverable materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-7\">To ensure that the government will act promptly to fulfill its duties to the accused under the due process clause, the district court is directed to require the government to produce all <em>Brady </em>material now in the possession of the government within a certain date to be fixed by the court. The district court shall also order the government to submit for in camera inspection any material as to which there may be a doubt whether it will be helpful to the defendants. The district court is also requested to order the government to disclose the names and addresses of any witnesses to the crime charged in the indictment. If any doubt exists that a witness will be helpful to the defense, it should be resolved by the court in an in camera proceeding. The government should be ordered to submit the personnel records for an in camera inspection for <em>Brady </em>material. The district court should also determine whether any informants remain undisclosed. If so, the court should apply the balancing test set forth in <em>Roviaro </em>before ordering disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-9\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1544-8\">. The district court defined its use of the term \u201cwitness\u201d in item 10 as limited to \u201cindividuals that were potential witnesses that either witnessed some act or observed some documents, conduct, behavior or act.\u201d When the prosecutor inquired as to whether this request was limited to persons \u201cwho may have information helpful to the defense within the meaning of <em>Brady\", </em>the court replied: \u201cThere must have been some reason for your investigators to inquire of them and obtain information from them.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1544-14\">. The court limited this request to <em>\u201cBrady v. Maryland </em>material and Jencks Act material, in the time allotted by Jencks.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1544-15\">. Later in these proceedings, at the request of the government, the court stated that item 12 was granted \u201cto the extent that it did not conflict with the Jencks Act.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1544-16\">. The government advised the court it was prepared to turn over all impeaching matter which was material. The prosecutor was ordered to turn over all impeaching material to the court forthwith for an in-camera determination as to its materiality.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1545-7\">. The government objected to the granting of this request on the ground that nothing in the rules or case law supports an order that a document must be created summarizing past relationships between the government, IBM and Palyn. The court replied that a prima facie case had been presented which established that Mr. Callahan was involved in the IBM-FBI cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1545-8\">. The prosecutor was not permitted to argue his position on this matter. Instead, the court stated as follows: \u201cWe\u2019ll turn now to Item 2. With respect to item 2, the court grants that request. And again your argument would be the same Mr. Ward, and I note your argument, and its the same as previously given.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1545-9\">. The government objected to item 3 in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1545-12\">Your honor, I think it is an unwarranted intrusion. There is absolutely no reason why they should go into the personnel records of government agents who were involved in this particular case. There has been nothing advanced by these defendants as to why those records would be helpful to them. I think this is an intrusion on the privacy of these individuals without some kind of a showing that this relevant to a defense in this case. The court replied: \u201cAll right. Thank you Mr. Ward.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1545-13\">The court proceeded to consider the next request without requiring Saffaie or Ayazi to make a showing that the personnel records would be helpful or relevant to the presentation of the defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1548-6\">. In response to the prosecutor\u2019s request for a clarification as to item 8, the court ruled that discovery would be limited to statements of co-conspirators whom the government did <em>not </em>intend to call as witnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1549-7\">. Counsel for the government stated that item 13 was \u201cbasically a request for <em>Brady </em>material, and the government certainly has no objection to that.\u201d When asked why the <em>Brady </em>material had not already been turned over to the defendants, counsel for the government replied that it was not yet available.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1549-8\">. In clarifying this portion of the order, the court advised the government that it would be required to turn over the names of \u201ctipsters\u201d even if they were not percipient witnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1549-9\">.
