The Wyoming Hospital Association, on behalf of its institutional members, and twenty-two individual hospitals brought this suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from enforcement of regulations issued under the \u201cHill-Burton\u201d hospital construction assistance program. The regulations were issued pursuant to Title VI and Title XVI of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 291-291o-1 and \u00a7\u00a7 300q-300s-6, and are codified at 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 124, subparts F and G.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">The Hill-Burton Act was intended to assist in the \u201cconstruction and modernization of such public or other nonprofit community hospitals ... as may be necessary ... to furnish adequate hospital .. . services to all ... people.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 291(a). To obtain assistance under the Act, states were required to submit a plan to the Surgeon General which furthered the purposes of the Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 291c, 291d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">Two of the assurances required of the state plan form the gravamen of this suit. These two assurances are known respectively as the \u201ccommunity service assurance\u201d which ensures medical treatment to all persons residing in the territorial area of the hospital who apply for assistance and the \u201cuncompensated care assurance\u201d which requires that a reasonable volume of medical services will be given to those persons unable to pay for the services. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 291c(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">The early regulations issued pursuant to \u00a7 291c(e) did not define what was a \u201creasonable volume of services\u201d or the eligibility requirements for free care. In 1972, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare issued regulations which defined presumptive compliance with the \u201creasonable volume\u201d provision. Those regulations allowed a Hill-Burton facility to elect either to adhere to a minimum percentage formulation or to adopt an \u201copen door\u201d policy. The minimum percentage option allowed compliance if the facility provided yearly uncompensated care at either a level of three percent of its operating costs or at a level of ten percent of the amount of the federal assistance. The \u201copen door\u201d policy provided that the hospital could certify that it would treat any person regardless of his ability to pay. Under that policy, the hospital would perform the services without charge or would charge only such an amount as the patient could afford. The hospital was not required to perform any minimum amount of such services. All of the hospitals in this suit elected to comply under the \u201copen door\u201d policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-9\">In 1979, the Secretary promulgated new regulations. The plaintiffs acknowledge that the regulations were issued in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. The 1979 regulations that are at issue here are significantly different from the 1972 regulations. Subpart F deletes the \u201copen door\u201d option. The three percent/ten percent option is retained, but is made subject to inflation for each year after 1979. Also, reimbursements from insurance programs or Medicare or Medicaid and amounts in excess of the payments the hospitals are entitled to receive under such programs cannot be applied toward uncompensated care obligations. The obligations of Subpart F are not durationally limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-10\">The 1979 Subpart G regulations concern the community service assurance and seek to prevent a hospital from refusing services on any ground unrelated to an individual\u2019s need. Subpart G also describes impermissible policies which could exclude certain patients. If the hospital has complied with its Subpart F uncompensated service obligations, then it may deny service to those unable to pay for it. Compliance with the Subpart G regulations is required in perpetuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-11\">The plaintiffs first contend on appeal that the 1979 regulations exceed the Secretary\u2019s statutory authority. Regulations must be set aside if they are arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), or if the agency has acted in excess of its statutory jurisdiction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(C). Deference is accorded administrative regulations. <em>Conway v. Watt, </em>717 F.2d 512 (10th Cir.). This court has frequently applied the \u201crational basis\u201d standard to agency actions. <em>Anderson v. U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development, </em>701 F.2d 112 (10th Cir.); <em>CF &amp; I Steel Corp. v. Economic Development Administration, </em>624 F.2d 136 (10th Cir.). That standard is applicable here. <em>See American Hospital Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Schweiker, </em>721 F.2d 170 (7th Cir.); <em>Ethyl Corp. v. Environmental Protection Agency, </em>541 F.2d 1 (D.C.Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">The Secretary was and is given broad authority under the Hill-Burton Act to promulgate general regulations. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 291c. That authority extends to regulating the hospitals\u2019 community service assurance and uncompensated care assurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">As to the Subpart F regulations which apply to the uncompensated care assurance, plaintiffs contend that these are onerous, overly rigid, and that they are not rationally related to the services provided by the hospitals. The plaintiffs object to the volume of care mandated and to the lack of alternatives if fulfillment of the uncompensated care requirements is not financially feasible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">The regulations provide, as mentioned, that hospitals must provide uncompensated care equal to either three percent of their operating costs or to ten percent of the amount of the Hill-Burton funding for twenty years. Adjustments for inflation are also made. The hospitals contend that they may be forced to repay 200 percent of the funding amount plus the inflation adjustment, and that such a repayment is unduly burdensome. However, the uncompensated care standards represent the considered reaction of the Secretary to the failure of the \u201copen door\u201d policy. As mentioned, the \u201copen door\u201d policy in theory required hospitals to admit all needy patients. In practice, insufficient uncompensated care was given in some instances. <em>See, e.g., Euresti v. Stenner, </em>458 F.2d 1115 (10th Cir.). The Secretary developed more specific standards to see that a reasonable volume of uncompensated care is provided. <em>See American Hospital Ass\u2019n v. Schweiker, </em>721 F.2d 170 (7th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-10\">The plaintiffs also contend the regulations to be onerous because the uncompensated service volumes are carried over if not fully complied with in a given year. The carryover provisions are again a method of ensuring that a reasonable volume of services is provided. The regulations are not in conflict with the statutory provision that \u201can exception shall be made if such a requirement is not feasible from a financial viewpoint.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 291c(e). As the Seventh Circuit has stated, that provision \u201cdoes not mandate a total waiver of the uncompensated care obligation when a facility is unable to pay.\u201d <em>American Hospital Ass\u2019n v. Schweiker, </em>721 F.2d 170 (7th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-11\">The plaintiffs claim that the Secretary\u2019s elimination of the \u201copen door\u201d provision was arbitrary and capricious. However, the Secretary was under statutory mandate to see that a reasonable volume of uncompensated care was provided. Because monitoring compliance under the \u201copen door\u201d option was at least difficult, the Secretary promulgated levels of presumptive compliance in the exercise of his discretion. His deletion of an \u201copen door\u201d option developed certainty in compliance and fairness, and was well within his authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-12\">The plaintiffs urge also that the regulations apply to services in the hospital that have no connection with the facilities constructed by the Hill-Burton funds. Title VI provides that \u201cthere will be made available in the facility or portion thereof to be constructed or modernized a reasonable volume of [uncompensated care].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 291c(e). The statute is framed in the disjunctive; the hospital may provide uncompensated care either in the portion of the hospital constructed or modernized by the Hill-Burton funds or in other parts of the hospital. Neither the statute nor the regulations compel a hospital to offer its entire facility for uncompensated care. However, the hospital cannot thwart the \u201creasonable volume\u201d provisions by limiting care to certain parts of its facilities. <em>Corum </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number><em>v. Beth Israel Medical Center, </em>359 F.Supp. 909 (S.D.N.Y.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">The plaintiffs next argue that the regulations wrongfully exclude certain credits for uncompensated care. Section 124.502 of the regulations adopts the Medicare definition for measuring reimbursable costs. The statute requires that the hospitals provide a reasonable <em>volume </em>of services, not a dollar amount of services. The Secretary\u2019s decision to so limit the uncompensated care credit is rationally based and within his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">We have considered other objections by plaintiffs and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">We therefore conclude that the Subpart F regulations are within the Secretary\u2019s authority and are rationally based.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-7\">The Subpart G regulations relate to the \u201ccommunity service\u201d assurance. The plaintiffs object to the regulations as being in excess of statutory authority, contrary to the legislative intent, and that the regulations wrongfully regulate hospital admissions and the practice of medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-8\">The community service assurance (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 124.603) provides that the facility shall be made available</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhKP\">\u201cto all persons residing ... in the facility\u2019s service area without discrimination on the ground of race, color, national origin, creed, or any other ground unrelated to an individual\u2019s need for the service or the availability of the needed service in the facility.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1028-9\">The regulations also provide that a hospital may deny service to indigents if the hospital has fulfilled its uncompensated care requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-10\">The plaintiffs argue that the statute requiring the community service assurance was intended only to counter discrimination and that the detailed regulations promulgated thereunder are in excess of that authority. The language of \u00a7 291c(e) is unambiguous. It provides that \u201cthe facility or portion thereof to be constructed or modernized will be made available to all persons residing in the territorial area of the applicant.\u201d That the hospital may have to take certain affirmative steps to ensure their treatment is well within the statutory purview. The community service obligation is not limited to traditional anti-discrimination concerns. Moreover, we are not troubled by the fact that the community service obligations are perpetual under the regulations. The statute is not durationally limited nor can any limitation be implied. <em>Lugo v. Simon, </em>426 F.Supp. 28, 36 (N.D.Ohio).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-12\">The plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the Sub-part G regulations constitute an impermissible regulation of hospital admissions and the practice of medicine is without merit. While the regulations do not require the hospital to take affirmative steps to comply with the community service assurance they are not violative of the provisions of \u00a7 291m. Section 291m proscribes federal control over the administration and operation of any recipient facility. An exception allows the government to exercise control over the facilities if that control has been specifically authorized by statute. Section 291c(e) which requires that the facilities be made available to all residents constitutes just such an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-13\">We therefore conclude that the Subpart G regulations are within the Secretary\u2019s statutory authority and are rationally based.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-14\">The plaintiffs raise two constitutional challenges to the regulations. The plaintiffs claim that the regulations impermissibly impair the hospitals\u2019 contractual rights by adding conditions to which they did not assent at the time they received the funds. The trial court declined to reach the question as to whether a contract existed between the federal government and the hospitals, preferring to hold that whatever obligations existed between the government and the hospitals were \u201cgoverned at least in part by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 291c(e).\u201d We agree. The distinction between whether the Hill-Burton funding was contractual in nature or made pursuant to the government\u2019s authority under the spending clause is not necessary to our decision. The obligations under \u00a7 291e(e) for community service and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>the assurance of a reasonable volume of uncompensated care were extant at the time funding was made. So too was the requirement of compliance with regulations issued pursuant to \u00a7 291c. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 291e(b). Thus, any Hill-Burton funding was made expressly subject to compliance with the regulations issued under \u00a7 291c(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">That the Secretary\u2019s discretion under \u00a7 291c is broad and open-ended does not impair the hospitals\u2019 rights. If the regulations are rationally related to the statute and in compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act, the fact that they upset the expectations of the parties does not condemn them. <em>F.H.A. v. The Darlington, Inc., </em>358 U.S. 84, 79 S.Ct. 141, 3 L.Ed.2d 132. <em>Cf. Fleming v. Rhodes, </em>331 U.S. 100, 67 S.Ct. 1140, 91 L.Ed. 1368. As we held above, the regulations comport with this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-7\">The current regulations may be more stringent than previous regulations issued under \u00a7 291e(e), but as the court noted in <em>The Darlington, </em>\u201cThose who do business in the regulated field cannot object if the legislative scheme is buttressed by subsequent amendments to achieve the legislative end.\u201d 358 U.S. 84, 91, 79 S.Ct. 141, 146, 3 L.Ed.2d 132. <em>See also American Hospital Ass\u2019n v. Schweiker, </em>721 F.2d 170 (7th Cir.). Consequently, we hold that a change in the regulations does not constitute an unconstitutional impairment nor is it a wrongful derogation of the plaintiffs\u2019 due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-8\">The plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the regulations are constitutionally infirm as retroactively applied is not well founded. While the regulations may not be in accord with the hospitals\u2019 expectations of how the assurances would be enforced, \u201c[s]uch inconsistencies are not equivalent to unconstitutionality.\u201d <em>Springdale Convalescent Center v. Mathews, </em>545 F.2d 943, 955 (5th Cir.). <em>See also Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., </em>428 U.S. 1, 15-16, 96 S.Ct. 2882, 2892, 49 L.Ed.2d 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-9\">We have considered the remainder of the plaintiffs\u2019 legal and procedural arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-10\">It is therefore the judgment of this court that the order of the trial court denying the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and granting the defendants\u2019 cross-motion for summary judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
