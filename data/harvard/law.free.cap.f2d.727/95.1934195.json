JONES, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">This case is presently before the Court upon Dennis Szymkowiak\u2019s appeal from his conviction for possession of an unregistered weapon in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d) and \u00a7 5871. Szymkowiak contends that the district court erred in failing to suppress the weapon, the seizure of which should not have been excused under the \u201cplain view\u201d exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement. Upon consideration of the issues presented by this appeal, we agree that the weapon was unlawfully seized and therefore vacate the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">On February 22, 1982, Toledo police officers obtained a warrant to search Szym-kowiak\u2019s apartment for specified items of jewelry and a T.Y. set. Detective John Connors and four other Toledo policemen executed the warrant. They did not find the jewelry or the T.V. The officers did, however, discover and seize two weapons. The firearms were not mentioned in the warrant and the officers did not anticipate that they would be found on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Detective Higbie entered a safe in the bedroom where he found jewelry, guns and ammunition clips. He removed these items to the living room. While searching the dining room area, Officer Gerken found an AR-15 weapon next to the couch. On the floor next to the couch, Gerken found a case which contained ammunition for the weapon. After looking at the AR-15 and the other firearms, the officers could not determine whether the guns seized were designed or specifically adapted to fire a succession of bullets. They therefore could not determine whether possession of these guns was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">The officers called the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) and asked Agent Haverstick to come to the apartment to look at the firearms. Haverstick, arriving at the apartment about thirty minutes later, stated that possession of the guns was not in violation of federal law, but was probably in violation of Ohio state law. The officers testified that the guns contained no clips and were not reported as stolen. Haverstick further stated that he could not clearly determine without disassembling the firearms whether they had been illegally adapted for fully automatic performance. The officers decided to seize the guns, based upon Haverstick\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">Szymkowiak thereafter was charged with unlawful possession of two automatic weapons, a R PB Industries pistol, SM 10 model (count I) and a Colt AR-15 rifle (Count II). The latter weapon is relevant to this appeal. Appellant moved to suppress the rifle on the theory that it had been seized from his apartment in violation of the Fourth Amendment. United States Magistrate James G. Carr conducted a hearing on the Motion to Suppress. On December 14,1982, the magistrate issued a report and recommendation, finding that the weapon had been lawfully seized pursuant to the \u201cplain view\u201d exception to the warrant requirement. Appellant filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation. District Judge Don J. Young, however, adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation to deny the Motion to Suppress and held that the officers in this case complied with the requirements of the \u201cplain view\u201d exception to the warrant requirement. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">The \u201cplain view\u201d exception to the warrant requirement was first explored in <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971). In that plurality opinion, the Supreme Court stated that in order to seize evidence pursuant to the \u201cplain view\u201d exception, executing officers must show, (1) a prior valid intrusion, (2) an inadvertent discovery, and (3) that the evidence of an unlawful act was \u201cimmediately apparent\u201d to them. This Court has completely adopted the <em>Coolidge </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>analysis. <em>See e.g. United States v. Gray, </em>484 F.2d 352 (6th Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1158, 94 S.Ct. 916, 39 L.Ed.2d 110 (1974); <em>United States v. Truitt, </em>521 F.2d 1174 (6th Cir.1975). Appellant concedes that the executing officers\u2019 prior intrusion was valid and that their discovery of the weapon was inadvertent.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The issue before us, therefore, is whether Szymkowiak\u2019s criminality was \u201cimmediately apparent\u201d to the officers from their \u201cplain view\u201d of the seized weapon. In <em>Texas v. </em>Brown, -- U.S. --, 103 S.Ct. 1535, 75 L.Ed.2d 502 (1983), the Supreme Court most recently had occasion to consider this \u201cimmediately apparent\u201d test. In <em>Brown, </em>the seizing officer validly stopped an automobile as part of a routine license check and inadvertently discovered a knotted party-balloon suspiciously placed in between the driver\u2019s fingers. The Supreme Court, confronted with these facts, held that the criminal nature of the seized object was \u201cimmediately apparent\u201d in light of the officer\u2019s particular experience with the wide use of such balloons to carry narcotics. Although a majority of the Court joined in this judgment, only two justices concurred in the Court\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">In its plurality opinion, the Court reasoned that the \u201cplain view\u201d exception is an extension of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s \u201cprobable cause\u201d requirement. 103 S.Ct. at 1543. Justice Rehnquist stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-10\">[t]he seizure of property in plain view involves no invasion of privacy and is <em>presumptively reasonable, assuming that there is probable cause to associate the property with criminal activity.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">103 S.Ct. at 1543; <em>quoting, Payton v. New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 587, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 1380, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980). Thus to the extent that <em>Brown </em>has any precedential weight at all, it stands for the proposition that evidence in <em>plain view </em>may be seized where the executing officers have \u201cprobable cause\u201d to believe that a nexus exists between the viewed item and criminal activity. In <em>Brown, </em>a majority of the Supreme Court agreed that such a nexus was \u201cimmediately apparent\u201d to the executing officer because no \u201cinnocent item\u201d is \u201ccommonly carried in uninflated, tied-off balloons.\u201d 103 S.Ct. at 1545 (Powell, J. Concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">The <em>Brown </em>decision\u2019s formulation of the \u201cimmediately apparent\u201d test is consistent with this Court\u2019s earlier pronouncements of that test in <em>Gray, </em>484 F.2d at 352 and <em>Truitt, </em>521 F.2d at 1174. In <em>Gray, </em>we declared unconstitutional the seizure of rifles inadvertently discovered by officers while they executed a valid search warrant for alcoholic beverages. In that case, the police removed the rifles from the defendant\u2019s closet, examined them, copied down their serial numbers and seized them. We concluded first that the incriminating nature of the seized evidence was not \u201capparent\u201d to the officers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-14\">The rifles were not contraband; there was no nexus between the rifles and the crimes of selling and possessing intoxicating liquor without a license....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-15\">484 F.2d at 355. Even if the incriminating nature of the rifles had been \u201capparent,\u201d the Gray Court concluded, the appearance of criminality was not \u201cimmediate.\u201d We found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-16\">the officers <em>at that time </em>[did not] have any knowledge of any other crimes. It was only after Trooper Brodt had seized the weapons, copied down the serial numbers, left the defendant\u2019s premises, and then ran the information taken off the rifles through the National Crime Information Center that he learned that they were stolen and hence incriminating, (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-17\">484 F.2d at 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-18\">In <em>United States v. Truitt, </em>we reiterated these general guidelines to the \u201cplain view\u201d exception, but upheld the seizure of evidence under the particular facts of that case. While conducting a lawful search, the executing officers in that case inadvertently discovered a sawed-off shotgun. This Court concluded that probable cause was \u201cimmediately apparent\u201d to those officers from the particular nature of the viewed object and the circumstances of its discovery. We stated that <em>Coolidge</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>fully provides the justification for the seizure of the shot-gun if that shot-gun can qualify as \u201can incriminating object\u201d found under circumstances where \u201cit is immediately apparent to the police that they have evidence before them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Unlike the officers in <em>Gray, </em>521 F.2d at 1174, the executing officers in <em>Truitt </em>could reasonably derive probable cause to believe that the seized evidence was incriminating from the very moment they \u201cfirst discovered\u201d the \u201cintrinsically\u201d suspicious evidence. 521 F.2d at 1176-1177. The officers\u2019 knowledge of the incriminating nature of the shot-gun in <em>Truitt, </em>then, was \u201cimmediate.\u201d Moreover, we concluded in <em>Truitt </em>that the criminal nature of the possession of a sawed-off shotgun was \u201capparent\u201d from the mere discovery of the object:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP8\">a sawed-off shotgun in private hands is not an intrinsically innocent object. The possession of it is a serious crime, except under extraordinary circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">521 F.2d at 1174; citing, <em>Porter v. United States, </em>335 F.2d 602, 607 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 983, 85 S.Ct. 695, 13 L.Ed.2d 574 (1964). In contrast to the seizure in <em>Gray, </em>the seizure in <em>Truitt </em>was accomplished in a circumstance in which probable cause was both \u201cimmediate\u201d and \u201capparent\u201d to the officers from the intrinsic nature of the object.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The standard which we have gleaned from <em>Gray, Truitt, </em>and <em>Brown, </em>therefore, requires a reviewing court to determine whether, under the circumstances of each case, probable cause was both \u201cimmediate\u201d and \u201capparent\u201d to the executing officers from the nature of the object viewed. We believe that this standard is mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s constant warning that any exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s Warrant Clause be \u201ccarefully delineated.\" <em>Brown, </em>103 S.Ct. at 1544 (Powell, J. Concurring); <em>United States v. Ross, </em>456 U.S. 798, 102 S.Ct. 2157, 72 L.Ed.2d 572 (1982); <em>Arkansas v. Sanders, </em>442 U.S. 753, 99 S.Ct. 2586, 61 L.Ed.2d 235 (1979); <em>Mincey v. Arizona, </em>437 U.S. 385, 98 S.Ct. 2408, 57 L.Ed.2d 290 (1978); <em>Vale v. Louisiana, </em>399 U.S. 30, 90 S.Ct. 1969, 26 L.Ed.2d 409 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">The requirement that probable cause be \u201cimmediate\u201d from the discovery of the object specifically averts the \u201cdanger inherent in such a situation that officers will enlarge a specific authorization, furnished by a warrant or an exigency, into the equivalent of a general warrant to rummage and seize at will.\u201d <em>See Brown, </em>103 S.Ct. at 1546, (Stevens, J. Concurring). As a reviewing court, we best obviate the risk of prolonged, war-rantless rummaging by objectively determining whether <em>at the time </em>of discovery the officer had probable cause to connect the item with criminal behavior. <em>Brown, </em>103 S.Ct. at 1546. To prevent any such abuses of the warrant requirement, we must also ensure that probable cause be \u201capparent\u201d to the executing officers at the time of discovery. In considering whether probable cause was \u201capparent\u201d to the executing officers, a reviewing court should be duly mindful of the executing officers\u2019 particular, subjective training and experiences. <em>See Brown, </em>103 S.Ct. 1545 (Powell, J., Concurring); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981). Where an executing officer\u2019s probable cause to connect the viewed item with criminal behavior is not <em>both </em>\u201cimmediate\u201d and \u201capparent,\u201d however, the individual\u2019s interests in retaining possession of property and in maintaining privacy, <em>see Brown, </em>103 S.Ct. at 1546, and society\u2019s interest in lawful enforcement activity, <em>see Johnson v. United States, </em>333 U.S. 10, 68 S.Ct. 367, 92 L.Ed. 436 (1948), are greatly compromised.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">After a careful examination of the controlling case law, the applicable policies and the record in this case, we conclude that the executing officers\u2019 probable cause to connect the seized weapon with criminal activity was neither \u201cimmediate\u201d nor \u201capparent.\u201d The incriminating nature of the evidence seized was at no time \u201capparent\u201d to the seizing officers or agents. We note initially that no \u201cnexus\u201d whatsoever exists between the seized weapon and the items particularized on the search warrant. <em>See United States v. Gray, </em>484 F.2d at 355. Further, our review of the record indicates that even ATF agent Haverstick did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>have probable cause to believe from the <em>intrinsic nature </em>of the seized weapon that the evidence was incriminating. Haver-stick, a firearms expert, testified that he believed that possession of such a weapon was not a federal offense. He also stated that he could not determine from the exterior of the weapon whether its possession violated Ohio law. The possession of an automatic firearm in Ohio violates O.R.C. \u00a7 2923.17. But Agent Haverstick testified that he \u201ccould not say <em>at the time\" </em>that he examined the weapon whether it was an automatic firearm. (Transcript p. 65). He further testified that he could not determine from his examination of the evidence whether it was specifically adapted for automatic performance. (Transcript pp. 77-80). After Haverstick\u2019s expert examination of the seized weapon, he was able to determine that the firearm\u2019s possession was not violative of federal law and was not able to determine that its possession violated Ohio law.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">While we recognize that \u201cprobable cause\u201d is not proof beyond a \u201creasonable doubt,\u201d <em>see Truitt, </em>521 F.2d at 1177, and is a \u201cflexible, common-sense standard,\u201d <em>see, Brown, </em>103 S.Ct. at 1543, we are unable to find under the circumstances of this case that, even at the late stage of the ATF expert examination of the weapons, probable cause was \u201capparent\u201d from the intrinsic nature of the evidence. Unlike the appearance of the intrinsically incriminating sawed-off shotgun in <em>Truitt, </em>or the knotted balloon in <em>Brown, </em>then, the appearance of the seized weapon in this case did not provide even a firearms expert with probable cause for the seizure. When an <em>expert </em>in the firearms field is unable to associate discovered evidence with criminal activity without actually disassembling the evidence, we can hardly say that probable cause would be \u201capparent\u201d to an officer of <em>\u201creasonable\u201d </em>caution from the evidence itself. <em>Brown, </em>103 S.Ct. at 1543.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Yet, even if probable cause of criminality were \u201capparent\u201d to the ATF expert, such probable cause clearly was not \u201cimmediately\u201d so. The record in this case is clear that the executing officers who discovered the weapon could not <em>\u201cat the time\" </em>of discovery determine whether its possession was unlawful. <em>See Gray, </em>484 F.2d at 356. Like the officers in <em>Gray, </em>the executing officers copied down and called in the firearms\u2019 serial numbers to determine whether the weapons were stolen. Like the officers in <em>Gray, </em>the executing officers also found through NCIC that the seized rifle had not been stolen. Finally, like the officers in <em>Gray, </em>the executing officers did not have probable cause to believe that the possession of such a rifle was incriminating. In <em>Brown, </em>the Supreme Court noted that probable cause \u201crequires that the facts <em>available to the </em>officer\u201d would warrant that officer to believe that he or she may have discovered incriminating evidence. 103 S.Ct. at 1543. From the \u201cfacts available\u201d to the executing officers in the case before us, they could not determine whether they had discovered evidence of a criminal nature. Indeed the officers very decisions to call NCIC for facts not available to them and to call ATF for an examination which was beyond their knowledge to perform, indicate that they did not from the \u201cfacts available to them\u201d <em>see Brown, </em>103 S.Ct. at 1543, \u201cat the time,\u201d <em>See, Gray, </em>484 F.2d at 356, of discovery have probable cause to believe that the firearm was incriminating. Under these circumstances, we can not conclude that the officers\u2019 probable cause derived \u201cimmediately\u201d from the discovery of the object.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Because we conclude that probable cause of criminal activity was neither \u201cimmediate\u201d nor \u201capparent\u201d to the officers from the discovery of the firearm, we hold that the seizure of that evidence in this case violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">Accordingly, we conclude that the Motion to Suppress should have been granted and we hereby VACATE the conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
