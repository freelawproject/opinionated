We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-21\">The issue in this case is the proper classification for Customs purposes of sheets of acrylic resin imported from Taiwan. The Customs Service classified the merchandise under item 771.41 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States as \u201cflexible\u201d plastic sheets and admitted them duty-free under the General System of Preferences as products from Taiwan. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2461-2465 (1982); 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202 (1982) (General Headnote 3(c) to the Tariff Schedules).</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-22\">The appellant, which manufactures a similar product which it sells in the United States under the trademark \u201cPlexiglas,\u201d filed with the Customs Service pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516 (1982) a petition challenging that classification. The appellant contended that the merchandise should have been classified as \u201csheets ... of acrylic resin\u201d \u201cother\u201d than \u201cflexible\u201d under item 771.45, and subjected to the duty prescribed for that item. The Customs Service denied the petition and appellant filed the present suit in the Court of International Trade to set aside that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-23\">After a trial, the Court of International Trade sustained the classification. The court followed the prior decision of the Customs Court in <em>Sekisui Products, Inc. v. United States, </em>63 Cust.Ct. 123 (1969), which held that the common meaning of \u201cflexible\u201d in item 771.42 (the forerunner of item 771.-41) is the dictionary definition: \u201ccapable of being flexed: capable of being turned, bowed, or twisted without breaking.... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>Flexible is applicable to anything capable of being bent, turned, or twisted without being broken and with or without returning of itself to its former shape.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-4\">The Court of International Trade held that \u201cCongress has chosen not to amend the law to define \u2018flexible\u2019 in a commercial designation even though made specifically aware of the <em>Sekisui </em>decision and its ramifications.\u201d It ruled that the appellant \u201cfailed to prove that the term \u2018flexible\u2019 has a commercial designation based on a trade understanding of the term \u2018flexible\u2019 which differs from its common meaning and is not in conflict with clearly manifested legislative intent.\u201d The court concluded that the appellant \u201chas failed to demonstrate a contrary legislative intent other than the common meaning of the term \u2018flexible\u2019 [and] has also failed to show through plenary proof a definite, general and uniform commercial designation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-6\">A. \u201cThe meaning of a tariff term is presumed to be the same as its common or dictionary meaning in the absence of evidence to the contrary.\u201d <em>Bentkamp v. United States, </em>40 C.C.P.A. 70, 78 (1952), <em>quoted with approval in United States v. C.J. Tower &amp; Sons, </em>48 C.C.P.A. 87, 89 (1961). One who argues that a term in the tariff laws should not be given its common or dictionary meaning must prove that \u201cthere is a different commercial meaning in existence which is definite, uniform, and general throughout the trade.\u201d <em>Moscahlades Bros. v. United States, </em>42 C.C.P.A. 78, 82 (1954). The concept of commercial designation \u201cwas intended to apply to cases where the trade designation is so universal and well understood that the Congress, and all the trade, are supposed to have been fully acquainted with the practice at the time the law was enacted.\u201d <em>Jas. Akeroyd &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>15 Ct.Cust.App. 440, 443 (1928). \u201cProof of commercial designation is a question of fact to be established in each case.\u201d <em>S.G.B. Steel Scaffolding &amp; Shoring Co. v. United States, </em>82 CustCt. 197, 206 (1979) (and cases there cited).</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-7\">As noted, the Court of International Trade ruled that the appellant had not proved that \u201cthe term \u2018flexible\u2019 has a commercial designation based on a trade understanding of the term \u2018flexible\u2019 which differs from its common meaning .... \u201d Based upon our review of the record in light of the principles governing the determination of commercial meaning set forth above, we cannot reject that finding as clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-9\">The appellant\u2019s expert witness, Reinhart, whom the court described as \u201cpossessing] excellent qualifications indicating a lifelong career devoted to researching and evaluating plastic materials,\u201d had been the chairman of a subgroup at the American Society for Testing and Materials, an organization Reinhart called \u201cthe largest and probably the most influential standardization body in the whole world.\u201d His subgroup attempted for two or three years to formulate a definition of \u201cflexible,\u201d but the endeavor was unsuccessful \u201cbecause there was not enough agreement to reach a definition.\u201d Instead, the subgroup used and defined the terms \u201crigid,\u201d \u201csemirigid,\u201d and \u201cnonrigid.\u201d Reinhart also testified that although the dictionary definition of \u201cflexible\u201d was \u201cnot the same in the plastic industry,\u201d he knew people in that industry who have said it is the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-10\">The appellant introduced evidence that the kind of acrylic sheet here involved was marketed or described in sales and promotional literature not as flexible, but as rigid. That evidence, however, did not affirmatively establish a commercial meaning of flexible that differs from the dictionary definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-11\">In a recent case in which it was contended that the tariff items \u201cclasps\u201d and \u201csew-on fasteners\u201d had commercial meanings different from their common meanings, we held that the appellant had \u201cfailed to establish commercial designations for those terms which are \u2018definite, uniform and general\u2019 throughout the United States. The opinion of [appellant\u2019s] witnesses, that the fasteners are not known as clasps or sew-on fasteners in the garment trade, is not conclusive proof of the required commercial meanings .... \u201d <em>Bar Zel Expediters, Inc. v. United States, </em>698 F.2d 1210, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>1212, (Fed.Cir.1983). That principle applies equally in this case. The doctrine of commercial meaning reflects an assumed congressional intent to adopt for Customs purposes the accepted industry meaning of a term. A showing that the industry routinely uses the negative or opposite of the term is not sufficient to establish that Congress adopted the industry\u2019s view that a particular product is to be classified under a particular item.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\">Although the Court of International Trade did not explicitly find that the acrylic sheet here involved was flexible under the ordinary or dictionary meaning of that term, that determination was implicit in its decision upholding the classification. The court pointed out that the government\u2019s witness had observed two men at the importer\u2019s office flex a sheet of acrylic so that the ends touched without breaking the sheet, and that in a demonstration at the trial the witness, together with the appellant\u2019s counsel, had been able to bend acrylic sheets \u201cto a great degree without breaking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-5\">B. The appellant argues that the legislative history of the tariff provision at issue shows that Congress intended acrylic sheet to be classified under item 771.45 as \u201cother\u201d than \u201cflexible.\u201d The argument is somewhat intricate, but there is no need to explicate it here. The legislative history of the Act of November 8, 1977, Pub.L. No. 95-160, 91 Stat. 1271 (amending the Tariff Schedules), shows that Congress recognized that acrylic sheet might be classified as either flexible or nonflexible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-6\">The Senate committee report stated: \u201cImports of flexible sheets of acrylic resin are now dutiable under TSUS item 771.42 [now 771.41] .... Imports of nonflexible sheets of acrylic resin are now dutiable under TSUS item 771.45 . . . . \u201d S.Rep. No. 419, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 3-4, <em>reprinted in </em>1977 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3369, 3371. Since in the 1977 amendment Congress made no change in the tariff provisions here involved, the inference is compelling that Congress intended that acrylic sheet could be classified either as \u201cflexible\u201d or as \u201cother\u201d than flexible (i.e., nonflexible).</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-7\">The legislative history contains an additional indication that Congress viewed the term \u201cflexible\u201d in these tariff items as carrying its common or dictionary meaning. In 1977 the chairman of the House subcommittee requested that \u201cin order to clarify the dutiable status of acrylic sheets,\u201d the Customs Service give the committee \u201can explanation of our practice with respect to the term \u2018flexibility\u2019 as it applies to acrylic sheets classifiable under item 771.42.\u201d Letter from G.R. Dickerson to Representative Charles A. Vanik (July 13, 1977). In response, the Acting Commissioner of Customs stated that the agency\u2019s practice \u201cis guided by\u201d the <em>Sekisui </em>case. He then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1186-8\">The court\u2019s test is exceptionally broad and has caused some administrative difficulty. Further, it appears that as a result of the court\u2019s decision some merchandise is being treated as flexible for tariff purposes which was not so regarded by the framers of the tariff schedules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1186-9\">A quantitiative [sic] test, based on the modulus of elasticity in flexure would be easier to administer and lead to more consistent results.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1186-10\"><em>Id. </em>The \u201cmodulus of elasticity in flexure\u201d test \u2014 under which these acrylic sheets would be classified as \u201cother\u201d than \u201cflexible\u201d \u2014 is the one the appellant urges as the proper basis for determining flexibility <em>vel non.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1186-11\">Congress, however, made no change in these items, although it did change other parts of the tariff schedules. This failure to take any action in response to the government\u2019s suggestion that a change from the dictionary meaning in <em>Sekisui </em>would be appropriate, at least suggests that the Congress acquiesced in the <em>Sekisui </em>interpretation of the term \u201cflexible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-12\">The decision of the Court of International Trade is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
