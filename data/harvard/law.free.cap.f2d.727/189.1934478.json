She overstayed her visa. During her unlawful residence here, she married American citizens twice and had two American-born children. Evidently her American husbands were unable, or unwilling, to obtain a visa for her. And, the immigration authorities ordered her to leave in 1976. After various appeals, her deportation date was scheduled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>for December 30, 1980. On December 29, 1980, she asked to reopen her deportation proceeding to apply for suspension on grounds of hardship. Her motion to reopen was granted and she had a full hearing. The Administrative Law Judge then denied her application for suspension. She appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision and declined to remand her case to the ALJ for consideration of new evidence. She now appeals the Board\u2019s decision to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">The relevant standard governing suspension of deportation is contained in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a)(1), which states that the Attorney General \u201cmay, in his discretion,\u201d suspend the deportation of an alien who has resided in the United States for seven years if the alien proves that he</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ank\">was and is a person of good moral character; and is a person whose deportation would, in the opinion of the Attorney General, result in extreme hardship to the alien or to his spouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United States ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJG\">The Supreme Court, in <em>INS v. Jong Ha Wang, </em>450 U.S. 139, 101 S.Ct. 1027, 67 L.Ed.2d 123 (1981) (per curiam), indicated that the Attorney General enjoys broad authority to interpret and apply the \u201cextreme hardship\u201d provision. <em>Id. </em>at 144-46, 101 S.Ct. at 1032; <em>see INS v. </em>Phinpathya, -- U.S. --, --, 104 S.Ct. 584, 592, 78 L.Ed.2d 401 (1984); <em>LeBlanc </em>v. <em>INS, </em>715 F.2d 685, 689 (1st Cir.1983). And, in the absence of the \u201cspeech therapy\u201d issue, to which we shall turn shortly, Holley\u2019s appeal would be frivolous. The ALJ found that \u201chardship\u201d in her case consisted of the simple facts that finding a well-paying job in Trinidad would likely be more difficult than in the United States and that living conditions were likely to be more difficult there. As the federal courts have held both before and since <em>Wang, </em>the fact that an alien <em>and </em>the alien\u2019s citizen children may find economic or educational circumstances more difficult outside the United States does not require the INS to find \u201cextreme hardship.\u201d <em>See, e.g., INS v. Jong Ha Wang, </em>450 U.S. at 142-43, 101 S.Ct. at 1030; <em>Ramirez-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>695 F.2d 1208 (9th Cir.1983); <em>Bueno-Carrillo </em>v. <em>Landon, </em>682 F.2d 143 (7th Cir.1982); <em>Men Keng Chang v. Jiugni, </em>669 F.2d 275, 278-79 (5th Cir.1982) (per curiam); <em>Banks v. INS, </em>594 F.2d 760, 762 (9th Cir.1979) (per curiam); <em>but cf. Ramos v. INS, </em>695 F.2d 181, 186 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">In addition, the ALJ made well-supported findings of facts that cast doubt on Holley\u2019s good character and on the appropriateness of the INS exercising its discretion on her behalf. These findings concerned two misdemeanor shoplifting convictions that she failed to disclose on her suspension application, false statements in applications for government benefits, and other fairly serious instances of misbehavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">The one difficult issue in this case arises out of the fact that on appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals, Holley\u2019s counsel, for the first time, sought to show that one of Holley\u2019s citizen children suffered from a serious speech defect. He added that Trinidad could not provide the child with the speech therapy available in the Rhode Island public schools. And he asked the Board for a remand to the AU to permit consideration of evidence on this issue. The Board questioned counsel on the matter. It concluded that \u201cdeportation would not cause [Holley] extreme hardship,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he respondent\u2019s request for a remand of the proceedings is denied since it would not serve any useful purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">Holley essentially asks us to review the Board\u2019s decision not to remand her case to take, evidence on the \u201cspeech therapy\u201d issue. We believe the Board has at least as much independent authority to decide this remand request as it has when deciding whether or not to \u201creopen\u201d a deportation proceeding to consider a suspension request. And, in this latter area, its powers to act independently are great. <em>INS v. Jong Ha Wang, </em>450 U.S. at 144-45, 101 S.Ct. at 1031-1032; <em>LeBlanc v. INS, supra. </em>In <em>LeBlanc, </em>we noted that the Board not only can define \u201cextreme hardship\u201d and apply that term; but also, when deciding whether to reopen, the Board can \u201cconsider the likelihood of success;\u201d and it can deny a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>to reopen without reference to hardship \u201cif in its opinion an application to suspend is certain to fail for discretionary reasons.\u201d <em>Id., </em>715 F.2d at 692. This court must accept the Board\u2019s decision not to reopen or to remand unless we find its action to be arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of its power. <em>Id. </em>at 693 (citing <em>Balani v. INS, </em>669 F.2d 1157, 1160 (6th Cir.1982)); <em>see INS v. Phinpathya, </em>-- U.S. at -- n. 6, 104 S.Ct. at 588-589 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">We find three considerations which, taken together, convince us that the Board\u2019s action here was neither arbitrary nor capricious. First, <em>Wang </em>establishes that specification of what constitutes \u201cextreme hardship\u201d is a task committed \u201cin the first instance to the Attorney General and his delegates\u201d and that they \u201chave the authority to construe \u2018extreme hardship\u2019 narrowly should they deem it wise to do so.\u201d 450 U.S. at 144-45, 101 S.Ct. at 1031-1032. Thus, whether differential opportunities for treatment of speech defects can amount to \u201cextreme hardship\u201d is the <em>type </em>of decision that Wang leaves to the INS. We need not, however, explicitly decide whether the INS would have gone beyond the statute were it to interpret \u201cextreme hardship\u201d not to extend to the serious type of speech problem here at issue. Rather, in the circumstances the Board need only have decided that the speech defect problem did not have sufficient <em>weight </em>to overcome the other seriously negative features of appellant\u2019s' case.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Second, the evidence of Holley\u2019s misbehavior is strong; and the record lacks much evidence of redeeming virtues (such as charitable work, civic involvement, etc.). Thus, the Board could reasonably have concluded that the bad outweighed the good to the point where deportation was warranted despite the child\u2019s speech defect problem. <em>See LeBlanc v. INS, supra; Phinpathya v. INS, </em>673 F.2d 1013, 1019 (9th Cir.1981), <em>rev\u2019d on other </em>grounds, -- U.S. --, 104 S.Ct. 584, 78 L.Ed.2d 401 (1984). In this respect, this case differs significantly from <em>Luna v. INS, </em>709 F.2d 126 (1st Cir.1983), where the appellant had never had a hearing on \u201chardship,\u201d or an opportunity to contest the facts relevant to the INS\u2019s negative assertions, or to present positive facts in his favor. Rather, this case is more like <em>LeBlanc, </em>where appellants\u2019 claim of hardship was weak, where there were numerous negative facts that might have weighed against their hardship claim, and where they had had previous opportunities to make their hardship argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">Third, Holley did not raise the speech defect issue until her proceeding\u2019s appellate stage, and she presented no good reason for the delay. INS regulations provide that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aa-dedup-0\">[mjotions to reopen ... shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered ... was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-13\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2. Since there are obvious strong reasons for not allowing deportable aliens to prolong their stays in the United States by obtaining ever additional deportation postponements, it seems particularly reasonable for the INS to take this procedural policy into account on appeal when it has already reopened the proceedings once and given the alien a full opportunity to present evidence. In this respect, too, this case differs from <em>Luna </em>where the appellant clearly could not have presented at least one \u201cnew\u201d feature of his case \u2014 a newborn child \u2014 in the reopening petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-14\">We note that the Board decision would have been less troublesome had the Board clearly spelled out its reasons for not remanding, instead of making the general statement that remand \u201cwould not serve any useful purpose.\u201d <em>See Ramos v. INS, </em>695 F.2d at 188-90; <em>Santana-Figueroa v. INS, </em>644 F.2d 1354 (9th Cir.1981); <em>cf. Dunlop </em>v. <em>Bachowski, </em>421 U.S. 560, 571-72, 95 S.Ct. 1851, 1859-1860, 44 L.Ed.2d 377 (1975). Nonetheless, those reasons are sufficiently plain on the record that remand would serve no useful purpose. <em>See NLRB v. Wyman-Gordon Co., </em>394 U.S. 759, 766-67 n. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1426, 1430 n. 6, 22 L.Ed.2d 709 (1969) (plurality opinion); <em>NLRB v. Community Health Services, Inc., </em>705 F.2d 18, 20 (1st Cir.1983); <em>Kurzon v. United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number><em>Postal Service, </em>539 F.2d 788, 792-93 (1st Cir.1976); <em>Alabama Power Co. v. Federal Power Commission, </em>511 F.2d 383, 392 (D.C.Cir.1974). The decision of the INS is</p>\n<p id=\"ACE\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
