Lynne, U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of Alabama, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1590-28\">JAMES C. HILL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1590-29\">In this case, we must decide whether the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA or Authority) correctly ordered the Department of the Air Force (the Agency or Air Force) to bargain with the American Federation of Government Employees (the Union) about the relative utilization of part-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1503\">*1503</page-number>time and full-time employees at Robins Air Force Base. We hold that the FLRA erred in ordering the Air Force to bargain and refuse to enforce the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-4\">During the course of contract negotiations, the Union submitted the following proposal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1591-5\">Employee Utilization</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1591-6\">Section E: It is recognized that part-time employees are essential in carrying out the mission of the Employer; however, full-time employees will be utilized to the fullest extent possible. Part-time employees will be utilized only when it is not practical nor prudent to use full-time employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1591-7\">The Air Force refused to bargain over the proposal, contending that it deals with a nonnegotiable subject under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7106 (1982). The Union petitioned the FLRA for review of the Air Force\u2019s position under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7117(c)(1) (1982). The FLRA held the proposal to be a proper subject for negotiation under section 7106(b), which sanctions bargaining over \u201cappropriate arrangements\u201d and \u201cprocedural\u201d matters, and ordered the Air Force to bargain. The Air Force now seeks review of the FLRA\u2019s decision under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7123 (1982), and the FLRA seeks enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-8\">The language of the statute provides the starting point for our analysis. Section 7106(a)(2) provides, in pertinent part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1591-9\">Subject to subsection (b) of this section, nothing in this chapter shall affect the [agency\u2019s authority]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1591-10\">(A) to hire, assign, direct, layoff, and retain employees in the agency, or to suspend, remove, reduce in grade or pay, or take other disciplinary action against such employees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1591-11\">(B) to assign work, to make determinations with respect to contracting out, and to determine the personnel by which agency operations shall be conducted;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1591-12\">(C) with respect to filling positions, to make selections for appointments from\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1591-13\">(i) among properly ranked and certified candidates for promotion; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1591-14\">(ii) any other appropriate source ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1591-15\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7106(a)(2). Section 7106(b) provides, however, that the agency and the Union may negotiate</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1591-16\">(1) at the election of the agency, on the numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty, or on the technology, methods, and means of performing work;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1591-17\">(2) procedures which management officials of the agency will observe in exercising any authority under this section; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1591-18\">(3) appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of any authority under this section by such management officials.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1591-19\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7106(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-20\">In reviewing the FLRA\u2019s construction of this statute, we must defer to its decision if it is supported by a rational basis, or, to phrase the test another way, we will uphold the FLRA\u2019s decision absent \u201c \u2018compelling indications that it is wrong.\u2019 \u201d <em>Veterans Administration Medical Center v. FLRA, </em>675 F.2d 260, 262 (11th Cir.1982) <em>( VA Tampa </em>) (quoting <em>National Federation of Federal Employees v. FLRA, </em>652 F.2d 191, 193 (D.C.Cir.1981)). Nevertheless, this court must actively review FLRA decisions; we do not exist simply to \u201crubber stamp\u201d and enforce the FLRA\u2019s orders. <em>See, e.g., Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms v. </em>FLRA, -- U.S. --, --, 104 S.Ct. 439, 440, 78 L.Ed.2d 195 (1983) (FLRA order not enforced); <em>Volkswagenwerk v. GMC, </em>390 U.S. 261, 272, 88 S.Ct. 929, 935, 19 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1968); <em>NLRB v. Brown, </em>380 U.S. 278, 291, 85 S.Ct. 980, 988, 13 L.Ed.2d 839 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1591-23\">The issue before us today is not a new one; the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has addressed several times the effect of similar bargaining proposals. <em>See American Federation of Government Employees v. FLRA, </em>702 F.2d 1183 (D.C.Cir.1983); <em>American Federation of Government Employees v. FLRA, </em>691 F.2d 565 (D.C.Cir.1982); <em>National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA, </em>691 F.2d 553 (D.C.Cir.1982); <em>Department of Defense v. FLRA, </em>659 F.2d 1140 (D.C.Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 945, 102 S.Ct. 1443, 71 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1504\">*1504</page-number>L.Ed.2d 658 (1982). The issue presented in this case and in most of the cited cases is whether a proposal is substantive and not subject to negotiation under 7106(a) or procedural <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and subject to negotiation under section 7106(b). As Judge Wright noted in <em>Department of Defense, </em>the distinction can, at times, be elusive.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1592-4\">There are, on the one hand, cases in which proposals cast in procedural language impinge on substantive management decisions by specifying the criteria pursuant to which decisions must be made. There are, on the other, more nearly \u201cpure\u201d procedures, which have less direct substantive repercussions \u2014 for example, procedures for use in determining which employees possess characteristics identified by management as appropriate criteria for choice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1592-5\">659 F.2d at 1152. Although subsection (b) states that subsection (a) shall not prevent negotiations over procedural matters, <em>see American Federation, </em>702 F.2d at 1185, the explicit relationship between the two subsections does not render less difficult the task of drawing the initial distinction in a given case, <em>cf. id. </em>at 1187 (in construing subsection (b)(2) with subsection (a), statute requires court to observe \u201cconventional dichotomy\u201d between substance and procedure).</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-6\">The Union raises one issue that we must decide before analyzing the facts of this case. In <em>American Federation, </em>the court held that the FLRA erred in utilizing a standard that questions whether the rights at issue are \u201cdirectly related\u201d to substantive rights to decide whether a proposal constitutes an \u201cappropriate arrangement\u201d under subsection (b)(3). <em>Id. </em>at 1186. The Union, which has intervened, argues that, because the FLRA relied here on both subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3) and because the legislative history evidences Congress\u2019 intent not to adopt the \u201cdirectly related\u201d standard for any subsection, the FLRA should have used the \u201cacting at all\u201d standard instead of the \u201cdirectly related\u201d standard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The \u201cacting at all\u201d standard, used by the FLRA in issuing the order enforced by this court in <em>VA Tampa, </em>675 F.2d at 262, voids only those procedures that would prevent agency management from \u201cacting at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-10\">The <em>American Federation </em>court correctly noted that FLRA should apply the \u201cacting at all\u201d standard in subsection (b)(3) cases and the \u201cdirectly related\u201d standard in subsection (b)(2) cases. We need not repeat here the logical underpinings of the distinction ably set forth by Judge Scalia in <em>American Federation, </em>702 F.2d at 1187, except to note that our decision in <em>VA Tampa </em>supports his reasoning. In <em>VA Tampa, </em>the Union proposal concerned the staying of a pending personnel action until grievance or arbitration procedures could be concluded. This is clearly an \u201cappropriate arrangement,\u201d <em>see </em>\u00a7 7106(b)(3), as opposed to a procedure under subsection (b)(2). We noted in <em>VA Tampa </em>that the FLRA uses both standards, but that \u201cthe decision not to use [the \u201cact at all\u201d] standard in \u2018direct interference\u2019 cases cannot invalidate its proper use in the case at hand, an \u2018indirect effect\u2019 case.\u201d 675 F.2d at 266; <em>see also Department of Defense, </em>659 F.2d at 1153, 1159.</p>\n<p id=\"b1592-11\">In this case, however, the FLRA properly applied the more stringent standard. The proposal at issue is not one indirectly effecting substantive rights nor is it an \u201cappropriate arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of [management] authority .... \u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7106(b)(3). The proposal deals directly with the right of the agency under subsection (a) to \u201cdetermine the personnel by which agency operations shall be conducted ... . \u201d To the extent that the FLRA concluded that the proposal is an \u201cappropriate arrangement,\u201d we hold that no reasonable basis supports that decision. Subsection (a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1505\">*1505</page-number>clearly states that the agency retains the authority to determine the \u201cpersonnel by which agency operations shall be conducted\u201d and to hire and fire employees. If this proposal is negotiable as an appropriate arrangement, we cannot envision what would remain for the agency to determine under subsection (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1593-4\">By the same reasoning, we cannot comprehend that the proposal is \u201cprocedural\u201d under subsection (b)(2). We are not impressed by the contention of the FLRA and the Union that the \u201ccurrent proposal does not bind management in the exercise of the assignment of employees or determine the number and types of employees but simply requires management to justify by a reviewable prudent or practical standard their decision to use part-time employees.\u201d Brief of Union at 22. Apparently, the contention is .that while the agency may utilize its discretion in assigning, hiring, and firing employees, it must follow the <em>procedure </em>of favoring full-time employees when reasonable. This is not a procedure at all; it is a substantive decisionmaking tool.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1593-5\">We find nothing in the FLRA decision or in the briefs of the parties causing us to doubt our position on this issue. The FLRA opinion states, in pertinent part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1593-6\">Union Proposal I, on its face, does not explicitly relate to the Agency\u2019s decision as to the numbers of employees assigned to an organizational subdivision or to any of the other management rights alluded to by the Agency. Moreover, the Agency has not demonstrated, and the record does not otherwise disclose, in what manner the proposal is integrally related to and thereby determinative of either the numbers of employees assigned to an organizational unit or any of the other management rights alluded to by the Agency. Rather, the proposal\u2019s requirement that part-time employees be utilized only when it is not practical nor prudent to use full-time employees would establish a general, nonquantatitive contractual requirement by which management\u2019s use of part-time employees could be evaluated in a grievance by a full-time employee who believes he or she has been adversely affected by the Agency action.\u201d <em>See, e.g., American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 1622 and Department of the </em>Army, <em>Fort Meade, Maryland, </em>4 F.L.R.A. No. 66 (1980), wherein the Authority found within the duty to bargain under section 7106(b)(3) a proposal which stated, \u201cHours of Work for employees in the unit will not be reduced without just cause.\u201d The agency had alleged the proposal interfered with the agency\u2019s right to determine the numbers, types, and grades of employees assigned to any work project or tour of duty under section 7106(b)(1). However, the Authority disagreed, emphasizing that the proposal\u2019s general, nonquantative standard was an example of an appropriate arrangement, under section 7106(b)(3), for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1593-10\">The Union argues that the FLRA reasoning is not only correct but that it is supported by the legislative history of the management rights section of the statute; the Union and the FLRA also cite numerous decisions allegedly supporting the result reached here by the Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-11\">Given the clear language of the statute and the clear effect of the proposal, however, the only logical conclusion in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1506\">*1506</page-number>is that the proposal is not bargainable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Despite the FLRA opinion, a proposal requiring the agency to utilize part-time employees only when full-time employees cannot practically or prudently be used is clearly, in the FLRA\u2019s words, \u201cdeterminative of the numbers of employees assigned to an organizational unit .... \u201d We find the contrary opinions of the Authority, such as the one cited in the excerpt above, without rational basis and thus unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-4\">Therefore, we refuse to enforce the decision of the FLRA.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1592-7\">. We use \u201cprocedural\u201d here loosely to encompass the various negotiable subjects set forth in all three subsections of section 7106(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1592-8\">. The Authority stated in its order that the proposal \u201cdoes not <em>explicitly </em>relate ...\u201d as opposed to \u201cdirectly relate\u201d; nevertheless, it is clear from the order that the Authority used the \u201cdirectly related\u201d standard in deciding the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1593-7\">. The FLRA here ordered bargaining; therefore, application of the less stringent standard would not have changed the FLRA\u2019s decision. And, since this is not an appropriate case for the \u201cact at all\u201d test, we need not, as the Union requests, apply that standard in reviewing the order by assuming that the FLRA employed it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1593-8\">. We see no distinction in this regard between the proposal at issue here and the one held not negotiable by the Authority in <em>National Federation of Federal Employees v. Headquarters, U.S. Army Material and Readiness Command, </em>3 F.L.R.A. 611 (1980). The proposal in that case required the agency to negotiate with the Union before hiring outside employees instead of in-house employees. The proposal here will result in review by an arbitrator of the agency\u2019s decision to hire part-time employees instead of full-time employees. Both proposals substantively infringe on management\u2019s section 7106(a) rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1594-13\">. The legislative history of the statute is, at best, equivocal. See <em>American Federation, </em>702 F.2d at 1187.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
