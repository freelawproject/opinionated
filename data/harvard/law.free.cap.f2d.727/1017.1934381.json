LANIER ANDERSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1106-9\">Appellant Chrysler Credit Corporation (\u201cChrysler\u201d) appeals an order of the Bankruptcy Court that allowed a debtor attempting a Chapter 11 re-organization to use \u201ccash collateral\u201d in which Chrysler claimed to have a security interest. We affirm the ruling of that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-10\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-11\">George Ruggiere Chrysler Plymouth (\u201cRuggiere\u201d) is a Florida corporation engaged in business as an automobile dealer. From July 24, 1979, through June 15, 1982, Ruggiere obtained extensive financing from Chrysler to operate its business and purchase inventory. To secure the complete indebtedness to Chrysler, Ruggiere granted the creditor a security interest in \u201call of its Accounts Receivable, Contract Rights, Chattel Paper, Inventory, Equipment and Fixtures, and all proceeds of any of the foregoing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-17\">On June 15, 1982, Ruggiere filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in an attempt to re-organize its business. At the time of filing, its obligation to Chrysler exceeded the value of its collateral by over $1 million dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-18\">On June 17, the dealer filed a motion under 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 363(c)(2) (West-1979), for authority to use cash proceeds to continue its business. The motion admitted that Chrysler had an alleged security interest in those proceeds. It also claimed that Ruggi-ere would protect Chrysler\u2019s security interest by (1) continuing to make required interest payments, (2) providing a security interest in all collateral (apparently including any newly-acquired inventory), and (3) remitting to Chrysler the wholesale value of any automobiles sold-</p>\n<p id=\"A8W\">The court first authorized the emergency use of a specified amount of cash between June 18 and July 9. On July 9, the court entered a \u201cContinuing Interim Order Authorizing Use of Alleged Cash Collateral Proceeds and Regarding Adequate Protection.\u201d The order essentially permitted Ruggiere to use gross profits obtained in the sale of vehicles.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The interim order was finalized by the court on August 17, 1982. Chrysler appeals from this final order, ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>guing that the debtor had not \u201cadequately protected\u201d its all-encompassing security interest and that the court, therefore, erroneously authorized the use of gross profits from auto sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">A. <em>Statutory Regulation of \u201cCash Collateral\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1107-7\">Chapter 11 allows a debtor to formulate plans for rehabilitation without pressure from creditors. <em>LaJolla Mortgage Fund v. Rancho El Cajon, </em>18 B.R. 283, 286 (Bkrtcy.S.D.Cal.1982); <em>see </em>11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 362 (West 1979). However, it also protects the interests of creditors while the debtor attempts to become financially viable. One interest Chapter 11 protects is the creditor\u2019s interest in \u201ccash collateral\u201d held by the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-8\">The Bankruptcy Code defines \u201ccash collateral\u201d as the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1107-9\">Cash, negotiable instruments, documents of title, securities, deposit accounts, or other cash equivalents in which the estate and an entity other than the estate have an interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1107-10\">11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 363(a) (West 1979). A debt- or, attempting to reorganize a business under Chapter 11, clearly has a compelling need to use \u201ccash collateral\u201d in its effort to rebuild. Without the availability of cash to meet daily operating expenses such as rent, payroll, utilities, etc., the congressional policy favoring rehabilitation over economic failure would be frustrated. <em>See, generally </em>D. Cowans, <em>Bankruptcy Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 11.9(6) (interim ed. 1983); Dodd, \u201cObtaining Operating Capital in a Chapter 11 Reorganization Proceeding Under \u00a7 363(c) &amp; 364(d) of the Bankruptcy Code,\u201d <em>1983 Annual Survey of Bankruptcy Law </em>217.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-11\">Opposed to the debtor\u2019s need for use of cash collateral is the valid concern that free use of secured \u201cproperty\u201d may result in the dissipation of the estate. Because security interests are \u201cproperty rights\u201d protected by the Fifth Amendment from public taking without just compensation, <em>Wright v. Union Central Life Ins. Co., </em>311 U.S. 273, 61 S.Ct. 196, 85 L.Ed. 184 (1940), the Bankruptcy Court cannot allow the secured interest to be threatened by improper use of cash proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-15\">To resolve this tension between debtor and creditor, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 363(c)(2)(B) allows the court to authorize use of cash collateral only if the use accords with other provisions of \u00a7 363.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The principal restraint on use of cash proceeds is found in \u00a7 363(e), which specifies that the court shall condition the use of secured property \u201cas is necessary to provide adequate protection of such interest.\u201d Thus, when a creditor opposes a proposed use of cash collateral, the guiding inquiry is whether its security interests are \u201cadequately protected\u201d absent the additional protection that the cash collateral would provide. We now address that question with regard to the court order below, recognizing that the finding that there was adequate protection will not be overturned unless clearly erroneous. <em>Dooley v. Weil (Matter of Barbara Garfinkle), </em>672 F.2d 1340, 1344 (11th Cir.1982); <em>In re Jim Kelly Ford of Dundee, </em>14 B.R. 812, 816 (N.D.Ill. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-16\">B. <em>Was Chrysler\u2019s Security Interest Adequately Protected?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1107-17\">\u201cAdequate protection\u201d is not explicitly defined by the Bankruptcy Code. In determining whether a creditor\u2019s secured interests are so protected, there must be an individual determination of the <em>value </em>of that interest and whether a proposed use of cash collateral threatens that value. <em>Matter of Karl A. Neise, Inc., </em>16 B.R. 600, 601 (Bkrtcy.S.D.Fla.1981); H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, 95th Cong. 1st Sess. 339 (1977), U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, pp. 5787, 6295. (\u201cThough the creditor might not re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>ceive his bargain in kind, the purpose of the section is to insure that the secured creditor receives in value essentially what he bargained for.\u201d); 2 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>\u00a7 361.03 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">Chrysler had a security interest in \u201call of (Ruggiere\u2019s) Accounts Receivable, Contract Rights, Chattel Paper, Inventory, Equipment, and Fixtures, and <em>all proceeds </em>of any of the foregoing.\u201d (Emphasis added). <em>See </em>11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 552(b) (West 1979). The value of that interest for purposes of determining \u201cadequate protection\u201d is limited to the lesser of the amount of the secured claim or. the amount of the collateral. <em>LaJolla Mortg. Fund v. Rancho El Cajon, Inc., </em>18 B.R. 283, 286 (Bkrtcy.S.D.Cal.1982); 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 506(a) (West 1979). Because Chrysler\u2019s secured claim far exceeded the value of Ruggiere\u2019s collateral, the latter value governs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-5\">At the time Ruggiere filed the Chapter 11 proceeding,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the car inventory was the principal element of collateral. The value of that inventory for purposes of \u201cadequate protection\u201d was its wholesale value because that is the \u201camount which the creditor would receive by its customary or commercially reasonable means of disposition\u201d (i.e., sale to another automobile dealer). <em>In re Klein, </em>10 B.R. 657, 660 (Bkrtcy.E.D.N.Y.1980). <em>See also In re Thomas Parker Enterprises, Inc., </em>8 B.R. 207 (Bkrtcy.D. Conn.1981); <em>In re Adams, </em>2 B.R. 313 (Bkrtcy.M.D.Fla.1980). Thus, because the value entitled to adequate protection was the wholesale value, allowing Ruggiere to use only gross profits and requiring that it remit the wholesale value to Chrysler did not impair the creditor\u2019s secured interest. The district court order allowing use of those profits was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-6\">The decision of the Bankruptcy Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1106-13\">. 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 301, <em>et seq. </em>(West 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1106-14\">. The July 9 order specifically stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1106-15\">All prior restrictions on the use of the Debt- or\u2019s gross profits arising from the sale of vehicles are removed. Debtor shall be allowed to utilize, for the purpose of operating its business, the gross profit on the sale of vehicles which has been generated since the filing of the Debtor\u2019s Petition on June 15, 1982. In addition, Debtor shall be allowed to utilize in the operation of its business the gross profits that will be generated from the future sales of vehicles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1106-20\">While the August 17th final order contained other specifications about the manner in which interest would be computed on the automobiles financed by Chrysler and discussed insurance payments and access to the debtor\u2019s records, the issue argued by the parties is the authorization to use gross profits. We confine ourselves to that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1107-12\">. 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 363(c)(2)(B) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1107-13\">The trustee may not use, sell, or lease cash collateral ... unless</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1107-18\">(B) the court, after notice and a hearing, authorizes such use, sale, or lease in accordance with the provisions of this section.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1108-8\">.
