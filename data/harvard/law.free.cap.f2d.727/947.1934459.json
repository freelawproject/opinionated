Shaw brought this civil action against the appellees (current and former employees of the City of Colorado Springs, and the City of Colorado Springs) asserting violations of the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 241, 242 and 1503. Shaw also claimed the appellees committed the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress. Finally, Shaw sought attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-12\">On May 19, 1981, Shaw was employed by Appellee City of Colorado Springs as a street maintenance worker. On that date, Shaw was seriously injured after being run over by a city-owned dump truck while apparently lying in the street to \u201ceyeball\u201d a pothole. The dump truck, operated by Ap-pellee Neece, was not equipped with a backup warning beeper. Shaw subsequently brought suit against General Motors <em>(Ike Shaw, Jr. </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>Civil Action No. 82-F-256), seeking damages for his injuries sustained in the accident. In the <em>General Motors </em>case, the parties dispute (1) whether the truck rolled backwards accidentally or whether it was in reverse gear, and (2) the distance the truck traveled before it ran over Shaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-13\">Shaw alleges that, during his preparation for the <em>General Motors </em>case, the appellees \u201clied\u201d to him, failed to cooperate with him and attempted to suppress evidence. Shaw claims this conduct by the appellees impaired his constitutional right of access to the United States courts. The \u201clies\u201d referred to by Shaw concern a factual dispute between the parties regarding the accident in question. Shaw also contends that the appellees failed to cooperate adequately with his pretrial investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-14\">After the accident, Shaw\u2019s counsel employed a paralegal to investigate the facts. The paralegal conducted interviews and attempted to have the four individual appel-lees sign various statements she had prepared. The appellees refused to sign the statements under advice of the City Attorney. This lawsuit was instituted essentially because the appellees did not cooperate with the paralegal\u2019s investigation to Shaw\u2019s satisfaction. Shaw also argues that his access to the courts has been chilled because Ap-pellee City of Colorado Springs wrongfully attempted to destroy the dump truck involved in the accident, informed him that his worker\u2019s compensation benefits would be terminated within the year and that Appellee Barnes \u201cthreatened\u201d him by stating that if he filed suit against GM, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>would have to pay back all of his worker\u2019s compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">The appellees respond that the claims and allegations by Shaw are specious, frivolous and without foundation in fact or law. They urge that Shaw\u2019s allegations must be dismissed as a matter of law because they fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The district court agreed and dismissed the cause stating that \u201cthis controversy is an attempt to inflate an otherwise justifiable controversy beyond the bounds of law or reason in a frivolous and overzealous attempt to secure a claim against those who may be protected from personal injury suits by state law.\u201d [R., Vol. I at 70]. We agree and will, therefore, affirm both orders. Further, we hold that the appellees are entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">In any section 1983 action, two essential elements must be established initially: \u201c(1) whether the conduct complained of was committed by a person acting under color of state law; and (2) whether this conduct deprived a person of rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\u201d <em>Parratt </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 535, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 1912, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981). <em>See also Gomez v. Toledo, </em>446 U.S. 635, 638, 100 S.Ct. 1920, 1922, 64 L.Ed.2d 572 (1980). Although Shaw established the first element, he did not establish a violation of federal rights. Clearly, access to the courts of the United States is a guaranteed constitutional right. <em>Silver v. Cormier, </em>529 F.2d 161, 163 (10th Cir.1976). However, we agree with the district court that no merit exists in Shaw\u2019s claim of an impairment of access to the courts. Shaw was not impeded in any way in bringing the personal injury action against GM. The appellees were not obligated to sign the investigator-prepared statements, and the letter regarding the reimbursement and nonreceipt of worker\u2019s compensation benefits is a true statement of municipal policy and state law \u2014 worker\u2019s compensation benefits are paid only for a one-year period after an accident and if Shaw\u2019s suit against GM were successful, he would have to reimburse the state for the original benefits he received. Further, Shaw\u2019s allegation that the appellees \u201clied\u201d is totally without merit under section 1983; the parties merely dispute a fact in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-8\">We further hold that the claim against Appellee City of Colorado Springs was properly dismissed because the alleged conduct by the individual appellees is not part of an established city policy or custom. <em>See Monell v. New York City Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2037, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978) (court held that there is no <em>respondeat superior </em>liability under section 1983 in the municipality-employee context). Further, punitive damages may not be imposed against a municipality under section 1983. <em>See City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., </em>453 U.S. 247, 271, 101 S.Ct. 2748, 2762, 69 L.Ed.2d 616 (1981). Finally, Shaw\u2019s claims under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 241, 242 and 1503 were properly dismissed because a plaintiff cannot recover civil damages for an alleged violation of a criminal statute. <em>See Fiorino v. Turner, </em>476 F.Supp. 962, 963 (D.Mass.1979); <em>United States ex rel. Savage v. Arnold, </em>403 F.Supp. 172, 173 n. 1 (E.D.Pa.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-9\">Our final concern is whether attorney\u2019s fees were properly awarded pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. <em>See Maine v. Thiboutot, </em>448 U.S. 1, 9, 100 S.Ct. 2502, 2506, 65 L.Ed.2d 555 (1980) (section 1988 allows attorney\u2019s fees for actions brought under section 1983). A district court has discretion to award a defendant attorney\u2019s fees if the plaintiff\u2019s action is determined to be \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.\u201d <em>Prochaska v. Marcoux, </em>632 F.2d 848, 853-54 (10th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 984, 101 S.Ct. 2316, 68 L.Ed.2d 841 (1981) [citing <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978)]. Because we agree that this is an unreasonable, frivolous action brought under section 1983, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion by awarding the appellees attorney\u2019s fees. Further, the amount of attorney\u2019s fees awarded to the appellees by the district court was reasonable; thus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See generally Gurule v. Wilson, </em>635 F.2d 782, 792-94 (10th Cir.1980); <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., </em>488 F.2d 714, 717-20 (5th Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">Finally, we hold that the appellees are entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees for services rendered on this appeal. <em>See Gurule v. Wilson, supra </em>at 792 [citing <em>Love v. Mayor of Cheyenne, </em>620 F.2d 235, 237 (10th Cir.1980)]. We, therefore, remand the cause to the district court to set an appropriate fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">AFFIRMED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
