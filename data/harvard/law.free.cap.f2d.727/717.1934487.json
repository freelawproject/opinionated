GIBSON, Senior Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">The Veterans Administration (VA) appeals the district court\u2019s <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> award to plaintiff, Dr. Bhartur N. Premaehandra, of $15,630.67 in attorneys\u2019 fees and $1,848.49 in expenses under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 (Equal Access to Justice Act) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (Civil Rights Attorneys\u2019 Award Act). The VA contends the plaintiff was not eligible for attorneys\u2019 fees because: (1) plaintiff was not a \u201cprevailing party\u201d; (2) plaintiff\u2019s suit was not brought pursuant to any civil rights provision enumerated in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988; and (3) sovereign immunity bars awards of fees for attorney time expended before the October 1,1981 effective date of the EAJA. We reject these contentions and affirm the award of attorneys\u2019 fees, but reduce the amount of the fee to $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">Plaintiff is a research endocrinologist employed by the VA for the past eighteen years. On December 30,1980, the VA notified plaintiff of his termination effective January 16, 1981, and also directed him to end his experiments and dismantle his laboratory by that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-12\">Plaintiff\u2019s response was two-fold. First, he appealed his termination to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). Second and most relevant to this appeal, he filed suit in federal district court seeking an order enjoining the VA from terminating him and from requiring him to dismantle his laboratory, until he received a due process hearing before the MSPB. Plaintiff claimed that he was entitled to a pretermin-ation hearing under the 5th Amendment to prevent possible irreparable harm to his laboratory research and experiments.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-15\">The district court, 548 F.Supp. 117, initially granted plaintiff a temporary restraining order, but then later denied him a preliminary injunction. The court found that plaintiff may be irreparably injured by the dismantling of the laboratory, but nevertheless concluded that this potential hardship was outweighed by plaintiff\u2019s slight chance of success on the merits. Relying principally on <em>Arnett v. Kennedy, </em>416 U.S. 134, 94 S.Ct. 1633, 40 L.Ed.2d 15 (1974), the court rejected plaintiff\u2019s contention that the continuation of his laboratory research entitled him to a pretermination/predismantling due process hearing under the 5th Amendment. <em>See Premachandra v. Mitts, </em>509 F.Supp. 424, 428-30 (E.D.Mo.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-16\">The district court also denied plaintiff\u2019s application for an injunction pending appeal, as did the Eighth Circuit and the Supreme Court. Plaintiff later submitted a second motion for injunction pending appeal to the Eighth Circuit, this time seeking an order prohibiting the VA from dismantling his laboratory or disrupting his experiments, but permitting the VA to terminate his employment prior to the due process hearing before the MSPB.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-17\">In response to this second motion, and to the VA\u2019s expressed willingness not to disrupt the plaintiff\u2019s laboratory pending appeal, the Eighth Circuit entered an order to stay the VA\u2019s dismantling of plaintiff\u2019s laboratory pending oral argument before the Eighth Circuit. This stay did not extend to plaintiff\u2019s employment and so the VA subsequently terminated plaintiff\u2019s salary but permitted him to continue working in the laboratory.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>Oral argument on plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his request for preliminary injunction was held before the Eighth Circuit on June 15, 1981. However, the Eighth Circuit never ruled on the merits of this appeal because, in a letter to the court, dated July 2, 1981, the VA agreed \u201cnot to dismantle or interfere with [plaintiff\u2019s] use of the laboratory before the decision on the merits of [his] discharge is filed by the [MSPB] Hearing Examiner.\u201d This agreement permitted plaintiff to remain in the laboratory until the MSPB ruled on the validity of his discharge. On October 26, 1981, the Board issued a final decision reversing the VA\u2019s termination of plaintiff. As a result, the Eighth Circuit dismissed as moot plaintiff\u2019s appeal of the denial of his motion for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Following these decisions by the Eighth Circuit and the Board, the plaintiff sought and obtained attorneys\u2019 fees in connection with the discharge proceedings before the Board.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff also asked the district court to award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees he incurred in the preliminary injunction litigation, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(b). In awarding attorneys\u2019 fees of $15,630.67, the district court interpreted \u00a7 2412(b) in conjunction with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 to make federal defendants, like the VA, liable to a prevailing party for attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in a suit for the vindication of civil rights. The court then, applying the <em>Nadeau</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>two-part test, concluded that plaintiff was a \u201cprevailing party\u201d in this litigation because: 1) his lawsuit served as a \u201ccatalyst\u201d to the VA\u2019s agreement not to disrupt plaintiff\u2019s laboratory pending disposition of his case before the Agency; 2) his lawsuit was reasonable, as evidenced by plaintiff\u2019s eventual success before the MSPB. In calculating the award, the court reduced by one-third the number of compensable hours to reflect the fact that plaintiff was unsuccessful in attempting to enjoin the VA from terminating his employment prior to his hearing before the Board. The court therefore awarded attorneys\u2019 fees of $15,630.67 and expenses of $1,848.49 for a total of $17,-431.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">II. Prevailing Party</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">The threshold issue in this case is whether the district court erred in finding that plaintiff was a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under \u00a7 2412 (EAJA) and therefore entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees. Although the EAJA does not define the term \u201cprevailing party\u201d, the legislative history clearly indicates that the term is to be read consistently with its use in other fee shifting statutes. <em>See </em>H.R. Rep. No. 96-1418, 96th Cong., 2nd Sess. 11 (1980), <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4984, 4990.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Recently, the Supreme Court stated that \u201cplaintiffs may be considered \u2018prevailing parties\u2019 for attorneys\u2019 fees purposes if they succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit\u201d. <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>-- U.S. --, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1939, 76 L.Ed.2d 40, 50 (1983), <em>quoting, Nadeau, </em>581 F.2d at 278-79. \u201cPrevailing party\u201d, however, is not limited to a \u201cvictor\u201d only after entry of final judgment following a full trial on the merits; a party may be considered to have prevailed through a favorable settlement of a case or consent agreement, even if he does not ultimately prevail on all issues.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number><em>ex rel. Heydt v. Citizens State Bank, </em>668 F.2d 444, 447 (8th Cir.1982); <em>United States v. 329.73 Acres, Grenada and Yalobusha, </em>704 F.2d 800, 808-09 (5th Cir.1983) (en banc); <em>Doe v. Busbee, </em>684 F.2d 1375, 1379 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">While the parties agree on the law generally, they disagree on the proper standard for determining \u201cprevailing party\u201d where, as here, the defendant\u2019s voluntary compliance with plaintiff\u2019s requested relief moots the lawsuit. The VA contends the appropriate standard is the two-part test announced in <em>Nadeau v. Helgemoe, </em>581 F.2d 281, and applied by the district court. The first step under <em>Nadeau </em>requires a court to determine, as a factual matter, whether the plaintiff\u2019s suit served as a catalyst \u2014 i.e., \u201ca necessary and important factor\u201d \u2014 in achieving the relief desired. This first step presents no dispute here; both parties agree on the necessity of a \u201ccatalyst\u201d inquiry and the VA does not contest the district court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit served as a catalyst<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in bringing about plaintiff\u2019s desired relief \u2014 i.e., maintenance of his laboratory pending the Board\u2019s disposition of the underlying appeal. Assuming plaintiff\u2019s suit was a catalyst, the second part of <em>Nadeau </em>requires a court to make the legal determination whether plaintiff\u2019s suit was so \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable, or groundless\u201d that the defendant\u2019s voluntary compliance with plaintiff\u2019s desired relief may be considered \u201cgratuitous.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">As noted by the district court and the VA, the Eighth Circuit adopted both parts of Nadeau\u2019s two-part test in <em>United Handicapped Federation v. Andre, </em>622 F.2d 342, 346-347 (8th Cir.1980), a case which, like <em>Nadeau, </em>involved relief through a settlement agreement. The plaintiff nevertheless contends that the second part of <em>Na-deau </em>\u2014 asking whether plaintiff\u2019s suit was \u201creasonable\u201d \u2014 is inapplicable in cases of voluntary compliance. In support, plaintiff relies on <em>Parham v. Southwestern Bell Telephone, </em>433 F.2d 421, 429-30 (8th Cir.1970) and <em>Williams v. Miller, </em>620 F.2d 199, 202 (8th Cir.1980) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">We are compelled to apply the \u201creasonableness\u201d prong of <em>Nadeau, </em>as the court did in <em>United Handicapped. </em>First, the <em>Parham </em>court\u2019s failure expressly to apply the \u201creasonableness\u201d prong of <em>Nadeau </em>was understandable since <em>Parham </em>preceded <em>Nadeau </em>by eight years. Reading <em>Parham, </em>however, it is difficult to conceive that the court regarded plaintiff\u2019s suit in that case as being anything but reasonable. <em>See Parham, </em>433 F.2d at 429-30. Second, in <em>United Handicapped, </em>622 F.2d at 346-7, the court cited <em>Parham </em>in applying <em>Nadeau's </em>two-part test, apparently recognizing that <em>Na-deau </em>augmented, rather than contradicted <em>Parham. </em>Third, although the <em>William's </em>court made only a \u201ccatalyst\u201d determination, it gave no reason for dispensing with the \u201creasonableness\u201d prong of <em>Nadeau </em>in cases where voluntary compliance, rather than a settlement, achieved the desired relief. In all probability, the <em>William's </em>court decided not to discuss the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit in order to avoid belaboring the obvious \u2014 since plaintiff\u2019s suit was clearly reasonable \u2014 rather than to establish, <em>sub silentio, </em>a nice legal distinction between a settlement agreement and voluntary compliance. Fourth, <em>United Handicapped </em>itself recognized that <em>Nadeau\u2019s </em>two-part test applied to cases where a litigant obtains relief through either a settlement agreement or the voluntary action by the defendant. <em>United Handicapped, </em>622 F.2d 346 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">Plaintiff does not offer and we cannot discern any reason why we should apply a different prevailing party test where relief is obtained through voluntary compliance rather than a settlement agreement. In both situations, the \u201creasonableness\u201d inquiry is dictated by the same congressional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>purposes underlying the EAJA \u2014 i.e., vindicating a plaintiffs legal rights and deterring the government\u2019s unreasonable conduct. See H.R.Rep. No. 96-1418, at 1,5,10; 1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, 4984, 4989; <em>see also Spencer v. NLRB, </em>712 F.2d 539, 550 (D.C.Cir.1983). If plaintiff\u2019s legal claims were truly \u201cfrivolous, groundless, and unreasonable,\u201d then, regardless of the form the relief took, awarding attorneys\u2019 fees would serve neither to vindicate the plaintiff\u2019s legal rights nor to deter unreasonable government conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">This leads us to consider whether plaintiff\u2019s suit was unreasonable as a matter of law. Plaintiff\u2019s suit for a pretermination/pre-dismantling hearing was brought directly under the due process clause of the 5th Amendment to the United States Constitution. For purposes of our inquiry, we focus only on the aspect of the plaintiff\u2019s suit on which he was granted relief: i.e., the claim for a due process hearing prior to the dismantling of his laboratory. The district court concluded that the suit was reasonable, pointing to the plaintiff\u2019s eventual success before the Board. The VA contends the suits\u2019 unreasonableness was established by the district court\u2019s rejection of plaintiff\u2019s claim for a pre-dismantling hearing and by the Eighth Circuit\u2019s subsequent rejection of his injunction pending appeal. The VA\u2019s agreement not to dismantle was purportedly nothing more than a \u201cgratuitous litigating courtesy,\u201d and should not be interpreted as a recognition or concession that plaintiff's suit had any legal merit. The VA also points out that plaintiff\u2019s success before the Board was irrelevant to the merits of his claim for pretermination dismantling hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">We do not believe plaintiff\u2019s suit may be regarded as so \u201cfrivolous, groundless, and unreasonable\u201d that the VA\u2019s voluntary compliance may be regarded as \u201cgratuitous.\u201d <em>See United Handicapped, </em>622 F.2d at 347. First, though the district court denied preliminary relief, it apparently did so without the benefit of full briefing on the legal merits of plaintiff\u2019s due process claim. After having been fully briefed on the legal basis for the claim, however, the district court viewed the issue as being sufficiently close that plaintiff\u2019s claim could not be characterized as unreasonable. Without delving too deeply into an issue that has been mooted by the VA\u2019s voluntary compliance, we are unprepared to say that plaintiff\u2019s claim to a hearing prior to the dismantling of the laboratory was clearly devoid of merit under traditional constitutional theory. In <em>Arnett v. Kennedy, </em>416 U.S. 134, 94 S.Ct. 1633, 40 L.Ed.2d 15 (1974), six justices recognized that a civil service employee\u2019s right to a pretermination hearing was determined not by an absolute rule but by balancing the competing interests of the employee and the government employer. <em>Id. </em>at 167-68, 94 S.Ct. at 1650-51 (Powell, J. joined by Blackmun, J. concurring in part), 188, 94 S.Ct. 1661 (White, J. concurring in part and dissenting in part), 217-18, 94 S.Ct. 1675-76 (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan, J. and Douglas, J., dissenting). The balancing approach was more fully embraced and embellished in <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 334-35, 96 S.Ct. 893, 902-03, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976), where the court approved the Social Security Administration\u2019s practice of conducting hearings on the termination of disability benefits after termination. Later in <em>Brown v. Bathke, </em>566 F.2d 588, 592 (8th Cir.1977) the Eighth Circuit, citing <em>Mathews, </em>stated that under some circumstances, a government employee\u2019s post-termination hearing may not satisfy due process. <em>See also Hathaway v. Mathews, </em>546 F.2d 227, 230 (7th Cir.1976) (postdeprivation hearing may not satisfy due process). We cannot find and the VA has not pointed to any controlling precedent saying that a civil service employee is never entitled to a predeprivation hearing, regardless of the circumstances. Hence, plaintiff\u2019s right to a predismantling hearing is determined by balancing the competing interests of the plaintiff and the VA.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">Applying a balancing approach, plaintiff\u2019s interest in preventing the irretrievable destruction of his scientific laboratory arguably may be more weighty than the interest of the discharged employee in <em>Arnett; </em>and, the VA\u2019s interest in dismantling the labora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>tory prior to a hearing may be less weighty than the government'employer\u2019s interests in <em>Arnett. </em>Without expressing an opinion one way or the other on the proper resolution of this issue, we merely conclude that plaintiff\u2019s claim was not so frivolous that the VA\u2019s voluntary compliance may be presumed to be gratuitous.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">The VA\u2019s suggestion that its voluntary compliance was merely a \u201cgratuitous litigating courtesy\u201d borders on self-serving hindsight which could be urged in every case mooted by the government voluntary compliance. The VA however relies on <em>Nadeau\u2019s </em>statement that \u201cif it has been judicially determined that defendant\u2019s conduct ... is not required by law, then defendants must be held to have acted gratuitously\u201d. 581 F.2d at 281. We are unwilling to interpret the district court\u2019s denial of preliminary injunctive relief and the Eighth Circuit\u2019s and Supreme Court\u2019s denials of an injunction pending appeal as a final judicial determination on the merits of plaintiff\u2019s due process claim. Indeed, the merit of that claim was still to be determined by the Eighth Circuit, until it was mooted by the VA\u2019s own voluntary compliance with plaintiff\u2019s requested relief. <em>See James River Flood Control Ass\u2019n v. Watt, </em>680 F.2d 543, 545 (8th Cir.1982). Further, in determining, as a legal matter, the reasonableness of plaintiff\u2019s suit, neither the district court nor this court should be bound by a district court\u2019s preliminary assessment as to the plaintiff\u2019s probability of success on the merits. <em>Cf., Fernandes v. Limmer, </em>663 F.2d 619, 637 (5th Cir.1981) (district court\u2019s denial of plaintiff\u2019s preliminary relief did not render erroneous the court conclusion that plaintiff ultimately prevailed.) A contrary position would permit the government to parlay a favorable preliminary finding, however ephemeral or erroneous, into a final legal victory on the merits by simply acceding to the plaintiff\u2019s desired relief pri- or to a final determination on the merits. Paradoxically, this would mean that a party, like plaintiff, who has prevailed in a practical sense would be denied attorneys\u2019 fees simply because the government has, by virtue of its voluntary compliance, effectively precluded a final judicial determination on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">We are also unpersuaded by the VA\u2019s contention that the fear of a fee award might force it \u201cto harden its litigating position in the future\u201d and \u201cnever to voluntarily agree to defer legal action as a litigating courtesy.\u201d We sympathize with the VA\u2019s well founded interest in quickly and efficiently disposing of claims through voluntary compliance or settlement. Indeed, our own interest in judicial economy aligns with this interest. However, the VA\u2019s expressed fear is unfounded because it assumes the existence of a significant risk that courts, in passing on attorneys\u2019 fees claims in voluntary compliance or settlement cases, will be unable to distinguish between frivolous and reasonable claims; for only the latter warrants an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. Second, as the <em>Nadeau </em>court so appropriately responded to virtually the identical argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW_\">\u201cThe argument cuts both ways. If defendants may refuse to settle a case and accept the cost of continued litigation to avoid paying attorneys\u2019 fees, it is equally likely that plaintiff\u2019s counsel, rather than receive no compensation at all for their efforts, would be willing to continue the litigation on the chance that they might cut if not eliminate their losses. We cannot decide this issue based on such honest but speculative concerns.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">III. Eligibility for relief under EAJA</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">Plaintiff seeks attorneys\u2019 fees under two separate provisions of the EAJA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412. First, \u00a7 2412(b), the \u201cdiscretionary\u201d subsection, provides that a court \u201cmay award\u201d fees to private prevailing parties in civil actions against the United States and declares that \u201c[t]he United States shall be liable for such fees to the same extent that any other party would be liable under the common law or under the terms of any statute which specifically provides for such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>an award.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Second, \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A), the more sweeping \u201cmandatory\u201d subsection, provides that a court shall award fees to private prevailing parties unless \u201cthe court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ADK\">The district court awarded attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 2412(b), without passing on whether fees could have been awarded under \u00a7 2412(d). In doing so, the district court read \u00a7 2412(b) in conjunction with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (Civil Right Attorneys\u2019 Fee Awards Act of 1976). Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a court is authorized to award attorneys\u2019 fees against litigants other than the United States where the plaintiff has sued \u201cto enforce a provision of\u201d the enumerated civil rights statutes including 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Section 1983<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in turn, provides a statutory right of action against \u201cany person who, acting under color of state law, violates the constitutional rights of another\u201d. Hence, \u00a7 1988 authorizes fee awards in actions against state officials involving deprivation of constitutional rights under color of state law. Plaintiff\u2019s claim alleged a constitutional violation by federal officials acting under color of federal law. While plaintiff\u2019s claim would not give rise to a fee award under \u00a7 1988 since it lacked the state action component of \u00a7 1983, it was nearly identical to a \u00a7 1983 action, the only difference being the alleged constitutional deprivation was under color of federal law, not state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">The district court essentially adopted the view that \u00a7 2412(b) had the effect of making the United States liable for attorneys\u2019 fees to a party who prevails against it in a suit seeking to vindicate constitutional rights \u2014 in this case, plaintiff\u2019s 5th Amendment procedural due process rights \u2014 on the grounds that a state or its official would ordinarily be liable, under \u00a7 1988, in an analogous suit brought under \u00a7 1983. Thus, \u00a7 2412(b)\u2019s language making the United States liable for attorneys\u2019 fees \u201cto the same extent that any other party would be liable\u201d was interpreted to make the United States liable when it engages in activity that, if carried on by any \u201cother party\u201d \u2014 e.g., a state official, acting under color of state law \u2014 would result in assessment of attorneys\u2019 fees against that party under \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">The plaintiff suggests that the district court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 2412(b) is consistent with the EAJA\u2019s remedial purpose of putting the United States on \u201ccomplete equal footing\u201d with states who violate con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>stitutional rights. Just as state officials are liable for fees under \u00a7 1988 in a \u00a7 1983 action alleging a constitutional violation under color of state law, so too then the United States is liable, pursuant to \u00a7 2412(b), in a suit alleging an analogous constitutional violation under color of federal law. While conceding that the statutory language is ambiguous on this point, plaintiff urges that the legislative history supports this broad interpretation of the language making the United States liable for fees \u201cto the same extent that any other party\u201d would be liable. <em>See Lauritzen v. Sec. of the Navy, </em>546 F.Supp. 1221, 1227-29 (C.D.Ca.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The VA on the other hand avers that \u00a7 2412(b) is a limited waiver of sovereign immunity and must be strictly construed. It contends that \u00a7 2412(b), strictly construed, does.not make the United States automatically liable for fees in suits alleging constitutional violations by federal officials acting under federal law. Rather, it authorizes fees only \u201cto the same extent that\u201d another fee shifting statute \u2014 in this case \u00a7 1988 \u2014 would make \u201cany other party\u201d liable for fees. However, \u00a7 1988 would not authorize a fee against \u201cany other party\u201d because there has been no violation of a statute encompassed by \u00a7 1988 \u2014 specifically, \u00a7 1983. While plaintiffs claim is analogous to a \u00a7 1983 suit, it nevertheless could not have invoked the provisions of \u00a7 1983 because the alleged deprivation was under color of federal, not state law. Thus, because no \u201cother party would be liable\u201d for fees under \u00a7 1988, the United States is non-liable \u201cto the same extent\u201d. <em>See United States v. Miscellaneous Pornographic Magazines, </em>541 F.Supp. 122, 125, 127-28 (N.D.Ill.1982). The United States additionally urges that to hold the United States automatically liable for fees in constitutional suits would mean the United States would be liable for fees regardless of whether its position was \u201csubstantially justified,\u201d thus effectively swallowing up the provisions of \u00a7 2412(d). <em>Id. </em>Arguably, this would run afoul of Congress\u2019 desire that the EAJA not impair the government\u2019s ability to enforce and administer the federal laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">Candor compels us to admit that both parties\u2019 interpretations and supporting arguments are persuasive. The problem we face is deciding which one of the two interpretations is more consistent with Congress\u2019 intent. The judiciary has not settled on one or the other. To date, no other Circuit has determined whether \u00a7 2412(b) was intended to authorize fee awards against the United States when it loses a federal civil rights suit. Those four district courts facing this issue have come to different conclusions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We are thus called upon to make our own inquiry on this very close statutory construction matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">We first turn to the relevant statutory language itself. <em>See Universities Research Ass\u2019n v. Coutu, </em>450 U.S. 754, 771, 101 S.Ct. 1451, 1461, 67 L.Ed.2d 662 (1981). Section 2412(b) provides that in civil actions against the United States or federal officers, <em>\u201c[t]he United States shall be liable for such fees and expenses to the same extent that any other party would be liable </em>under the common law or under the terms of any statute which specifically provides for such an award.\u201d Thus, the disputed limiting lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>guage, which is highlighted, applies <em>pari passu </em>to both the \u201ccommon law\u201d and \u201cstatutory\u201d fee shifting provisions. We can therefore glean Congress\u2019 intent with respect to the statutory exceptions by considering Congress\u2019 unambiguous intent with respect to the \u201ccommon law\u201d exceptions. <em>See Northcross, </em>412 U.S. 427, 93 S.Ct. 2201, 37 L.Ed.2d 48 (similar attorneys\u2019 fee authorizing provisions should be interpreted <em>pari passu.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">The federal judiciary has recognized several exceptions to the American Rule on attorney fees and has held that a successful litigant may recover fees against a losing litigant who \u201chas acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reason;\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> also a successful litigant who, by virtue of winning his suit, has conferred a \u201ccommon benefit\u201d on a group of persons may recover fees from the beneficiaries.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See Spencer v. NLRB, </em>712 F.2d 539, 543 (D.C.Cir.1983). One important effect of \u00a7 2412(b) was to codify and make applicable to the United States the \u201cbad faith\u201d and \u201ccommon benefit\u201d exceptions to the American Rule. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1418 at 9, 17 (1980); <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4987, 4996; <em>see also Spencer, </em>712 F.2d at 545 (D.C.Cir.1983).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> No one has suggested that the language making the United States liable for fees \u201cto the same extent as any other party would be liable under the common law\u201d should be interpreted to authorize fees against the United States only in a suit where the prevailing party could have invoked a common law exception to recover fees against some party other than the United States. For example, if, in a civil suit, the federal government has acted \u201cin bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly or for oppressive reason,\u201d it would seem anomalous to immunize it from paying attorneys\u2019 fees simply because the prevailing party could not have recovered, in the same suit, fees against some \u201cother party\u201d for similar bad faith. That Congress had no intention of sanctioning this anomalous result was made clear by the House Report No. 96-1418, accompanying the final version of the EAJA, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-9\">The EAJA amends 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 to permit a court in its discretion to award attorney fees and other expenses to prevailing parties in civil litigation <em>to the same extent it may award fees in cases involving other parties. </em>Thus, the United States would be liable for fees under the \u201cbad faith\u201d, \u201ccommon fund\u201d and \u201ccommon benefit\u201d exception to the American Rule. There appears to be no justification for exempting the United States in this situation; [].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">H.R.Rep. No. 1418 at 9; 1980 U.S.Cong. Code &amp; Ad.News at 4987. (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">What this tells us is that the United States\u2019 liability for fees in civil actions should be subject to the <em>same </em>common law standards applicable to any other party. For instance, the United States would be liable for fees if it acted in bad faith \u201cto the same extent\u201d that any other party who acted in similar bad faith would have been liable for fees. In short, similar conduct warrants similar fee shifting treatment, regardless of whether the similar conduct was committed in the same suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">It would seem only reasonable and logical to interpret the statutory fee shifting exception similarly. Thus, if the United States was engaged in conduct that, if carried on by some \u201cother party\u201d, would render that \u201cother party\u201d liable under a statutory fee shifting provision, then the United States should be liable \u201cto the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>extent\u201d. Like the \u201ccommon law\u201d provision, the statutory provision would be read to place the United States on completely equal footing with any \u201cother party\u201d; similar conduct would warrant similar fee shifting treatment. This interpretation would of course render the United States liable for fees in suits involving constitutional violations by federal officials, acting under federal law, because a state (an \u201cother party\u201d) would be liable for fees under \u00a7 1988 if state officials, acting under color of state law, committed a similar constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">Thus, although the language of \u00a7 2412(b) is relatively opaque, it neither precludes nor renders implausible an interpretation that would authorize fees in a case like the instant one. Nor does the language, even strictly construed, necessarily support the VA\u2019s proffered interpretation limiting the United States liability for fees to those suits in which a statutory exception (e.g., \u00a7 1988) would in fact apply to some \u201cother party\u201d (e.g., the state); indeed, as discussed above, such an interpretation would be fundamentally inconsistent with the way identical language is interpreted in the context of the \u201ccommon law\u201d exception. Saying this, however, we are not unmindful of the suggestion that if Congress really wanted to make the United States liable for fees in constitutional deprivation actions, it could have done so more clearly and precisely, perhaps by simply amending \u00a7 1988 of the Civil Rights Act. Conceivably, however, Congress thought clarity would be served by simply consolidating all fee shifting exceptions \u2014 both common law and statutory exceptions \u2014 applicable to \u201cother parties\u201d into one provision, making all of these exceptions applicable to the United States \u201cto the same extent\u201d. In any event, Congress\u2019 lack of precision in drafting legislation should never be an instrument for defeating or frustrating the manifest purpose and intent of Congress, as revealed by the legislative history. Where, as here, a remedial statutory provision is relatively opaque and susceptible to more than one interpretation, a court may discern congressional intent by resorting to the legislative history and purpose. As stated in <em>Lambur v. Yates, </em>148 F.2d 137, 139 (8th Cir.1945):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-7\">All statutes must be given sensible construction. The sole object of construction is to determine the legislative intent. Such intent must be found primarily in the language of the statute itself; but when the language is ambiguous or the meaning is doubtful, the court should consider the purpose, the subject matter and the condition of affairs which led to its enactment, and so construe it as to effectuate and not destroy the spirit and force of the law and not to render it absurd.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">Cf., <em>Ashley Drew and Northern Ry. v. United Transp. Union, </em>625 F.2d 1357, 1365 (8th Cir.1980) (\u201cit is impermissible to follow a literal reading that engenders absurd consequences where there is an alternative interpretation that reasonably effects the statute\u2019s purpose\u201d); <em>see also Stribling v. United States, </em>419 F.2d 1350, 1352 (8th Cir.1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">A close evaluation of the legislative history and purpose of \u00a7 2412(b) convinces us that Congress, in making the United States liable for attorneys\u2019 fees \u201cto the same extent as any other party would be liable ... under the terms of any statute providing for such fees,\u201d intended to authorize fee awards in suits, like the one here, where federal government officials have violated plaintiff\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights, since state officials would be liable for fees under \u00a7 1988 for analogous violations of plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">First, as stated in the relevant Report of the House Committee on the Judiciary (H.R.Rep. No. 1418 at 5-6, 9, 10; 1980 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4984, 4987) the EAJA was intended to ensure that individuals and small businesses \u201cwould not be deterred from seeking review of, or defending against unreasonable governmental action because of the expense involved in securing the vindication of their rights\u201d. <em>See also Berman v. Schweiker, </em>713 F.2d 1290, 1295-96, (7th Cir.1983). Pursuant to that purpose, \u00a7 2412(b) was designed \u201c[to establish] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>a general statutory exception for an award of fees against the Government\u201d and \u201c[to place] the federal government and civil litigants [both private parties and states] on a completely equal footing\u201d with respect to attorneys\u2019 fees. House Report at 8, 9; 1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 4987. These objectives could be best served by making the United States liable for fees in suits against federal officials for vindication of constitutional right, \u201cto the same extent that\u201d states (the \u201cother party\u201d) are liable for fees in analogous \u00a7 1983 suits involving state officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Second, the legislative history reveals that Senate Bill 265, which was to become the EAJA, was specifically amended to assure the United States would be liable for attorneys\u2019 fees in suits of the type involved here. Senate Bill 265, as originally proposed in 1979, provided in \u00a7 2412(b) that the United States shall be liable to the same extent as \u201ca private party\u201d (rather than any other party) would be liable. <em>See Award of Attorneys\u2019 Fees Against The Federal Government: Hearing on S.B. 265 Before the Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties, and the Administration of Justice of the House Judiciary Committee, </em>96th Cong. 2d Sess. at 1, 3, 9 (setting forth S.B. 265 as of August 1979).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, after hearings on S.B. 265 before the House Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties and the Administration of Justice, the subcommittee changed the language of \u00a7 2412(b) so that the final version made the United States liable to the same extent as \u201cany other party\u201d, rather than \u201ca private party\u201d, would be liable. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 96-1418 at 1, 4, 7; 1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4985-86. Obviously, the subcommittee was persuaded by the testimony of Armend Derfner of the Lawyer\u2019s Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. <em>Id. </em>at 7; 1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4985-86. Mr. Derfner told the subcommittee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-8\">Mr. Kastenmeier, if I could just direct myself to one portion of this bill?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-9\">There is an area in which' a slight drafting modification could carry out what I believe might be the intention of the committee; and that is to put the United States completely on a par as far as the enforcement of important constitutional and statutory rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-10\">In the Civil Rights Act of 1976 you provided that when someone, whether it be an individual or business, or whatever, sues a State or local government under 42 United States Code, section 1983, to vindicate a constitutional or Federal statutory right, that fees would be available under the <em>Newman v. Peggy [Piggie] [sic] Park </em>standard. These bills say that the United States should pay fees-in the amendment to 28 United States Code 2412-in those circumstances where the court may award such fees in suits involving private parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-11\">That doesn\u2019t say State or local government, but if the language were amended to read, \u201cin those circumstances where the court may award such fees in suits involving other litigants\u201d; it would achieve that purpose. And I think it would go even further toward putting the United States on a par with other governmental bodies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-12\">Hearings on S.B. 265 at 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-13\">The import of Mr. Derfner\u2019s remarks seems pretty clear: by extending the United States\u2019 liability for attorneys\u2019 fees to that of \u201cany other party\u201d, Congress would make the federal government liable for at-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>tomeys\u2019 fees in suits seeking to vindicate federal constitutional rights, just as states are liable under \u00a7 1988 for fees in analogous suits against state officials brought under \u00a7 1983. In accordance with Mr. Derfner\u2019s suggestion, the subcommittee amended S.B. 265 to read \u201cany other party\u201d in the immediately succeeding draft, which became the final version of the EAJA. H.R.Rep. No. 96-1418 at 1, 4, 7. We believe this sequence of events demonstrates Congress\u2019 intent to extend \u00a7 2412(b) to make the United States liable for fees in suits, like the instant one, where federal officials engage in activity that, if carried on by 'a state official, would render a state liable for attorneys\u2019 fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">Finally, the drafters of the bill were well aware of the potential applicability of \u00a7 2412(b) to \u00a7 1988. House Report No. 96-1418 provides that the Act \u201creflects a strong movement ... toward placing the federal government and civil litigants on a completely equal footing\u201d and that \u201c[2412(b) ] clarifies the liability of the United States under such statutes as the Civil Rights Attorneys\u2019 Fees Awards Act of 1976 [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988].\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1418 at 9, 17; 1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 4987, 4996.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">We do not regard our interpretation here as violative of the rule requiring waivers of sovereign immunity to be strictly construed. <em>Compare Monark Boat Co. v. NLRB, </em>708 F.2d 1322 (8th Cir.1983). Unlike in <em>Monark Boat, </em>the case upon which the VA principally relies, the legislative history and purpose behind the language we interpret here clearly supports a finding that the Congress waived the government\u2019s sovereign immunity for cases like this one. Perhaps Congress could have drafted \u00a7 2412(b) with more precision and clarity. Even conceding th\u00e9 language lacks clarity, however, we fail to see how this supports the VA\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 2412(b) making the United States liable for fees only in those rare constitutional suits in which federal officials have acted in concert with a state actor.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Such an interpretation of the language making the United States liable <em>\u201cto the same extent that any other party would be liable\u201d </em>encounters three obstacles which, when considered together, are insurmountable. First, it would conflict with the clearly established meaning of that language when used in reference to the \u201ccommon law\u201d exceptions of \u00a7 2412(b). As mentioned above, it would be anomalous to insulate the United States from fee awards where federal officials pursue litigation in \u201cbad faith\u201d simply because no \u201cother party\u201d in the litigation is guilty of similar acts of \u201cbad faith\u201d. Second, the VA\u2019s interpretation is without support in the EAJA\u2019s legislative history and, in fact, actually conflicts with its legislative history. Third, it would frustrate the Congressional purpose behind \u00a7 2412(b) of putting the United States and other civil litigants, whether private parties or states, on completely equal footing under existing fee shifting statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">The VA however points out that the failure to retain the state action requirement of \u00a7 1983 for purposes of \u00a7 2412(b) fee awards would mean that the United States would be liable for fees regardless of whether its position was \u201csubstantially justified\u201d under \u00a7 2412(d).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The VA fears that \u00a7 2412(b), read without a state action requirement, would effectively swallow up the more lenient \u201csubstantial justification\u201d standard of \u00a7 2412(d), and thereby seriously hamper the proper enforcement and administration of federal law. The VA predicates this contention on the assumption that \u00a7 1983 extends not only to violations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>constitutional rights, but also to violations of rights created by a broad range of federal statutes. <em>See Maine v. Thiboutot, </em>448 U.S. 1, 100 S.Ct. 2502, 65 L.Ed.2d 555 (1980); <em>Miscellaneous Pornographic, </em>541 F.Supp. at 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">We do not share the VA\u2019s fear that \u00a7 2412(d) will be swallowed up by \u00a7 2412(b) under our interpretation. Section 2412(d) was designed primarily to encourage small businesses to contest the unreasonable exercise of federal agency action. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1418 at 9-10; 1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 4988. Accordingly, \u00a7 2412(d) was envisioned as a sort of catchall provision, encompassing a broad range of federal regulatory litigation not already covered by existing fee-shifting statutes. <em>Id. </em>at 18; 1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 4997. (\u201c[\u00a7 2412(d)] is intended to apply only to cases (other than tort cases) where fee awards against the government are not already authorized\u201d). Thus, \u00a7 2412(d)\u2019s provision covers numerous types of suits which would not fall within the rubric of \u00a7 1983 type suits. Moreover, the VA\u2019s claim that \u00a7 2412(d) will be rendered meaningless is fundamentally flawed insofar as it is based on the notion that \u00a7 1983 encompasses a violation of any federal statute. Recently, the Eighth Circuit considered the implication of the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Maine v. Thi-boutot </em>decision and concluded that \u00a7 1983 provides a cause of action for violations of only those statutory rights \u201cakin to fundamental rights protected by the fourteenth amendment.\u201d <em>First National Bank of Omaha v. Marquette National Bank of Minneapolis, </em>636 F.2d 195 (8th Cir.1980) <em>cert. denied </em>450 U.S. 1042, 101 S.Ct. 1761, 68 L.Ed.2d 240 (1981) (holding that a violation of plaintiff\u2019s bank\u2019s rights under the National Banking Act did not give rise to a \u00a7 1983 cause of action). Finally, to the extent that there is a conflict between \u00a7 2412(b) and 2412(d), Congress apparently intended the more specific \u00a7 2412(b) fee shifting provision to supercede the more general \u00a7 2412(d). <em>See </em>House Report at 18; 1980 U.S.Cong. &amp; Ad. News at 4997.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">Having determined that plaintiff, as a prevailing party, can obtain fees under \u00a7 2412(b), we need not pass upon his alternative claim that he was entitled to fees under \u00a7 2412(d) because the government\u2019s \u201cposition\u201d, defined by plaintiff to include the VA\u2019s prelitigation position, was not \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">IV. The Fee Award</p>\n<p id=\"AtZ\">A) <em>Fees incurred before October 1, 1981</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ax9\">The VA argues for this first time on appeal, that if plaintiff is entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees, he cannot recover any fees incurred prior to the effective date of the EAJA, October 1, 1981, even though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s case was indisputably \u201cpending\u201d on that date.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It contends that sovereign immunity was not expressly waived for fees and expenses incurred before October 1, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">While recognizing that waivers of sovereign immunity must be strictly construed (see <em>Monark Boat Co. v. NLRB, </em>708 F.2d 1322 (8th Cir.1983)), we conclude that Congress clearly intended that a prevailing party in a suit against the United States is entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees for services rendered prior to the effective date of the EAJA (October 1, 1981), provided the suit was pending on the effective date. In so holding we are in accord with every other Circuit Court addressing this issue. <em>See United States for Heydt v. Citizens State Bank, </em>668 F.2d 444, 446 (8th Cir.1982); <em>Berman v. Schweiker, </em>713 F.2d 1290, 1299 (7th Cir.1983); <em>Kay Mfg. Co. v. United States, </em>699 F.2d 1376, 1378 (Fed.Cir.1983); <em>Natural Resources Defense Council v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, </em>703 F.2d 700, 712-13 (3rd Cir.1983); <em>Tyler Business Services, Inc. v.

No. 96-481, explicitly states that it is applicable to fees in cases pending on October 1, 1981:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqr\">\u201cSec. 208. This title [i.e., title II, the EAJA] and the amendments made by this title shall apply to any civil action ... described in section 2412 of title 28, United States Code, which is <em>pending </em>on, or commenced on or after such date.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">The meaning of this language is clear: the EAJA applies to fees generated before or after the effective date as long as the action was \u201cpending\u201d on October 1, 1981. Any other construction \u2014 even applying the strict construction doctrine \u2014 would require a tortured reading. <em>See Berman, </em>713 F.2d at 1300. \u201cThe statement that a statute applies to case \u2018pending\u2019 on its effective date means precisely that, and unless Congress indicates otherwise, the statute applies in full to all such cases.\u201d <em>Kay, </em>699 F.2d at 1378. \u201cIf Congress had intended to exclude pre-effective date fees, it could have done so by simply stating in Section 208 that only post-effective date fees for pending actions or actions commenced after October 1, 1981 were covered.\u201d <em>Berman, </em>713 F.2d at 1297.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">Nothing in the EAJA\u2019s legislative history indicates that Congress intended to distinguish between fees incurred before and those incurred after October 1, 1981, in cases that were pending on that date. <em>See Heydt, </em>668 F.2d at 446 (court, interpreting EAJA as authorizing fees for pre-effective date work, stated \u201c[a]n appellate court must apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision unless there is some indication to the contrary in the statute or its legislative history or unless manifest injustice would result.\u201d) In fact, the legislative history buttresses our interpretation. Specifically, the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s (CBO\u2019s) estimates of the cost to the government of the EAJA reveal a congressional recognition that the pre-Act fees would be covered. The CBO cost estimates, which Congress had available when it passed the EAJA, predicted that the annual expenditures could vary <em>only </em>with the number of cases terminated each year, the inflation rate, and the EAJA\u2019s incentive effect H.R.Rep. No. 1418 at 21-23; 1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, 4984, 5000. The CBO projected the EAJA would cost an estimated $92 million in fiscal year 1982,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> $109 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>million in fiscal 1983, and $129 million in fiscal 1984. These yearly increases are nearly constant, rather than askewed as one would expect if those fees incurred prior to October 1, 1981 were being excluded. Indeed, if pre-October 1,1981 fees were being excluded, then one would expect the budget for 1982 to be significantly lower than the budget for 1983 because the number of cases terminating in 1982 (but pending pri- or to October 1, 1981) would have a large portion of their fees excluded. <em>See Nunes-Correia v. Haig, </em>543 F.Supp. 812, 815-16 (D.D.C.1982) (CBO cost estimates \u201cdemonstrate that Congress clearly intended the Act to authorize fees for work performed before October 1, 1981.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Furthermore, interpreting the EAJA to permit recovery of fees incurred prior to the effective date would not defeat the purposes of the EAJA \u2014 i.e., to compensate those seeking to vindicate their rights against unreasonable government action and to prospectively deter unreasonable government action. Indeed, such an interpretation may further these goals. <em>See Berman, </em>713 F.2d 1290.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Thus, our interpretation passes muster even under the strict construction rules set forth in the three cases upon which the YA principally <em>relies </em>\u2014 Monark <em>Boat Co. v. NLRB, </em>708 F.2d 1322 (8th Cir.1983), <em>Brookfield Construction Co. v. United States, </em>661 F.2d 159, 228 Ct.Cl. 551 (1981), and <em>Commissioners of Highways v. United States, </em>684 F.2d, 443, 444-445 (7th Cir.1982). It should be noted that <em>Monark </em>dealt with the interpretation of statutory language that was anything but clear. And, without specifically discussing <em>Brookfield Construction </em>or <em>Commissioner of Highways, </em>we simply add that those two cases presented statutory construction issues inapposite to the statutory construction issue we address here. <em>See Kay, </em>699 F.2d at 1378 (distinguishing <em>Brookfield); Berman, </em>713 F.2d at 1301-03 (distinguishing both <em>Commissioner of Highways </em>and <em>Brookfield Construction.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">B) Reasonableness <em>of the fees award</em></p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">In awarding attorneys\u2019 fees of $15,-630.67<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the district court began its assessment of a reasonable fee by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation by a reasonable hourly rate, which in this case equaled $23,806.00. Bee <em>Hensley v. </em>Eckerhart, -- U.S. at --, 103 S.Ct. at 1939, 76 L.Ed.2d at 50. Recognizing that this did not end the matter, the court then adjusted the fee amount downward by one third to take account of additional factors set forth in <em>Johnson v. Georgia, </em>488 F.2d 714, 717-719 (5th Cir.1974)\u2014 including the \u201cresults obtained factor\u201d. As the Supreme Court recently observed in <em>Hensley, </em>the \u201c[results obtained] factor is particularly crucial where a plaintiff is deemed prevailing even though he succeeded on only some of his claims for relief.\u201d -- U.S. at --, 103 S.Ct. at 1940, 76 L.Ed.2d at 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-14\">We do not believe the district court\u2019s downward adjustment went far enough. The predismantling claim \u2014 the one plaintiff prevailed on \u2014 was certainly related to the pretermination claim insofar as both were essentially procedural due process claims. <em>See Hensley </em>(relatedness of successful and nonsuccessful claims is a factor in determining \u201cresults obtained\u201d). Nevertheless, plaintiff did not \u201cachieve a level of success that makes the hours reasonably expended a satisfactory basis [for the fee award]\u201d. Instead, plaintiff achieved only \u201cpartial success.\u201d <em>Hensley, </em>-- U.S. at -- - --, -- - --, 103 S.Ct. at 1940-41, 1943, 76 L.Ed.2d at 51-2, 54-5; <em>compare Tusa v. Omaha Auto Auction, </em>712 F.2d 1248, 1255 (8th Cir.1983). While plaintiff\u2019s affidavits in support of fees do not reveal the time allocated to the pretermination and predismantling claims, it is clear from the briefs in support of the injunction, that plaintiff treated the pretermination issue, the losing issue, as being of major importance to his overall relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>Moreover, considering the nature of the due process issue involved, we do not believe the 411.3 attorney hours spent on the law suit was reasonable. \u201cIn determining a proper fee award, [a] court should consider the number of hours ordinarily necessary competently to prepare comparable cases.\u201d <em>Bonner v. Coughlin, </em>657 F.2d 931, 934 (7th Cir.1981); <em>citing Brown v. Bathke, </em>588 F.2d 634, 638 (8th Cir.1978). Also, \u201c[f]ee awards based upon an excessive number of hours would encourage overpreparation of often relatively simple cases .. . . \u201d <em>Bonner, </em>657 F.2d at 935. By comparative standards, the case here was neither legally nor factually complex. Although the procedural due process issue raised was a close one, it was not the type of complicated issue typically warranting such extraordinary research and preparation time. <em>See Gagne v. Maher, </em>594 F.2d 336, 345 (2d Cir.1979), <em>aff\u2019d </em>448 U.S. 122, 100 S.Ct. 2570, 65 L.Ed.2d 653 (1980) (trial court properly disallowed half the hours claimed in civil rights case where issues were relatively simple and most attorneys would not have spent so much time on the case); <em>Bonner, </em>657 F.2d 931 (appellate court vacated determination of 253.5 hours of attorney time spent for a two-day \u00a7 1983 trial, concluding that the issues raised were not legally or factually complex); <em>Peeler v.

As recently recognized in <em>Foley Construction Co. v.

In <em>Foley </em>the court considered only the government\u2019s \u201clitigation position\u201d because the parties so framed the issue. In most cases, the distinction between \u201cunderlying action\u201d and \u201clitigation position\u201d makes no difference because \u201cthe litigation position of the United States will almost always be that its underlying action was legally justifiable\u201d. <em>Spencer v. NLRB, </em>712 F.2d at 551-552. In this case, however, the distinction would make a big difference because plaintiff\u2019s \u00a7 2412(d) claim focuses entirely upon the allegedly unjustified agency action in terminating him, which precipitated the lawsuit. Circuit courts squarely addressing the nettlesome issue of whether Congress intended for the government\u2019s \u201cposition\u201d to include the underlying agency action have read the same legislative history and come to different results. <em>See Natural Resources Defense Council Inc., v.

Before a second trial began, the parties entered into a consent decree. Consequently, there was no judicial determination as to whether the defendants\u2019 conduct was required by law. The court, in determining the plaintiff\u2019s right to attorneys\u2019 fees under these circumstances, decided that the defendants\u2019 action was gratuitous if the plaintiff\u2019s suit was \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable or groundless.\u201d <em>Nadeau, </em>581 F.2d at 281.

I would reverse the district court and deny a fee on Dr. Premachandra\u2019s claim with respect to the dismantling of the laboratory.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
