Gathercole for its violation of his rights under \u00a7 4(a) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a), in that Global discharged him because of his age from his employment as an airline pilot on the airline-type passenger flights used by the U.S. Army\u2019s Ballistic Missile Defense System Command for Military Operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1574-15\">It is undisputed that: (1) Global employed Gathercole as an airline pilot stationed on Kwajalein Island, the principal location of the Kwajalein Missile Range. (2) Gathercole\u2019s sole duty was to pilot passenger aircraft on the airline-type passenger flights used by the U.S. Army\u2019s Ballistic Missile Defense System Command for Military Operations. From the time that Global first employed Gathercole for a temporary period, from June 12,1979 to August 5, 1979, (see Exhibit A attached to Answer to Complaint), it has been clear that Gather-cole\u2019s \u201cServices are to be performed as assigned by Employer [Global] in the Marshall Islands in connection with Employer\u2019s performance under Government Contract NO. DASG60-75-C-0001 or such other concurrent or successor contracts as may be executed between Employer and the Government, or at such other place or in such other connection as may be designated by Employer.\u201d And (3) on August 5,1979 Gather-cole had his 60th birthday. Only because on that day Gathercole reached 60 Global removed him from active flight status, and on August 8, 1979 discharged him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1574-16\">Gathercole complains that Global\u2019s discharge action violated his right under \u00a7 4(a) of the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a) which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1574-17\">(a) It shall be unlawful for an employer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1574-18\">(1) ... to discharge any individual .. . because of such individual\u2019s age.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1574-19\">In reply to that complaint Global invokes the following exculpatory provision set forth in \u00a7 4(f) of the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(f):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1574-20\">(f) It shall not be unlawful for an employer. ..\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1574-21\">(1) to take any action otherwise prohibited under subsection [ ] (a) ... of this section where age is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1487\">*1487</page-number>sary to the normal operation of the particular business.. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1575-4\">Global contends that:</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-5\">(1) within the meaning of \u00a7 4(f), \u201cthe particular business\u201d in which Global employed the plaintiff was that of pilot on the airline-type passenger flights used by the U.S. Army\u2019s Ballistic Missile Defense System Command for Military Operations;</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-6\">(2) such employment of the plaintiff was exclusively incident to a contract between Global and the United States Department of the Army specifying that Global shall provide air transportation for the Kwaja-lein Missile Range.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-7\">(3) The contract between Global and the U.S. Army\u2019s Ballistic Missile Defense System Command for Military Operations [Defendant\u2019s Exhibit 7] provided, at p. 4, that Global, as contractor, shall \u201cdo all things necessary for the accomplishment of satisfactory and timely performance of the requirements outlined in [a specific] Scope of Work\u201d document. That document, in turn, explicitly adopted 350 FAA airline safety regulations. One of those adopted regulations of the FAA [see 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 860.102 (1981) ] established a 60-year age limitation for pilots.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-8\">We do not know from the record whether as a fact the FAA held any hearing in connection with the adoption of this 60-year age regulation (though there is, of course, a presumption that the FAA complied with its official obligation to have done so). Nor does the record show whether the regulation was adopted on the basis of evidence, or whether the FAA had before it (in its agency files or elsewhere) supporting evidence. All we have in the district court record is the uncontradicted recital of an army officer in a letter to Global to the effect that the 60-year age regulation was imposed \u201cfor reasons of safety in air transportation at the Kwajalein Missile Range.\u201d [See Defendant\u2019s Exhibit 9, Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 8] [See 560 F.Supp. 644-645]</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-9\">Before Global discharged Gathercole, he on July 5, 1979 had informed Global of his contention that the Age 60 Rule in the Army\u2019s regulation did not satisfy the requirements of the exculpatory provision set forth in \u00a7 4(f) of the ADEA, quoted <em>supra. </em>Global rejected that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-12\">Then Gathercole requested Global to procure from the Army a waiver of the Age 60 Rule in his case. Accordingly, Global applied for a waiver by the Army; but the Army declined to grant it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-13\">As heretofore stated, on August 5, 1979, Gathercole\u2019s 60th birthday, Global removed Gathercole from active flight status and on August 8, 1979 it formally discharged him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-14\">Gathercole\u2019s complaint (resting solely on defendant Global\u2019s alleged unlawfulness in discharging him as a pilot, and not claiming that Gathercole was entitled to any other position) was heard in the Northern District of California by Judge Weigel and a jury. The jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff Gathercole. On March 31, 1983, for reasons set forth in an opinion, <em>Gather-cole </em>v. <em>Global Associates, </em>560 F.Supp. 642 (N.D.Cal.1983), the court denied defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or for a new trial, and entered judgment for plaintiff in accordance with the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-15\">The only one of the several issues raised before us which we need to consider is whether <em>as a matter of law </em>Global\u2019s action discharging Gathercole meets the standard for exculpation established by \u00a7 4(f) of the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-16\">The district court ruled that Global was not immunized by the contract and the FAA regulation indirectly incorporated therein because there was no evidence that [in words which Judge Weigel quoted at 560 F.Supp. 645 from an opinion which in its <em>holding </em>was flatly <em>contra </em>to Judge Weigel\u2019s own opinion, <em>Tuohy v. Ford Motor Co., </em>490 F.Supp. 258, 264 (E.D.Mich.1980) <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>675 F.2d 842 (6th Cir.1982) ] \u201c \u2018an appropriate federal agency has determined <em>after a full hearing </em>that, as to persons over the age of 60, it is not possible to use factors other than age to predict the likelihood of the onset of a sudden condition that could imperil the passengers\u2019 (emphasis added).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1488\">*1488</page-number>There is a certain plausibility in the district court\u2019s view that \u201cAbsent evidence of the Army\u2019s basis for its decision, the fact that the Army seeks to require defendants to engage in discriminatory employment practices in violation of the ADEA does not insulate defendants from liability under that Act.\u201d 560 F.Supp. at 645 (footnote omitted). But we are of the opinion that the district court\u2019s view will not withstand close analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-4\">Section 4(f) of the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(f) provides that a liability which would otherwise exist on account of action taken by an employer due to the age of the complaining employee does not exist if that age factor is \u201ca bona fide occupational qualification [BFOQ] reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the particular business\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-5\">Here the so-called BFOQ was not determined by the Army\u2019s reliance on its own wisdom as to the reliability of pilots over 60 years of age but on the Army\u2019s reliance on the judgment of the FAA as expressed in FAA formal regulations applicable to 60-year-old airplane pilots of various types. It would be anomalous for the Army to question the FAA as to whether the evidence before that agency had been sufficient to enable it to reach a sound conclusion. Surely it could presume that the FAA both procedurally and substantively performed its duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-6\">It is sufficient that the Army, knowing of the expertise of the FAA, and of its obligation as a public agency to perform its official duty, accepted at face value its proclaimed standard of necessary minimum qualification. The Army is not a court of review for the FAA. Nor is it incumbent upon the Army to probe the methods of the FAA. The Army may reasonably assume that the government\u2019s expert agency with respect to flight safety acted appropriately both procedurally and substantively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-8\">Global is in an even better defensive position than the Army. That private company received its contract on the express proviso that it would follow official regulations. For it to have failed to do so would have in all probability caused Global to be justly charged with breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-9\">Moreover, certainly Global was in no position to challenge the applicability and soundness of or evidentiary support for the FAA regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-10\">In short, the judgment against Global was erroneous because the district court failed to afford Global the protection conferred by \u00a7 4(f) of the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-11\">Our conclusion is fortified by our awareness that the district court\u2019s ruling would subject Global to a patently unjust dilemma \u2014 either to break its contractual promise to the government (and thus imperil its own likelihood of retaining the benefit of its present contract and its hope of comparable future contracts) or to fail in its obligation to obey a statutory command of the government.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1576-12\">To cap the matter, we note that at least since 33 FR 9172, June 21, 1968, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 860.102 (1981), the Wage and Hour Division of the United States Department of Labor, in its official regulations interpreting \u00a7 4(f)(1) of the ADEA has contained the following interpretive statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1576-13\">(c) The following are illustrations of possible bona fide occupational qualifications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1576-14\">(d) Federal statutory and regulatory requirements which provide compulsory age limitations for hiring or compulsory retirement, without reference to the individual\u2019s actual physical condition at the terminal age, when such conditions are clearly imposed for the safety and convenience of the public. This exception would apply, for example, to airline pilots within the jurisdiction of the Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1489\">*1489</page-number>Aviation Agency. Federal Aviation Agency regulations do not permit airline pilots to engage in carrier operations, as pilots, after they reach age 60.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1577-5\">It is not disputed that the department of the Army has plenary power to regulate aviation at the Kwajalein Missile Range and that the Global contract with the Army in its \u201cScope of Work\u201d provisions required Global to discharge a pilot who reached 60. Thus the 60-year requirement was \u201cregulatory\u201d within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. 860.102 (1981), just quoted. Furthermore, the 60-year regulatory requirement was \u201cclearly imposed by the FAA and by the Army for the safety and convenience of the public\u201d. <em>Starr v. Federal Aviation Administration, </em>589 F.2d 307, 309 (7th Cir.1978) and eases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1576-7\">. Global\u2019s position is in contrast to that of the employer in <em>Fernandez v. Wynn Oil Co., </em>653 F.2d 1273 (9th Cir.1981) which attempted to justify failure to promote a woman because of the preference of customers in a foreign country to deal with male business representatives. Unlike Wynn Oil Co., Global was subject to statutory and regulatory requirements enacted to promote safety.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
