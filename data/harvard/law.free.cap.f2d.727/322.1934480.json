(Para-mont), appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment, 556 F.Supp. 815, affirming the Commissioner of Internal Revenue\u2019s assessment of a capital gains tax on coal royalties Paramont received for the year 1974. Paramont\u2019s principal contention on appeal is that its status as Subchapter S corporation exempted it from the tax assessment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">Paramont began its coal property leasing business on June 22, 1973, by incorporating under the laws of Virginia. It filed a regular United States corporate income tax return for the taxable year ending December 31, 1973, reflecting earnings from its coal operations for the preceding six months. It, however, changed its filing status for the years 1974 through 1976, electing to file as a small business corporation under Sub-chapter S of the Internal Revenue Code. Normally, a Subchapter S corporation\u2019s income is imputed directly to its shareholders, not the corporation. The corporation pays no tax because the income is \u201cpassed through\u201d and taxed for the first time as the shareholders\u2019 income. There is, however, an exception to this general scheme of treatment for Subchapter S taxpayers detailed in I.R.C. \u00a7 1374 (formerly \u00a7 1378):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvC\">(a) If for a taxable year of an S corporation \u2014 (1) the net capital gain of such corporation exceeds $25,000 and exceeds 50 percent of its taxable income for such year, and (2) the taxable income of such corporation for such year exceeds $25,000, there is hereby imposed a tax (computed under subsection (b), on the income of such corporation....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-12\">(c)(1) ... Subsection (a) shall not apply to an S corporation for any taxable year if the election under section 1362(a) which is in effect with respect to such corporation for such taxable year has been in effect for the 3 immediately preceding taxable years. (2) ... Subsection (a) shall not apply to an S corporation if (A) it (and any predecessor corporation) has been in existence for less than 4 taxable years, and (B) an election under section 1362(a) has been in effect with respect to such corporation for each of its taxable years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-13\">The Commissioner based his assessment against Paramont on this provision after finding that the requisite elements for its application were present. These elements were that Paramont realized a net capital gain of $2,307,638 for the tax year 1974; that it had been in existence for less than four years; and that its election to be a Subchapter S corporation had not been in effect for each of its taxable years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-14\">Paramont\u2019s first contention is that the gains it received in 1974 were not \u201cnet capital gains\u201d as contemplated in \u00a7 1374. It argues that to realize a \u201clong-term net capital gain\u201d there must be a sale or exchange of capital assets as defined in \u00a7 1223(1) of the Internal Revenue Code. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>The basis of its argument is that a \u201ccapital asset\u201d by definition does not include property used in a trade or business. I.R.C. \u00a7 1222. Since coal royalties are classified as property used in a trade or business, I.R.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(2), it contends that its income from leasing coal property is not derived from a capital asset and \u00a7 1374 cannot apply. The fatal weakness in Para-mont\u2019s position is that it ignores the effect of \u00a7\u00a7 631 and 1231 on the operative definition of capital asset as it applies to coal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Income from the sale or exchange of certain natural resources, including coal, is treated specially under I.R.C. \u00a7 631(c). This provision treats royalties received from coal leasing operations (with certain adjustments) as gain generated by a \u201csale\u201d of the coal itself. Under I.R.C. \u00a7 1231, gains from the \u201csale or exchange of property\u201d used in a trade or business, including coal operations, are treated as gains from the sale of a capital asset, although losses from the same transaction are handled as ordinary losses. Reading \u00a7 1374 in conjunction with \u00a7\u00a7 631 and 1231, we conclude that Paramont\u2019s income from leasing of coal properties is a capital gain within the meaning of \u00a7 1374(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">We likewise find no merit in Paramont\u2019s contention that \u00a7 1374 does not apply to corporations, like itself, that choose to operate under Subchapter S on a continuing basis. The keystone of its argument is that Congress only intended for the \u00a7 1374 exemption to apply to those corporations which elected Subchapter S status in a onetime transaction to avoid capital gains treatment for their income in a particular year.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">It is true that this type of one-time corporate transaction was the principal target of \u00a7 1374. The legislative history of \u00a7 1374 makes it plain that Congress was concerned with curtailing the abuse of Subchapter S elections. See S.Rep. 1007, 1966 <em>U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News </em>2141, 2146, 2147. There is no indication, however, that Congress specifically intended the section to have the extremely limited application which Para-mont urges. The language of the section itself defines the corporations which are subject to the exception and is the best indication of what Congress intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Paramont concedes that its net capital gain was more than $25,000, that its gains exceeded fifty percent of its taxable income for the year in question, and that its taxable income exceeded $25,000 for that period. It also concedes that it had been in existence for less than four years and that its election to Subchapter S status has not been in effect for all of the taxable years in which it has been in existence. This, under the express terms of \u00a7 1374, subjected Paramont\u2019s coal property income to a tax assessment, even though it had elected Sub-chapter S status. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-15\">. Paramont did not elect Subchapter S status until six months after the corporation came into existence and acquired the taxable property.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
