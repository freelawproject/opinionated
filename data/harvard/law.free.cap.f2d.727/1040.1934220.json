We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-5\">Dorothy Vaughn is a 59-year old resident of Americus, Georgia, who works part-time as a maid.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In light of a history of mental illness, specifically chronic schizophrenia,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> she was approved for disability benefits under a Georgia state plan in December, 1971. At that time, she was adjudged permanently and totally disabled under the existing criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-6\">In 1974, the Supplemental Security Income Program, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1381-83 (West 1983), became effective on a federal level. That program took the place of state-administered plans by providing benefits directly to \u201cdisabled\u201d citizens. A \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d in the legislation commanded that any person \u201cpermanently and totally disabled\u201d under an authorized state plan would maintain that status in the federal scheme. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(E) (West 1983). Thus, Vaughn continued to receive benefits under the SSI program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-7\">In April 1981, Vaughn received a letter notifying her that the Secretary of Health and Human Services (\u201cSecretary\u201d) was developing current evidence to determine whether her condition prevented her from obtaining \u201csubstantial gainful activity.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Shortly after that letter, her SSI benefits were terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-8\">Vaughn then applied for a period of disability benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 423 (West 1983). An Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) denied her initial application for disability benefits, finding that she was not \u201cdisabled\u201d because her impairment \u201cdoes not prevent the performance of ... past relevant work.\u201d The judge also upheld the termination of SSI benefits because, upon review of current evidence, he determined that her past disability had ceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-14\">After the Secretary\u2019s Appeals Council upheld the ALJ\u2019s decisions, Vaughn sought judicial review in the district court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court affirmed the agency\u2019s rulings, finding substantial evidence to support them in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-15\">On appeal, Vaughn argues that the district court erred in affirming the agency decisions, <em>i.e., </em>both the denial of the disability benefits and the termination of her SSI benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-17\">A. <em>Denial of Disability Benefits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1129-18\">42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 423(d)(1) (West 1983) provides that individuals with disabilities may be entitled to monthly disability insurance benefits. The term \u201cdisability\u201d is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-19\">Inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for continuous periods of not less than 12 months....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1129-20\">42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A) (West 1983).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In filing a claim for benefits, a claimant has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>the burden of proving disability, <em>Crosby v. Schweiker, </em>650 F.2d 777, 778 (5th Cir.1981),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and we will not disturb an agency finding of \u201cno disability\u201d unless the record lacks substantial evidence to support that conclusion, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 405(g) (West 1983); <em>See, e.g., Alien v. Schweiker, </em>642 F.2d 799, 800 (5th Cir.1981), or the conclusion was derived from faulty legal premises. <em>Boyd v. Heckler, </em>704 F.2d 1207, 1209 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-4\">In the hearing before the ALJ, there was oral testimony from Vaughn and her sister, Ms. Ernestine Moore. Vaughn testified about her work and discussed her mental problems. Ms. Moore testified at length about Vaughn\u2019s mental illness, which manifests itself in hallucinations, moodiness, nervousness, and suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-5\">Three affidavits from medical experts were also considered and discussed. Paul Mandeville, a clinical psychologist, diagnosed Vaughn as having \u201cborderline intellectual functioning\u201d and \u201cresidual schizophrenia in good remission.\u201d He determined that she had the understanding to \u201ccope with simple unskilled or familiar work routines,\u201d but did stress that the remission of her schizophrenia was due, in part, to the familiarity of her current daily routine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-6\">Dr. S. Taylor, who has treated Vaughn on an outpatient basis, confirmed that she was schizophrenic. He had placed her on medication to aid remission and found no particular oddities in her behavior, except for occasional hallucinations. Finally, Martha Smith, a nurse who has treated Vaughn, explained that while the patient can perform simple or repetitive tasks, her mental impairment seriously affects her ability to perform complex tasks, to follow instructions, or to have frequent contact with other people.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1130-13\">After reviewing this evidence, the ALJ<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1130-14\">[The] claimant has the residual functional capacity to perform simple, repetitive, unskilled or familiar work routines. Her past relevant work as a maid in private homes was unskilled and is familiar to her. Therefore, Regulation 404.1520 would require that she be found \u201cnot disabled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1130-15\">This conclusion states, in essence, that because Vaughn can perform her past work, she cannot be considered disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-16\">It is undisputed that Vaughn\u2019s current job as a maid is <em>not </em>\u201csubstantial gainful activity.\u201d Her work has always been compensated at a level significantly below the earnings level at which work becomes gainful.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In ruling that she was not disabled, the Administrative Law Judge inconsistently held that her past <em>insubstantial </em>gainful activity demonstrated her ability to perform <em>substantial </em>gainful activity. Because her past work has not been substantial, it was an error of law to conclude that her performance of it disqualifies her from receipt of disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>Having found that the AU incorrectly credited Vaughn\u2019s \u201cpast relevant work\u201d as dispositive of the disability issue, we must remand to the Secretary for further proceedings. On remand, the appropriate question is whether, given Vaughn\u2019s capacity, age, education and work experience, she is able to do substantial work within the national economy. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.-1520(f)(1) (1983). This \u201csubstantial work\u201d must, of necessity, amount to more than she is currently performing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1131-5\">B. <em>Termination of SSI Benefits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1131-6\">The 1971 state determination that Vaughn was disabled was presumed valid when the SSI program was initiated in 1974. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(E) (West 1983). Because of the presumptive validity of that decision, there can be no termination of SSI benefits until there is substantial evidence of actual improvement to the point of no disability. <em>Simpson v. Schweiker, </em>691 F.2d 966, 969 (11th Cir.1982). <em>See also Finnegan v. Matthews, </em>641 F.2d 1340 (9th Cir.1981). This presumption is necessary to avoid re-litigating the evidence presented in support of the initial administrative decision.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1131-7\">In the proceeding below, the ALJ focused only on current evidence of whether Vaughn was disabled. Because <em>Simpson v. Schweiker, </em>691 F.2d 966 (11th Cir.1982), requires evidence of <em>improvement </em>to support a termination of benefits, the ALJ was also required to evaluate the medical evidence upon which Vaughn was originally found to be disabled. Without such a comparison, no adequate finding of <em>improvement </em>could be rendered. We therefore reverse and remand for application of the proper legal standard.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1131-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-11\">The case is reversed and remanded to the district court with instructions that it be returned to the Secretary for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-12\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1129-9\">. Vaughn has worked for one family for 35 years. She currently works three days a week, but has worked up to six days a week during her tenure. As will be explained below, her minimal earnings have not affected her eligibility to receive SSI benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1129-10\">. Schizophrenia is defined as \u201cany of a group of severe emotional disorders characterized by misinterpretation and retreat from reality, delusions, hallucinations, ambivalence, inappropriate effect, and withdrawn, bizarre or regressive behavior.\u201d <em>Dorland\u2019s Illustrated Medical Dictionary </em>(25th ed. 1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1129-11\">. This phrase will be explained with other statutory requirements below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1129-21\">. Jurisdiction to review the Secretary\u2019s decision was premised on 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1383(c)(3) (West 1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1129-22\">. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520 (1983) establishes the general procedure for determining when a disability exists. If a person is working at a \u201csubstantial gainful activity,\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.-1571 <em>et seq. </em>(1983), then there is <em>no </em>disability. If a person does not have such employment, she can either be found presumptively disabled by reason of a specific \u201clisted impairment\u201d deemed disabling by the Secretary, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(d) (1983), or her non-listed impairment will be examined to determine its effect on her current ability to work. If the claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>lacks the capacity to perform \u201cpast relevant work,\u201d then it will be determined whether she can do other \u201csubstantial gainful work.\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 423(d)(2), (4) (West 1983); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(f)(1) (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1130-8\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), this court adopted as binding precedent all of the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981. <em>Id. </em>at 1209.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1130-9\">. A final affidavit, prepared by Vaughn\u2019s employer Ms. Emmie Halstead, was not before the ALJ but did appear in the record prior to the decision of the Secretary\u2019s Appeals Council and was considered in that decision. It stated that Vaughn could perform the tasks which had become routine after 35 years, but that minor variations caused her to become quite nervous. It was Halstead\u2019s opinion that Vaughn could not function in any job with more pressure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1130-18\">. Because the ALJ\u2019s conclusions were adopted by the Secretary\u2019s Appeals Council, they provide the rationale for the agency decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1130-19\">. When Vaughn\u2019s application for disability benefits was filed in 1981, she was earning $27 per week or approximately $120 per month. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1574(b)(3) establishes that, for calendar years after 1979, a person earning less than $190 per month will generally not be considered to have held \u201csubstantial gainful activity.\u201d The ALJ acknowledged that Vaughn \u201cis not currently engaging in substantial gainful activity.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1131-8\">. We note that there is strong evidence in this record that Vaughn may not be able to do more work that she now does. Her own testimony, and that of Ms. Moore and Ms. Halstead, is to this effect. Similarly, Dr. Mandeville\u2019s report indicates that her structured environment helps maintain her remission. On the other hand, there is some inference that Vaughn may be able to work five days a week, rather than three, although there is no evidence that five days of her work would constitute substantial gainful employment. Also Dr. Mandeville\u2019s report states that she is in \u201cpresent good remission\u201d and that she \u201cretains understanding enough to cope with simple unskilled or familiar work routines.\u201d Finally, Dr. Taylor\u2019s report states that Vaughn\u2019s condition has resulted in no marked restriction of her daily activities, although we have some question about the value of Dr. Taylor\u2019s brief report, which contains no clinical or laboratory findings. <em>See Oldham v. Schweiker, </em>660 F.2d 1078, 1084 (5th Cir.1981) (Unit B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1131-22\">. <em>See Shaw v. Schweiker, </em>536 F.Supp. 79, 83 (E.D.Pa.1982) (\u201cAfter a final determination of disability, if a termination of benefits were effected without a showing either of improvement or newly-discovered evidence, such a termination would of necessity be based on whim or caprice or would constitute an impermissible relitigation of facts and determinations already finally decided\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1131-23\">. Of course, if the Secretary concludes on remand that Vaughn is currently disabled, <em>see supra </em>note 10, then she would be entitled to a continuation of her SSI benefits, and there would be no need to apply the <em>Simpson v. Schweiker </em>analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
