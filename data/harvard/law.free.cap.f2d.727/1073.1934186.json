The parties entered into a retail installment sales contract on a form prepared by the defendant-appellee, General Electric Credit Corporation (GECC), which obtained the contract by assignment from Hutchinson shortly after the Grants took possession of the home. The rate of interest on the contract exceeded an add-on rate of 13.6%, 3.6% higher than the maximum finance charge on mobile home contracts allowed under the Georgia Motor Vehicle Sales Finance Act, O.C.G.A. \u00a7\u00a7 10-1-30 to -38 (Michie 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-6\">The Grants filed a complaint in the District Court for the Southern District of Georgia on behalf of themselves and a class of all persons similarly situated, seeking damages and injunctive relief for the alleged violation of Georgia law. In addition to setting forth the state law claim, the complaint attempted to refute an anticipated defense that the high interest rate was valid under \u00a7 501 of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act, Pub.L. No. 96-221, Title V, 94 Stat. 161 (1980) (codified at 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1735\u00cd-7 note) (the \u201cAct\u201d), which preempts state usury laws governing mobile home financing if the lender complies with certain consumer protection regulations. Attached to the complaint was a copy of the financing agreement. After a hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the district court dismissed the action, concluding that the Act governed the contract and that the finance charge was thus protected under federal law. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-7\">The Grants alleged in their complaint and maintain on appeal that GECC did not comply with the conditions imposed by the Act and the implementing regulations, and that the contract is therefore governed by Georgia law. Specifically, they contend that the contract impermissibly allows GECC to immediately declare the entire contract due and payable upon the buyer\u2019s default without giving the debtor thirty days notice and right to cure as provided in the Act and 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 590.4(h) (1983).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1162-10\">This case is controlled by our decision in <em>Quiller v. Barclays American/Credit, Inc., </em>727 F.2d 1067 (1984), where we held that although neither the Act nor the regulations requires the lender to include a thirty-day notice provision in the financing agreement, if the contract contains a term or condition inconsistent with the regulations, the creditor may not obtain the benefits of the federal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-11\">Section 501(c) of the Act authorizes the preemption of state usury limits only if the \u201cterms and conditions\u201d of the loan agreement comply with the consumer protection regulations promulgated by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. The regulation applicable to this contract provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOS\"><em>[N]o action to repossess or foreclose, or to accelerate payment </em>of the entire outstanding balance of the obligation, <em>may be taken </em>against the debtor <em>until SO days after the creditor sends the debtor a notice of </em>default____ In the case of default on payments, the sum stated in the notice may only include payments in default and applicable late or deferral charges____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1162-14\">12 C.F.R. \u00a7 590.4(h) (1983) (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1162-15\">The Grants\u2019 contract provides in part: In the event of Buyer\u2019s default in payment when due, Seller may declare <em>immediately </em>due and payable any and all installments due or to become due hereunder, less the unearned portion of that part of the <em>FINANCE CHARGE </em>designated as Time Price Deferential calculated by the Pro-Rata Method <em>provided that Buyer shall be given notice of right to cure default before Seller is permitted to exercise that </em>right____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1162-17\">This passage is directly contrary to the statute and \u00a7 590.4(h) of the regulations because it grants the creditor the right, upon default, to immediately accelerate payment of any and all installments due or to become due under the contract. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>regulation unequivocally forbids the creditor from immediately demanding all installments due and payable upon default; it can only do so thirty days after the creditor sends the debtor notice of default and right to cure. Moreover, the regulation provides that the sum stated in the notice may only include payments in default plus any applicable late charges. The creditor may not, as this contract allows, declare all installments due and payable as soon as the debtor defaults one payment. A provision allowing all future payments to become due immediately upon default is an inaccurate statement of the creditor\u2019s rights in the federal scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-4\">The qualifying clause here (\u201cprovided that Buyer shall be given notice of right to cure . . . .\u201d) may more accurately inform the debtor of his absolute right to notice than did the qualifying clause in <em>Quiller</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but the clause does not remedy the inaccurate statement of the creditor\u2019s power already conveyed. The passage transmits two conflicting messages: the creditor\u2019s right to declare all installments immediately due and payable and the debtor\u2019s right to cure before the creditor exercises that right. As in the <em>Quitter </em>contract, a debtor reading this provision might receive an accurate impression of his rights if he is aware of the federal statute, but absent this outside knowledge, the debtor can only conclude that the creditor may accelerate immediately upon default, subject to some unspecified right to cure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-7\">Since \u00a7 590.4(h) forbids immediate acceleration, the contract does not comply with the regulation. When a financing agreement includes a term that is inconsistent with one of the Act\u2019s implementing regulations, the applicability of state law to the contract is not preempted. We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint. REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1162-8\">. In an amended complaint filed shortly before the district court rendered its decision and in their appeal to this court, the Grants have alleged additional reasons why their contract does not comply with federal law. Because we decide <em>infra </em>that the Grants are entitled to a reversal of the district court\u2019s dismissal based upon the contract\u2019s failure to accurately state the creditor\u2019s right to accelerate, we need not decide the validity of their other contentions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1163-23\">.
