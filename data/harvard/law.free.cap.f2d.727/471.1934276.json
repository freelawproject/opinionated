Banda\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees, following her successful appeal to the MSPB from a decision of the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d) denying her application for disability retirement. We find that the MSPB lacked authority to consider Banda\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees request; thus we vacate the MSPB\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-27\">Banda, a supply clerk with the Department of Air Force, was injured on the job on April 25, 1978. She subsequently, on October 5, 1979, executed an application for civil service retirement based on disability, which was denied by the OPM. Banda filed an appeal, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8347(d)(1) (1982),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with the MSPB on August 14, 1980. The MSPB reversed the OPM\u2019s decision, finding that the OPM had failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that its rejection of Banda\u2019s disability retirement application was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-28\">After receiving the MSPB\u2019s decision, Banda petitioned the MSPB for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees under 5 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>\u00a7 7701(g)(1) (1982).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The MSPB Presiding Official issued his decision denying Banda\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees on May 25,1981. In his decision, the Presiding Official held that it would not be \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d to award attorneys\u2019 fees to Banda because nothing in the OPM\u2019s decision indicated that the \u201cdecision lacked good faith or was clearly without merit.\u201d Banda took issue with the Presiding Official\u2019s denial of her petition for attorneys\u2019 fees and requested that the MSPB review the Presiding Official\u2019s decision. On August 10,1982, the MSPB issued a decision rejecting Banda\u2019s petition for review. That decision indicated that in <em>Vergagni v. OPM, </em>MSPB No. DC831L8010270ADD (July 19, 1982), the MSPB had held that it was not in the interest of justice to award attorneys\u2019 fees in employee-initiated disability retirement cases and that its decision in <em>Vergagni </em>was dispositive of Banda\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">On appeal to this court, Banda argues that she was entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees, whether or not the decision appealed from was made in bad faith and was clearly without merit, and whether or not the claim was employee-initiated. She argues that the MSPB had substantial discretion in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees and was not prohibited from doing so because the application for disability retirement was employee-initiated. In the alternative, she argues that the MSPB\u2019s denial of attorneys\u2019 fees was arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion, and not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">The OPM argues that the MSPB properly denied Banda\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees, but not for the precise reasons articulated by the MSPB. The OPM argues that the MSPB should not have reached the question of whether payment of attorneys\u2019 fees in civil service retirement appeals is \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d as that term is used in section 7701(g)(1). \u201cIndividuals\u201d who appeal OPM civil service retirement decisions to the MSPB pursuant to section 8347(dXl), the OPM argues, are not entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees under section 7701(g)(1) because Congress has not waived the sovereign immunity of the United States to allow for the payment of such fees in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">The OPM first notes that attorneys\u2019 fees may not be awarded against an agency of the federal government unless specifically authorized by a statutory waiver of sovereign immunity, <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975), and that waivers of sovereign immunity must be \u201cunequivocally expressed.\u201d <em>Lehman v. Nakshian, </em>453 U.S. 156, 160-61, 101 S.Ct. 2698, 2701-02, 69 L.Ed.2d 548 (1981). Pointing out that section 8347 does not contain a provision for the award of attorneys\u2019 fees, the OPM argues that the attorneys\u2019 fees provision of section 7701 cannot be held applicable to section 8347 appeals. The OPM\u2019s position rests principally on four factors: (1) the MSPB does not hear civil service retirement appeals under section 7701; (2) significant differences in the membership of the class of \u201cemployees\u201d who may appeal to the MSPB under section 7701(a) and receive attorneys\u2019 fees under section 7701(g)(1), and the class of \u201cindividuals\u201d who may appeal to the MSPB under section 8347(d)(1); (3) the complete absence of any mention of civil service retirement appeals in the legislative history of the Civil Service Retirement Act (\u201cCSRA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8301 <em>et seq. </em>(1982); and (4) the post-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>CSRA enactment of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8347(d)(2) (1982).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">Alternatively, the OPM argues that, if an award of attorneys\u2019 fees in this case is not barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity, the decision of the MSPB should be affirmed for the reasons articulated in <em>Ver-gagni, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The MSPB argues that sovereign immunity does not bar its consideration of attorneys\u2019 fees under section 7701(g)(1) in an appeal pursuant to section 8347(d)(1). According to the MSPB, section 7701 applies to <em>all </em>employee appeals. The MSPB then argues that its determination that Banda was not entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees in this case was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">We agree with the OPM that Congress has not waived the sovereign immunity of the United States authorizing the MSPB to award attorneys\u2019 fees to individuals who prevail before the MSPB on appeals from civil service retirement decisions made by the OPM. We do so for the reasons set forth in the thorough opinions of the Seventh Circuit in <em>Dawson v. Merit Systems Protection Board, </em>712 F.2d 264 (7th Cir.1983), and the Federal Circuit in <em>Williams v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>718 F.2d 1553 (Fed.Cir.1983). The reasons underlying both <em>Dawson </em>and <em>Williams </em>are clearly set forth in those opinions and we will not reiterate them here. We simply adopt the rationale of <em>Dawson </em>and <em>Williams </em>and write here only to deal with an issue raised before this court by the MSPB which appears not to have been directly addressed in either <em>Dawson </em>or <em>Williams.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">The MSPB argues that, as the agency charged with administering sections 7701 and 8347(d), its construction of those statutes is entitled to substantial deference. <em>United States v. Rutherford, </em>442 U.S. 544, 554, 99 S.Ct. 2470, 2476, 61 L.Ed.2d 68 (1979). Therefore, the MSPB argues, we should defer to its interpretation of section 7701 \u2014 that it allows awards of attorneys\u2019 fees in all employee cases before the MSPB, including those under section 8347(d). While we recognize that such deference is normally mandated, we are also cognizant of the fact that deference is required <em>unless </em>there are \u201ccompelling indications that [the agency interpretation] is <em>wrong.\" Miller v. Youakim, </em>440 U.S. 125, 145 n. 25, 99 S.Ct. 957, 969 n. 25, 59 L.Ed.2d 194 (1979). We think that <em>Dawson </em>and <em>Williams </em>provide such indications that the MSPB\u2019s interpretation is <em>wrong.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">Because we find that the MSPB lacked authority to consider Banda\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees request, the decision of the MSPB with regard to attorneys\u2019 fees is VACATED.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-14\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b559-18\">.
